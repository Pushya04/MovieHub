Good idea...turned to generic garbage.,"This movie really could have been so much more. The idea would have been much better off with someone who actually wanted to make a decent movie, instead of a porno gorefest. The first half of the movie consists almost entirely of sex, talk of sex, drugs, and talk of drugs. Instead of, hey, maybe develop the characters a little so the audience might care about them and make their plights a little more tense, the filmmakers decided to have a lot of party scenes and annoying main characters acting like idiots until, uh oh, we didn't plan on being tortured, oops! The sad thing is, there are hints of something more intelligent beneath the surface, but the surface is piled so high with garbage that it's lost. For example, while at a sex club (wow, original!) one of the characters mentions something along the lines of ""paying to do anything you want to a person,"" of course he means sexually, but we know the basic plot of the movie involves the same concept with death and torture instead of sex. One of the characters is supposed to seem like a nice guy, but still never really develops enough for us to care. The main character has absolutely no depth other than a childhood story and his shallow interaction with his friend. The last half or so of the movie actually starts to gain momentum, and the first half not been an entire waste of film, I could have walked away with more than a feeling that I'd just watched 15 minutes of an okay movie, and an hour and fifteen minutes of porn and senseless gore. Sadly enough, the idea of this movie was put into the wrong hands. A little less than halfway through, my friend turned to me and said, ""Maybe I picked up the wrong movie..."" to which I replied, ""Yeah, I think you got Eurotrip by accident."" I am baffled as to why they decided to write the first half like they did. I guess I was hoping for something deeper. Don't watch this expecting anything special, be ready for lots of nudity and lots of incredibly disturbing gore mixed randomly, the two not even seeming to fit like they would in a slasher flick.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Physiological Scares,"Recently I picked up Hostel at my local movie store and decided to give it a try. I finished watching it and had very mixed feelings. First off, this film is not nearly as gory and disgusting as advertised. It is although, very graphic, and NOT for the squeamish, I just expected more out of it. The pop-up scares aren't effective and the first half of the movie is all soft-core porn. So what makes this movie a decent horror movie? The physiological scares. That is what got to me. The overwhelming feeling of being tied and up and tortured to death. Having no escape. For that was very effective and stomach curdling. The sex and nudity was all not needed, but for people looking for that kind of stuff, it's all here. The acting was pretty good. No bad performances. Hostel is a kind of movie where you'll either love it or hate it. But overall, an OK horror film. Not my favorite, but not terrible.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Deeply unpleasant on one level; thrilling on another  it works for what it sets out to do but is a very basic and cynical affair that will put many off,"Hostel was one of those films described as ""torture porn"" and, with my low tolerance for gore, I decided to give it a miss at the cinemas and dismiss it if anyone brought it up. However as it came on TV a month or so ago I decided that maybe I was being unfair by not giving it a try. It did sit on my HDD for a month though as somehow I never was in the mood until I forced myself to watch it. It does what you expect it to do and there should be no surprise that it is very gory throughout. What surprised me was how gripped I was by it as I squirmed in my seat and had the emotional ""flight"" response while sitting there. In that sense the film works because for all but the most hardened viewer it will have you feeling ill and get your heart beating. However while it did achieve this, it did it by simply going direct for being as sadistic and graphic as it possibly could.In a way there is a ""build-up"" to the main gory bits but this is less of a decision so much as a necessary evil of having any sort of story. The first thirty minute or so are essentially the guys getting honey-trapped into this Eastern-European world of heartless torture and then from there we have gore for varying reasons (and here the makers give us nudity to prevent the male target audience getting bored). You never really care about the characters or the story because the tension is not about ""what is happening next"" as it is about the act you are watching. It is a cynical horror movie in this way as it has a very simple atmosphere and a very simple target or gore. While you are watching it the sheer cruel horror of it might stop you thinking but ultimately it is a soulless affair that reminds me of the viral ""2 girls 1 cup"" video. You see both are the type of thing you want to watch but also don't want to see, both also are entirely about seeing horrible things from the remote safety of your home and of course both generally get a ""hands over eyes, open-mouth but yet unable to look away"" response from viewers. This is all Hostel is going for and this is why I have real reservations recommending it because as a ""film"" it is pretty poor.Those that love gore will love it though because in this area it excels. The effects are horrifically realistic and are delivered in clear, cruel shots. The actors do a great job of convincing in their pain, horror and fear and this is part of the gore voyeur aspect of the film. As characters though they are poor and can do nothing with the script other than be young and geeky/sexy/beefy/stoned* (delete as appropriate). Hoffman's portrayal of power is the only exception because, while a bit whacked out, he perfectly captures the sheer indifference to live that real evil has. Roth's direction doesn't show much in the way of subtlety but he knows what his audience want and how to give it to them. The lack of anything beyond this in his delivery or script can be easily seen in the way that the film doesn't even try to do something with the fact that we are getting entertainment from watching people torture/kill others for their entertainment. Normally in this sort of thing there would at least be some reference to this conflict but here Roth is part of his audience and sees nothing wrong at all with what he is doing  which is a problem for me, not that he needs to be ""ashamed"" but just that a film should not just be a load of filmed gore with no heart or reason to care.Hostel is a gory horror movie that is entirely about being repulsed and thrilled by the graphic and sadistic acts portrayed with excellent special effects. Those looking for this will be pleased with it but the majority will be turned off. For some it will simply be too gory to watch and they will get no pleasure from witnessing hell on earth  I totally understand where they are coming from. However the majority of viewers will not be those that struggle with gore but just object to the cynical way that it is put on the screen without any real attempt at using it as part of the film or story  no, here the gore is the all and there is nothing else to watch it for. This factor alone makes me stronger in my decision to ignore this genre for what it is because being good at what you do doesn't mean that it is right for you to do it in the first place.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Somewhat stylish, but very trite and predictable!","The plot, in short: Three backpackers, two Americans and one Icelander, does Europe by train with two major goals: To get high and nail as many women as possible... In Amsterdam they accidentally learn of a hostel in Bratislava, Slovakia where sex-mad women thirst for men in general, and American men i particular. They of course decide to go there and at first it seems the rumors were true. But they soon learn that the hostel is nothing more than a front for a bizarre club, where people can pay a huge fee to get to perform unspeakable acts...My 2 cents: The director and writer Eli Roths biggest accomplishment before Hostel is Cabin Fever (2002) - weather or not that is something good is a matter of personal judgment. That he got two Evil Dead'ers (Scott Spiegel and FX-genius Gregory Nicotero) interested in his script is not at all surprising. But how he got Quentin Tarantino to executive produce (and thereby act as ""posterboy"" for his flick) is, to me, a total and utter mystery.Hostel has potential, I'm not going to take that away from it. The thought that a place exists where rich people pay money to torture and kill other people is interesting. And a story about a kidnapped person who finds himself locked in that very place, waiting for his assassin, should make for a great film! The film is wonderfully lit, specifically in the torture chamber-scenes. And the set-dressing in those scenes are marvelous. It really feels like Roth found these places - and just shot them as the were. But the lighting, set-dressing and potentially-rich story, unfortunately, ends the positive things I have to say about Hostel.It is frustrating to see a story that could have been so exciting and horrific get so utterly fumbled up! The movie is an hour and a half long, and takes a whopping 50 minutes to get to the place that is supposed to be the scene of terror and creepiness. The nearly hour-long ""intro"" is spent observing the backpackers while they party, get high and watch naked ladies in Amsterdams Red Light-district. When the story finally starts to focus on whatever is wrong with the Slovakian hostel it points everything out to such an extensive degree that it feels like Roth wants to put a stupid-hat on every member in the audience. I sat, in vain, and waited for him to take the lid off, go ""ta-daa!"" and show me something intelligent that I had missed. But it never happens and when the lid, towards the end, slowly slides off on its own accord it turns out that the ones you suspected were bad guys were in fact...bad guys. The ones you suspected were dead...were dead. And the entire movie ends the way you suspected it would all along.Jay Hernandez (Paxton) and Derek Richardson (Josh) doesn't do to shabby in the two leads. But Roth has stayed true to Hollywood formula and chosen picturesque before personality, and the bigger part has unfortunately been given to Hernandez - instead of Richardson who I thought were more likable, and more interesting to watch.Spanish director Koldo Serra made El tren de la bruja in 2003. A short-film about a man who agrees to partake in an experiment and suddenly finds himself strapped to a chair in a dark room. He hears metal objects being handled and someone pacing back and forth in the room. When the light is turned on it dawns on him that he will probably be tortured to death. Serras short-film is fifteen minutes long. It was filmed in two days and is scary as hell! Hostel is both longer and has, as it first seems, more story to build on. But it still wants to base the horror in exactly the same sort of scenes as Serras short - and fails miserably! Hostel is, probably, made specifically for an American teen-audience, where drugs and naked women represent half of the movies pull. Blood and bodyparts make up the other half. If you watch this and expect anything more sophisticated than some blood and naked breasts you'll be disappointed.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Missing important points,"It would seem from the majority of the comments on this film that very few of the people making these comments have any real insight into film production or what some film makers are attempting to communicate to an audience. With that in mind, here are some things I discovered upon viewing this film: (1) The story is new and unique. Thank goodness for any film that is not a sequel, a remake, or a film based on some decades-old television program. (2) The director uses the Xenophobia most Americans have about Europe and the citizens of those countries to very good effect. He plays on those fears, throws fuel onto that fire, much like Tobe Hooper did with rural areas in the U.S. in ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". (3) I was impressed by the build-up of uneasiness leading up to the torture scenes, the prevading sense of something ""off bubble"". If the characters had not been tenth-degree horndog party animals intent only on having a good time, they might have been more suspicious of the strange events taking place around them, which - in my mind - justifies the scenes of debauchery to show how oblivious these guys were. (4) A great number of things often have to be done in a film to appease The Studio. I saw several scenes that appeared to be included seemingly at the behest of The Studio for ""saleability"", and were not necessarily included for story-telling. There is also a desire to ""one-up"" each other in the Studio System, which publicly decries sex and violence while unofficially tells Producers to ""give us more, and make it even more shocking than (fill in the blank)"". All-in-all, while this film is not for the squeamish, it does have some things to say that create discussion and dialogue about a number of things, from how we view foreign cultures to how we treat each other. Any film that can generate that kind of thought while providing innovation deserves applause.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Upgrades Horror Movies...,"This movie is a clear step above most horror movies. It helps raise the bar for all horror movies by simply having a nice mix of movie elements that work well together.Basically, the movie is about three American college guys who venture out of Amsterdam and into a region of Slovakia looking for more extreme female interaction. Once they arrive, they begin to suspect that everything may not be as good as it seems when one by one they start disappearing.Although this seems like a typical horror plot, the movie is well-done and believable. The European scenery, interesting characters, decent dialog and fast-moving pace of the movie completely separate it from the typical ""waste of time"" horror movies.I also give the director high marks for not making this a gore-fest and overfocusing on nothing but blood and guts. The result is that he has created a real movie - and a good one.This is a pretty decent horror flick. If you're in the mood for this kind of movie and don't want a mindless slasher-fest, this will do nicely.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Moral Choices and the Dark Side of Humanity,"I just got back from an L.A. screening of Hostel. I haven't seen an effective horror film like this in a long time. My stomach was still knotted up after we left the screening. The last time I felt like that was when I saw ALIENS for the first time about 19 years ago. Since then, no other horror film has ever made me feel like that. I certainly didn't expect it from this one. As much as I loved Cabin Fever, I'm not blind to the shortcomings of its script. As such,I was expecting more of the same from Hostel - dark humor, gore, and a sense of dread. I'm happy to see that director Eli Roth has taken a big step forward in becoming a better storyteller and filmmaker.Admittedly my heart sank when the film began. The scenes introducing the main characters were blandly shot and edited. All I could think was, 'Oh no. Roth succumbed to some unseen studio pressure to make a normal-looking horror flick'. The style was typical of the what you'd see in crap like I know what you did last summer. But in very subtle ways, the blandness gets washed away and as our heroes enter the threshold of Hell, the style of the film changes as well. This, I learned during the Q&A afterwards with Roth, was intentional.If you've read some of the other reviews posted here from people who saw it at the Toronto Film Festival, you get the general idea of the story. Contrary to what you might've heard, this is not a 90 minute film on torture. The torture scenes are brief and to the point. Roth doesn't wallow in pointless gore. And this is where I think it shows how he's improved as a filmmaker. He's more interested in scenes and ideas that move the story forward. Yes, there is plenty of gore, but it's relevant to the story and doesn't exist just for it's own sake.One of the aspects of this film that made it so powerful was how Roth created a sense of helpless and inevitability. He provides the dark setup, throws in a sympathetic character, and begins twisting the screws and ratcheting up the suspense. This isn't a movie where you turn off your brain to enjoy it. On the contrary. The more you think about it, the more horrifying it becomes. You begin putting yourself into the character's situation and wondering what you'd do. When you realize that there is no hope for the character, no way to escape, no 'buddy' who's gonna turn up at the last minute to save the hero, and not a shred of humanity or compassion to the antagonists, real fear begins to set in.Another great element in the script is how the 'survivor' makes moral choices that define their character. Instead of being merely reactive like the characters in Cabin Fever, the survivor makes several decisions which change the course of the story. It's a sign of well thought-out script and a filmmaker who cares about the fate of his characters.For horror fans, this is an absolute must-see. It's so refreshing to see a horror movie that actually makes you feel uncomfortable and one in which you have no idea what's going to happen next. As for the gore, I was surprised by what they got away with. Although there were no credits at the end of the film, the cut I saw was rated R by the MPAA and according to Roth, he didn't cut anything out.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
At least there was a coherent plot,"Not to give too much away in case you haven't seen the film, I did feel a little sick at one point. However, there was a beginning, a middle and an ending and, there is a small chance that this could really happen to you. Based on actual happenings during the World Wars, (where does anybody get their ideas from), I thought that this was quite a good horror film.At one point, I had to laugh, (my youngest son has been accepted by two universities to study Medicine - he wants to become a Surgeon), and so I found this film quite entertaining. Quite frankly, I wouldn't mind watching this film again at a later date.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Honey Trap...,"HOSTEL is best seen knowing nothing about it. Director Eli Roth has made a tricky movie here, with a lot of seemingly harmless buildup leading to a crescendo of visceral terror and anguish. The three western tourists are likable, young males out for a bit of fun. They are oblivious to the trap into which they've fallen. Hell has to literally open up around them before they take notice.Part horror / cautionary tale, part sadistic blast of jet-black humor, and part social / political commentary, Roth builds the story slowly, revealing the truth in one big, shocking switch. The motivation behind the ordeal is what places this movie a step above typical, so-called ""torture porn"". It's ingenious really, in a sort of cynical, demonic way. Not for the squeamish or the easily offended...",,Anonymous,Horror
Creepy as hell,"I just watched this movie, after sitting here alone in the dark for the past hour or so i can honestly say that i had to take my eyes of the screen a few times. Some of the scenes are directly painful to watch, you will feel it hurt in every part of your body.but this is not like a meaningless horror movie, this movie has something else. Maybe it's in the dialogs and the story or maybe in the acting and the setting. I don't know really, maybe it's all of them.The actors do a great job, the music score is really horror, the story is a little weak, but it keeps it going, and the director is really a genius. I just love the way he plays with camera angles. And the cast in the movie, really says it all. What do a butcher look like ?. See the movie and you will agree. ""That is what a butcher looks like"". This is also the truth in the other roles.I loved the film, it is extremely horrifying but still very very entertaining. They brought horror to a new level with this one. And once again Quentin Tarrantino have involved himself in yet a genius flick.I give it 7 out of 10. The story was a little weak.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
watch with open mind...,"Just watched Hostel for the second time and thoroughly enjoyed it again though it meanders towards the end and doesn't deliver the catharsis that the degree of vengeance could. I think this is intentional though as we aren't supposed to identify with the characters in a good way, but recognise that their ignorance and chauvinism could be our own. The feeling achieved at the end is liberating in a different sense as in we are still free to heed the main message of the film, and tuck that money back in our wallet before we spend it on an immoral enterprise, such as sleeping with prostitutes who were forced into it, despite the carefree dogma of the age. Barbara Nedeljakova and Prague both look great as well. I liked the nod to the Wickerman, and the more sinister reference of the big ovens (the other thing i got was the feeling of getting more than you bargain for when you delve into a country's history and dig up some nasty stuff. This is particularly true when travelling.)One final important point is that I think although many viewers will be able to identify to a degree with the blokes in this film, they aren't supposed to be entirely sympathetic characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Good horror, non-existent story","I like a rip-roaring horror movie as much as the next guy, but this one just didn't do it for me. It certainly felt like it hit all the necessary marks, from nudity and dismemberment to bloody revenge, but at the conclusion, it just felt like eating cotton candy - no real nutritional value, just a sense that I had satisfied some of my prurient appetite without any logical payoff.The movie was slow in getting started and then the sprinted to a singularly boggling ending. I walked out of the theater asking, ""What was the point of all that?"" And while this is described as horror, it really should be classified as thriller. There was no explanation or clever twist at the end. Just the end. I'm sure that it will attract an enthusiastic audience of young adults, but the evisceration by the critics will stem any hopes of huge box office.If your expectations are low enough, and your tastes in gore sufficiently robust, then you are in for a good time. Otherwise, skip this and see a classic Hitchcock film. You'll feel better about yourself.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

The very nature of slasher films: Paying for watching someone get killed (or tortured).,"Eli Roth is a genius, and Hostel is a twisted, sick, depraved masterpiece.I was one of the few that had high expectations when I went to see Cabin Fever in theaters. Boy, was I disappointed. I still thought back then that Eli Roth was a promising guy even if his first film wasn't that accomplished.Let's say that for that matter, my expectations were kind of ""neutral"" when I went to see ""Hostel"", but I was anxious to see it anyway. During the first 10 or 15 minutes I was thinking ""hey! I guess Roth sold himself after all"". More wrong couldn't I be.What I found was one of the sickest, darkest and above all, most intense films I've seen in my life. I found out that Roth didn't want MTVish flashy editing cuts, and after seeing this film a total number of 7 times (5 times at theaters, and 2 times at my home theater, and still going up) I see that is true, and works perfectly for the story. Roth wanted the film to have a classic (and classy for that matter) feeling to it and he succeed in every single aspect of it. The editing is just invisible and discreet, the photography is stunningly gorgeous, and the music score is one of the finest and most memorable I've listened to in a long time; there is no need for filling up the soundtrack with your one-hit-wonder of choice.Kudos to Roth for making one of the best screenplays in recent years. The dialogues feel so natural and real, with every situation grounded in some logic. His directing skills are brilliant too. There is no a single frame or scene that is a waste. Every single shot, every single frame is as beautiful as it can be. And in a horror film that makes the whole thing more disturbing.What I found more remarkable about this film, it is the amount of intelligent ideas that float around like subtexts, consciously OR unconsciously. One of the most clever ideas is why we like to see horror films: because we like to see people being tortured, chopped, or beaten to death and that is true. As the Dutch Businessman would say, that is part of human nature. We, horror films fans, PAY for watching someone going through gruesome suffering and we don't pay once, we do it twice, thrice, or more, just to feel that adrenaline rush the American Client talks of.-Some Spoilers-It is amazing how we come to ""rationalize"" the deaths to suit our beliefs, attitudes and fears. We feel bad for Josh, Kana, Oli, and Yuki, but the audience was clapping and cheering when Natalya, Svetlana, and Alex get rolled over by two cars, when the chasers get beaten to death by the Bubble Gum Gang, and when Pax finally gets his revenge at the Dutch Businessman, in the gentlemen restroom.-End of Some Spoilers-I guess it is just part of human nature. Revenge is in our genes. See the trashy state of the world for that matter.***1/2 And #02 of my Top Ten of 2006 (just behind Love Me If You Dare).Note: Though I'm certain that Roth and Hernandez won't get any Oscars nods (even if they deserved them for their marvelous work behind (Best Director) and in front of camera (Best Actor in a Leading Role), there are other things that need to be taken ""For Your Consideration"". Editing, by George Folsey, Jr., the beautiful score composed by Nathan Barr, and the gorgeous cinematography by Milan Chadime are such a fine work that deserved some nominations. But they won't get them. Roth's attitude towards American film unions (that could be resume in a big Screw You!) won't let them get the recognition they truly deserve.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Disgusting! But fun!,"Hostel is half suspense thriller and half gorefest. Most people won't like the level of violence and blood and such, but for those who are fond of splatterfests, it'll be like a Renoir you'd love to have in your collection of fine, gross art.Three youths backpacking through Europe find themselves in a Slovakian youth hostel. It's all they've ever wanted - even better than Amsterdam! The girls are gorgeous and (most importantly) willing, especially concerning young Americans. Even better, the boys have to room with two local lovelies who like to walk around naked and party hardy with their new friends.But strange things are afoot. Ole (Eythor Gudjonsson) goes missing; the front desk says he's checked out, and his pals Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson) receive a phone message from him saying he's gone home. And a Japanese guest at the hostel says her friend's missing, too. What's up with that? The first half of the movie is titillating, with plenty of go-thither scenes of fantastic debauchery, wickedly enticing the average male viewer with promises of drinking, toking, and hardcore fornication. I mean, how dare they? Here I am, trying to write a serious review of a nasty horror movie, and they have to muck it up by showing me plenty of gratuitous nudity! Not that there's nothing for the rest of the audience. Okay, there's not much. The first half is aimed squarely at the heterosexual hedonist male. But then we get to the second half, and we get to see what happens when Josh passes out in his room and wakes up in the torture chamber.This is the moment you'd start covering your eyes, shooing small children from the room, warning people with heart conditions, and so on. Of course, they probably didn't watch the nakedness, anyway, and in fact aren't even in the room, choosing instead to lambaste you from the other side of a thick door. I mean, how dare you bring such filth into their home? Why don't you bring it into your own home, you pervert? For the most part, the blood looks awfully real, but the editing is so well - pardon the pun - executed that you hardly have time to see how authentic it all appears. The point is, it feels darn authentic. Everything, from the actions of the psychopaths to the reactions of the victims feels pretty sincere.Scary, creepy, and disgusting, Hostel is of the same - ahem - cut as Saw: a polished, well-shot (heh), squishy-sick horror film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"No masterpiece, but certainly not that bad either.","Alright, let me get right down to it: Hostel is not as bad as most people here want to make you believe it is. I think - no, I am certain that people who give this a one star rating simply went to see it expecting too much. Two points that I saw mentioned a lot:This is not the goriest movie ever. Period. If it's been marketed as such, that might be morally dubious, but hey - if you're old enough to legally watch this movie in any country and still take marketing talk as a fact, you might want to consider switching your medications. The gore is there, it looks professional, it's neither over-the-top nor squeamishly hidden.Yes, the characters are not out of something Shakespeare, Hemingway or King might have written. They lack depth. I give you that. But the plot is clearly about three guys travelling Europe to get the most sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll out of it as possible. That's all they want, that's all they're ever shown to do, that's the story, for Christ's sake. That's what you do when you're young. If I had been there, I'd probably acted even dumber. They get stoned, they get high on ecstasy - do you expect them to explain the Big Bang in between? They did what kids do when they set out to party - they party. Yeah, people having fun aren't as likable as people suffering a childhood trauma and telling the audience every detail about it. I didn't sit on the edge of my seat blinking away tears either. But in the context of the story, they're believable enough.Talking about trauma: Yeah, that little tidbit about our main character's past failings was cheaply incorporated. No excuses for this.Otherwise, though, I think people tend to use the word ""unrealistic"" way too often. It's not like our main character suddenly finds a buried space ship in the end, keys conveniently dangling from the dashboard and a manual nearby...My final verdict on this movie is as simple and humble as it gets: A decent, well-directed, nicely-written horror flick. Way better than most of the flicks cluttering the horror genre, not a masterpiece either (sorry, Eli..). The acting neither stands out as bad, nor as terrificly good - with the exception of Rick Hoffmann as the American Customer, that was one creepy performance. A lot of ""been there, done that"" moments, but no major plot holes either. If you think this is a bad horror flick, watch Friday Thirteenth - Jason goes to Hell and think again. Oh, and if you really think that this is inferior to Cabin Fever, I dunno, just stay away from me. Please. (Don't get me wrong, it's not like I didn't like that one. But it has, like, a hundred more flaws than Hostel, obviously. Still entertaining, though.)An entertaining 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A cheap show of nudity, blood, and bland, cliché humor","Hostel is one of the reasons why horror is becoming a genre of shock value and losing it's creative side. Eli Roth creates a cheap show of nudity, blood, and bland, cliché humor. He definitely purchased the book of typical story lines and merged them all together. How many times have we seen the story of three 20-something-year-olds and the crazy things they do? One should know better if they saw Roth's horrible slop of a film,""Cabin Fever.""The major problem with this film was the false advertisement. The ads and previews showed this movie to be a promising horror-thriller with depth and originality. They even flashed ""Quentin Tarantino!!"" four or five times to ensure the viewer that this was quality. It wasn't. It did not even come close. The producers and distributors of the movie knew that with a good preview and a good name, people would flock to the theaters. This film is the reason why the box office continues to slump. Cheap and cheesy. You are looking for steak and Eli Roth throws down a raw hamburger.Sure, the movie has gore. And sex. But with what was given, even those could not keep me remotely interested. Honestly, it isn't very hard to find an waitress/actress who will take her clothes off in a movie and a few prosthetic limbs. The movie had potential but flaws in the writing take it places where ""White Noise"" and ""House of Wax"" went. Hey, at least Paris Hilton did a better acting job.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Eli Roth redeems himself with the kick-ass Hostel,"I was one of those people that hated everything about Cabin Fever. I wasn't anticipating Eli Roth's next film, but when I heard the Internet buzz around Hostel, and found it was showing at the 2005 TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival), I decided to check it out.Eli Roth, who was at the screening, mentioned to the audience that this was the first public viewing in North America. He also told us what we were about to see was a work in progress print of the film. What I saw was one hell of a fierce horror flick that works on every level.All the actors do a great job in this flick. I was especially impressed with Jay Hernandez, and Derek Richardson, two relatively unknown actors. There are a lot of funny scenes, and dialog in the early parts of the film. It's not that slapstick, forced stuff that was so prevalent in Cabin Fever. There also lots of nudity in the early parts in the film as well. When things begin to turn towards horror, you truly feel the sense of terror the characters are going through. The build up to the climax is just done so well. I loved the fact the story is very believable.Make no mistake about it, this is a violent, sick, and gory flick. It's not for the squeamish. I haven't seen this type of extreme violence in a North America mainstream cinema. The Takashi Miike, and Asian Cinema influences are clearly seen here.This is a film that will shock people, and remain in there heads well after the film is over. It will be interesting to see how the film is edited, and rated. In it's current state, I don't see how it could get anything less than the dreaded NC-17 rating. I just hope that it's not butchered too much, as the audience deserves to see the film how it was intended. Eli Roth has completely redeemed himself for what I thought was a very poor film in Cabin Fever, and has made one kick-ass horror film.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Quite fun,"At first, I thought: Oh no, not another ""teen comedy"". I know you've seen them, how they all start out in Amsterdam with cannabis, etc.I was frightened, the start of the movie was completely different from the last 1/3 of the movie.I think the first 2/3 is not exceptionally good, the plot was not very good and I for one could guess what was about to happened. However, when the movie got going, there where yucky effects.I don't recommend you to eat while watching the last 1/3 of the film.The movie is quite fun, but it's ""dumb entertainment"".

A Torture Gore Cornucopia,Eli Roth delivers a gore fest that you'll not soon forget. This is where things go after SAW and the results will either repel you or repel/ fascinate.

Wrong Wrong why all the hate?,"Why? why? why? What is it that makes the movie so bad, no plot perhaps, well unfortunately it does have a plot and actually a pretty realistic one. Yes I know your probably thinking what the f#$% but sad but true. Example I have been to Europe myself 4 times including Amsterdam and when I came back and told some people where I went the most frequently asked questions were, did you smoke pot and did you go to the red light district? So to me that part about the guys just wanting to go over to Europe to f$%# girls and smoke pot seems pretty realistic to me. Yes I will agree the gore was a little much but besides that it was pretty solid with the exception of the main character's acting but Oli's was Awesome. This movie does not supersede saw in any way but for an entertaining movie it's almost perfect.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Slovak man,"Hi. I am from Slovakia. Sorry for my English. First I want to say that in the film there is not anything from the Slovakia. It was filmed in Czech. Bratislava is small but nice with many things to see. O.K. There are some dirty corners, but which town hasn't? My opinion is, this is very bad film. But not because it considers Slovakia as the forgotten place but I think it is bad movie at all. The plot is about nothing. I had feeling, that first half of movie is only the beginning. And nota bene I wasn't afraid a second. I hope American tourists will not be afraid of the visit our country. Here isn't war or some cannibals or something. Here lives very generous people. I like Tarantino's film, but I think this is the worst. At least Narnia was better. So don't judge Slovakia by this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
pretty good little horror ditty,"I enjoyed the movie more than most commentators it appears, and not just cause it was bloody and had lots of boobies. The first 20 mins are just full of titties titties titties and yes, there are plenty of homophobic remarks that make us (or at least me) not so supportive our alleged heroes. but after the titties, the real fun begins. --SPOILER -- The torture scenes are graphic, but not as bad as I thought they'd be - they aren't relentless and overdone, but have just the right piquant tastes of grotesque and terror. The scene with the kid pleading for his life in German was very effective - thought maybe i should pick up some German for situations like these. as for the other commentators complaining that the characters were jerks - that's actually part of what makes this movie so good - Usually it's the nice, earnest, innocent hero/heroine goes through hell but always makes it out alive - being rewarded by fate or god or whatever for being good. but here the nice(st) fellow of the three bites it, in a bad way, leaving us to think we've got no one to root for. left with the jackass, we're forced us shift our alligence to a less likable hero - that is unless you're rooting for the torturers. Nice twist really. --SPOILER -- What really did it for me and probably why i give this movie such a high rating are the revenge scenes. In most movies, our beleaguered hero/heroine escapes, we have the one last scare and the hero/heroine kills the bad thing and then we all go home. But we all kinda feel hollow, like the bad thing's death just wasn't enough to make up for all the crap our hero/heroine had to go through. Here, in Hostel- the last 10 mins outta nowhere change from horror into a revenge film and it's quite satisfying, like a big ole bacon cheeseburger. Everyone that brought our characters to their lowly states gets it and gets it good. I wish I had a pack of wild orphaned gypsy children to do my bidding for bubble gum.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Roth uses the right influences plus his unique raw style.,"""Hostel"" is one of the new generation movies that tend to bring back to life the exploitation sub-genre, of course, in light, R-rated versions.I know that comparisons are not always necessary but I have to say that Roth is HEAVILY inspired by Tobe Hooper's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Don't get me wrong, I give my respect to Roth for being brave enough by creating ""Cabin Fever"" and ""Hostel"". It takes guts to produce these kind of movies in a world that consumes PG-13 Horror flicks. Roth seems to don't give a sh** about making money, but he wants the respect of fans of the genre.Anyways, I compare it to TCM (1974 of course) mainly because it has the same basic plot elements: torture, sadistic people, symphaty for the main characters, extreme violence, and a creepy setting.The plot is as simple as it gets: Two American boys along with a drunken fun guy from Iceland plan their ""spring break"" style trip to Europe, not Cancun or Ibiza. A series of events lead them to a hostel in Slovakia where they meet a cruel fate after partying with no limits. One by one these guys are getting slaughtered and butchered by savage town people as a part of an ""art exposition"" or something like that. It's not like they had bad luck, because these people kill any foreign tourists.Why? and who is behind these atrocious activities? What's behind the purpose of killing? Could it be something with economical purpose? You need to witness the interesting motives.""Hostel"" isn't by any means a shocking Horror flick for those who have seen exploitation flicks from the 70's or heavily violent Slashers from the 80's. The movie succeeds in delivering extreme violence, glorious blood (thanks to the f/x team!!), and raw violence. We got smashed heads (those children really had a bad behavior, where were their parents?), severed bodies, butchered body parts, and the good old chainsaw violence. What else could you ask for?* The highlights of the movie, in my opinion * 1. When Paxton witnesses brutality towards people. The events he looked at really looked like scenes taken away from a snuff film. 2. The now infamous ""eye cut"" scene. Poor Kana. The scene is memorable and will soon become a favorite among fans of the genre.The movie goes directly to the point after you get used and feel symphaty with the characters. After the mix of sex, HOT women, alcohol, sex, and more sex, we are driven through a torture ride without asking for our permission. Now violence, blood, gore, more violence, and violence substitute sex and chicks. I liked the abrupt change! Roth knows how to create tension and make the audience feel disturbed by the movie's events. This guy is going to get far in the genre. He takes the right influences (TCM mainly).Jay Hernàndez delivers a believable strong performance. The man knows how to demonstrate pain and desperation. Oli was my favorite character. It seems that the actor is really a party animal. Nice casting overall. Likable villains also.Overall, ""Hostel"" is a decent Horror flick which doesn't relies 100% it's gore and violence on it. The movie does have a plot (minimal if you say) and good production values. I really prefer this new wave of film making than PG-13 or R-rated re-makes.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
What the Hell Are These People Thinking,"There is absolutely no end in sight for the amount of ridicule this film can bring upon itself. The fact that this film was actually given the green light to go into production says a lot about Lions Gate Films and everybody involved in it. Apparently, nobody saw ""Cabin Fever"" before they let deuchebag Eli Roth spend millions of dollars on this pathetic, unremarkable trip into nothingness. First of all, the script was insanely bad. I read the user review titled ""Excellent puke"" and wanted to thrust my face into a toilet. How stupid can you possibly be? How much bad taste can one have? There are truly NO twists in this movie. The only plot lines that can be related to each other, really, is the story that wonderful, should-be-nominated-for-best-actor Jay Hernandez recounts to his friend that, later on, more light will be shed on (no more information since it may spoil the film for some risking their hour's pay to go see it.) The acting is horrendous. THe script is terrible. The story is non-existent. The direction is horrible. Enjoy",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
State of the art in intense horror,"As a rule, I find horror films a little tiresome, but Hostel starts with a great premise and slowly builds up to some outrageous horror. The film tips its hat to some of the classics, and there's even a delightful cameo of Pulp Fiction playing in the background. It's not good that the premise of the movie is revealed in the IMDb listing as you don't learn the truth until near the end of the movie and it all starts to make a lot more sense. One thing about horror films which has always bugged me is that the bad guys never seem real to me, as if they are some kind of limitless satanic evil or whatever. In Hostel, by contrast, we really believe that the scenario is very plausible and for that, all the more frightening. I wouldn't be surprised at all if this kind of thing goes on in certain parts of the world. As far as maximum creep value, I saw it in a packed house at a screening in Beverly Hills last night, and many in the audience couldn't take it and ran out -- one guy was retching in the bathroom and was too scared to leave! The organizer had to talk him down and call one of his friends to take him home. The director was there for a Q&A which will be on the Creative Screen writing Magazine podcast, and he said that at one test screening they had to call a ambulances for two different people. It appears that the explicit sex, torture and violence will not be toned down for the theatrical release and it will still have an R rating instead of NC-17 which most of us thought it deserved. The trick, is that there is no sex during the violent scenes, and no violence in the sex scenes, which makes the MPAA more comfortable. By the way, this was shot near Prague, and is amazingly beautiful to look at -- I was there a month ago and the place is like something out of a fairy tale (unlike most historic European areas, there isn't a McDonalds every hundred feet). The ending is very, very satisfying yet believable and unforced. The audience was screaming, gasping, cheering, and hiding their faces at all the right moments. Eli's interview was a hoot, also, so check out the podcast once they post it on itunes. It's worth it for no other reason than to hear his anti-Union rant!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amazing - a US horror that's actually good!,"Hostel is that rare thing these days - an American horror movie that actually delivers. Whereas most current Hollywood ""horrors"" are anaemic affairs that sacrifice scares for laughs and tend to have their characters sneer instead of scream, Hostel goes for the jugular with some genuinely harrowing moments (you'll never see toenail clippings in the same way again). Eli Roth seems to have taken a tip from the 1970s, the golden age of horror, by placing his protagonists in unfamiliar surroundings, stripping them of all comforts and subjecting them to such horrendous ordeals that, to paraphrase Tobe Hooper, the audience really doesn't know 'who will survive and what will be left of them.'Beginning innocuously enough with two fresh-faced American backpackers doing hash and whores in Holland, Roth slowly cranks up the tension by having the hapless teens encounter a guy who tells them that if they're looking for hot chicks then they just have to visit a hostel in a remote town in Slovakia. Mocking the young Americans' ignorance by casually referring to a non-existent war, and making out that the women of Eastern Europe are still living life as though they were in a Soviet state of the 1980s, pretty soon this silver-tongued creep has convinced the teens and their Icelandic buddy to take a chance. One unsettling train journey later, and the boys believe that all their wishes have come at once, as beautiful, buxom, naturist girlies frolic for them at the legendary hostel.Of course, this is just the flypaper. Pretty quickly, the Icelander is missing, and it gradually becomes apparent that the hostel is the front for something sinister.Crossing over into exploitation by featuring acres of female skin and full frontal scenes, Hostel fondly recalls the political incorrectness of so many 1970s British horror movies, combining this with the gutsy gore of 1980s American shockers. However, Roth ensures that this is more than just a tribute with some neat directorial touches and motifs, contrasting the light S&M fetishes in the Dutch brothels with the truly awful fate of the Slovak hostelers. He also keeps things interesting with a twist two thirds of the way through the movie.Hostel's not a perfect film - the script lacks the anger or isolation that defines the greatest genre films. The greatest horror directors (Walker, Kubrick, Romero) seem to retain an ambivalence towards the material that Roth lacks - it feels like he enjoys this to much to be repelled by it. But this is worth more than a hundred Screams or Final Destinations because it does not try to humourise the horror, or make light of the characters' ordeals: no-one can come out of this smiling. Superior to Cabin Fever, most certainly, and pretty much on a par with recent hits such as Wolf Creek and The Descent, Hostel is the best US horror I've seen for some time. See it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

New Tortures,"Gosh. We are left today with only three horrors. The extravagant slasher movie, the wet Japanese ghost haunting, or the conspiratorial torture movie.This last seems to have very few degrees of freedom. The setup of the conspiracy can be deep, folded and reflexive, like ""Saw."" The tortures can be increasing gruesome, horrible and explicit  well, that essential. And the manner of the film-making can be excellent, meaning that the cinematic expression increases the rush and horror.This last is what is advertised here. To judge from the box office success, it does actually push the state of the camera. I didn't see it. There was obvious attention to presenting one and a half torture scenes. A lot of expert attention went into this and I even image that they were shot early as a means to attract funding. The rest is merely adequate on all accounts.The formula demands that the victims ""ask for it"" by at least making bad choices and ideally participating in one end of the machine for pleasure or profit, that machine turning around and biting. Here, it is sex. We are led to believe these guys are seeking deviant sex; it is mentioned enough and why they travel to this ""dark"" place. We never see any of course, because the formal for some reason allows exposed breasts to represent all matters of sex.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,Horror
Film of jealousy and hate,"This, unlike your typical ""slasher"" is truly disturbing. I found this so, not because of violence but for the representation of hatred towards the fellow man.This hatred is directed to westerners, specifically American's. It leaves you asking do foreign cultures really think this way? How many people dream about torturing people from wealthier, ""happier"" cultures like that of the U.S.A, U.K, Australia, Japan etc.?The setting is perfect: Slokakia, known to many as a gloomy, poor nation in Eastern Europe. The victims are perfect: ""Happy-go-lucky"", promiscuous teenagers on vacation. The perfect juxtaposition exists between villains and victims. The poor, angry and jealous Eastern Europeans against these, more prosperous American's. It's one cultures revenge against another, through jealousy.In the end who are the real victims, who are the real villains?An ideal infusion of strong imagery, violence, suffering and revenge make this an entertaining film for most horror movie fans.In the end this is an above average modern portrayal of the dark side of the human psyche and humanity in general.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
'Global Terror' at its finest.,"This film is about human commodification and Darwinian economics. The Americans depicted want more than a painting or a statue from their trip to Europe -- they want stories of subjugating natives. But their fraternal lust is outstripped by the international business community (all First World players) who want to experience murder first-hand. Sex is just foreplay for what turns into an erotically charged bloodbath. This film functions at so many levels -- first as an aggressive, homo-social ""buddy picture"", then as a first-rate slasher, and finally as a great indictment of unbridled capitalism. I can't believe this film got tepid reviews from anyone (at least have the courage to hate it outright). Strongly recommended.A number of comments seem to concern themselves with the notion that is in some way an attack on European values. National Socialism was about the banality of evil -- everyday people doing what they thought was expected of them. Here we have both Americans and Europeans performing social stereotypes that have been culturally determined for centuries: hunting and fu*king and buying immunity. If you can't handle that, or find it ugly, then maybe you don't want to watch ""horror"" movies. The horror in this film is all human, emanating from within -- there's no supercosmos or grand inquisitor. It's about people who have forgotten that they are human (hyper-alienated), and at least Roth has the good grace to take this on in a loving and spirited manner. I say again, this film is way more subversive (and technically beautiful) than it's being given credit for.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Solid horror movie,"First off, I'm not a fan of horror movies in general: the acting is usually bad, the plots are too contrived, and the violence (when present) doesn't add very much. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by this film. The acting was believable and authentic, and the story, although still a bit far fetched, was compelling enough to not have one saying ""Oh come on"" every five minutes. The notorious violence that the movie was supposed to showcase in all its graphic glory was actually restrained in my opinion, and not nearly as bad as the commercials make it seem. Still, this movie is definitely not for the faint hearted; some of the scenes will leave you cringing and maybe even looking away for a few moments. But overall, it is not as gory as one might be led to believe. If you can stand some intense but brief scenes, you will walk away quite satisfied, and certainly not wanting to visit Eastern European hostels any time soon!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Quentin Tarantino's name on a film usually means it's somewhat good, but I can honestly say that I will never trust him again. The film has quite a bit of nudity for pretty much no reason.

However, after watching the North American preview at the Toronto Film Festival, I was pleasantly surprised. I went to the midnight showing and when the movie was finished I've got to say, I was a little anxious going home.The movie dispenses with much of the clever, self-congratulatory repartee made so popular in horror films since Scream and its imitators. It opts instead for the old fashioned horror staples of nudity, terror, blood and tension. It was original, well filmed and well acted by a stable of Eastern European unknowns.

A horror film post 1990 thats actually GOOD!!!!,"Hostel (2005) is a breathe of fresh air for the horror film genre, all we tend to get nowadays is remake after remake, or just general C-grade rubbish with Z-grade actors, so this film surprised and entertained me thats for sure! 80% of horror films that come out these days just don't entertain or thrill me and i lose interest with them before even making it to the end, but this was a great film from an upcoming horror director in Eli Roth.The story is about 3 young men, 2 Americans and 1 European, who are on their travels around Europe searching for the sexiest and horniest women for lots of fun and hot sex!!!! They get told about this Hostel in Slovakia where the girls are gorgeous and dirty, so obviously they make their way out there to see what it's all about, and sure enough at the hostel there are loads of gorgeous young women with great bodies who are up for fun!!!! Everything seems to be going well until strange things start happening, the Americans European friend suddenly goes missing without a trace............. and it appears that the local's aren't as nice and friendly as they initially seem!!! As the 2 American guys try to work out whats going on, they later discover a run down old building where there is a sick business going on, and torture and killing is on the menu.Can the Americans survive this Slovakian evil or will they just become another victim!!! I thought Hostel was a very entertaining horror film, the actors all did a good job, the girls were lovely and there was lots of nudity which is always a good thing, and of course the gore....... yep there was quite abit of blood and gore too.Along with The Hills have eyes remake, i thought this was the best horror film in recent years and i highly recommend it. 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"much like ""Cabin Fever"" in that it's a bit over-hyped","Wow, a lot of people seem to either really dig this film or hate it with a passion. I, as a true horror fan, can relate quite a tad more with the latter. I could easily see and emphasize with the major problems that horror aficionados have with this film. It IS unoriginal and rips off so many better films. It IS an exercise of (mtv) style over substance. And it is pretty unrealistic and hokey. However that being said, I still can't bring myself to out and out loathe this picture as it does have bits and pieces to redeem it somewhat, even if said pieces were smaller than the great Takashi Miike's two lines in the film. And trust me if you were among the people that recognized his cameo at first sight than you KNOW this movie wasn't nearly as graphic or 'disturbing' as way too many people seem to tout it as being. Also, as an aside, the children were a major downfall of the film as much as to be laughable. But I did enjoy the movie somewhat if only because of the enjoyment of the people I watched it with, one of which brought the movie over so I didn't have to pay a dime to see it.

"Better than expected, truly frightening","Grade: B-Not as gory as you might expect, but more psychologically disturbing than anything in recent memory. The first thirty or so minutes play more like a porno than a horror movie (though I suppose the two could often be confused for lack of quality) as three college kids pursue sex and drugs in, where else, but Amsterdam. The very idea behind Hostel is terrifying enough to keep the viewers attention. Once the torture begins, director Eli Roth doesn't stop. To say he creates tension is inaccurate. This isn't Hitchcock. Still, Roth focuses more on the anticipation of pain than in the pain itself. Often he shies away from showing us the torture: we don't see the drill going into the flesh, we don't see the ankles being slashed, but we know what's happening and that is even more terrifying. Hostel is still a horror movie with bad dialogue and useless characters, which is why giving it a ""B-"" is a little generous. It gets the grade because I left the theater thinking about the images and the situation: people being Kidnapped on vacation to be torture subjects for those who can pay for it.

Otherwise it is left up to the perverse minds of Hollywood to put the audience through as much pornography 2006 will allow (a surprising amount) and as much gory torture we can take (after many CSI episodes, that is also quite a bit). I don't get what is so great about strapping a hapless victim into a seat and slowly watching them get mutilated. This passes as a ""story,"" a ""plot,"" a reason to watch a ""film."" It's as though we appreciate this because it is perverse. How many more low budget horrors do we have to endure until we come across another bona fide gem like The Exorcist or Carrie, or even Rosemary's Baby. Spend time being creative, using truth mixed with mythology to capture our imaginations and make us question the very essence of fear, belief and terror and why we have that in our consciousness in the first place. Don't just put flesh on display as something to consume and destroy, that's just plain cheap, like the price tag for your ""film.""",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Destined For Culthood,"""Sick, twisted, disgusting and absolutely brilliant"" reads the review blurb on the back of the HOSTEL DVD. While it may sound sensational, particularly for horror flick with a budget under $5 million, every word rings true.HOSTEL begins by introducing us to three pals, Paxton, Josh and Oli (Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson and Eythor Gudjonsson respectively), on a backpacking journey through Europe of sex, drugs and partying. Horny as can be, they take a newfound friend's advice to check out a Slovakian city that promises to fulfill all their desires for intimate, no-strings attached relations. But once they get settled in, Oli inexplicably disappears, soon followed by Josh. That leaves Paxton to unravel the brutal truth behind this mystery.HOSTEL is impossible to sufficiently describe to someone who hasn't seen it. It's not because it's so good (though it is pretty good), but because it's such a creative, unusual film experience. Indeed nothing quite like this has ever been done before, at least not this superbly. The film is heavy on the blood and guts, but the blood and guts are entertaining and actually contribute to the film in a this-will-gross-you-out sort of way. HOSTEL is many things, but it's not guilty of gore for the sake of gore.The direction and acting represent another high point of HOSTEL. The picture is oozing with fresh talent from most every orifice (a fitting way to put it). Young director Eli Roth keeps things running at an efficient pace and gets the most out of what is a fairly basic storyline. It's fair to say he is unrelenting and seems intent in asking the audience how much they can take, but this approach works amazingly well in the film's favor. As for the performers, they are all no-names, but they rank as one of the most talented no-name horror casts in memory. Hernandez is worth singling out, as he has the believability, subtlety and charm needed to carry the film.Unfortunately, many have dismissed HOSTEL as another mindless gorefest. That's really too bad, because beneath the decapitated heads and leaking eye sockets lurks a truly original, entertaining piece of work. This one is destined for culthood.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a pile of rubbish!,"I've seen this movie and expected - after Cabin Fever - at least SOME excitement. However, unless you are in the middle of puberty and a fan of male friendship connected with stupid dialogues and the wish to be fooled by unreal scenarios with naked beauties around you, you'll be terribly, terribly disappointed. What a waste of time! Three young Americans are on a trip through Europe and follow some stranger's advice to go to Slowakia, because in some obscure hostel ""they love Americans"" - which means: you'll get laid by awesome girls. Rubbish, bloody rubbish. Then people start disappearing (GOOD and CLEVER idea to take unknown pills that unknown and of course stunningly beautiful chicks pop into your mouth...), and it all turns into some even more unrealistic plot whereby tourists pay money to torture/kill other tourists (those who disappear, what a surprise). Have I already mentioned the ridiculous dialogues? Jeezus, I wasted nearly 2 hours of my life with this rubbish movie. However, you've been warned now! But if you still consider watching it, I'll be a good person and spoil it by telling the end: Only one of them survives (the least likable one!); the Asian girl jumps in front of a train after seeing her reflection with one eye missing, and one of the Bad Men (""I always wanted to be a surgeon"") gets the proper punishment - the best and probably only OK scene in this whole fiasco that dares to call itself ""movie"".

Don't waste your time,"I'm sorry this is probably the worst movie you could ever imagine unless you're the type who loves to just see torture, if you're looking for a horror flick I suggest you see house of wax or something more in the genre.Lets start off with the plot, hmm well first off the first half of the women is all about sex, drugs, and clubs, which as a teen I can relate to. The second half of the movie is basically like watching something totally different and doesn't share any of the same qualities of the first half. The second half is almost disturbing while the first half is definitely enjoyable.The reason I bothered watching this movie is because Quentin Tarantino had the courage to put his name on it hoping to promote it, I just have one thing to say to that.. SHAME ON YOU QT YOU ARE RUINING YOUR GOOD NAME!!! This movie lacks motive, plot, has horrible acting (as you can see almost every member of the class had never acted before) the sound was absolutely horrible it was like watching a typical 90s horror film except they replaced the jump at-ya scary parts with horrible images which aren't even worth adding.All in All I'd suggest sticking with the saw series if you're into this kind of movie.

Hostel Skirts Hype And Manages  New Horror,"This is a film for horror fans, if you don't really, really like horror films(gore included), I mean really, than don't see it. The first half of the film before the characters arrive at their destination is all frat boyish American fantasy European road trip film, which is later mirrored and satirized in the events of horror that actually take place. Though the film is full of extreme gore and violence(and a pretty cool ode to ""Suicide Club""), there was a lot more subtlety to the story than I expected, though I cant imagine too many people really looking at it for anything other than the violence. It was a lot better than I expected, but not ""the scariest film ever"" that it is claimed to be. I'm also sick of Quentin Tarintino sticking his name on everything, its just a trick to confuse people who aren't paying attention, and as always giving him way more credit than he deserves(see Hero). There are also subtle themes about globalization and exploitation here, a critical view of the American and westerner in general who feel they can ""buy"" anything, which also asks us as ""horror"" fans what ""price"" we are willing to pay to see our violent collective fantasies laid out.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pure Trash,"As the summary states, this movie is pure trash. I cannot possibly fathom why Tarantino would want to associate himself with this. This movie is a cross between soft-core porn and a horrible 70's horror movie. Its like Eurotrip gone bad. This has to be the worst movie I've seen since Frailty. I love cheesy/tribute slasher/horror films when done correctly, but this movie was painful to watch. It tauts itself as gory w/ torture throughout the film, but that was mild at best. Most scenes were cut a fraction of a second before the acts were actually committed. The gore, itself, when shown looked extremely fake in several cases. And let's just say from a logical standpoint without giving away any spoilers, some people should've gone into shock during certain points of the movie. If you believe this movie is realistic and terribly gory, then you need to go watch The Audition. Fast forward to the end and I guarantee the strongest of stomachs will at least feel a little squeamish. This movie was awful, and the money is better spent on alcohol, a cheap hooker, or the homeless. I highly recommend NOT seeing this movie. It will make you want to kill people.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Surprisingly well made and effective, one of the best new horror movies in YEARS","I'm not going to comment on the plausibility of elements of Hostel's plot, which doesn't really interest me. What's important here is that Eli Roth has made a horror movie that represents a significant step up in style and horror storytelling from the merely okay Cabin Fever, a horror movie that even harks back to the days when quality horror movies were made by auteurs such as John Carpenter and David Cronenberg, intelligent up-and-coming filmmakers with talent, style and vision to burn.In these days when the horror genre consists of pretty much nothing but lame sequels and even lamer remakes that rarely even achieve basic watchability, it's almost a relief to see a movie like Hostel again. Not because of its unrestrained violence, but first and foremost because it looks and plays throughout like a real movie, with actual characters, interesting and varied settings, genuine atmosphere, steadily mounting tension and an increasingly sinister and threatening sense of mystery. Compare this movie to the hyped-up video game commercials, goofy ""concept"" garbage like those awful ""Saw"" movies and soulless spazzy remakes that the studios have been vomiting forth to capture the ""horror market"" in the past few years, and Hostel almost looks like a Hitchcockian masterpiece in comparison. Of course, in reality, and by any earlier standard of competent film-making, it's not quite THAT good. But it's good enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Expected much worse,"Going into this film I had it in my head that this would just be a pointless film showing gore for gore's sake. But if actually had a pretty intriguing concept which caught me off guard.
Sure it's not some in-depth thinker of a film, nor is it a thriller or anything. But it's a simple gore movie with likeable characters.What stops it being better than a 6/10 is that I believe that the director was almost conflicted, especially in the first half of the film, with it being some almost Eurotrip style comedy and mixing it with extreme gore and torture. With the ""stupid"" character and the American Pie obsession with women's breasts and sex. It's quite confusing as someone watching, because you aren't sure if this is a comedy or not.Overall it's a lot better than I expected and worth watching if you enjoy gore.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A nice effort by Roth,"2002 was a big year for director Eli Roth, as the huge success of his modest debut film, the low-budget horror ""Cabin Fever"", quickly gave him the attention of a young audience eager of horror films aimed to their generation. While not exactly an original or exceptional film, Roth's ""Cabin Fever"" became a huge hit among the audience because it offered an edgier, raw approach that proved to be very attractive to die hard horror fans, but at the same time was friendly enough to gather the mainstream audiences not entirely familiar with the genre. It was this success that attracted producer Quentin Tarantino to help Roth to make the follow-up to his initial success. The 2005 release of ""Hostel"" was the result of that joint venture and the movie that showed that Roth is finally growing up as a horror director.""Hostel"" is the story of Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson), two backpackers traveling across Europe during their last summer before going to college, in a wild trip of drugs and sex. In their quest, their are joined by Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson), an Icelander traveler who is also looking for good experiences. During one night on Amsterdam, the three travelers meet Alex (Lubomir Bukovy), a young man who tells them about a hostel located in Slovakia where they will find not only the best looking women of all Europe, but also the ones that are easier to get into bed. Excited about this information, Paxton, Josh and Oli travel to Slovakia to discover the paradise Alex was talking about. But they will also discover a dark side of the business that Alex conveniently forgot to tell them.Written by Roth himself, ""Hostel"" is at its core, a very basic tale of punishment as the young protagonists go from lustful consumers to products of consumption by their own choice; however, it's commendable the effort Roth has put to the development of the characters to give some flesh and make the simple story a bit more engaging. The lack of sympathetic or well-built characters was one of the most criticized aspects of ""Cabin Fever"", but in ""Hostel"", Roth creates a trio of characters that while at first are like Xerox copies from his ""Cabin Fever"" boys, later they evolve into real persons with realistic motivations and surprisingly heart, proving that the director/writer has learned something from his past mistakes.It's important to point out that its hype as an extremely violent movie is deceiving, as it really doesn't offer anything new or groundbreaking to old and experienced horror fans familiar with lesser known gems of the exploitation genre. That said, ""Hostel"" is a visually impressive movie (thanks to its bigger budget) that showcases a stylish yet very realistic way of violence rarely seen in the current mainstream horror. As a director, Eli Roth follows a straight forward approach to his story that in many ways is the obvious evolution of his work in ""Cabin Fever"", as even when this new film is definitely more brutal and remorseless than his previous work; it also offers a slightly friendly face that makes it attractive to bigger audiences outside the traditional horror fan base.The cast of the film does a commendable job, but never goes beyond the expected. Jay Hernandez is probably the best of the main cast, giving a believable turn as the naive American who gets in the middle of something bigger than himself. While he is good in his role, his character loses all credibility by the last third of the movie due to the sadly unrealistic way Roth ends the film. Derek Richardson is pretty good too, as the less enthusiastic and introverted Josh. Eythor Gudjonsson as Oli exudes his natural charm in a role that is probably an exaggeration of his real life persona. Jan Vlasák gives a terrific performance in what's probably the best acting of the film. The rest of the cast is pretty much OK, without any real surprises.As written above, it is Roth who is the main responsible for the fatal flaw of the film: it's conclusion. ""Hostel"" is divided basically in three acts, and sadly it's in the final part where Roth decides to conclude his story in a way so fantastic that betrays the realist approach he had used in the film so far. Without spoiling the finale, I'll just say that the unfortunate decision makes the film look like a complete different movie and totally unbalances what otherwise could had been a new classic. ""Hostel"" has been criticized by the naive and ignorant view it has on Slovakia and other European countries in their portrayal as poor countries where life is cheap. While Roth has defended himself by saying his film is done that way on purpose, personally I think that the ambiguity the film has on this aspect (it's very realistic at times, while over-the-top fantastical at others) doesn't really help Roth to make his point clear.Wheter it is a socially aware film or not, the fact is that with ""Hostel"" director Eli Roth gained another financial success and proved that he was more than a lucky one hit wonder. While not a movie without flaws (and it has some serious problems), ""Hostel"" is a big improvement over ""Cabin Fever"", and hopefully Roth will make a masterpiece if someone else writes instead of him. 7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent puke,"One of the best horror films I've ever seen, the clever script is the backbone, and Eythor Gudjonsson is a wonderful representative of Iceland.

I'm still feeling a little sick after seeing the film, and am unable to go to sleep, both because I'm afraid I'll get one of those nightmares and the adrenalin level is too high! There are many very good twists and turns in this film and it is never foreseeable. Many solutions in the script are brilliant, to say the least. Eli Roth is doing a perfect job. I can't even remember when I saw a decent horror film. This film is like a long awaited rain (of blood) in the desert. To set the story in the murky eastern Europe is a good move, because who knows what's going on out there? For all I know there might be such a thing going on right now. I mean, Count Dracula was alive and kicking once, or still is, in his native Romania. Where there is smoke, there must be a fire.I would recommend this film to anyone... except my grandmother.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Sick torture in its purist form,"Hostel is very much like two movies in one--the college male fantasy Euro-trip followed by a psychotic deluge of raw torture. The story line is rather ""simplistic"" (not in a bad way) void of any intricate plot twists, tension buildups and surprise endings. Not much thinking is needed to follow this movie. It is obvious that the Director, Eli Roth, is very influenced by filmmaker Takashi Miike's work because, Miike has a cameo in Hostel and this movie follows the same time line format as one of Miike's films, Audition. As with Audition, Hostel is rather tame for the first 3/4 of the movie and then the gore-fest mercilessly comes at you full force for the last 30 minutes. It seems others try to compare Hostel with the two Saw movies. I totally disagree. Where Saw and Saw II are more of a psychological mind thriller that keep you guessing, Hostel is just raw torture that makes you...disgusted. The real horror of Hostel is that the main reason for the torture is based on ""actual events"". To think that something like this takes place in the real world is very scary and sick. The one actor I enjoyed seeing in this film, if only for a few minutes, was Rick Hoffman. He seems to perfect the character who we all would love to beat the hell out of. In the movie, Cellular, he personified the prick lawyer type; he brings that same character's traits to this role in a refreshing, twisted way. If anything, Hostel definitely pushes the envelope on how far a film can go to show you mindless torturous gore. I can't put it any ""simpler"" than that.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Is Eli Roth a jackass, or is it just his characters?","Eli Roth is either a satirist with an amazing poker face, or 12 years old. The man responsible for the execrable ""Cabin Fever"" is back now with ""Hostel,"" another Dead Teenager movie. While the thought of anyone enjoying any aspect of the stinky ""Cabin Fever"" made one weep for the species, ""Hostel"" is a notch or two above that moist pile of rankness. Yet it's still an ugly, ugly movie.First off, what is it with Roth and the ""gay"" epithets? He populated his first film with smarmy rich kids who called each other ""gay"" with every other breath, as if 1987 (indeed a fine year) had never ended. Now here's ""Hostel,"" with its dopey frat types backpacking through Europe, dropping the casual g-bomb like it's gone out of style. A memo to Roth: IT HAS. As in ""Cabin Fever,"" Roth has presented us with such loathsome characters that we're almost glad to see them get what he has in store for them. ""Hostel""'s young jerkoffs seem like the types to take such a clichéd coming of age trip just to prove their masculinity to their brothers back home. I'm beginning to form a picture of Roth as a once-persecuted bookworm made good, who now can get back at all his childhood bullies and their ""gay"" taunts in multiplexes nationwide. I really hope I'm onto something, as the alternative implies that Roth is simply as retarded as his characters.But anyway, there's a movie here. Our two young homophobes are Finding Themselves on a tour of the whorehouses of Europe, along with a giddy Icelandic drifter who would likely be played by Peter Stormare in an older, and much better, film. A guy in their hostel in Amsterdam quickly pegs them for the dumb f**ks they are and tells them about a joint in Bratislava; ""girls you won't believe,"" ""will do anything,"" ""love Americans,"" etc. Of course they're on the next train, and find themselves in the titular hostel, which is conveniently populated exclusively with young, nubile women of the type normally found online. The DKE brothers are beside themselves, doing everything short of shouting ""boobies!"" outright (and I can't even be sure that doesn't happen at some point). Drinks are laced, and the Greeks find themselves in one of those dank, wet movie basements in which the only thing not covered in grime is the glistening row of saws, drills, scalpels, and other instruments that are generally preceded with a stern call of ""nurse"" Turns out one can still play the Most Dangerous Game in Slovakia, except the rules have evolved so that the prey is now handcuffed to a chair. I can't wish these gory punishments doled out by the unfeeling rich on anyone, but Roth really seems to dislike his characters, and wants us to as well. If that's the case, he has a lot of bottled up anger to deal with. If not, he's simply a sadist. Either way, ""Hostel"" is cloaked in a weighty unpleasantness that makes it hard to enjoy its few nice touches.Roth occasionally flirts with statement-making in ""Hostel."" In his pay-to-torture men's club, taking one's aggression out on an internationally-despised American will cost considerably more than hacking up, say, a Russian or European. The idea of the socially numb elite dropping mad coin to slice people up just to feel something echoes, well, all of ""Fight Club."" Roth has some pretty usable material here, but is more interested in icky shock thrills than social commentary. By the end, our lucky survivor has gotten revenge on a character he couldn't possibly have known was involved, and we wonder exactly what is the point of ""Hostel."" It can be summed up in two of the film's favorite terms (after ""gay""): ""jugs!"" and ""ahhhgh!""",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
one of the best social commentaries of our time,"Let me first qualify that subject line - in order to understand the social commentary one needs to be capable and mature enough in their critical thinking skills to see outside of their horizons of expectation. If one goes into this film expecting a Friday the 13th/ Jason/ Freddy experience he or she will be disappointed. If they are expecting a Kafka-esquire cinematographic wonder they will be disappointed. However, this film stands above the ordinary movie droll for the following reasons:1. It doesn't rely on clichés (no fumbling for keys, no long discussions with the villain, no idiotic explorations of dark basements or rooms without lights, no endlessly resurrected slashers).2. It is believable (crass Americans in Europe, testosterone driven youths, and the commodification of human life).3. The torture scenes are not shot gratuitously. Other threads have noted that the film ""didn't show much"" and this is precisely why that makes this film great. It leaves the terror up to the audiences imagination. The director focuses his lens on the faces and the reactions of the victim. We experience fear vicariously. Films of this ""genre"" usually spoon feed violence to viewers and are consequently forced to escalate and intensify the methods of death in order to evoke a reaction. Hostel succeeds because it does not rely purely on blood, guts, and gore.Too many threads on this message board post the opinions of this spoon fed generation. Watch this film. Ask yourself what the Director doesn't show. Ask yourself how the Director defies your expectations.

Sure, I winced during some of the more grisly scenes, but the primal horror I felt during TCM was nowhere in sight. The sadism in TCM was far more brutal and alien. The victims were reduced to absolute and sheer panic without a shred of composure left to them...which is what blind, insatiable sadism wants....blind and insatiable fear. The victims in the most recent horror films still maintained an element of heroism (the final twist in Tension was kind of a cop-out if you ask me...like the writer was retracing his steps to cover up a stalling plot line). All this says to me is that the writer and director seem unwilling to cross the line into true horror and opted to save a shred of hope for their audience...which may be satisfying on one level...and yet, we all still compare them to the shrieking nightmare of TCM, shake our heads and wonder what happened to the good olé days.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A film that has no ending...,"Hostel is a film that you will always remember. No matter what viewers say a bout it, the film is original and it is smart, creative, and passionate. Some people might say it is just another gory flick but it is really a deep reflection of humanity; everybody has evil in them, ""Hostel brings out that evil and displays if for the public"". It is a film that shows how truly sickening our race can be, and how truly just we can be. It shows us that the world is not a safe place, yet there is something we can do about it. The film is realistic, smart, and truthful. They would not just make this stuff up and say it was real, if I thought of this idea on my own I would take all the credit for it. This film is a great film to learn from, and to be psychologically scared by.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not Up to Its Hype,"Considering the marketing of Hostel as one of the most shocking horror films, my girlfriend and I were eager to watch the just out ""uncut"" DVD. Actually, I watched most of it alone as she fell asleep within 45 minutes.We watch a lot of horror films, yet this one fell well short of any frights, dream-weavers, or even suspense. I'm being generous in giving it a 5 of 10.And do not expect it to be a Quentin Tarantino film either. He neither wrote nor directed it, and I can only imagine how much more interesting it would be if he had. There was no evidence of Tarantino in it whatsoever. Now I'm not hating on Eli Roth, I liked Cabin Fever, with it's mix of angst, blood, and black humor, but he took a fine concept for a film, and turned it into a shmozzle of a road-trip movie without any laughs, a soft-porn movie that wouldn't even excite a teenager, a gore movie which just seemed wholly unrealistic and hokey, and a thriller into a predictable outcome without any tension.Yes there were some scenes that were disturbing, perhaps, to the squeamish, but I wouldn't let my mother watch it anyway. I found Rob Zombie's ""Devil's Rejects"" much more disturbing, unexpected, tense, and story-driven than this yawn, I mean, yarn.I was expecting much more with Tarantino prominently featured as executive producer. I mean, True Romance, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Dusk Till Dawn even, these are all either noteworthy or excellent movies he's written, but sadly, he penned nothing here. I would really be interested in what he'd do with a horror screenplay himself.To summarize, I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater, and also glad I work in a video store so that I could see it for free. It's barely worth a DVD rental (very scant special features BTW), if only to inspire others to strive to do more and better in writing and directing than this tame might-have-been.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Disappointing,"Kinda crappy. Weak script. Some of the gore was cool, but I wouldn't shell out ten bucks for it as is. The Lion's Gate people tried to get people excited at Toronto, but it was a little disappointing. Ran into some of their people later who said the director threw a fit and had to be baby sat through the festival. Kinda funny for a horror guy to need a babysitter. Always amusing to hear the 'office gossip' at these festivals. I was hoping for a better film, however. Actually, I heard the director was kind of a handful on Cabin Fever, too. There was a really awful draft of the sequel to that one that Lion's Gate refused to even consider. It was so bad it was comical. So they made the guy do this one. Not sure about this, but I also heard someone at LGF wrote this one and they paid him big bucks to slap this guy's name on it, to keep him happy. In any event, I really love the genre, and had high hopes for this one. Loved the premise, but it just doesn't deliver.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better Than I Expected,"Based on some other reviews  plus the ad campaign, I expected an unrelenting gore fest. Actually, this is a very Grimm fairy tale (pun intended) with just enough fantasy and allegory to keep you interested while not losing your lunch. Thematically, this is also a very political film that takes various swipes at the notion of anti-Americanism. (Note how Jay Hernandez' bi-lingual ability, unusual for mono-lingual Americans, is a plus.) Of course there are many incidents in the movie that are way over the top and highly implausible, but, again, this is a cautionary fairy tale, and it sticks to those old-fashioned rules of good, evil and retribution while being very entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Great, sadistic, evil film, rich with characters and atmosphere.","I have just returned from watching the afternoon screening of Hostel at the TIFF. It's great. Really great. A bloody, sick, twisted, violent, bloody, violent, gory, violent, violent, violent, sick, and what? sexy? damn right it is. Eli Roth is such a cool guy, and his work seems to border the absolute darkest and deepest depths of inhumanity. I love it. Every second of the film, which was not even fully complete since he really wanted to show it at the TIFF so he brought a temp work in HDCAM or TV or whatever the hell it's called, was very entertaining. The film tells a story of a brutal, fiendish, perverse, greedy and barbaric world. I'd like to dig further into it's rich atmosphere but I don't want to spoil anything. The performances were excellent, especially Derek Richardson. I'm worried that the film may be cut horribly by the ratings board since I really want my friends to witness the truly outstanding film-making and storytelling in the depths of a truly evil world. Eli Roth is one of those rare filmmakers who can mix both storytelling(both character and plot driven, which in fact some filmmakers can't seem to do...) and directing. Any serious Horror and Thriller fan will appreciate this film. I can't wait to see what Eli and Raw Nerve come out with next.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disgustingly predictable...,"I watched this film with my roommate for a Seattle newspaper review and was utterly disgusted and disappointed! Everything in the first 20 minutes or so was a dead giveaway to the rest of the movie. Personally, I love horror films and don't usually mind seeing gore if it is a significant part to the plot; unfortunately, this is not true for 'Hostel'... poorly written plot (no explanation entire film), far too obvious (audience is not left guessing with ANYTHING!), overly graphic (I don't just mean bloody, but literally the theatre had tons of people puking in the hallways - i saw it and asked), and basically not scary.

"Intense, Twisted Horror at its Bloodiest","I saw this movie today, the day it opened around here, and I *really* liked it.What a wonderful kind of its genre (horror). It was bloody, edgy, intense, fast-paced, dramatic ... with a near-perfect beginning and end embracing a wonderfully terrifying story.How to compare this movie? It's very bloody, in the spirit of slasher movies beginning with the semi-legendary Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It has some of the intensely personalist flavor (ugh) of High Tension.In the tradition of American scary movies, there's sexuality mixed, in varying measure, with the fear. The sexuality is quite strong even for an R-rated horror movie. Such can certainly be titillating in scary movies; however, I myself didn't find it so in this one ... at least not after the first few scenes. In the early part of the movie especially, the general sense of Something's Not Quite Right was so pervasive, and so artfully mingled into the scenes, that I doubt if anyone will get ""turned on"" by those scenes ... but expect that Something's Not Quite Right sense to coax you to the edge of your seat until the Not Quite Right hits you (and all of us in the audience) in the face.The real value of the early scenes is exactly that they follow admirably a pattern that is very familiar to horror movies fans: some likable folks (3 kids) are invited to Something That Sounds Too Good to be True.Next of course the kids experience Something of the Good. And then all hell breaks loose as they discover that it is indeed Too Good to be True.Part of the horror comes in contrasting the Dreamed of Good, the Taste of Bliss, with the actual Nightmarish Horror.There are some amazing scenes full of that intense irony that you only find in a well-made horror flick. I won't spoil them by talking about them ... except to say that these are the sorts of scenes that simply leave me wrinkling my brow and whispering ""Oh, NO ... oh, sh** ... !"" If you, like me, like this kind of scene, then hey, you'll have plenty of opportunity to experience more than a few such in this movie.The entire movie is set near Bratislava, Slovakia, and there are some lovely views, beautiful scenes, mostly of what Americans (like me) would think of as a quiet, almost idyllic, sometimes pastorally peaceful setting. Which produces all the more contrast to the horror of the film.The pace was good, the action was quick, the dialog and script were both economical and very credible.Tight, taut, scary, horrifying ... if that's your scary movie taste, hey, check this movie out.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""I don't want to drink. I want to look at art!""","I'll skip to normal intro and jump right into this one. It's been awhile since I was this disappointed in a film. Eli Roth had an opportunity to make a classic with Hostel, but as far as I'm concerned, he failed miserably. Before I get to where Roth went wrong, I'll start with what he got right. The scenes of torture at the factory are as grueling and intense as I've seen. These scenes have an incredibly dark tone and feel to them. Many of these moments are difficult to watch. I was squirming in my seat on more than one occasion. These 30 or so minutes are top notch stuff.Unfortunately, there's another hour of this movie that is so poorly written with so many moments that I can only describe as dumb that I did not enjoy Hostel as a whole. Let's start with the three main characters traveling around Europe looking for sex. They're about as shallow a group as you'll find. There's nothing presented about any of the three that led me to care in the least whether they lived or died. There was no emotional attachment. It was like watching a sophomoric Spring Break movie set in Europe. And when our hero goes out of his way to describe the young girl he watched die, it was so out of character (as if he had any character) that I just knew Roth was beating me in the head to set me up for something yet to come.Or take the whole getaway at the end of the movie. Are we supposed to believe that our hero just happens to pick the one car with the keys in the ignition and a bag of gum and candy on the floor? Sorry, I'm not buying it. And how convenient that the three people who were responsible for luring our hero and his friend into the factory should step out in front of his getaway car. Again, Roth might be selling, but I'm not buying. Finally, our hero trades the convenient bag of candy to the gang of pint-size street thugs in exchange for their help in stopping the bad guys. Oh boy! It's one of the dumbest moments I've seen in a movie in a long time. A lot of people will look at a moment like this and see Roth's attempt to inject humor into Hostel. I'm sorry, but you can't have it both ways. Either your movie is a gruesome, gut-wrenching affair or it's a teenybopper film on the same level as Scream. A change from something like the Guinea Pig series to National Lampoon is startling, forced, and poorly handled.You don't have to look very hard to find other problems with Hostel's script. For example, how does our hero manage to kill several people and drag around a girl missing part of her face without getting a noticeable and suspicious amount of blood on the perfectly fitting suit he so conveniently found? And wasn't it a great coincidence that our hero should happen to wind up on the same train with the ""main"" killer who so conveniently goes into a deserted bathroom? There are other examples, but you get the idea. It's insulting and, as I've said repeatedly, dumb.Finally (I say finally because I could ramble on forever), I've got to agree with the critics of Hostel who are upset with Roth's portrayal of the Slovakian people. Yes, bad things can happen anywhere. I'm not saying that Slovakia is exempt from barbarous murder, but Roth would have us believe that most everyone in the town was complicit with what was going on. Apparently we're supposed to believe that a few dollars is all it takes to get a whole town to accept murder as their primary source of income. Wasn't there one decent person in town to speak up about what appears to have been going on for what appears to have been a considerable period of time? And don't you think the travel agents and guidebooks would steer travelers away from this town after the first couple of people went missing? As dumb as this movie is, I wonder how dumb Roth thinks his audience is.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

The cheapening of horror cinema continues...,"Thank you Eli Roth for taking an intriguing premise and transforming it into something of no value whatsoever. ""Hostel"" tells the story of a couple of annoying yank college students and one seriously burnt out foreign ""dude"" traveling through Eastern Europe. Since they spend the majority of this film sucking up whatever drugs they can get their hands on, banging prostitutes and acting like complete morons, they become perfect targets for an business looking to recruit (i.e. kidnap) 'distracted' and brainless young tourists... just like them! Before you can say ""good riddance"" we discover that said business is actually a grimy, decaying underground labyrinth where customers from all over the globe pay big bucks for a chance to torture a mutilate a real, live human being. Sounds like a blast, doesn't it?While Hostel might seem like a disturbing horror film in theory, it's so badly directed and written it aggressively refuses to deliver anything remotely resembling suspense, terror or shock value. The only memorable sequence happens near the end of the picture and involves a dislocated eyeball that needs snipped. In the meantime... The characters are so poorly developed, obnoxious and dumb, the dialogue is risible and the film so slow moving you might find it a trust test of patience to hang in there. I'd say Eli Roth probably had his target audience in mind when he vomited up this mess; people who are content with nothing more than T&A and blood being flung around. Sadly, those sharing his same mentality tend to be too young to actually see R-rated movies.Most surprisingly, this mess managed to make a dent at the box office. A small dent, but a dent nonetheless. Just one more sign of the times when something this bad turns out to be one of the highest grossing horror movies of 2006. And that has nothing to do with it being a quality horror film and everything to do with hype. Hype being some major name calling dredging up Quentin Tarantino's money investment and a misleading ad campaign claiming this is the most shocking film of the past ten years. Unfortunately, it doesn't even come close and is just another waste of time and money.",,Anonymous,Horror
Hostel = nothing,"I first became interested in Hostel when I saw a preview before Saw II on the first night. Hostel seemed to be the type of movie that would beat out all other horrors with it's disgusting tactics and clever screenplay, however, after actually seeing the movie, my opinion was rendered worthless. Hostel does not create any sympathy for the three main characters that get involved in the torture ring. Therefore, the aspect of actually caring what happens to them is lost. When walking out, I realized that Hostel was in fact, the worst movie I've ever seen. The best part may the the ""gangster-like"" children attempting to obtain bubblegum, but other than that, this movie falls far short of horror or the shock factor that was so prevalent in both Saw movies. I expected much more from QT, and if I were him I would be ashamed to have my name listed at the beginning of this empty joke of a movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Couldn't Sit Still Through This,"After some friends told me that people were gasping and squirming through the torture scenes in this film, I decided not to see this in the theater, to avoid the distractions. So I bought the unrated DVD and finally got a chance to see if it lived up to its hype. No disappointments here! People complain about the first half being too gratuitous and juvenile with nudity, but when it picks up, it is truly a terrifying experience. I enjoyed the pacing, there were times when I felt sick, the acting was reasonably good and torture seemed genuinely realistic even though the plot was extremely far-fetched. Anybody who sees this without clenching their fists or curling up their toes or not having their heart beat fast several times through it, is not human. It has to be the most violently sadistic mainstream film in the history of film-making. I liken it to an awesome roller-coaster ride! Highly recommended, indeed! 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Extremely disturbing film with a brilliant plot!,"Okay, yes it does have some sexual content & nudity but what horror film these days doesn't include something of that nature just to gain entertainment value points? I mean, look at your target audience (teens and young adults) and tell me you don't need those scenes to get people in the cinema seats especially when you have no A list (and really not even any B list actors). Also, if you pay attention to who wrote & directed the film you'd notice it's the same guy as 'Cabin Fever' (this film far surpasses it's predecessor) which has the same sort of 'American Pie' meets 'Saw' type feel to it so some sex is necessary for the story line.The plot is just brilliant. It's terrifying because it's very realistic. I'm not sure if any of you have ever visited any of these Eastern European countries but something of this nature could actually happen and no one would be the wiser to it. I don't want to give away too much but suffice to say that the plot definitely thickens and runs deeper than you expect.The gore factor is absolutely full blown. I have seen Saw and Saw II and I would say that along the visual basis they are equal but the key difference is that you really feel the torment and pain the characters are experiencing, it's not just some colored corn syrup and latex intestines...it's horrific screaming and desperate pleas that you really believe. The acting I have to say was superb by these new comers.All in all, a great horror flick.

A bit funny but OK,"First of all I have to say that I come from Slovakia. So lets deal with the movie first. Its really hard for me write something original now, because I read a few reports above, and while at the beginning everyone was caring about the main characters and everything, I have to say I was laughing my ass off on the first half of the movie. Lets ask some important questions first. Why do they talk Czech on the train station when our heroes come to Slovakia? Why do they talk Czech in the TV at the Hostel? Why are every signs on the walls in the streets in Czech? I mean come on, there ain't an actual word spoken in Slovak in the whole movie. Well maybe in the disco the music is Slovak, but thats already 20 years or more old songs. My parents used to listen to that music. At the beginning the Dutch guy tells them that this place is near Bratislava and it is true that Slovakia is on the border with the Czech republic, but shouldn't they have explained in the movie,like: ""look there's a hostel near Bratislava the capital of Slovakia, but the hostel is in the Czech republic?"" Another thing, obviously the movie was shot in the Czech republic, believe me I know my country and that just wasn't Slovakia at all. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to dis anybody and I am not saving my countries reputation, its just good to have some things made clear.

The previews made this movie so appealing and scary! I was not once scared. The ending was more than predictable and very disappointing.

"Not really Hostel, just a little disturbed.","This is the new breed of horror film, which has become increasingly popular in the past few years. Following in the popularity of ""Saw"", ""Hostel"" is another chapter in the psychological chop-'em-up. Pretty simple story, about 3 young tourists who are lured to a youth hostel in an obscure eastern Europe town. Typical teen dangers arise ( sex, drugs, and strangers) that always result in trouble.The movie does have moments of inspired tension, with it's ghostly town residents,a concrete killing field,and it's redemptive finale. It even tried to make the characters 3 dimensional ( could the virginal friend be gay? What fuels our hero? and we have a promiscuous...father? ), but it seemed there wasn't enough time to care about those shadings, and instead of a paint brush.. here comes the axe... or chainsaw, or blow torch, or machete, or hammer.. at one point it's like shopping in aisle 5 at your local home depot.Some of the scenes are disgusting, but i've seen more inspired horror scenes. I think some of the most horrific things that happen in the film, actually don't involve the aforementioned utensils, but how people care so little about a fellow human being.

Eli Roth bombs again!,"Two American guys (played by Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson) are traveling through Europe. Their reason is to have sex with as many women as is possible.

I never wanted to see anything he did again but this has an interesting premise and I DO like Jay Hernandez. I should have known better! Like his first film we are given characters that we don't know anything at all about (Hernandez and Richardson have NOTHING to work with) and we really don't like. Seriously--we're supposed to give a damn about two horny American boys who only want to have nonstop sex? Richardson and Hernandez are as good as they could be--meaning not very.The script is terrible. Like I said the premise isn't bad but the dialogue is lousy AND offensive (I didn't like Hernandez saying ""That's so gay"" after anything went wrong) and the script doesn't make a lot of sense. The direction is off too--some shots were framed so badly I couldn't believe it! The gore is effective and extreme--but I didn't know or care who it was being done to. I also love how two characters have body parts chopped off, but are walking around OK right after--they should be dead of blood loss or in shock.Also there is TONS of pointless female nudity. It got to a point where I was just getting angry. I went to see a HORROR film not a soft core porno flick!

Daft American tourists in a European wonderland,"You can say what you like about Eli Roth, but you can't say he doesn't have vision. Roth has said on numerous occasions that he wants to bring the old-school grindhouse style back to cinema, and while Hostel is no masterpiece - it's safe to say that Roth has achieved his aim. Hostel is one of the grisliest films to come out of America in years; and what it lacks in originality is made up for with in your face gratuity. I'm actually one of the few that rates Cabin Fever as both a good film and a promising debut, and it's safe to say that Roth's prowess has a director has grew in the three years since the release of his first film. It's also safe to say that he's targeted his audience well, and Hostel is sure to appeal to fans of grisly, gory horror that leaves nothing to the imagination. The simple plot follows two Americans and their Icelandic friend on a backpacking trip through Europe. We first meet them in Amsterdam where they are directed to a Slovakian hostel on the promise of beautiful and easy girls by a stoned Dutch man. Everything is going well for the trio...until they start getting killed.Roth shoots on location in Europe, and this brings a great style to the film. We start off in sleazy Amsterdam, where drugs and naked girls are the order of the day. From there, we move onto a beautiful village in Slovakia, upon which Roth creates a great sense of wonder. The central location is an abandoned hospital, and this setting provides the scene for all the ghastly action once the movie turns into a horror film. Hostel is a film of two halves; we start off with a scenario that reminded me a lot of 'An American Werewolf in Paris', in that wide-eyed American tourists are seen taking in the sights of Europe. There's no horror early on, but there's lots of comedy and this allows Roth to build his characters and show the audience a good time. Once it becomes a horror film, the shocks come thick and fast and the second half of the film is very different from first; but also very good. The characters and acting are both surprisingly well done. Although they're not exactly deep, Roth's teens are easy to like and it actually is a shame once they enter the chamber of horrors. The horror scenes are more along the lines of cringe-worthy torture than any real scares; but Roth makes good of it, as mystery is created early on and then the film breaks into a thrilling climax towards the end. The ending itself is really good, and provides the perfect finale to a grotesque monster of a film. Well worth ninety minutes of your time.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Did I miss something???,"From all of the positive reviews I was expecting a very dark, relentless, gory film on par with the best of Asian extreme cinema. Instead, what I saw was a dumbed-down American horror movie trying way too hard to be gory and disturbing but never actually coming anywhere close. The first 45 minutes played like a crappy Showtime soft-core porno. Then, the allegedly ""disturbing"" horror aspect began. There was maybe one scene that pushed the envelope of American gore (still tame by Asian standards). The rest was a ho-hum crap American slasher. There was absolutely no build up or sustaining of atmosphere. The plot was paper thin and totally anti-climatic.The premise of this film had so much more potential. In skilled hands, this could have been an absolutely disturbing mind-f***. Instead, it was a completely ineffective exercise of mainstream Hollywood cliché.I don't know what cut some reviewers saw at the Toronto film festival. Many had put this on par with the likes of Miike and other intelligent filmmakers. Perhaps the original cut lived up to what one would expect from a Tarrantino produced film with this kind of hype. The cut currently available comes nowhere near. Save your money if you are looking for a truly disturbing and thought-provoking film.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
To the negative critics: you're ALL idiots!,"I've read nothing but how bad everybody thought this movie was. But come on, what was it that you really disliked about it? The excessive blood and violence? Disturbing content? The sex? Or was it the fact that Tarantino had very little to do with it? 90% of what I've read seems to be the last option. Just because Quentin isn't directing it it's a bad movie? Bulls***! The acting was brilliant, any performing artist would have to agree. Jay Hernandez put on a very real performance, and stellar at that. The rest of the cast was quite good as well, especially since for almost all of them, Hostel was their first real break in the business (and Oli's VERY FIRST movie...that a boy, King of Swing!).I think most of you are just being critical for the sake of being critical, but seriously, open your eyes...so I can burn 'em with a blowtorch! HAHAHA! (P.S. this is a brilliant example - how many movies do you see something like THAT?) Anyways, although the story pretty well revolves around a bunch of guys trying to get laid in Europe, you gotta respect Eli Roth's ability to provide us viewers with a crazy little thing called ""shock value"". I look forward to the sequel...it better not suck.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Brutal, Brutal fun","""Hostel"" is definitely not a film for everyone. With intense depictions of torture and camera shots that force the viewer to observe every gory detail, ""Hostel"" pushes the R rating to its limit.Produced by Quentin Tarantino and written and directed by new comer Eli Roth, this film gives the horror movie genre a wake up call that it desperately needed.The film begins with three friends Paxton (Jay Hernandez) Josh (Derek Richardson) and their new found friend Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson) who are backpacking through Europe. Paxton is the typical college guy who encourages all of the bad behavior that they participate in. Josh on the other hand is the shy type and has to be forced to do anything. Then there is the laid back Icelander Oli who Josh and Paxton met on their travels and has now joined their group.Of course they partake in the activities of drug use and other debauchery that characters in horror movies usually do, but what they are really looking for are beautiful women. This is when the three bump into a local in Amsterdam who tells them of a secret hostel in Slovakia where the most gorgeous women are located.Unable to resist, the three jump on the next train to Slovakia. At the hostel things start to take turn for the worse when after the first night Oli is missing. After worrying a bit Paxton and Josh brush it off and decide to continue partying with the girls they have met. Naturally the next morning Josh cannot be found. Paxton then becomes desperate to find his missing friends. Interrogating the girls they were with Paxton is lead to a place where people are violently tortured as a way of fulfilling people's fantasies and reaching a new emotional rush.The horror movie genre has become extremely formulaic recently with movies that are either remakes of older films or use every cliché possible. Fortunately Roth being a fan of horror movies knows what has become tiresome and tries breaks away from the sameness that has corrupted the genre. Although he does resort to using characters that are the typical young rule breakers, they are given some characterization that allows the viewer to feel sympathy for their situation. Not to mention when the characters do something that might seem stupid, he gives ample reason for their actions.What Roth does well is he understands exactly how to build tension throughout the film. Recent horror films have relied on the use of quick cuts and cheap scares in order to frighten the viewer. Roth though utilizes the atmosphere of the scene by using close up shots that allude to the painful acts that will soon occur. Do not worry though because when those acts do occur the camera does not switch over to something else. Roth instead decides to show the whole gruesome act. This gives the film an intensity that other horror films have begun to lack.Realism is a key element that Roth emphasizes throughout the film. The premise for the movie originated when Roth stumbled upon a website that said one could kill someone for $10,000. Thus the movie advertised that it was based on true events. Here he uses ordinary people in a plausible situation in order to cause fear. This strays away from the typical plot of an un-killable monster or a ghost that has been overdone.""Hostel"" is a horror movie that is not only new but refreshing due to its original story and strong direction from Eli Roth. Be warned though that this movie is fairly intense at times, but any fan of the genre will appreciate this fresh approach to horror film making.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
a Slovak point of view,"i have just (almost) seen the hostel.since i come from Slovakia,the movie felt completely unrealistic and i stopped watching,considering it more a satire than a horror movie. i just want to point out,that whole environment was exaggerated and i feel sorry for those who have this picture of my country. it felt more like watching a movie from somewhere beyond Ural (mountain range in Russia some thousands of kilometers from Slovakia) the movie wasn't even shot in Slovakia but some little town in Czech republic. our government sucks ass,but we don't kill people so obviously :-) anyway,I'm sorry to learn that such a good director as Quentin Tarantino made such a stupid movie with such superficial characters...

Hostel:  Strangeland meets Saw.,"At the start of the movie, my first impression was another corny teen movie. I was right, to an extent. Some parts are corny, however, some are extremely suspenseful. It starts out with a group of three pot smoking friends on a vacation in Amsterdam hoping to get stoned out of their minds and sleep with lots of European girls. Typical and overused, yes, but it worked. Unfortunately, this scenario plays out for almost half the movie. My friend told me about this movie and summarized it as ""lots of boobs, and lots of gore"", and he was dead on. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy seeing a boob here and there, but come on, let's do it in moderation, OK? The nudity was excessive, and it felt like it was only there for the ratings. They could left out 95% of the nudity and still kept the viewers perfectly happy. As for the gore -- Hostel wouldn't be Hostel without it. There's no problem there. This is a movie that WILL make you cringe.. and it's a movie that WILL make you fold up into the fetus position. But it won't scare you. Hostel was much more of a thriller than a horror.As for the acting.. everyone did a good job, with the exception of a few scenes. Everyone was convincing for the most part, even the ""only hired because they were hot"" European girls. Since I compared this movie to Saw in my summary, let me just say the acting was a thousand times better than in Saw. Don't worry about that.All in all, I enjoyed this movie. But it definitely isn't something I'd buy. It kept my attention, it was very suspenseful at times, and the story was straight forward and believable. It just didn't have the spark. Metaphorically speaking, this is just another notch in the belt in terms of recent horror/thrillers.I give it a generous 7 out of 10 stars.Don't take your kids to this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Don't believe the previews,"I got really excited about seeing this movie. I enjoyed Eli Roth's Cabin Fever and previously thought of him as a genius, but after this movie, I'll never think that again.The first hour or so was more porno than horror movie. The previews made me think that the whole movie would be gory, scary and interesting. I would have never bought tickets if I knew how the movie started, how much was left unanswered and how bad the whole thing is.I had assumed the movie would be gruesome and twisted, such as Saw, but it ended up being a complete waste of time and money. There were, of course, a few scenes that were pretty good and one or two that made me cringe, but I've seen better-much better. If you are planning on going to see this movie, don't waste your money.

A collection of clichés and ethnic stereotypes,"A collection of clichés and ethnic stereotypes. One of the worst movies ever seen in my life. I just arrived from The Sitges Film Festival in Spain, and right now, I am deeply disappointed with Tarantino, who produced this movie and was there as a special guest of the Festival. Tarantino during his speech said people are weak and can't stand the blood and the violence. But concerning to Hostel, people are weak and can't stand such a bad movie. The director abused of people tolerance with detailed murder scenes, and I agree in a B movie that is probably the main idea, but nothing makes me believe his script has any sort of reason to exist.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hostel: one of the scariest movies I have seen!!!,"The movie is about three guys who while on vacation to Europe they go to a small town in Slovekia hearing that there women are hot and down for whatever. They end up getting a little more than they bargained for and are faced with a sinister reality that seems what hell must look like... will they get out of hell? you must see it to find out!!!I definitely recommend this movie. If you are the kind of person that likes scary movies it has all the horror you can ask for in a scary movie. However if you are the kind of person that likes his movies meticulously thought out, you are sure to find some minor flaws in this movie which could tamper with your opinion of it. This all said and done, the movie is a great improvement in horror movie. I cant wait for what Eli Roth directs next.... why not Hostel 2 Eli?

Otherwise - great movie! It was pretty scary too, as I know that there are people like that out there living in the world...

very hard to tell...,"I never had such a problem to decide if I rather recommend a movie or not... never before there has been a main-stream-movie which went this far, depicting this kind of gore. never before I've seen a gore-movie that was this little fun and entertaining. It's true that this movie really made me feel terrible and sick. Not in a way like Peter Jackson's Braindead did to me when I entered a whole new level of horror-movies watching it long time ago. Rather in a way documentaries can make you feel. I couldn't say this is a bad movie or that it's not made pretty well... still I wouldn't recommend it. I'd even recommend avoiding those who simply can enjoy a movie like this. For me there needs to be a a clear line between fiction and reality. Hostel doesn't have this gap so I couldn't enjoy the gore. I still give a 7 because I believe that it's a milestone for the genre... I just cannot tell if it's a good or a bad step ...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Thanks, Quentin. Great find!","Is pushing the limits what we are trying to achieve here? Is witnessing realistic torture scenes the whole point of making a horror movie? Do we want to believe this world is a very unsafe place to live in? When we watched someone's being tortured on the screen, how should we feel? Are we on side with the killers when we were sitting there being entertained by the slaughtering process? Should a person be killed if one is 'bad'? Is murdering in a comical way a more acceptable way of killing? Does the R rating only attracting more curios, young minds to a dark movie? Is my dog pooping on the sidewalk a form of creativity? Do we call inappropriateness a proof of freedom of speech?Quentin Tarantino is the greatest producer/ film maker in Hollywood. His strategy of cashing in through promoting a franchise of violent movies as hip entertainment is undeniable the best move benefiting the youth and society.I remember it was so funny after Vincent shot Marvin in the car.

softcore porn followed by inhumane acts...,"I understand the appeal of horror movies but can't understand people who view them as quality film. This isn't a movie about a story and a plot and characters with motivations. This is spectacle. There is nothing inherently wrong with spectacle but I sure wish it were viewed for what it is. Critics attack these movies because they think they're movies. So the reviews will be pretty shoddy. I watched it against my will and found it to be just that. While I enjoy spectacles from time to time, a lot of great ones of crossed the screen, I just can't sit back and enjoy a show where the only purpose is to show you how realistic we can make this gross stuff look. And again, I enjoy porn on occasion. What the heck, right? But... Hostel pretty much takes us through 40 minutes of soft core sex scenes for no real reason at all. It's filler. It's to make it look like there's more to the movie then dismemberment. Ugh.... I'm done now. And yes I realize this comment is pretty useless for the mostpart but i wanted the opportunity to vent.

Take It For What It Is & Give It A Chance,"Okay - I really wanted to see this at the cinema but missed it, so waited till it came onto Sky Box Office. My boyf and I had read up some of the critiques on the Net and thought we'd give it a go, even though most of the write-ups were negative.It is my belief that if you expect a lot from a film it can sometimes be a disappointment - so with that in mind we settled in on the sofa.The first half hour is extremely annoying and plays into every cliché in the book - the girls are all hot, the Americans are all loud and obnoxious, the weird German man on the train wanting to take advantage of the USAers - it's your average jocks-going-on-holiday-to-have-sex-and-take-loads-of-drugs movie - but I believe the writer and director were doing this intentionally.

The gory scenes are actually very well done and whilst the sickest scene of all (Japanese Eye is all I will say) could have been better, the payback is beautiful, tongue-in-cheek and downright nasty.The main character, who also gets his kit off, is not that wooden an actor and does carry the film well. It's one of those films that if you keep an open mind and realise that yes, there are better films out there, that yes, it is not the most incredible film you'll see this year and that yes, it falls into cliché-territory from time to time, it's actually a thoroughly decent movie.Plus, it is the only film in 17 years that gave me really bad dreams (I'm talking about being skinned alive here, veins being ripped out of my arms) and any film that enters into my sub-conscience in that way gets more points because those are the kind of films you do remember for longer.Like I said, keep an open mind, relax into the ride and give it a chance...",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"This wild, ambitious, horror film premise is not for all tastes.","Two life long American buddies (Jay Hernandez & Derek Richardson) and their new found foreign friend (Eythor Gudjonsson) are traveling through Europe by backpacking. Later they find themselves seduced by attractive ladies at a Hostel and then lured by becoming victims in a cruel game. Which is a Murder for Profit business by killing travelers from any nationality at any price.Directed by Eli Roth (Cabin Fever) made an entertaining, sick, twisted horror movie with clever touches of dark humour. Roth's scenes of torture are surprisingly effective and the film is gratuitous violent. Which Roth is never seems to be ashame of. The director handle himself better as a filmmaker than he did on his previous first picture (Which is of course ""Cabin Fever""). The film actually takes its time by getting to know the characters before getting into the story of this movie. Which is a good for a horror film, especially these days.DVD has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Like Roth's previous movie on DVD, the director appears in all four commentary tracks! Which one of them is a solo commentary track by the director. Commentary two is the director and the executive producers:Boaz Yakin (Remember the Titans), Scott Spiegel (Co-Writer of ""Evil Dead 2:Dead by Dawn"") & Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill Vol.1 & Vol.2, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs). Commentary three is by the director, Producer:Chris Briggs and documentary filmmaker:Gabriel Roth. Commentary four is also by the director, film editor:George Folsey Jr. (National Lampoon's Animal House, The Blues Brothers), Harry Knowles of AintItCoolNews.com, actor:Eython Gudjonsson and actress:Barbara Nedeljakova. Which the all four commentary are all entertaining and worth checking out.DVD also has three part excellent featurette titled ""Hostel:Dissected"" by director's brother:Gabriel. Which is entertaining and gives you the behind the scenes tour of this film. Also the DVD has an multi-angle interactive feature of the infamous ""Kill the Car!"" sequence. Which is basically long takes from different camera set-ups. Seeing the street kids destroying the car is amusing, depending from which angle to choose from. The two things are missing from this DVD is the original theatrical trailer and deleted scenes. The original darker ending was mention in the commentaries and also briefly seen in the three part featurette. This low budget film has good production values with great locations, terrific score by Nathan Barr (Club Dread, Dukes of Hazzard, Super Troopers) and gory make-up effects by Gregory Nicotero & Oscar-Winner:Howard Berger. Roth is actually working on a sequel. I think it will be difficult to imagine a sequel to this flawed but unique movie. But who knows, maybe writer/director Roth could surprised us. Super 35.

Not as gory as I imagined,"I walked in to the cinema thinking ""wow, this is gonna be terrifying! I hear there were walk outs in America because of the blood content"". However, it's not. It has more than Reservoir Dogs and possibly Saw but it's not like the kind that makes you feel all that queasy and wanna vomit. I felt that they could have made more of the torture scenes and fully flaunt it to a higher level if they were going to go all out. I have to admit, I did like the tension it builds up in certain scenes and even though it may not be as gory as I hyped myself up for, it has a fair amount of blood to justify its genre as a horror.

What was Quentin thinking?????,"I have never written a review before on IMDb, so if this sounds stupid you will have to forgive me, I'm writing out of anger. I have just returned from seeing Hostel, and I can't stress enough. Do not waste your money on this film!!! I was so excited to see this! First of all I'm a huge fan of the horror genre, second I think that Tarentino is amazing. So, after reading a lot about this film online I couldn't wait to see it, even though it was directed by Eli Roth. Well all I can say is Cabin Fever II. It was that bad.Now, because I'm such a fan of horror movies I've sat through a lot of bad acting and cheesy plots. However, as far as I'm concerned that's what horror is all about. I personally think that you only have to follow one basic rule with horror. Either make people love your characters so much that you want them to make it, or make them so annoying that you can't wait to see them die. The rest is free game. If you have that I can sit through the worst acting in the world. I was so bored with this film I didn't care either way who lived or died.This film basically once again proved to me that American horror is dead.

A new level of SUCK,"I will make this short and sweet. Hostel is the MOST Disappointing MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. And no, that is not a hasty, post viewing rant from someone who was simply just disappointed. This movie, honestly, SUCKED. And I will tell you why. It's one thing to go see a movie that you know isn't going to be that good and then see exactly what you expect. But to go see a movie and expect it to suck (as I did Hostel), only to have it suck twice as much for twice as many reasons, that's a whole new level of suck. Ya see, I expected Hostel to be low on substance and meaning and high in gore. Turns out, this movie couldn't even deliver the latter. That's right, with the exception of one scene, Hostel was weak in the graphic nature department. In fact, Hostel was so weak, if it weren't for the pointless sex and nudity and the pervasive language, it could have been rated PG-13. And I mean that. This movie was so typical and so ""not"" a departure from the norm. In fact, there was hardly any torture. It ended up just being a ""get away from the evil bad guys"" movie, typical of all other proclaimed ""horror films."" I'm so upset I cant even write anymore. The last thing I'll say is this. 1) Eli Roth can't write a script to save his life (check out the scene where the main character talks about a girl drowning, that was a pathetic attempt to create emotion in the audience) and 2) Quentin Terrentino should be ashamed to have his name on this project.

Eli Roth Gives Us a Taste of Humanity's Dark Side,"I don't recall watching HOSTEL in the theater. I'm pretty sure I did, but I have no recollection of it whatsoever. For whatever reason, my brain has totally blocked any memory of originally seeing the movie. All I remembered was that it was brutally violent and helped the SAW series solidify the profitable nature of ""torture porn"". I hadn't watched the movie in years when I saw it sitting in my collection a few weeks back and decided to reintroduce myself to Eli Roth's gore-fest. After watching it again with a few years of letting it settle in at the back of my mind, I realized it's a little better than I rememberand a little less violent. That's not to say the movie seems tamer after watching it again. HOSTEL can never be considered tame. HOSTEL is the story of three friends backpacking through Europe: Paxton, Josh, and their new Icelandic friend Oli, the ""King of the Swing"". These guys are one a never-ending quest to get laid and, when Amsterdam doesn't quite live up to their expectations, they're directed to a hostel in Slovakia that's loaded with available women. Arriving in Slovakia and settling into the rumored hostel, the trio make a connection with two beautiful women, Natalya and Svetlana, who act as their guide to the booming nightlife. But soon, things take a dark turn as Oli disappears one night, supposedly making a sudden return home, and the hostel starts feeling a little less welcoming. By the time we learn the hostel's horrible secret, it's already too late.Let me start by admitting that I'm not a horror fan. Less than 20% of my total DVD collection might fall into the genre. The average horror movie has nothing to offer me and my personal tastes. So a horror movie needs to have an interesting angle or some incredibly good reviews for me to hunt it down, and HOSTEL has just that. The premise behind HOSTEL is an intriguing one and is rumored to be based on truth (in that the organization at the center of the movie might be based on an existing service). When I watch a horror movie, it's got to be truly frightening and the idea that psychopaths like the ones we see in this movie might actually be out there somewhere doing business is a grim one. We all have the ability to commit horrific acts and the concept that there are people out there that embrace this ability and treat it as fun or a form of release is disgusting. And this movie is, if anything, disgusting. In a good way, though. The movie gives us a solid 45 minutes to get to know these characters before they get to the meat of the film. Even if they do come off as a bit two-dimensional at first, it gives us a chance to know them so when the horrible stuff hits, it's got more of an effect. The first half of the movie is pretty slow and, at times, outright boring but it all builds up to a gripping final half hour.The gore in the movie is awesome. I love practical gore. I'll take some rubber intestines over a CG disemboweling every time. HOSTEL runs with practical horror effects and it comes off as that much more disturbing. There are a few instances where it might not have looked quite right (for those who've seen the movie, I'm primarily referring to Kana) but it's all part of the fun of going over the top. Eli Roth has an obvious passion for the horror genre and, if there's any doubt, listen to any one of the multiple commentary tracks that come with each of his HOSTEL movies. His passion for terrifying an audience and his solid grasp of storytelling make HOSTEL a pretty cool movie. He uses a bunch of unknown actors in the film which, while I'm sure helped keep the overall cost to a minimum, also helped see the victims in the movie as real people. I'd never heard of Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson, and Eythor Gudjonsson before, and, really, I haven't heard from them since. I hear Gudjonsson is pretty big in Iceland though. The real stars of the movie are the villains, who are fleshed out a little better. Particularly the Dutch Businessman, played by Jan Vlasák. Considering that Vlasák doesn't speak English, it's that much more impressive how menacing he comes across. Eli Roth's HOSTEL is a really good movie for what it is, and this is coming from a non-horror freak. The violence is brutal but shot in just such a way that a lot the worst happens off- screen or in quick glimpses, and Roth leaves the audience's minds fill in the blank. If more effort had been put into creating some more sympathetic victims, this movie would've been even stronger.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
hostel = the goodness,"'Hostel' is by no means an Academy Award winner, but it is exactly what Eli Roth intended it to be - a good, solid creepy movie (a definite step up from the letdown known as 'Cabin Fever' which was still pretty funny). Yes, it is just another movie for young men all about sex and ultra-violence. Yes it's pretty low-budget. And it's definitely not for the faint of heart. But if you're looking for a good gross-out with plenty of unnecessary sex, then this movie is perfect for you.Paxton and Josh are American friends traveling Europe in search of a good, preferably illegal, time. They partner up with a random Icelandic man and hit clubs and brothels to have the trip of a lifetime. But when they hear about the beautiful girls of Slovakia, they decide to change their itinerary. And one by one, people come up missing at their new hostel, and no one is quite who they appear to be. With a pretty crazy plot twist, eerie performances from some new actors, and gut-wrenching effects, 'Hostel' is sure to become a classic horror film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Thrillingly Unpleasant and Original,"Roth's best feature film to date delivers yet again for horror fans of this niche genre. You're unlikely to find another contemporary horror-thriller that can match the intensity and style of this flick.This is one that you'll want to watch to the end. The movie starts off as 3 young men who are almost a caricature of privileged Western men embarking on a European backpacking Journey; who are much more concerned with booze, sex, and good times. The three of them slowly realize they are caught up in a sadistic operation that leaves you shaken to the core.There's a comedic edge in this movie that helps it keep pace. Some are surely to disagree here but you have to at least hand it to Roth -- he dared to step out and get creative. The movie ultimately leaves you with a strong message; be careful what you wish for.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Oh boy....,"Oh jeezzzz, where to start.... Oh, ITS SUPPOSE TO BE A HORROR MOVIE, not softcore 1st hour and PG-13 violence the other half. Acting is so bad that you end up laughing when the main character is getting tortured. This is also assisted by how fake the torture scene is, not to mention extremely short. I have hard time believing that this movie caused some people to be rushed to hospital, most limbs are not chopped off on scene, you just see the actor going ""ahh ahh ahh"" like a friggin drunk. everything is shallow, story, dialogues, torture scenes. Also, there is a scene where the main character (paxton) manages to put on a suit with tie without getting blood on anywhere when he lost 2 fingers. Future classic? definitely not, scary? no, worth watching? hell no.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sad follow-up for Eli Roth,"With so much hype surrounding this movie plus Quentin Tarantino's named tacked on, I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up too high. I did and was let down. Mind you, the special effects used during the torture scenes were exceptional. However, if you make a movie like this and bill it as a torture film with the brutal scenes then that's what it should be. I can understand the absence of character development and weightlessness of the film's plot in a movie like this because typically horror/slasher films aren't concerned with these aspects. But if you leave these elements completely out you have to compensate with excessive gore and violence. Maybe this reveals a dark side of my filmgoing expectations but the torture scenes, i.e. the horror scenes, totaled maybe 15-20 minutes of this 1.5 hour film, that's about 20% of a movie that was hyped to be incredibly graphic and disgusting. There were 1 or 2 moments where I actually did physically dry heave (pretty sure the girl sitting in front of me thought I lost it in her hair), but that was it. Honestly, I have scene more graphic horror sequences in the modern horror staples such as ""Friday the 13th"" and the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Halloween"" series. ""Cabin Fever,"" director Eli Roth's previous horror film is one of the most underrated horror/slasher/indie style films and more graphic and gut-wrenching than ""Hostel"". And I'm not sure why Tarantino is tacking his name onto projects he normally wouldn't be affiliated, but I guess he has a reason. If you're a fan of horror, I would wait until this comes out on DVD. There are some scenes that will make the average person squirm and feel their gut rolling, but the sick-to-your-stomach feeling is strongest as you walk out of the theater realizing you wasted 9 dollars on a sub-par film. If you haven't scene ""Cabin Fever,"" go rent that and wait for ""Hostel"" to join the DVD library a few months from now.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Once again it isn't safe to travel,"It is amazing what you can do with movies. Movies can evoke all types of emotions. The can make you laugh they can make you cry, they can make you love the bad guy and hate the good guy. And in the case with the movie ""Hostel"", they can make you never want to visit a place that otherwise would normally be appealing to most anyone.This movie does nothing to alleviate the fears of people who are already afraid to travel abroad. Hostel implicates a small city in Europe as a place where the wealthy act out their horrendous dreams of torture. Just to think that such people exist or that such a complicit place exists makes my skin crawl. Hostel is most effective because of its setting more than the blood and gore that was shown. Just the very idea of such things possibly happening make this movie a horror classic.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Motel Hell,"Hostel: 10 out of 10: Half Eurotrip style sex comedy (with a seventies level of nudity) and half the doctor scene from Bloodsucking Freaks, yeah I might as well stop my review right there it's a 10.Director Eli Roth (Cabin Fever) has scored a bull's eye simply by going back to what makes exploitation films great. Thus he produces a film that could have been lensed in the freewheeling year of 1975 rather than PG-13 stuffy year of 2005.The film starts with two American college students and an Icelandic hanger on enjoying some debauchery in Amsterdam. They hear about a nirvana for sex and drugs in Slovakia and they pursue it as if they were traversing the Himalayas to find Shangri-La.What they find is,,,, well I won't spoil it for you but they should have stuck with the marijuana brownies and overpriced Dutch hookers.The movie actually makes torture scenes enjoyable again. (I generally have hated the whole torture motif in modern film for example Rest Stop.) Roth unlike his contemporaries shows the gore without those annoying zooming camera tricks. The leads are unlikable in a fun rather than irritating way (not easy to do) and the film has both a wonderful energy and plentiful surprises.Oh and there is copious amounts of extremely well done gratuitous nudity and sadistic gore. One of the best films of 2005.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Hardly a horror classic, but recommended for its twisted concept","This film's advertising insisted on the fact that it was ""the sickest, bloodiest movie you'll ever see"", as opposed to all the tame, PG-13-rated horror films (most of them being remakes of Japanese shockers) that were being released at the time. According to writer/director Eli Roth, it was time the horror genre got its guts back (both metaphorically and literally). As for that second statement, there's no reason to argue: Hostel is not a film teenagers or the weak of stomach should see. When it comes to the ""sickest, bloodiest"" part, however, it's a whole different story.At first, casual viewers might think they're watching the wrong movie: the film opens with three backpackers coming to Amsterdam. Why they have chosen Amsterdam is quite obvious: what better place if you're looking for sex and drugs? As one of the three, the Icelandic, self-proclaimed ""King of the Swing"" Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson), would say, ""It's f*cking awesome!"". Apparently, though, there's this village outside of Bratislava, in Slovakia, where the girls are even hotter, and particularly willing to sleep with Americans, something that makes Oli's mates, Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson), very eager to try this new place. What seemed to be another version of Eurotrip, however, will soon become a nightmare, as our three unsuspecting protagonists run into something so terrifying few people would be able to imagine it. And this is where the massacre begins. Well, not quite actually.In fact, despite what he promised, Roth doesn't exactly show us everything: we rarely see the acts themselves (which include severed limbs and eyeball torture), as the director thinks the effects of those acts will be scary enough. And as a matter of fact, they are, although it has got more to do with the context Roth has come up with for all that violence. On an entirely conceptual level, Hostel is absolutely brilliant, with a third-act twist so nasty it will make the audience re-evaluate the whole film (a small clue for genre fans: it kind of reminds of The Wicker Man, which is referenced in a sex scene). Shame the director doesn't develop this great idea in a particularly original way, using it merely as an excuse to show us flesh (first half of the movie) and blood (second half), and neither of them in the excessive amount the trailers and posters seemed to promise. Roth certainly knows where to place the camera when filming the most gruesome sequences, but he lacks the genius of filmmakers like Tarantino (who is one of Hostel's executive producers) or Takashi Miike (who appears briefly).Ultimately, Hostel deserves to be seen because of its original concept, although the rest is fairly conventional, and not as extreme and disgusting as they want to make you think.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Your stock is rising Mr Roth,"Hostel.Having seen the trash that was Cabin Fever, I was quite worried that Hostel would be a disappointment, I'm glad to say that on the contrary it wasn't.The film starts off innocent enough, 3 backpackers touring Europe looking for some hedonistic fun (and lots of sex!) and who wouldn't? Being an ex-backpacker myself I can relate to their early experience entirely! One night they meet a dark and mysterious character in Amsterdam who tells them that if they are looking for beautiful girls and lots of them they should head out to a Hostel near Bratislava, which is in Slovakia if you don't know.So they do and after a strange incident with a man on the train they go to the Hostel and start having lots of the kind of fun you might expect.Soon though, things begin to take on a more sinister and very gory turn.Just to warn you, i have seen some very gory films and I actually felt physically sick watching this one.I am impressed with the quality of Roth's film-making here, as in Cabin Fever he uses a slightly skewed take on the horror genre, going for real suspense. Instead of the usual bad guy hunting down the teenagers, there is a real mystery about this film right up until the last few acts.But don't worry, I hear Slovakia really is a lovely place...",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not bad!,"The thing about Hostel that separates it from movies such as Saw and other gross out films is it is built on a premise that could be very real, knowing the fall of the USSR. It is an original idea. I recently saw a Law and Order episode where whole blocks of a city in Russia catered to child prostitution so this is not much of a stretch. The gloomy look of the worn out city captures much of the fallen society it is portraying and it's medieval atmosphere. Those two aspects work great.However what it does wrong is it doesn't take time to make us like the characters headed into the lion's den. I didn't feel anything for any of the suffering characters except for likable Oli, but we don't really experience his pain. Pot smoking, partying teenagers is too much of a cliché and we kind of know where they are headed from square one. Because of that, it loses much of it's impact. The ending escape scene just seemed rushed, contrived and resorts to gross out tactics. This is where Wolf Creek becomes a better film. Wolf Creek went for an unprotected jugular and never let go. Although it resorted to unabashed torture and cringing acts of dominance, torture is never something that should ever be portrayed lightly. This is where Hostel should have went with it's real and horrible subject matter to make it a real classic shocker.Still I recommend this to anyone except those with no aptitude for watching graphic violence depicted on the screen. It's premise could very well be real and the look of the old city of Bratislava is the stuff horror movies are made of.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Truly awesome movie.,"I really don't see any reason for all of these complaints about plot and the subsequent expressions of disappointment...surely you knew what you were going to see! I mean, it's a drug movie, a sex movie, a thriller, and a revenge movie. I think that covers just about everything. And how can anyone say that this movie is about nothing??? It's about American excess and the general European disgust that responds to it. The characters are even better developed than in most horror movies. For the genre, this is a fine effort, delivering everything I hoped to see and plenty I couldn't have imagined pending. The visceral murder and torture, the creative motivations....I remain awe-struck hours later. See this if Wolf Creek disappointed you and you're ready for something extreme and shocking....the audience will respond en masse at the film's every prompting....if you enjoy horror, you can't be disappointed.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Steps the horror genre up a notch,"I'm reviewing the unrated version of Hostel, now out on DVD.First of all, let me say that Lion's Gate, responsible for the film's distribution, has come a long way from the days when it was almost exclusively synonymous with bad B-movies. It has become one of the major distributors of good horror movies that push the envelope, such as the Saw franchise and High Tension, and it could now be said that it's a patron of the genre.Hostel develops an interesting premise and is better seen in ignorance of any plot summaries/background information on the movie. In the style of Asian horror, there is plenty of over-the-top gore, and in the style of campy American horror, there's plenty of nudity, but this doesn't detract from the ability of the director, Eli Roth, to take us to new and ever darker places as the plot thickens, building suspense right up to the gratifying finale.Unlike many horror movies nowadays, it has an ending that provides some closure and does not leave you thinking that a sequel sometime in the near future is inevitable, although IMO this concept could be taken further and the movie ended too soon for me. Then again I'm somewhat jaded when it comes to horror fiction in general, so maybe it's just the right length to not overwhelm non-targeted audiences.Because of the level of entertainment, I have to give this movie a 10 within the genre. It has everything the modern horror fan could want, like good direction, great makeup and special effects, an atmosphere all its own. and a main character that is believable because he's not making the cliché, inane mistakes that most horror leads are scripted to make with the inexplicable notion that this somehow adds to the scare factor.If you are not easily grossed out or offended, I recommend renting or, better yet, buying Hostel. Who knows? You may want to revisit it...P.S. Support the ""WE WANT MORE R-RATED HORROR MOVIES"" campaign. Go buy it or rent it now!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Well, this movie certainly divided the public...","First of all, Eli Roth absolutely loves Takashi Miike and the Japanese horror ""hype"" , so to say. The prime idea for this movie was inspired by Miike's ""Odishon"". These two movies are absolutely not comparable with each other, because ""Odishon"" is very deep, dark, and traumatic piece of cinema. But, can we really say that Roth has done a bad job when doing this movie? I say no. This movie does exactly to the viewer what it should do. Relaxes him completely to the state of being just an ordinary movie, and then... bam! Shock. The last 20-30 minutes of the film is great. Great F/X , great disgusting ideas and environment, gloomy atmosphere, etc. I thought Americans would love this movie best, but it seems i was very, very wrong. To finish this review, i'd like to say that Roth has some really great ideas, and hopefully will convert them to the big screen maybe slightly better. By seeing a lot of junk a long way back, primarily American cinema, this can never be treated as a bad movie. No way.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
the first 'exploitation flick' of the year doesn't strike where it could've,"Eli Roth is a filmmaker I've heard about through the cult film 'Cabin Fever' and his latest film, Hostel, is presented by action-film maestro Quentin Tarantino, and produced by him and horror filmmaker Scott Spiegel. I wondered as the lights went up why Tarantino decided to put his name on the film. I can sort of understand why- as it brings out some grisly violent scenes, with enough gore to pack in his seeming enjoyment for it (see Kill Bill for details)- but also remembered that another film he was involved in, From Dusk Till Dawn, was quite similar. Dawn, also a film where it's sort of two topics converged into one 'exploitation' flick (which Tarantino himself might argue or not, depending on your pov of what's exploitive in the genre), was a much better film, with main characters (one of them played by QT himself) who were also violent, but somehow relatable. Roth's film here doesn't really give much to invest in the characters, and then when the film focuses on its final character's survival, it becomes not so much unbelievable- as I know by some point I SHOULD try to suspend disbelief- as it is empty.I like a horror film to be something that actually gives me suspense, and if it shocks me then to back it up with something in the story, or with the characters, to give it some leverage. The first forty-five minutes or so of 'Hostel' just shows our main characters, Paxton and Josh, living it up in Amsterdam, then taking a tip on another Hostel (or practical prostitution palace) in Bratislava. There's nothing given at all to the character really, except that one is less inhibited than the other at times. Roth tries to add substance by giving the run-down city an almost Third Man feel (i.e. there's curious, dangerous beings all around, particularly children and other undesirables, everyone possibly 'in' on what the main characters aren't). But Roth as a writer isn't much concerned with spending that much time with these guys, unlike Tarantino did with his screenplay ten years back. If there had been perhaps even more set-up, or more scenes showing the two (err three) friends together, there would've been back-up. However Roth is more interested in what comes in the second half of the film.To give credit where credit's due, Roth at least doesn't commit the sins of the filmmakers of, for example, 'Saw'. The cinematography and production design is a full notch above those far lesser, laughably bad films. In the sort of 'exploitation' sense he doesn't screw around with the audience by playing too many guessing games. Like QT, he goes for the torture scenes- and there are a good many few of them- by not always showing it, more of showing the reactions to the violence. And I suppose as a director dealing with such subversive, trashy material like sex (lots), drugs (some), and unmitigated carnage, he does film it without too many gimmicks or stupid flash cuts and such. However, his style, which isn't a horrible one, is lacking due to how the substance is too ambiguous for its own good (I only knew what this whole torture building was for after reading a couple of reviews after the fact) and didn't really keep me on the edge of my seat. If he was looking to make me laugh at times as well, which is good and bad depending on which scenes I might mean, its sometimes at far too inappropriate moments. All of the imposed atmosphere is moot when torture just happens for the sake of it.I know that Roth, unlike someone like Mel Gibson who said his film would be 'good for the soul', doesn't relish in these scenes, and maybe is trying for something gruesome out of the recent slew of ultra-violent Asian flicks ala Fukasaku and Miike. But the wit of those films, albeit quite dark, is too absent here, and after a while one wonders if all of this is more for the filmmakers' benefit than the audience's. Who knows, maybe I can recommend it for a certain quota of the public who are into the take-no-prisoners films like from the 70's (I Spit on Your Grave for example). But it just wasn't for me; after a while even after trying to shut my brain off and enjoy the mindlessness of it all, I got impatient. There's some good stuff in the film, but muddled over by not being able to connect the set-up with the payoff. C+",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Skip this flick,"I can't believe I watched the entire movie. Lets start with the characters, they were wooden, stiff, almost emotionless even when trying to portray fright, horror, etc. I guess the word that may best fit is shallow. The storyline was weak, but, much more could have been done with it. With stronger three dimensional characters and less cliché' the film could have been a whole lot more than just a below average slasher flick, which is all I can really call this movie. The main turn-off for me was that the characters were almost robotic. I can't say this enough, and that in itself ruined the entire film for me. Sure there were a few turns that may not be in an average slasher film and a tiny bit of suspense, but, certainly not worth paying to see in a theater or even a rental. Wait awhile and it'll be on a UPN station late at night. Some of the gore was decent, but, it was far overshadowed by the lack of a strong ensemble cast. Some similar films that this reminds me of in a round-about way are the Freddy movies,and maybe Halloween although at least they had deep characterization and good casting Again, do not waste your hard earned money.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty funny,"I live in Slovakia, I live in Bratislava and I consider this movie being one of the funniest horror comedies ever. I couldn't stop laughing when those guys arrived 'just outside Bratislava'. Police beating up citizens for no apparent reason? Gypsy teen gang terrorizing the city? 80's hits playing at the local disco? Tatra 613 as the best car around here? This 'alternate reality' ruined any promise of terror and fear I could feel from this movie and it ended up with only one scary set.People say this is twisted, depraved and sick movie. Our local posters have tagline 'Try not to vomit watching this'. But to be honest, it's not that gory as one would think. Almost everything takes place just outside frame or someone blocks the view or the movie is cut away just before 'it' happens. After 'Cabin Fever' I would expect more, but let's wait for unrated director's cut and see what happens.There's been a lot of fuss about this movie around here, saying it reflects bad image on Slovakia, but people do not get it's just a movie. In my opinion Eli Roth simply wanted to show different locations and props. If he would have shown Slovakia as it really is, he wouldn't get this image of scary European backwoods where everything is possible and I believe the movie would be a lot less scary for non central European folks. We do have the newest cars, we do have skyscrapers, we don't have gypsies' gangs terrorizing towns but hell, we have the most beautiful girls in the world.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
a good idea gone wrong,"Okay, so, three backpackers (two American, one Icelandic) hear about this sexual paradise in Slovakia: a town full of gorgeous, horny women, who are desperate for male company since all the local men have been killed in the war. Of course, they waste no time getting there, where they discover, of course, that things are not what they seem.The set up is more or less the same as 'The Beach', which is fine. The European locations and the cinematography all seem promising, but the movie falls flat pretty fast and stays there. There are scenes of imaginative gore, there are some beautiful women taking off their shirts, and that's about it. The film completely lacked suspense because we weren't given much of a reason to care about the characters. I found myself completely disengaged. Sure, I'll squirm when you show me someone getting chainsawed, but is that all there is? Increasing gruesome effects and nice camera work does not mean you've got a story. The main characters, who, in theory, we should be hoping will survive all the bloodshed, come off like shallow, annoying frat boys, but not SO annoying that you want them to die, which would at least be some way to connect to the movie.Horror movies should not just be horrifying, but suspenseful as well, offering the audience a reason to think (or yell) 'Don't go in there you idiot!' Instead I found myself wondering if they shot the whole thing in Europe, or did the torture chamber scenes in a US studio.

Nerve-grinding HORROR!,"Director Eli Roth returns to the horror scene with this horrifically shocking and daring film that makes Roth's earlier film, the outrageous Cabin Fever (2003), look like a light-weight thriller!Two American students traveling across Europe fall into the clutches of a sadistic madman and his colleagues who make a business out of violently torturing people.Completely merciless in its brutality and tension, Hostel is Roth's most mature film thus far. Roth's story is well-written with a great set-up and a plot that builds suspense and spirals into madness and extreme violence. To say it's a film that's gripping and edgy is a real understatement! The gore FX are as bloody as can be, producing plenty of truly disturbing (if not downright sickening) images. I couldn't imagine what would have been cut from this film to get an R rating. This is what we horror fans have come to expect from Eli Roth though, and he more than delivers the horrific goods in this film, he pushes the envelope plenty. Roth also adds a strong sense of the erotic, adding lots of nudity. All the while, Roth does excellent direction with great locations, atmosphere, and well-done intensity. Kudos also go to the great soundtrack of European rock songs.The cast is perfectly good, and often rather bold. The best of them are Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson as the ill-fated American youths.Once again Eli Roth has delivered excellent old-school horror that pulls out all the stops and gives us horror fans the strong stuff that we need!

Some of the scenarios were just laugh-out-loud funny. The acting was horrible. I'm a Jay Hernandez fan and can't believe he did this movie.

Is it possible that Eli Roth is the most misunderstood/underrated director of this decade?,"This movie is a more than great one for several reasons. It's not also a good refreshing and original horror movie but also a great, subtle social commentary.Just think about it. Every horror element of horror movies of the past two decades are present here. Hot girls, lots of sex and nudity, graphic horror and a murderous psychopathic villain. Everything is made out extra large and is prominently present here in this movie, with as a result that it becomes almost a parody on these sort of other recent horror-flicks. Watching this movie really made me realize that Eli Roth understands the genre and sees what is wrong with it these days. He's a horror-fan that also happens to direct movies himself. Especially the first halve of the movie is mostly a parody. It's filled with nudity and sex and really feels over-the-top all. It's also filled with some great humor.Yet this movie is also so much more than just reflection on horror movies of the past 2 decades. It's also a great social commentary. The Americans are portrayed as ignorant testosterone driven persons who are willing to travel halve over the world just to have sex and they also see the world through their own ignorant narrow minded eyes. For instance Amsterdam is filled with willing-girls at about basically every corner and all the city has to offer are coffee-shops. And everyone in Slovakia is poor and does literally everything for money and the country itself is gritty, cold, gray, boring and filled with old fashioned use objects such as cars, televisions and clothing, like time has stopped there during the cold war. And one of the torturers is OF COURSE a German. Some people call it racist but I see it as a great and perhaps even brilliant, subtle brought statement, made by Eli Roth. He shows how ignorant most Americans are about the world around them, by showing us the world through the eyes of the two main American characters. Everything is cliché filled and stereotypical but with a purpose. Not sure if it was done on purpose that every Dutch characters speaks German in this movie. I think it had more to do with budget reasons. It's easier to let an actor learn to speak German than Dutch. Still it feels pretty weird, since Quentin Tarantino, who was involved with this movie and who lived and worked in Amsterdam for a couple of years and always puts some Dutch elements into his movies (also in this one obviously), didn't pointed this out to Roth.It's also funny to see how most people call this movie a predictable one. If there is a refreshingly original horror movie of the past few years, than it's ""Hostel"". You don't know who is the killer(s) and why and how things are happening, until like the last 30 minutes when everything becomes FULLY COMPLETELY clear. The movie goes in several directions at times and than suddenly turns the other way around. For instance the movie begins as a tripping, humor filled B-movie, that you can hardly take serious. But after that the movie suddenly becomes darker and mysterious and in the end it also becomes gory. The movie and its style go into several directions at times and the movie takes some great twist and turns. It fools the audience a couple of times. For instance who didn't thought that when they went into the 'torture museum' the main characters would get stuck there and the rest of the movie would be set in there. Or how about it that it's implied several times in the movie that one of the main characters is a homosexual. Nothing is really done with it in the movie but it's a great daring and subtle touch to make the main character look extra vulnerable and sensible. It was not necessary for Roth to put it in the movie, since nothing is done with it in the story but it's obviously put in there to fool us and makes us think that the movie is heading into a different direction with this extra added element.The movie gets graphic but not until the end, when the movie fully turns into an horror movie. The movie might not be as gory and graphic as expected but it leaves a lot up to your own imagination. But still there are a couple of straight-forward graphic sequences, which are certainly not just for everyone.The movie is fairly cheap looking which certainly does also add to the unique feeling and atmosphere of the movie. It's style is certainly unique. Although this movie is mostly a horror one, it never looses its sense of humor and is filled with humorous comical situations, dialog and whatever more. It makes ""Hostel"" above all an entertaining and amusing one to watch, even though it certainly also gets heavy in the end.Quentin Tarantino calls Eli Roth 'the future of horror' for a very good reason. If there is one person who can bring back the horror-genre back to its roots and to what they were intended to be at the first place, it's Eli Roth. Simple, straight-forward and without a complicated or sensible plot. Hopefully in the next few years more people start to see this and shall this also inspire other directors and movie makers.Perhaps you have to be familiar with the horror-genre and its movies of the last 2 decades and '70's and perhaps even older, to fully see and understand this movie the way Eli Roth intended us to see it. It's a movie that will most definitely please the fans of the genre, while most casual viewers might probably find this movie nothing more than a formulaic horror movie, with a simple story and just 'don't get' what is so special about it. (also hence the low rating (5.8) here at the moment.)9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
What the hell,I would like to say that as Eli Roth has been annointed the new face of horror I believe he has a long way to go. He has brought back exploitation movies but find myself feeling like I am watching more along the line of snuff films while watching them. He may like this feeling but I would like to see what he could do with more psychological material. These are the true forms of horror. The movies that make you hind under your covers when you get home rather than make you sick to your stomach while you watch it. Wes Craven looked into this with Red Eye going from chop and crop cinema to a thriller. I think there is room for both forms. I can appreciate the gratuity but it takes too long for the story to get going. Basically this is a fifteen minute porn fest with an hour of introduction.,1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good gore flick,"This is a great and entertaining gore movie.Although I believe the idea is great, you can expect some clichés and predictable scenes.The plot is simple. Two American young guys traveling through Europe making friends, having fun, sex and problems... They will be surprised when arrive in Bratislava searching for lots of sex.The performances are down to earth and you can imagine yourself in a situation similar to theirs. The basement where the slaughter occurs is perfect for those scenes and it's really macabre.Basically, a pleasing movie to watch with your friends in the dark, late at night.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
i am pretty disgusted,"OK, first of all, i haven't seen this movie yet (not because we don't have a TV in my country) but i saw trailer and have already read plenty of reviews. I am very disgusted and disappointed of Mr. Tarrantino, and how they present my country. I lived one year in US and i know that American people don't know much about Europe, not even about tiny country like Slovakia. I respect that, nobody is perfect. On the other side I know very well that Americans are most naive (at least teenagers) people in the world, and for sure, according to some stupid movie, they will make picture of whole country. Well, i don't understand these 6 things: 1) why the story could not be based in ""virtuall"" country like in ""The Terminal"" with Tom Hanks for example, country called Krakotzia (with Russian accent) 2) director apologize to Island's minister of foreign affairs, cause he pictured Islanders as an alcoholics and sexual addictive assholes...but he doesn't care about Slovakia (he probably even wasn't there) 3) why mostly of the movie was made in Czech republic, with Czech speaking people, Czech headlines, traffic signs, etc. (everything was mostly in Czech language, BTW. great new for many of you, Czechoslovakia was separated in 1993 - 13 years go) 4)we do have TVs (even colored), internet, electricity, we have had already own astronaut in space, mostly students can speak more than one language (in contrast with you), mostly students traveled across US and saw more than average American citizen saw from his own country 5) All of you are very welcome to Slovakia, so you can convince yourself, how is this nation beautiful with friendly, peaceful people and very progressive economy 6)I understand that even negative publicity is sometimes good publicity, but anyway I am disgusted...",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Actually not as bad as it sounds,"This isn't a work of art but it is not intended to be. It is a decent horror flick on the creepy side and horror fans would enjoy it if they tried. But i do have to admit it isn't perfect. I'll come to that later.Lets start with the good. The acting was very decent for a horror slasher. The three actors that played the backpackers all convinced me that they were young and in need of a good time. They also showed fear as they were getting tortured which made me feel how they were feeling. Eli Roth directed the film very well and he does have some talent which shows his passion for horror films and I do have faith that he may become the next George Romero. The storyline did keep me hooked as Paxton was trying to get away from the villains.Now for the bad, most of the gore scenes were quite unnecessary. They didn't all need to be there and it seemed that it as there just to keep the film in budget. It was a pretty sick film and is not for the kids to watch. The goriest part was the eye gouging part. If you don't mind that part than you will be fine. The film as also split in two half's. The first half was a softcore porno and the second half was a gorefest. The sex scenes were very erotic and the girls were all very sexy but like the gore, not all of them were necessary.Overall this is a great ""bad movie"" with some entertaining scenes of gore and erotic sex that twisted minds will love. But beware its not for everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I Hated Hostel,"I am a huge fan of gory movies, I even enjoyed Cabin Fever, but this movie was a waste of time, effort and money. I left after an hour, not all due to the movie, theater had messed up the sound, stopped the projector to ""fix"" it, but I thought the movie was pointless, first half, was porn, with no reason, and the second half was gore, and violence, with no development, no exposition. I know the elements would prob have tied up in the last act, but I had no desire to see them.What story there is is painfully signposted, Dutch Businessman, and what story exposition there is is painful and drawn out, first entry into the ""exhibition"".I really disliked this film, despite all of the correct elements, the sfx make up was good, the atmosphere was interesting, and the premise I had figured out was good, but the storytelling was clunky, and was poorly executed.I really would not be in a rush to see another Eli Roth movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good time.,"As many people would like to believe, That Hostel was just a skin and torture exploitation film, I have these things to say. Hostel is the perfect horror movie, not because of some sick twisted, perverse and demented fantasy that is buried somewhere deep in my brain, but because it actually sacred me to the point of wanting to cry. Many regard all horror films the same way they would regard most soft core porn, as all the same. A slight plot an inevitable ending and a sense that as the story closes that you knew everything that was going to happen before it did. The ending is logical and everyone knew that someone was getting laid. With most horror films there is a protagonist that has in some way a purpose, i.e. a satanic ritual that needs to have ten blond virgins blood, a crazy man has been infected by the soul of a long dead serial killer. Someone is going to kill, torment, or bring violence to someone in the movie based upon a set of criteria. Someone wants to kill someone else for some reason. That is not true of Hostel, and the reason it frightened me so much.In the movie three friends travel to the Slovakian border and look for a good time filled with weed, women, and as much booze as they can drink. They find such a place in an upscale hostel, and enjoy themselves. This is the part many like to mention as the skin flick part, where are unsuspecting trio offers themselves to a gaggle of exciting new women who they enjoy very much. But all this dose is set up the remainder of the story. When we sat down in the theater when we put in our DVD, we all knew that each of the main characters or at least some were going to be tortured to death in some horrible and unimaginable way that would be shown to us in full color on our own t.v.'s or brought in front by the miracle of cellulose photography. It was intentional to set us up, to remind us that each of these young people was going to meet some horrible end, and to set us up for the remainder of the movie. It takes a long time to get to the torture and I felt almost expectant, every corner every turn having some unspeakable evil waiting around it, hiding in the shadows, waiting to strike. The atmosphere ready we are invited to take pleasure in their deaths by their captors or to sympathize with their plight. The thing I think that destroyed this movie for so many people was that there was no reason for killing them, just because some sick old men wanted to. People who kill others in the world don't necessarily do it with purpose in mind and the most brutal people on the planet are remembered as the ones who took the most pleasure out of others deaths simply because they were there. If people would own up to the idea that this is not so far fetched as Saw, or as real as Wolf Creek I think more people would enjoy this movie for its suspense its tension, and its horrific premise that there are those willing to do anything for a good time.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
true about Slovakia,"I think that Americans should realize that the whole movie shows untrue picture of Slovakia,because in reality a living standard there is much higher and you will certainly not meet there children begging for chewing-gums. The village shown in the movie is not Bratislava, but a small village from Czech republic. The cars in movie are not used for several years there. In average you can see on roads cars like BMW,Mercedes,Skoda,Opel and a lot of other good European cars. The girls are in average nice but they will certainly not do anything for money as it is presented in movie.And in one scene, there are Slovak policemen batonning some civilian. This is absolutely absurd. Something like that is not possible in Slovakia, because Slovakia is democracy and member of European union.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Eurotrip 2 ( enjoy ),"WOW WOW WOW !!!This movie truly kicked Eurotrip in the nuts. Jesus. Let me say something. I hate movies like Eurotrip, because I'm aware that they are cheap and stupid, but they're still making me laugh.Back to Hostel. Somehow this movie comes to us like From Dusk Till Dawn, only this time Tarantino is not so much involved. In the beginning is nice and then boom: a lot of blood, and gore. Do not expect some typical Tarantino script or cut scenes ( one or two in the whole movie ) . This movie have other purposes, like kicking in the nuts the teen movies. This was a hit back. This movie made me cry of happiness. Hell they should have call it Eurotrip 2, just for fun. Although it does not deserve an 8 for the acting, and the feeling, and etc. . This 8/10 from me ( and I could have give it 10 very easy ) is just because...Now let's see some connections with PULP FICTION.Amsterdam. Well, in Pulp Fiction Travolta explains to Jackson how free Amsterdam and Europe are. All the legal s**ts...and it's funny cause it does not make any sense, for that they have very much freedom in America too ( they where gangsters remember? ). Well I'm from Europe, I know what they where talking about, but there are guys out there who got confused. Watch this movie. This is what Travolta was talking about.And now the big connection. Europe is no such different from America. We got our psychos, they got theirs. The only difference is the perspective. This movie took the scene from Pulp Fiction ( the one from the basement ) to another level ( it does not have to be one up, just another level, an European one ).And another thing. This movie is not an horror one. It does not have the classical tension of an good horror movie ( now-days they call Final Destination an horror movie. How low can we go ?) There where just so many movies about Europe and how beautiful and romantic is, that someone had to make a stand. This is the one: Hostel. ( it's like killing 50 Cent and raping Shakira with no philosophical intend ).",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A moral core inside a violent & vulgar nutshell !!,"On behalf of the cast, Eli Roth & the rest of the crew, I would like to apologize to the people who were not satisfied with the intellectual content of this movie.

truly horrible movie depicting the ugly side of man (sic),"I hated this movie, why would anyone want to make this film, it only showed the most horrible side of humans without the slightest evidence of reflexivity. Why does Tarantino insist on producing films which constantly link sex to horrific violence no not even sex just the explicit objectification of women. where was the moral of the story- uh don't go to Europe because they are all crazed money grabbing half wits.the representation of men was equally worrying, the only half decent male got killed off early on with some pseudo comment about a 'new man' type. made me want to go to film theory classes just so i can try to learn why such horrifically themed films are made",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

I enjoyed the acting, hernandez, richardson and gudjonneson all did well. Other actors were good and Id like to beleive that kana deserved a lot better.

My two cents on a cheap thriller,"I was quite disappointed by the time I got to the end of this movie. I agree with the user who commented before me, (Todd Koerner from Hermosa Beach) with his analogy ""It certainly felt like it hit all the necessary marks, from nudity and dismemberment to bloody revenge, but at the conclusion, it just felt like eating cotton candy - no real nutritional value, just a sense that I had satisfied some of my prurient appetite without any logical payoff."".I agree to a point. I almost think that after all the hype there would have been more to it. A quirk or a twist would have been good, but it turned from a somewhat creepy horror movie into an actually laughable ending. The movie wasn't even scary. I don't get quote scared unquote at movies, but I appreciate the horror of it. But this one was off the deep end. No explanation, no reason. Think of it along the same lines as Jeepers Creepers, only with a bit more nudity and gore. I wouldn't say DON'T watch this movie, but I wouldn't advise going to the theater and spending too much on it.This movie is a rental for sure. Of course with the mostly brain dead young adults in this day and age, I'm sure it will be classified as ""incredibly horrific"" and the such, but frankly I'm disappointed that Quentin Tarantino would put his name on it just to make money. To be frank, I only paid money to go see it because I was and am a big fan of Tarantino and of his mentor, Robert Rodriguez. Hope to hear some more comments and reviews of this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Read Goulet's Review,"This movie was by far one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen. Aside from the shock value, this movie had absolutely nothing to offer. The only quality of the film that superseded the unnecessarily gruesome bloodshed... which was more nauseating than scary... is the unnecessarily mindless plot line. If you're looking for a psychological thriller that leaves you awake for days obsessing over the horrific details you witnessed the night you went to the movies, don't see this film. If you're looking for a horror movie that leaves you ready to vomit and unsure why the once god-like Quentin Tarrantino ever tried a career in film, go ahead and check it out... but I suggest you don't waste your money.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Under-rated Experience!!!,"When asking about ""Hostel"", several persons suggested i shouldn't waste time/money on it. When some friends bought it, i asked whether i could borrow it. About 120(minutes)of watching, i realized why others thought it was a waste. There wasn't enough there to complete the horror experience, this movie could've been, that horror-movie-goers paid admissions to see. However, ""Hostel"" should've earned much more appreciation than what people were giving it. The center idea around the movie was probably to be sickening, with its gruesome torture, and literally shock you, in this ""Hostel"" highly succeeded, keeping me looking over my shoulder at times throughout the night. The whole of the movie is not nessecarly based on torture though, accutaly its more of a pornographic movie, focusing 3/4 of the movie on the hawt women, which was disappointing, when you're expecting scares, rather than orgasms. The language barrier between the Americans, Germans, Iceland, Etc. is another positive remark ""Hostel"" offers, leaving movie-goers to focus on expressions/emotion to understand the basics of what someone is saying. The characters were fantastic, except there wasn't enough sympathy, so while their being tortured you'll not be saddened by the character, but by the disturbing methods used to torture. Sets/Props were always believable, while sets never left you questioning. Overall, an exhilarating experience, that'll leave horror fans craving more! 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why make this film?,"Or why watch it?I'll keep it short and sweet, as the actress said to the bishop.This is a thoroughly unpleasant film and anyone who gets real pleasure out of watching the torture scenes needs professional help, or locking up in an asylum.I don't see the point of the film, or what its message is, and it is frightening to think that this sort of thing is going on in the world, as it probably is.Having said all that, I think the film is quite reasonably well made, well directed, and the actors play their parts well, including the baddies, and it is certainly a cut (if you'll excuse the pun) above the average mindless slasher movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
What a vile piece of garbage!,"And to think I thought that Cabin Fever was a piece of garbage! Hostel was worse. In fact, I'll list it as one of the worst 'horror' films I've ever seen. The story stunk, the characters were unlikable boors - the typical 'ugly' Americans. In fact, the only one who I even liked was Oly. The brutality in it was a descendant of the crummy and overrated Last House on the Left, and unfortunately since Quentin Tarantino, obviously no judge of talent is Roth's 'mentor', I'm sure that more garbage will be coming from this 'director'. Amazing that with all the great novels out there, waiting to be adapted, crap like this gets the money to be made. Simply amazing. I'll put this in the ""SAW"" category of too dumb to ever see again. I'd say more, but that would lead to spoilers, and I wouldn't want to do that to someone who might actually want to see this crapfest. Want to see a good or great horror film?

"nice movie, but could have been so much better","Saw this movie yesterday and I was disappointed I must say. I'd heard a lot about how good this movie was from friends and had built up some expectations that was not answered upon. the idea of the movie is nice but personally i think it was too shallowly told. the first part is no horror and the second part is gory but without the right feeling. I didn't feel the pain going through my spine when people was tortured and even the nicest moments wasn't close to none of the ""saw""-movies I think. don't get me totally wrong now. I think the movie is a nice piece of craftsmanship and the actors are doing a good job, but there's something missing. if you've seen movies containing torture-scenes like in ""ichi- the killer"", ""old boy"" or ""saw"" for example, I tell you this movie is not close. but if you're out for an entertaining and different horror-movie, this is still way way better then all the collage-horror-films and other standard horror-films. so, as conclusion, I would say that you definitely should see this movie, but keep your high expectations at bay..peace",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Stay Away...,"MY TAKE: This is simply one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. I haven't actually read many of the user comments, but I am sure that most reinforce my own thoughts. I went to see the movie because my girlfriend told me that it had something to do with Tarantino. It's clear that this is exactly the sort of response that the marketing execs were counting on. However, I was aware of his previous ""presentations"" of other films. Thus, it was with a degree of caution that I went to this one. Well, even with low expectations, I was amazed by the horrible smut that was peddled as a film. It basically combines the plot of ""EuroTrip"" with the content of soft core pornography and a little of the newer ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" thrown in at the end for gross out effect.MY ADVICE: Stay away from this one; it is a true waste of your time despite the deceiving previews. Of course, some people (""Cabin Fever"" fans) like it, which is clear from it's average rating on this site. In fact, to my surprise there was actually some applause in the theater at the end of the film (mostly from horny 15 year old guys who somehow got in). If you want proof that the movie polarizes it's audience, look at the distribution for the ratings, most either love it or hate it. I hate it, and according to the stats there is a 17.5% probability that you will too (keep in mind most sane people will never see this movie so that number is quite low). Well, you've been warned.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Elite HuntingHostel,"I have to applaud writer/director Eli Roth for what he has created in Hostel. To me this film is not as much a horror flick as a thriller told with all the gruesome brutality intact. There are no scares, no haunting music crescendoing, and no jump in your seat moments that we expect from the genre. Yes, we get blood and gore and uncut severing of body parts, the film is definitely not for the squeamish, however, Roth tells it in such a way that we as an audience are involved and invested in these characters. We saw the torture in the previews and think this is what the movie will be in totality, when instead we are shown a couple of kids backpacking through Europe before grad school. These kids roam free until their better judgment lead them to their destruction.Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson are perfectly cast. Hernandez's Paxton is ready for a good time, or as many as he can with as many different women possible; Richardson's Josh, on the other hand, has just broken up with his girlfriend and is reluctant to join in the fun. His nervousness is portrayed realistically and you can believe these two guys are old friends and have each other's backs. They even meet a horny Icelander Oli played with comic genius by Eythor Gudjonsson. He is a kindred spirit, although probably a decade older than the boys, and the three are having a blast in Europe when the suggestion of perfect, sex-crazed girls in Slovakia is dropped into their consciousness. They continue their trek east and all goes to plan, meeting two vixens, including the gorgeous, Monica Bellucci lookalike, Barbara Nedeljakova, who show them a good time. A good time, that is, until Oli goes missing and hell begins.Eli Roth has woven a suspenseful yarn that totally came out of left field. He shows us a more serious take on a premise like the comedy EuroTrip for the first forty or so minutes of a ninety-minute film. We know what is going to happen, and yet he teases us by giving the exact opposite to the gore we have come to see. This tactic allows us to settle in and get to know our protagonists, learn their backgrounds and motives. The attention to detail here makes what happens in the second and final act that much more visceral. These are innocents roped into an underground game of deception and profit. They don't deserve what is about to happen and we root for them that much more. Each small bit of exposition into their lives also pays dividends later on to help us cope with some of the things they do. Remember the memory shared by Jay Hernandez about a drowning girl from his past. This story helps setup why he does what he does towards the end. Old horror rules don't apply here, people don't act stupid and run towards the killers; they have distinct reasons for what they do and the entire film is carefully orchestrated as such.Other reasons to see the film include actor Jan Vlasák as the Dutch businessman our leads encounter on their journey east. He has the intellectual creepiness his character needs to be a success. The mannerisms and involuntary shake of the hands add substance and layers to a role that isn't explained as much as the others. Each action of his speaks louder than any words could. Also, the cinematography is worth watching on its own. We are treated viscerally by grimy, disease-infested scenery shrouded in darkness. Roth uses abstract angles throughout the film keeping the audience off-kilter and prone, so that the assault has the utmost impact. More than visuals, though, is the aural quality of many scenes. On multiple occasions we are stopped on static framing while the sounds of what's about to happen fill your ears. If you feel any fear during this movie it's in the anticipation perfectly laid forth by the sound preceding every act seen, as with thunder being followed by lightning.Hostel has everything you could want in a horror/thriller. The suspense is heavy and never overplayed to cause boredom from the waiting. I think this fact might actually hurt the planned sequel being written now by Roth. Hopefully the fact that he is continuing the story at the exact point the first ended will help in getting the audience involved right away; not having the same long period of setup before the payoff, making it essentially the same movie with different characters. Either way, count me in for part two. Any movie that includes great songs like the Sneakerpimps' How Do and pop culture cameos like horror-maestro Takashi Miike is good in my book.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disturbing,"I happened to tune into the Sci-Fi channel yesterday and the movie Hostel was on. I never saw the film before and only caught the last 15 minutes or so. I'm not into gory movies but nonetheless, I felt I had to comment. What is it with all the gore in movies today? Are we really that violent a species that enjoys watching people being tortured, maimed and killed? I just don't understand what pleasure anyone can get out of that, but apparently these movies are popular with a certain sect of our society. I find it disturbing that teens and even children would watch these particular kinds of movies and get some sort of thrill out of it. Sorry, I just don't get it or find them at all entertaining. In fact, they sicken me. I read and see enough violence in the news everyday and wonder why.",,Anonymous,Horror
Eli Roth torture porn,"College guys Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson) are traveling in Europe with Icelandic friend Óli. In Amsterdam, they are told about a hostel in Slovakia where they find beautiful women. Their friend Óli is killed but the guys get a text that he has gone home. They meet Kana whose friend Yuki has disappeared as well. Josh gets killed and Paxton goes searching for him. He's taken to an industrial plant where rich people pay to kill.There isn't much more here than torture porn. Eli sometimes adds a few touches like the Bubble Gum gang. That's a bit surreal. However it doesn't do much that is truly surprising. If there's a choice between logic and grotesque, the movie chooses grotesque every time. Of course Paxton has to cut out Kana's dangling eye even if it makes no sense. Jay Hernandez is good enough. Usually horror uses scream queens but this one uses guys.

Good but not great...,"After waiting for some time with much anticipation for the Tarantino/Roth horror film, ""Hostel"" finally made it's way to my local cinema. After an assembly of ridiculously bad horror previews, the film finally came up and I eased back in my chair. The film's first half or so was albeit, not horror in any way shape or form, and more so was a closer relative to a National Lampoon sex romp. The three main actors were thankfully enough, good at who and what they were trying to emulate: horny, college grads who want sex and drugs...but they were funny and occasionally kind of down to earth.Eli Roth did a fair job of setting up the story, though i felt it took a little long for a horror film. As great a storyteller Miike is, and as much as Roth adores him, I would've figured the film to have an overall creepy quality, but alas no. The music was well done, especially when the horror comes crashing in, and the direction was pretty good, showing us a good amount of gore, and then a good amount for us to leave to our sick imaginations.My only complaint about the film was the tiresome nudity and sex, teens will love it, as will college students, but it gets old fast. I never knew Roth relied on such frivolities to make a film move along, then again ""Cabin Fever"" did the exact same thing.The latter half of the film was very good, and occasionally bordered on the awesome. I wish there was more gore, though there was some, and I was hoping to get more glimpses into the other rooms that lined the slaughterhouse. The best scenes were easily inside this ""factory"" and if the whole movie was set up faster for more time inside the ""farm,"" this movie would've been great, and not just good.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A truly sick movie,"First of all, this movie made me wanna go to Amsterdam. All the fun seems to happen there. But it seems to be kind of fun that you need money to. Let's get serious. The set-up for this film is fascinating: It's realistic. The actors/directing are bad, but that doesn't ruin anything, as a matter of fact that fits to this kind of film. Also the photography seems a little pretentiously ""artistic"" or ""raw"", but that's also the usual standard in new movies. The ""after-effects"" (coloring etc.) added to the pictures are also really ugly. (The pretentiousness brings to my mind Steven Soderberg, especially ""Traffic"".) It seems like no-one in the film crews today has any kind of artistic interests, or anything they want to say or do. They just do their job without thinking anything. Actually it's an ugly film in every way; Also the people and the portrayals of the human relations (and of course the ""human condition"") are quite cynical. For example: All the women in this movie are brainless prostitutes. At least to me it remains unclear if the director wants to say something or not. The script is already so bad that I think no director could do a good movie of it. Or even want to try. It's a mystery to me why make movies (with millions and millions of dollars) without the slightest idea, point or inspiration, or any need to do something. Or maybe they just have to make up some work for the thousands of people who work in the film industry. The factories has to keep rolling, even if no-one would need their products. There is no life in this movie. I don't know is this movie supposed to be exciting or scary? The characters are so artificial and plastic that I cannot relate to them as human beings. I'm not interested at all what happens to them.A funny idea came to me while watching this film: Fassbinder could have done this. It has the same kind of overall feeling of total negativity and nihilism that he had in his films (except ""Angst essen seele auf"" maybe). Of course Fassbinder's movie wouldn't have included this many ""exciting"" or ""entertaining"" plot turns or events, and it would have been visually even uglier than this. This is one of the most disturbed movies I've seen; It doesn't have any humor or balance (which for example all the ""gore"" of horror movies I've seen do have), only total darkness and pessimism. I'm not the biggest fans of Tarantino, but I noticed that he has produced this film (and they try to sell it with his name for no doubt). I really wonder why he wants to support this kind of ****. He could put his money on charity or something. Or give them to me.If you want to see a movie that takes place in a hotel or a hostel, see ""Hotel Rhuanda"" instead.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hostle Goers Beware,"This was an excellent movie. Anyone who says different either has a poor imagination or lacks the capacity of fear. Having travelled a lot when I was younger and not for one second thought I was ever in any danger... this film is the nightmare of parents everywhere.The flick doesn't take itself too seriously, and as far as I'm concerned beautiful women in any medium are always welcome (though they do form part of the 'honeypot trap' plot).Don't take your lass to watch this, or get it out for a 'family' viewing.

Instead all the viewer gets is a good hour of torture depictions guaranteed to make your stomach quell for no reason. Seriously, your money would be better spent on paying a homeless person to punch you in the stomach for the same effect.

A Fresh Breath of Air in an Otherwise Stale Genre,"Hostel is the perfect film for fans of the Horror scene in a time where a seemingly endless line-up of shoddy horror films continue to dilute the genre as a whole.What starts off as appearing to be another generic ""fish out of water"" and ""road trip"" story premise, Hostel proves itself by offering something morea feasible and intriguing plot, even if it takes the entire length of the film to reach it.In the former half of the film, there is a questionable level of nudity even with an ""R"" rating, whereas the latter half provides the same elevated level of subjective material, but in a more tasteful and grotesquely satisfying manner.The characters, while providing a sufficient, yet inconsistent level of solid acting, lack the development that would have made the film truly stellar. Only one of the three protagonists is easily identifiable for the viewer, yet I still question Eli Roth's choice to turn a potentially memorable character into another bland horror film compilation of shallow human emotions. What is noteworthy regarding the characters however is the apparent level of moral development, which allots the viewer ample forgiveness for the initial shallow character introduction.Where this film does excel is its ability to convey emotions that are the product of well-planned and well-paced story progression. Rather than succumbing to sudden plot twists to proved a story that ultimately leaves the viewer with little to no afterthought, intrinsic details carefully placed into every scene progress the film at an even pace. As a result, the on-screen character's emotions are implanted into the viewer's minds, which makes for an unprecedented feeling of insecurity and helplessness in the horror genre.The most surprising aspect of the film is the lack of any final plot twist which has become commonplace in the horror genre. This surprise is strongly welcomed and really concludes the formerly lacking story well. My only gripe regarding the story is that there really isn't one until just before the credits roll.While there are aspects of this film that could use some fine tuning, the lasting result is a much-needed level of satisfaction for horror fans. Those with weak stomachs are advised to stay clear of this movie, but even casual fans of the genre should check it out.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Underrated,"The excess of negative reviews here is, in this case, a reflection of how well this movie works. It's one of the few recent American movies that qualifies as real horror. The worst possibility comes to fruition, every prejudice and suspicion manifesting as far worse than the protagonists could imagine. This is what horror does best - bring one's darkest fears to life.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hostel is for losers and psychopaths,Anyone who enjoys or appreciates this movie in any way should have their heads examined and fast. Quintin Terrantino should be ashamed of himself for having anything to do with this piece of complete garbage. Its obvious that this movie's only purpose is to continue to chip away at the Amercian public's perception of torture. So maybe we can acquire a taste for torture. Let us not forget that the men who hold the keys to the American government are in fact pro-torture as PUBLIC policy.Terrantino should be feeling real shame for aiding these psychos in achieving part of their messed up agenda: public torture policies.Read 1984 folks.

"Not exceptional, but better than average, with an homage to original TCM","I recently saw the unrated DVD version, and the main difference seems to be that the DVD has an excessive use of the F word, which is rather distracting and unnecessary. Generally this is just as good as Cabin Fever, Roth's initial film, and very similar in style, not subject. The nice thing about Roth's films is the time he spends with what seem fairly ordinary or mundane activities of the characters, behaving in mostly superficial fashion, but there is actually more to this behavior within the development of the plot. For one thing, these mundane activities are later shown to be paramount to the scenes of horror that are to come. Also, they allow the characters to behave as most people actually do, which is to maintain a fairly superficial persona except amongst the closest of friends and family, until in here when faced with their impending death. The sex in the film is always non-personal, and this is a precursor for the murder-club. Within this framework is a horror film that is grisly and gory enough to satisfy most of the gore-fans who don't care about plot, though obviously not all judging from the comments stating that the film took too long to get to the scenes of terror. This is actually a nice combination of American styled horror films and European Giallo terror, just as Cabin Fever was, and has a satisfying revenge-type ending. I will not divulge the 1973 Texas Chainsaw Massacre homage, but it will be obvious to those who know the original TCM and is quite enjoyable.",,Anonymous,Horror
brutal(and not in the good way),"Hi I just wanted to say that this was not a good movie. The nudity is as gratuitous as any Freddy or Jason movie, while the humour is not the cheese found in those types of horror movies its only because this movie starts out like Eurotrip, so no one liners just one sex joke after another followed by an ass in the face. Then the second half being the horror film to be relived in my nightmares, or not. I went into this movie thinking its going to insanely violent, when I would say its probably not the most violent movie I have seen. Now combine that with the lack of even an attempt for a interesting storyline and you find yourself going, alright hit me with your best shot Eli, the shot in this case being a vomit inducing tortue scene, which unfortunately never really came. Now maybe I am being harsh but I just thought it was pure trash and I was pretty well just waiting for it to end, and not because I was grossed.

In this age of overpaid corporate assholes, I can believe that they soon are bored with spending money on $400 cigars and expensive liquor and seek out perversions such as this.The actual torture wasn't as bad as I expected it to be, but the horror was absolutely brilliant. Eli Roth has established himself as a director of horror. The last 30 minutes was so carefully crafted that it stand well above anything I have ever seen.And, wow, a cameo by Takashi Miike, the director of Ichi the Killer and Graveyard of Honor.The only person I recognized was Rick Hoffman.

What a waste of 10 bucks...,"Lions Gate Films is starting to become known as the gore production company, and with good reason. However, this movie is over-hyped and under-developed. The story is so hokey and predictable, you never once connect with any of the characters, it starts as a porn movie and then turns into a snuff film. Personally, I'm not complaining so much about the fact that there was nudity. I'm not going to lie. I'm a guy, I like boobs just as much as the next guy.

And once the humor dies off (Which'll be when you least expect it), you better hold on for dear life because this movie gets wild! Eli Roth is probably one of the most promising horror directors in the business right now because he's never too playful and never too serious about his movies and I have to say Hostel is one of his shining acheivements.

Overrated,"The plot = three friends backpacking through Europe and when they hear that Bratislava is full of horny chicks, they immediately pack their bags and jump aboard the train. Well, what they've heard is all true, but what no one told them was that a company in Bratislava makes a living by kidnapping tourists and letting their clients kill them for a price. The three friends soon find themselves in some very difficult situations to say the least.After reading all the stuff about this movie, and seeing trailers and pictures on the Internet and magazines and ended up #1 at the box office and became a smash hit, so I was expecting something brilliant, violent brutal and gory in the same vein as Saw, probably made because Saw became a surprise box office hit and the film makers wanted to quickly cash in on the ongoing craze.But in My opinion Hostel is overrated, yes it's violent and gory but to my feelings are mixed, it's an okay movie but it's not something I would watch time and time again. And what gets on my nerves is that a lot of horror movies that come out these days say they're based on true events, which I think is complete ballocks.The three friends play they're parts well but none stand out for me to be honest. Hostal is a good movie but not great, and it's great that they've made gory horror movies mainstream, because for gore I revert to old Italian horror movies in which none of my friends ever heard off, saw I'm glad this and other movies like this have paved a way into a new wave of horror. Plus there are some pretty gruesome gory bits in which I won't go into much detail about, but it's definitely not for the faint hearted.All in all Hostel is a good movie, It just isn't as gory as it is hyped up to be.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
low budget: no time for research,"Finally, I gave in and went to see Hostel, because it kept being referred to in daily conversation of the young and reckless. Now I know why I usually do not go to see light pieces like this one. It is because however intriguing the first sequels might be, after a few minutes the usual problems surface and keep bugging you even until after the end. Loose plots, fact-defying situations and conversations, and wrongfully chosen backdrops all boost the impression that low-budget also resulted in not taking the time to carry out the necessary researches on the subject, the location etc.In Amsterdam a wily youth advises three backpackers from the US and Iceland to go to Slovakia if they want to hook up with nice chicks. The reason, he says, why so many easy girls can be found there is that there are no guys in that country because of the war. What?? Come on, the last time there has been a war on Slovakian territory was back in WWII. Eli Roth must have mistaken Slovakia for Slovenia. But there has not been a recent war in Slovenia either, only its neighbors, Serbia and Croatia were engaged fighting one another in the early to mid '90s.When the backpackers arrive to Slovakia what they find is a run-down country out of the stone age. Not exactly what it is like in reality. I am not saying Slovakia is the European Dubai, but people not having more than three crooked teeth in their mouthes and driving around in cars you would not see anywhere else but in an industrial museum paying tribute to the ex-Soviet era's technological achievements is a bit of an exaggeration. Slovakians also drive Ford, Opel, BMW and Mercedes cars like everybody else in Europe. And they do have state-supported dentistry as well.No care has been taken to try to find out what the location of the film is indeed like in reality. The sad truth is that the place you would find child gangs attacking backpackers in broad daylight is not Slovakia, but England and the disgraceful outer districts of Paris.Either American movie makers do not know anything about Europe, or they think we are stupid enough to be depicted as we are in their films. Actually, the only character resembling a European is that of Oli, so why all the hassle to excuse the Icelandic president? And if you intend to make the central train station of Bratislava look like it was in Germany you could at least remove the coke ads written in Slovakian from the background, Mr Roth.

I dare you to watch every second of this film!!!,"Saw this film at the TIFF last weekend. What an amazing film, even if the final polishing is yet to happen. I found myself drawn into the story and caring about the characters. The fates of some of these characters is pretty brutal and made worse by the fact that you care (unlike other films in this genre). Despite my commitment to watch the whole film, there is still a five second scene where my eyes shut all on their own (but I could imagine thanks to the audience what had been on the screen). I am glad I attended this during the day, as I was drained, disturbed and shaken by this film. As another reviewer said, the scary thing about this movie is that it is not about ravenous aliens from space, but a scenario that could believably happen (if not now, in the near future). My hat is off to the director!! Once this movie hits theaters(possibly in November according to Eli) run don't walk to see this film. And remember, take two friends!!!!",,Anonymous,Horror
Bring out the East-European Gimps...,"""Hostel"" only just got released and it's already a bit overrated. Well...over-hyped might be a better term to use, as Eli Roth's follow-up to the crappy ""Cabin Fever"" is an overall intense horror flick and it definitely reaches its basic goal; which is to disgust and even shock younger audiences. Eli Roth and producer Quinten Tarantino aren't exactly known for their subtlety and thus ""Hostel"" is quite a sick and unhinged movie that leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination. Not even during the bloodless first half hour, when numerous beautiful girls go topless and the film looks an awful lot like vulgar teen-comedies such as ""American Pie"" or ""Road Trip""! Two Americans and an Icelander, all driven by their hormones, travel through Europe with only sex and soft drugs on their minds. After a disappointing party in Amsterdam, a fellow stoner advises them to travel further east where the girls are stunningly beautifully and  oh yes  very willing. The hostel in Slovakia starts out as a dream location but, soon after, the horny boys one by one get kidnapped and gruesomely tortured in a ramshackle old factory. The idea and structure behind the torture-network isn't particularly original or innovating, but since it's the only form of depth and plotting in the film's entire script, I won't be the one ruining it for you already (although other reviewers obviously have no problem with that...). Admittedly you have to be a little sick in the head, but I really enjoyed the extended and genuinely sadistic torture sequences and the devices looked creepy. Eli Roth will probably never be a great filmmaker, but his directing skills have seemly improved since ""Cabin Fever"", as there are some stylish camera angles and a nifty use of locations. The almighty Tarantino's influence is clearly detectable in smaller aspects, like twisted gags and clever references towards other movies (like his own masterpiece ""Pulp Fiction""). The ending is really good and the film once more proves that ordinary CHILDREN are the most petrifying creatures on the planet! Worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Has pretensions to be one of the nastiest movies ever seen but for me it was just one of the most boring,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsA couple of obnoxious young Americans and a pal they met on their journey take a trip to Amsterdam, Holland to enjoy a no holds barred holiday of casual sex and pot smoking. However, things take an unexpected turn when members of their number start mysteriously disappearing. It turns out there is another pleasure the boys haven't sampled- a pleasure where they'll suffer the most extreme pain and torture they've ever known from which they may well not leave alive.Touted as one of the most gruesome films ever made, Hostel proudly boasted a blood-splattered publicity campaign with a grisly promotional poster and that master of all things violent Quentin Tarantino billed as the executive producer. I've already seen some extremely nasty films this year, in the shape of Running Scared and The Devil's Rejects. Although Hostel is not as consistently nasty as those films there are a handful of scenes that definitely won't work wonders for the faint-hearted. But for the most part this just struck me as one of the most boring films I've seen in quite a while.If you still feel the need to slow down and peer in the car wreck yourself, you'll have to let yourself in for an unbelievably boring first half where absolutely nothing seems to happen, some unlikeable central characters and, of course, the unpleasant blood-splattered scenes. It might help if you try to see it as an examination of the dark side that could result in Amsterdam's culture of indulgence, but if you tune in for shock value, if you're like me, you'll most likely just end up falling asleep. **",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hostel Rocked.,"I absolutely loved Hostel. The acting may not have been the best but the small details were some of the things that made the movie really good for instance the cinematography, the set design, the music and the costumes. And even though the acting was not that good, I feel that the actors still portrayed what the character was like. Also, the plot in general was a very interesting and thought-provoking idea. There were some funny lines but the main attraction is definitely the gore. The special effects were very good and realistic, but the movie is definitely graphic and is not for the faint of heart.

"Liberate tute me, es en ferris.","Now, if my repeated viewings of Event Horizon have taught me correctly, the above statement, translated from Latin, means ""Save yourself from Hell."" By ""Hell,"" of course, I mean the horrendous experience of watching this unbelievably bad movie, and by ""save yourself,"" of course, I mean for GOD'S sake don't watch it. One out of ten is about ten times too high.Dear Mr. Roth,Listen, keep my $9, you prick, just give me back my 95 minutes, my dignity, and my respect for horror movies.You have stolen from me.I happen to believe in the theory that whenever you see someone tied to a chair in a movie, you have a screenwriter that ran out of ideas. Following that logic, this movie never had a thought in its head from the very beginning. I have to admit that in the first act, I was positively beaming at the screen I was so interested in where the film was going (because of the sexual element and an accompanying feeling that the movie was not going to cop out and go where every other horror movie involving sex went).Had I taken two seconds to see that this movie was directed by the same jerkoff who defecated Cabin Fever into theaters a couple of years ago I would have known not to watch it in the first place, but sadly I just checked the movie times and went out and paid $9 to be tortured through my eyes for an hour and a half.This movie seems to have been hugely popular at the Toronto International Film Festival, I can only theorize that the people who wrote glowing reviews on the IMDb are either closet sociopaths or were simply starstruck that the director was there talking about this film, pretending it wasn't the revolting sludge that it is.I promise you, this is one of the absolute worst films of any kind that I have ever seen.Some Americans go to Amsterdam for drugs and sex as Americans are wont to do, like it or not, and are advised to go to a certain hostel in Slovakia where beautiful women will just pounce on them. They find this to be startlingly true, until the girls drug them, big guys come and take them down into the dungeon and strap them to chairs in separate rooms, and for $25,000, rich people can come in and torture and kill them in any way they can think of (could it be for revenge against those dirty Americans for coming into our countries and dirtying the place up?).Directed by an American, by the way.Of course, you can't really claim that the movie is racist against Americans, because you can buy access to other ethnicities as well (for a substantially lower price). One creative individual decides to save some money and just go for a Japanese girl rather than an expensive American, and he proceeds to blowtorch her face until one of her eyes bulges out of its socket and hangs down on her cheek. Our ""hero"" has managed to escape his own torture and shoot and kill his tormentor, and goes into the room and shoots the guy torturing her, then displays a massive surge of brilliant intelligence by apologetically cutting off her eyeball, sending white pus running down her cheek, and THEN tries to get her out of there.Do you mean to tell me that you find this trash entertaining?My GOD!!When the movie thankfully ended, I have never in my life felt the urge so strongly to find the manager and demand my money back, the film is that sick and that twisted and utterly without redeeming value.I am absolutely baffled at the people who praise this movie on the IMDb. This thing is so disgusting and so cheap and so stupid and so sick that it blows my mind that there are people who really think there is some social value to a movie that makes you wonder how you would torture someone. And to make matters worse, nothing is resolved at the end. We are handed this cardboard resolution that solves nothing at all, the fire is dimmed by dousing a flame here and there, leaving the smoldering source of the torturous blaze firmly burning.I don't even want to give this staggeringly pathetic mass of congealed stupidity and perversion the pleasure of a spoiler alert, so I'll just give you an analogy. The main character, Paxton, is a man lost in the woods, when suddenly he's attacked by a bear. Ultimately, he is faced with the possibility of picking up a gun and shooting the bear, but instead decides to stomp on the bear's foot, and the movie ends as he runs cowering into the woods.This film is absolute drivel of the lowest order, a pitiful attempt to do something new in the horror genre by removing all elements of story, character, reason, creativity, tension, depth, thought, and meaning, and reducing itself to nothing but a lot of people strapped to chairs and being mutilated alive.If this is entertainment to you, you have some real problems. This movie strikes me as the kind of thing that would be enjoyed by someone who gets a real kick out of those disgusting videos that have been coming out of Iraq.I feel violated just because I've seen this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you approve of real-life torture, you will love 'Hostel'","I have just watched ""Hostel"", and as a result, my mind is filled with a vast amount of anger and disgust at the content of this film. I am not the world's biggest horror fan, but will certainly watch 'mainstream' movies in this genre. ""The Devil's Rejects"" wasn't to my taste (athough I loved its prequel), but the film had many praise worth qualities, and proved Rob Zombie to be a director worthy of much bigger and better projects. ""Saw"" was great, ""Saw 2"" hohum.""Hostel"" however, doesn't even pretend to be a horror film. It is, instead, nothing more than a plea for the re-acceptance of the use of torture in the real world.The film is cheaply made, with useless acting, and a cheap nasty use of untouched abandoned industrial locations. However, it is in this that the film is TOTALLY honest, for the film is concerned ONLY with scenes of torture and sadism, devoid of any context or dramatic purpose. The film ONLY comes to life when a torture scene is showing. The rest of the time, ""Hostel"" is like a very very inferior copy of a plot-free version of ""An American Werewolf in Paris"".In the opening scene of ""The Evil That Men Do"", a low rent Charles Bronson thriller, we witness a bunch of would-be torturers receive a practical classroom lesson in the art of inflicting pain and humiliation on a real-life male and female victim. ""Hostel"" was made as a pure piece of desensitisation for such an audience.I'm sure the renamed ""School of the Americas"", the main facility in the US for training the leaders of death squads that operate in various Latin America nations, has already placed a giant order for DVD copies of ""Hostel"" to use as a teaching aid.There is NO black humour in ""Hostel"". No dark subversive comment. No plot to speak of. No irony and no invention. No decent editing, and no decent cinematography. The East European landscape is cheaply and artlessly shot. The sexual nudity is tedious in the extreme. All these negatives allow the film-makers to purify the central purpose of their film, an act of pure worship at the temple dedicated to the worst of Human crimes, murder by torture.""Hostel"" has but one message, that torture is now to be accepted as a normal part of the Human experience. When the use of torture by the West became commonplace in US facilities in Afghanistan, Iraq, Cuba, and many ex-Soviet-controlled nations (eg., US military bases in Poland and Romania), we had a choice. To howl our outrage, and return Western Civilisation back to the values previously in place for at least the last two hundred years. Or to quietly submit, and embrace the new age of depravity. The makers of ""Hostel"" believe that we have voted for depravity, and wish to cheer that result as loudly as possible.As a side observation, why was the film giving Slovakia such a kicking? Is this rivalry between the successful Czech Republic, and the other part of the former nation of Czechoslovakia. Torture and racism, what a lovely combination.I can't score this movie for obvious reasons. However, if I could score for evil intent, ""Hostel"", like John Wayne Gacy, would score a perfect 10.For those of you that would seek to misunderstand my position, I would explain that I am too squeamish to watch the whole of even the 'cut' version of Hellraiser 2, but I would NEVER dream of describing that film as evil. The often stupid and tasteless Italian exploitation horror movies of the 70's and 80's likewise always have some merit, and would never be described by myself as evil. For me, ""Hostel"" is a first.",,Anonymous,Horror
All hyped up for nothing,"I was all excited to go see this movie. The reviews I've heard said it would be one of the scariest movies. It wasn't. It was, however disturbing. Seeing the previews and hearing that some people were being taken out by paramedics and others were passing out was all bogus. The crowd at the theater was laughing at certain parts that were not funny and weren't intended to be. I read all these reviews that were making it seem like a real horror, one that would finally live up to the standards. It was more grotesque than anything. I liken it to the Texas Chainsaw Massicure. What was all the hype about? I could see worst things in movies like House of 1000 Corpes or even Aliens. It was good to an extent. I can't wait to see if the come out with either an unrated version or directors cut on DVD. Perhaps then it will truly be the horror it was hyped to be.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
What an awful movie,"People.. PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE! It's better to spend your time on other things (of just a good movie) The first 45 minutes are really, really boring, all the people in Amsterdam (Netherlands) speak German :S. Another thing is.. you keep seeing lots of half naked woman. Why the naked woman? Well, I don't think anyone knows why they put in the woman, they don't have any purpose in the movie.. after 45 minutes the movie isn't very, very bad, but just bad. The things you see are pretty repulsing, so that's good, but the movie stays boring and there are no shock-effects..This really was the worst (horror) movie I have ever seen :(",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lame,"This movie was just down right terrible. Even if your a horror movie lover or not this movie just sucks. There is nothing you get from the actors,their performance is just dry and fake. The promotion of this movie just made it seem like it was so amazing, But don't let it fool you. There is very smallllllllllll amount of any kinda blood and gore at all. when there is some there isn't much.The concept was cool, and the locations were great for the first few minutes that is. It is mainly just nudity and a fest of how to kill time before the ending. it takes almost an hour before anything happens. I don't mind the nudity but when i am going to a horror movie, thats what I'm expecting a pure murder ride. major let down.Don't LET THE HYPE TRICK YOU TO THINKING IT WAS A GREAT AND GORY MOVIE!!! I would give it a 1, but the concept was cool and nudity helps any movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Becomes a James Bond movie,"Hostel was a big disappointing for me. I had been looking forward seeing this movie for a long time. Taratino's name was almost bigger then the actual name of the movie on the posters and so your hopes go even higher after seeing that. When I walked in out of the theater I wondered if he ever saw the movie!? The first 60 minuets of the movie is just 100% nudity, so much that I felt strange and after the movie it ran through my mind if they where trying to win the audients with that? Well it just looked ridicules. Finally we started to see some action after 60-70 minuets. The torture seemed real but it wasn't as scary as I thought it would be. The audients didn't really got to see anything except how scared the characters where and every time the throw up. Then the movie becomes a normal James Bond movie. Eli Roth had a good story, when he has practice some Ill watch the remake.These thinks I found funny! The list BELOW contains SpoilersThe music was way too loud and did not in any way fit the movie. - When you are watching a cowboy film from 1960 happening in the desert you'll always see some kind of a ""tree ball"" roiling in the warm wind past the camera, when you're watching a action film happening in Mexico, a hungry skinny dog walks past the camera, in this movie a poodle dog walks past the camera in this country where you cant find a building with every four walls hanging on and no ones got money, I cried I laughed so much. - Why didn't the just crash into the children? Did the movie suddenly had to have some ""horror limed""? - What did the Japanese girl expected to see in the mirror after her eye had been burned out? Why was she so surprised? - When the Paxton (Jay Hernandez) Escaped how did he know that the kinky ""eating with his hand"" man on the train killed his friend? Only Josh (Derek Richardson) knew that!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gore is not horror,"After enduring Hostel it finally became clear to me why some people slow down to get a good view of a bloody auto accident. Hostel, if one is honest in their thinking, is just another slasher film with better gore effects, which keeps those entranced with such effects happy. And as always in slasher films, the story is very lame to say the least. But then again they have to be, because to do otherwise might require the viewer to actually think! To be classified as a horror film, Hostel is not. And to those that don't understand, or may resent what I'm saying here, go find, beg, or borrow a copy of John Frankenheimers 'Seconds' and let your imagination do the rest.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good but Doesn't Fulfill the Hype,"Eli Roth's film has been hyped as the ""scariest movie in a decade"". With Tarantino attached (seemingly only for marketing/promotional reasons) and rave expectations since his previous CABIN FEVER, it's not the director's fault that this film has been pumped to the Nth degree. With the success of the SAW films and the J-Horror flicks in the past several years, we eagerly awaited this ""fresh"" concept, based on true events.Paxtor (Hernandex) and Josh (Richardson) are two young Americans backpacking through Europe, focusing less on the culture and more on the booze, drugs, and women. Predictably, the characters are foils. Paxton as the brash, egotistical Type A and Josh as the more quiet, reflective, just-broke-up-with-the-girlfriend sidekick. They meet Oli (Gudjonsson) an easy-going party-animal from Iceland. Together, they enjoy the sights, scene, and sex of Amsterdam.One night, they meet Alex (Silhavecky) who tells them of a city in Slovenia that is ""filled"" with women, if that's what they want. Alex shows them digital photos of him and gorgeous, naked beauties.The bait has been shown and the fish are hooked.Paxton, Josh, and Oli go to the Hostel recommended by Alex, but the trip is initially depressing and they are somewhat hesitant. Seemingly, their luck changes when they arrive at the hostel, a charming building which houses the three with two buxom flirts (Natalya and Svetlana) who invite them to the spa and out dancing.The next morning, after a night of bliss, is when things start to go awry.Roth manages to get us to this point in the film, about twenty minutes in, without much effort. The characters are stale and one dimensional, and the American-as-ignorant-tourist is over-played. Later, Paxton's ability to speak German is misused to give this idealogical conflict some meat. Unfortunately, Roth is too methodical during the gruesome torture scenes and continues to try and use the characters to send a message about Americans/capitalism.While the concept is strong, the story plays out a bit amateurish. The tension is fleeting, and we only wish the torture scenes could be longer (not for the blood but to push the envelope of what these people are doing). It's unfortunate that we know very little from the torturers' sides; they are just masks. There's no twists as to who's good and who's bad. It's fairly obvious as each character is introduced as who will end up being a friend or foe.As a second film for Roth, it's a good start. As for the hype, forget about it and just enjoy it for what it is, a pretty good horror flick. Hopefully Roth will forget about the Hitchcock-like directing and just focus on the in-your-face scare next time.",,Anonymous,Horror
Hype really makes the difference on this one...,"The negative reviews really seemed to flow on this movie. I think many people felt duped by the inclusion of Quentin Tarantino's name on this film (I still have not figured his true affiliation with this movie). It may have originally been a ploy to salt the trail and lead viewers - like keyword spamming on ebay - therefore critics are retaliating by overly harsh criticism. This is an interesting movie. Well written and acted. It's a shocking ride. If you are expecting Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction, why? Because somebody mentioned QT's name? Forget it. This is a different movie and certainly NOT trying to be like any other. Many people didn't seem to understand the soft porn galore, but the movie takes place in Amsterdam. Prostitutes REALLY DO advertise by dancing in glass windows along the street and absolutely anything goes. It's for real. Roth didn't invent this stuff he's bringing you in on the real deal. We are in Amsterdam folks. It sets up the premise for the rest of the movie... that... money can get you whatever you desire... and be careful what you wish for. This is a raw, potent and extreme film, not for those afraid to be deeply shocked by things they probably have never imagined... they could imagine. What movies are for anyway!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Irony?....,"Anyone notice the irony in the fact that everyone that went to see this movie saw it because of our fascination with horror and gore and the fact that the entire premise of this movie surrounds and focuses on this building where people go to live out their inner most desires of torture and killing. Eli Roth has us despising these characters, like the one the Jay Hernandez character meets in the locker room. However, in a sense we are similar to these people in that we spent our money to go and see this torture and horror on the big screen. Obviously, I know there is a big difference between the actual act and watching it in a movie. However, I did see the irony that Roth (perhaps unknowingly)displayed to his audience in the entire experience of Hostel.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Don't watch on a full stomach.,"It seemed like this movie was over-hyped until it actually hit the theatres, then it became a sort of a flop. I liked it personally, I thought maybe it could have been done better, but it was alright. People on the board are complaining about how it was sick and disgusting. I look at it more like a rebirth of the trashy era of cinema that started in Europe (mainly Italy). This was a trash film. It exploited and objectified women, showed lots of graphic violence and was filled with foul language. Maybe you're not familiar with the work of Lucio Fulci, Joe D'Amato, or even Dario Argento but this sort of thing thrived in the 80's. Anyway, about the movie. The only thing that bothered me was the abundance of inane dialogue among the Americans, proving that most of us between the ages of 18-30 can't say a single sentence without using the ""F"" word. But that's what you get when you rent a ""teen"" movie nowadays (Look at ""The Girl Next Door"" for example.). Two American college students take a trip across Europe looking to party and find some girls. They do just that and the audience is treated to some of the most explicit sex scenes I've seen in a while. One is kidnapped and taken to a slaughterhouse to be tortured and killed. Why? You'll have to watch and find out. The second half of the movie is for die-hard gore lovers only. It's got some truly revolting make-up effects, including an eyeball scene that would have made Lucio Fulci nauseous. See this movie if you're tired of those other slick, glossed over, minimal violence, new horror movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hostel Just Plain Blew,"i can't believe people think this was a good movie. This movie was so ridiculous and so full of crap. i was so excited to see it, and was horribly disappointed when I did. They could have used the 1st half of the movie to do really cool things. If you liked or didn't like Saw 2, at least the very 1st scene was tense and pretty sweet. Hostel was pretty much like watching Euro Trip (which was extremely retarded) and a really bad softcore porno for an hour, followed by really brief SAWish gore. The movie failed to make you forget you were in a movie theater, and make you feel like you were the one in the situations. I would flick on MTV if I wanted to see 3 idiots party for an hour. There was about 1.5 seconds of cool gore out of the 3.4 seconds of it in the entire movie. Eli, I hate you.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
big let down!,"I was expecting to not be able to sleep for a week after seeing this. i was expecting a blood and guts filled horror movie and what i got was basically a soft-core porno with a slow moving plot.

This movie sucks!!!!!!!!,"This is a terrible film. The first half is Hernandez and his 'loser' friend going all over Europe trying to get laid. There is also a great deal of nudity in the first part of the film which has nothing the story(of which there is little). The second part of the film is the part that is supposed to be completely gross but pails in comparison to either of the Saw movies. The ending is possibly worst part of the movie because it really doesn't end, they just stop showing the movie. I went to this movie the day it was released because of all the hype it was getting and I figured it was going to be about on par with Saw but it's not even close.

Q Tarantino's Sleaze And Gore Romp Masterpiece a la Central Europe,"It must have been a curiosity  related to my Slovakian motherland which prompted me to screen ""Hostel"" in cinema after Slovakia  the country in the heart of Europe popped up in previews and reviews.The horror seemed to be executed quite well when considering ""a fragmented structure and explicit violence"" (Courtesy of MS Encarta ®) are the hallmarks of the master director: Quentin Tarantino.I don't think the movie's can be branded an A movie or place itself among Top 10 though. Although the storyline is that of credible real life situation with exception of upbeat action-hero-up-for-justice style ending, it is the amount of violence and gore which all of a sudden bursts out in 2nd half of the movie; the very shocking & sickly images that drove away a few fellow cinema-goers.While ""Hostel"" is not for the faint-hearted, people who liked ""Wrong Turn"", ""Saw"" or ""Creep"" and similarly creepy, flicks packed with human butchery will surely find it quite enjoyable. Paradox as it is, consider yourself lucky to find this sort of savagery confined only to silver-screen aimed to amuse in a weird way unlike real life victims e.g. somewhere in bagdad where psychopaths roam freele without inhibitions.And perhaps this might be a reminder for young travellers: if something looks too good to be true, it most probably is. Feel safe to visit Slovakia or Czech republic  I insist on these places to be as safe and civilised nowadays as Spain, Britain or US. Few distortions in the local character can be found. Featured pop music originates in before year of 1990 and based on this fact you would be hard pressed to find such relic 50's style TV sets even in early 80's Czechoslovakia. Uniforms with the Slovak signs which the police force flashed several times appeared for the 1st time aftermath 1993, but that would mean not such communist models of cars only like those depicted in the movie. My judgement clearly says that the location for the train scenes and storyline in Slovakia movie itself was solely shot in Czech Republic even though the countries shared common past and places may look alike.Well, this movie might be a refreshing addition to your horror collection once you've waited long (or rather short) enough to buy it cheaply in sales.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

It is astonishing how many unique, intelligent scripts cant even get a greenlight yet someone actually handed this director several million dollars to make this fetish film. See it if you like movies with nothing to say to you except perhaps to reiterate your assertion that quentin Tarantino is as vapid a producer as he is a director.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Sick And Twisted: It's One Of The Best Horror Films Of The Year,"I have been eagerly awaiting the release of this movie, as it had been a long time since I'd seen a good horror film, so the expectation for Hostel was quite high. I have to say that, after a slow start, it didn't disappoint once the action got going.The beginning of the film was a bit of a damp squib I must admit, the 3 main characters were just irritating, stock horror movie guys. Once the horror really started to kick in, though I was pleased that they developed to the point where I actually cared what happened to them. With the exception of Oli, the Icelandic guy, who, it must be said, got on my nerves so much that I was thinking ""if he isn't killed soon I'm gonna jump in there and do it myself."" By the end of the movie I was hooked and disturbed, there are some truly gory scenes and the overall premise -people paying to experience the feeling of torturing and killing someone- is an extremely scary one, which could easily have been based on a true story, in my opinion.I'd definitely recommend this movie, for horror fans, but bring a cushion to hide behind. It's stuck in my mind relentlessly, which, for me is the mark of a good horror flick.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
I Have Walked Out of Better Films.,"The only reason I didn't walk our was because my wife and I were another couple. Apparently they wanted to as well.Before I go into a rant about why this movie was such a let down. Let me let tell you a little about the perspective this is coming from. I am 32 and a huge fan of horror films. I'm such a fan that for a few years I spent time as a special effects make-up artist and worked on a few major films. I like everything from the classics horror films like ""Nosferatu"" to seventies films ""Last House on the Left"" and ""The Exorcist"", Eighties flicks ""Hellraiser"" and had a good laugh with ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"". And now and again there's been films since then that I have enjoyed.So why would I hate this movie so much? Simple. There was nothing to it. It was two hours of soft porn and shock scenes. The plot, if you will call it that, was summed up in the first 15 minutes of the film. Honestly, this film could have easily just cut out the cheap dialogs and released it as a part of ""Faces of Death"" and shown the sex clips as a collage on Cinemax.Who was this movie made for? As a horror fan and I love a good shock and stomach a lot of gore in a film but it just became pointless violence. I estimate that things didn't start moving in the movie until almost 50 minutes after it's start. I say if you want the gore go watch Faces of Death. If you want to see soft porn watch Cinemax. But don't try to splice the two together and call it a movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Hot European women, nudity, horror, gore, more horror and gore and a bit of humor in that order, what more can ye ask for.","Before seeing this movie I did not know it was from the same director as Cabin Fever. Realising it was Eli Roth I have to say I have become a fan most definitely. I really enjoyed Cabin Fever and thought Hostel was even better.At first knowing it was presented by Quentin Tarantino and having read and seen a lot of hype about it on the internet I knew it was a movie I was going to enjoy.From a cast of almost unknowns or newbies they did a good job in convincing the horror and terror of their situation although I did not like Oli the guy from Iceland who was just plain annoying.Firstly the movie features some gorgeous eastern European women nude a lot of the time which was a plus for the guys, but as it goes on we're soon presented with the real horror, terror and gore that awaits them presented to us in graphic detail. Makes you kinda think ""does something like that really exist"" and could make you think twice about visiting Slovakia :) for the sole purpose of meeting beautiful women.I think a lot of the gore could of came from ideas taken from a lot of Asian horrors as being a horror fan myself I have seen plenty of Japanese and Korean horror movies although a lot of them haven't been as good as Hostel.Another thing was that I found myself laughing at some scenes, not in a bad way though. I'm not sure whether the humor was intended or just me. Although it wasn't the scariest of horrors I have seen I really enjoyed this movie as I thought it was pretty fresh, in particular for the US market.I would definitely recommend any horror fan to go see this movie as I believe it is one that has resurrected the genre of horror. Will definitely get it out on DVD when it is released as I have read there is an alternative ending on it.A final note I would like to make is that if you liked this you should definitely see Takashi Miikes 'Audition'. Probably the best horror movie ever.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Poor,"Hostel (2005)* 1/2 (out of 4)Three backpackers, hitting every hostel in the area, get more than they expect when they go to a small country where people pay to kill other people. This here comes as a major disappointment because I really enjoyed Eli Roth's Cabin Fever. Technically speaking this film is pretty well made, especially some of the cinematography but outside of that the film was all downhill. I think the biggest blame goes towards Roth and his screenplay, which tries to do something different (American wise) but fails. The director said Miike and Audition were an influence on this film but Roth fails to bring the ""two stories"" together. Like that film, we're led to believe this film is simply about three guys finding girl but then we get to the torture stuff. The beaver hunting scenes don't work and the torture scenes don't work. The characters aren't interesting and that's another problem. The final twenty-five minutes is suppose to be full of suspense but none of it worked. In the end the film is really slow and boring.",,Anonymous,Horror

Dull,"I can't believe the amount of positive feedback this boring little yawn is getting. It amazes me that people think this is extreme or depraved or graphic or twisted. The first half plays like a toned down American Pie movie, and then the rest consists of people looking for their friends, giving gum to dirty street children, looking for their friends again, giving more gum to dirty street children then being subjected to unimaginative and laughable attempts at ""extreme"" and ""hardcore"" torture. Yes. Cringe as someone gets a drill in the leg. Gasp as fingers fall off. Scream in terror as a neck is cut. Sure, in real life this would be terrible, but in cinema, in a movie backed by Tarantino and Miike and Peter Jackson, it's just pathetic. If this is as sick as Mr. Roth can get, then he needs to start stealing from some other movies. I almost wonder if Miike cameoed in this flick just to make fun of poor little Roth and his sad attempts at being wild. Though I suppose one could say that Hostel is kind of cute for trying so hard to rip off better movies, like a child imitating Jack the ripper. This had the potential for greatness, but in the hands of Eli Roth and his inability to be creative in any possible way, it's just a dumb waste of time.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Discourages people to go on sex tours.,"I think this movie presents a good argument against going on a hedonistic sex tour on a few different fronts: 1) If you go on a hedonistic sex tour, and pay money to bang babes, then equally some sadist may pay money to torture and kill you. The fact is, when an institution is sick or evil, you could also be a victim. The very concept of the sex tour is that a woman is a commodity that can be purchased - but there is no limit on what can be commidified as long as there is a market for it.2) Second of all, suppose you start getting becoming a more depraved and sick human afterwards. A character that was during the torturing to an Asian woman apparently went on lots of sex tours, and wanted bigger highs and thrills and eventually ended up doing that. It's like some sort of progression. Starts with a hedonistic sex tour with normal women, then more depravity, it goes to sex with children, more depravity, it comes to snuff, more depravity, torture and killing, etc....As a young virgin guy, I identified with the characters wanting to get laid in Europe, and sure, that's a guy thing. I really identified with them and was totally sympathetic. Although they wanted to get laid, they never hurt or tortured anyone and could never have deserved that.The movie has a stead progression from an American pie movie, to a horror movie to a revenge movie and had a nice tone to it - but the problem with the movie is that it is just too evil - I felt like paying to watch a movie like that seems sick. It's a sick movie, but it has raised some points.If anyone ever thinks of going to Thialand, Costa Rica, or any sex-tour places to explore hedonistic pleasure - then in the back of my mind there could be some evil lurking.Another aspect is that normal types of people can just be diabolical evil monsters. You don't know what people would do if they had no limitations. Super rich people can buy themselves out of anything, and the movie potentially taints rich people as potentially being sadistic monsters that pay to break the law in third world countries where anything can be bought.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disappointing,"I have read a bunch of comments stating that this movie is ""hardcore"" and ""real horror"" but it's not. The truth is the horror movies that are being produced today are just so terrible that this movie appears to be for real. I was really disappointed by this film. So much potential and so little actual payoff. The beginning of the film that is supposed to be setting up the Hostel sequence is waaaay to long. I don't really need this much character development. They are a bunch of early 20's morons who travel to Europe to take drugs and have sex. How much more do you need to know? Apparently you need half of the film. When you do finally get to the Hostel the violence and horror that could have been never appear. Granted there are a few scenes that make you cringe but nothing that hasn't been done before. Much like Roth's last film Cabin Fever, this is nothing more than an homage to better films. (If you want to see a great power drill sequence check out Feluci's Gates of Hell.) I am willing to give Roth a break since the movie had to be edited pretty severely in order to get an R rating. I would wait for the DVD to come out and see this movie without the constraints of rating system. In the meantime I am throwing all of my hope for good horror films on Aja shoulders with his remake of the Hills Have Eyes.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
I wanted to like it..,"First of, let me mention that I've never reviewed a movie before. I make no claim of being good at it, I can offer no explanation as to why anyone should listen to me, but here are my thoughts. I've read about 5 of the reviews on here, and I feel like they've missed the mark quite badly. After the movie, I found myself defending Hostel to my wife more than I even felt it deserved. Apparently this is a love it or hate it type of movie, but I didn't do either -- I just thought it was pretty bad.My biggest gripe with the film through about an hour was that there was absolutely no plot. A few guys go to Slovakia and get tortured. It wasn't till right at the end that the plot made itself apparent and Hostel finally seemed to have some value as a film. Without giving away any of the details, I'd say, at this point, Hostel seemed to have a great premise for a film -- unfortunately it didn't pull it off.Hostel in no way attached me to the characters. While I've debated with myself how realistically they behaved, there's no getting around the fact that the characters were about as likable as any random college tough guy trying to start a fight at a bar -- and these are the guys we're supposed to be pulling for, relating to.The plot setup took almost the entire movie. My wife said it'd be good for guys, because there were plenty of boobs, but we all have internet and can get that for free anyway. Once the action began, it was over in about 10 minutes. The movie wasn't horror -- there was never a moment I even felt like my heartrate MIGHT increase. And, overall, the whole movie seemed to have a playfull, weak, teenage feel to it, just like Cabin Fever.I wanted to enjoy this movie.

The last movie that I saw in 2005 was Wolf Creek. It was darker and grimmer. I liked Wolf Creek but I don't know that I could recommend it. Hostel is a hoot. The element of suspense is well done. The plot tripped me up a few times when I thought that I had everything figured out, and the fun doesn't stop till the final frame. All the actors do an excellent job. Whether technically accurate or not, again to my delight, the actresses have shaved their legs and their underarms. Hostel also functions, in a way, as a great tourist ad for Holland. I definitely want to go there. Not so much Eastern Europe. Hostel is what a Saturday matinée is all about. See it!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Soft porn in the disguise of a Horror film...apology of a film...,"Firstly... what kind of 90 minute horror film takes 30 Min's to start getting to the point... the first thirty Min's of this film are dedicated to some useless soft porn which makes no sense but seems like satisfying the directors own carnal leanings...i think he will make millions making films for Vivid...one has seen enough use of pliers and drills to inflict torture on kidnap victims, to pass it off as horror is sheer horror by itself.. directors need to scare the audiences not repulse them... If you do have to watch a gory film... then Saw and Saw 2 beats this film hands down... splashing pots of blood around the frame is not horror... even the thrill element in the film was missing...I think Mr.Quentin Tarantino and Co. should think about there reputation before endorsing a senseless film like this.. there is far more talent out there. Apart from the SAW films.. ""Devils Rejects"" is another film that one can invest valuable time in rather than this stupid, apology of a film...",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brutal and frightening... but not for long.,"Eli Roth can be commended for attempting to do something other filmmakers have left only half done. He has attempted to put on film the actual, relentless and somewhat realistic image of torture and pain. The film achieves a cold level of intensity. It makes its audience feel isolated, and successfully prevents anyone from looking at the film with any humor. Its true and dry terror. But it does not last for long.Only so many bodies can pile up, only so many human beings can be subjected to sadistic torture before the audience gets tired. Thats right: tired. After the first 40 minutes or so, you will desire to leave the theater; not because you can't handle it anymore, but because you've already handled too much.Roth tried something. He tried a film without humor or cutaways. It didn't work. Hitchcock's old rule remains the same, I'm afraid, when it comes to horror. It's not what you see, its what you don't see. Roth would do well to remember it.",,Anonymous,Horror
Don't check in,"I've just watched this movie on DVD, what a waste of space, seriously one of the worst movies I have ever seen (it makes the last George Romero flick look like Citizen Kane), it's completely lacking in tension or mood. Isn't this meant to be a horror movie? Is fake blood and by the numbers gore meant to be frightening alone? This is desperate film making, as if the director was clueless how to scare the audience. I guess some people might get a very slight kick out of some of the sub-teen movie sex scenes. 'Quentin Tarantino presents' the poster says, well Quentin you buy every copy back and personally cut his name off this. Save your money and go backpacking in Europe.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It's a decent horror film. What did you expect, Casablanca?","I'm old enough to remember when Hostel was a new thing and people talked about it, but I never watched it myself. I usually avoid things that are hyped too much, and then much later when the dust is settled watch it with an open mind.I was aware that this one, along with the Saw series, was one of the films that started the ""torture"" sub-genre of horror films. Though I must say these are the only examples that I can name. What has come later I have no clue. However, still today every now and then Hostel is referred when talking about other films, so I thought it's become a minor genre classic, or...cult movie, or something, so I want to finally see what's it like.Even though the notorious violence in this movie was indeed very brutal, I was surprised that there was also other things going on than just torture. The plot was quite interesting. Maybe the characters were a bit shallow but I didn't mind. Right from the start when there was a lot of nudity and partying I set myself into the right mindset: ok, this is a trash film, bring it on. But then the tone gradually moved to more serious and I thought that was cool. The ending was maybe my favorite part but I also liked the slow buildup.Overall: I think people wouldn't be talking about Hostel if it wasn't for the gimmick of the hair-rising violence, but in any case it's a decent horror film. But only watch if you're fan of the genre. I mean, stuff like Friday the 13h sequels, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Saw are your usual choices of relaxing on sunday afternoons.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not Scary and a Waste of Time,"If you want to see a lot of naked girls, gore, and a terrible story, this movie is great for you. I think Roth missed the mark when shooting for a horror movie. If you remotely pay attention to the movie, you realize that, basically, everything is predictable. Is it just me, or doesn't that defeat the purpose of a horror flick? To make things worse, the first half of the movie is nothing but a softcore porn that has very little to do with the plot, or lack thereof. All in all, I feel that this movie was a combination of two ideas (sex and gore) haphazardly thrown together into a 90 minute presentation. I challenge anyone out there to watch this movie and tell me that they didn't see how things were going to turn out scene after scene. Roth may have accomplished his goal, but his goal is a terrible film.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
a really good movie,"I thought the movie Hostel was pretty good. I thought it was creative and enjoyable to watch. The movie was pretty original in my opinion. I have never seen another like it. Some parts were pretty gory, which was good. There was lots of naked women, which is OK. But, I thought it was original and I felt the actors were pretty believable to watch in the movie. The movie kept the watcher interested and i think the movie went along pretty fast and I would probably watch it again. I rate the movie 8/10, though I have never found a 10/10 so this is up there.

Hostel!,Well in a few ways Hostel has it ups and downs For one thing this movie is really really good don't get me wrong most horror movies in the first 30 to 45 minutes drag on unless u saw white noise that totally sucked -_-.This is the way that they should make Horror movies u do not produce it by MTV and u don't put any famous actors in it I know Jay Hernandez is a somewhat known actor but everybody else u probably never heard of.There's stuff worse out there from Faces of Death to even Traces of Death when u got the MPAA on board u have the idea that your movie will get cut down from an nc-17 rating to a Rated R rating and that cuts out the worse parts of the movie that u either have to see online or get the uncut version that comes out in the future Eli Roth made cabin fever that movie was actually pretty good Its all suspenseful and good to the point and doesn't drag..This movie is good just that i wish some theaters let it come out NC-17 the true way that ELI ROTH made it.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Smart and Horrifying,"Eli Roth has turned out a refreshingly smart horror film. The trite horror plot devices found in many recent horror movies are seldom included, and then only has a scratch at the surface. The originality of elements, coupled with bone-chilling influences of movies such as Takashi Miike's ""Audition,"" makes for a truly frightening film.The most frightening elements of the film are the most mundane. The horror of it all is universal.The seemingly gratuitous nudity in the beginning pays off later in the film to become painfully (and brilliantly) relevant. The amount of gore is borderline - never excessive, but vivid all the same. Don't expect to jump from your seat, but you may find yourself at the edge of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Either you'll Like it or hate it,"I was drawn to this film with low expectations, as I have been for the last several years with horror. Understanding that this was to be a shock and gore fest, and not a revolutionary new horror film, I was not disappointed. Honestly, I was delightfully surprised. Some felt that it took all the old cliché's and ruined them. I think they've forgotten that these old cliché's of teenagers backpacking, through the US, Europe, Australia, or where ever. These groups of people traveling and running into some type of horrific terror has the most probable suspension of disbelief. That is to say ""Could this actually happen?"" With Hostel, that's a resounding yes, this is something that really and actually happen. Whereas some movies end and the viewer says to themselves, ""Yeah, right, that isn't even possible."" Hostel can leave one asking what they might don in this same situation. I felt that all of the T & A added to the story, and I'm all in favor of any movie with that much T & A.To simplify, when it comes to Horror, ask yourself, next time you watch a horror movie, could this really happen? and if your answer is yes, then you know the movie scored.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I will admit thought, I laughed my ass off during most of the scenes. QT should be ashamed of himself for having his name affiliated with this film. The acting was boring and unoriginal. The plot was weak and for a horror film there wasn't a lot of gore at all. Horror films now should be crazy with the technology. Of the three characters that get tortured/killed, one of them wasn't even shown. The idea for the film was good, but it definitely wasn't worked on enough.

This movie was terrible,"I went in to this film looking for a decent scary movie and left having seen a simply terrible movie. Please, please, please do not waste your time watching this movie. Terentino attempted to show as many naked women as possible and then to stay true to his form, threw in some of the most disgusting things imaginable. I would not recommend this movie, ever...but I would definitely not recommend wasting your money seeing it in the theaters! This is a sad excuse for a movie, and is a disgrace to Hollywood and American film makers. The plot is non-existent, there truly is no content to this film. To me it is simply an attempt to push the limits of our cultures tolerance to cruelty and gore. I feel terrible after my experience of watching this movie. My biggest disappointment is that I did watch the trailer for it before going to view it, and the trailer in my opinion did not adequately portray what was to come in the film. The trailer doesn't even touch on how disgusting this film is.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Poorly made,"Right of the bat, this movie sucked, the plot is shaky, and then there is a ton of sex and partying soon followed by gallons of blood. The story just wasn't believable. Not to mention the acting was pretty poor because they couldn't get any real actor to play in such an off the wall movie. Finally the gore. Most of the effects weren't that real. So if I were you I would save my $8.25 and see something else. I think Eli Roth was trying way to hard with this one. He tries to be too much of an artist with his gore, but in the end it just is a little gross, not scary. For this movie to work, it would need better actors and some form of a plot line. Pulp Fiction and Resivior Dogs, both great films and both had a significant amount of known actors. Also because Tarantino used a unique style of filming and revealing the story, it sucked the viewer in. They still had gore, and they were directed by the producer of Hostel, thats the only reason it seemed promising. Hostel on the other hand was missing most of that. Like I said, poor plot and acting. Not to mention there isn't creativity in the way is was filmed. It just appears the the movie was running low on funds and Roth had to slap something together. Instead of screaming or being creeped out, my friend and I were laughing so hard pointing out all the flaws in this movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Overview,"I was able to attend a special sneak preview screening of Hostel last night in the Los Angeles Area. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I will be the first to admit that I was not enthralled with Cabin Fever, Eli Roth's first horror film, but I was amazed at how well this movie was done. There is something so unsettling about a place that seems to pander to the visceral basis of human nature. The movie was masterfully done, slowly sliding from a place of comfort and happiness to a place of sheer terror. The scenes of torture that you have heard about are just as horrifying as you would expect, definitely worthy of the R-rating the movie received. The transformation of the main character throughout the movie was captured quite well, and the character development overall was very well done. Even though the movie only runs 95 minutes, Eli Roth was able to effectively make us care about the characters and what happens to them. There is plenty going on in this movie, and the short runtime does not detract. There are plenty of moments in the film where you just want to stand up and cheer for the good guys, and go beat the crap out of the bad ones.And I realize that I am rambling, and my sentences are very disconnected... must be the early morning hours. The point is this is a very good horror movie, and the perfect scary movie to cure the Oscar season slump of artsy films. Come January 6th, I will be seeing this movie again, and if you are a horror fan you should be seeing it as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

When I watched it, I am not a squeamish person, my stomach was churning for hours on end but I still wanted to watch it over and over again.

Tarantino commits career suicide!!!,"I saw the previews and thought well it looks OK, and Tarantino has his name on it, so it should be good. Boy was I wrong! This was, is, and (hopefully) always will be Tarantino's worst movie! If you want to see gore I suggest seeing CSI for even that has more gore than this movie. The only ""gore"" that was shown was for a split second as the camera panned, other than that it was just all nudity and blood splatter. The only R rated scenes were the ones that contained nudity and it wasn't even great nudity. I expected this kind of boring PG material from the incapable and incompetent director/writer of cabin fever but not from Tarantino. He has really lowered his standards on this one and hopefully will come out with a GOOD movie to make up for this garbage..err not even garbage, this film is the lowest form of existence, it is useless. I do not think I can bring myself to watch another Tarantino movie without at least having a pillow and a free ticket. I would rather sit in a room of stereotypic blondes scratching blackboards with their long nails and open mouth chewing of bubble gum than watch this filth again. Usually Lions Gate and Tarantino can pick good movies to add their names to but this is the kind of movie that should be taken out, beaten, destroyed, burned, incinerated more, and then launched into space with a heading towards the sun. It is not even worth getting a FREE ticket or viewing. And if I could rate less than a 1 awful, I would, for even awful is an immense compliment for this thing called a movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
What gore?,"I am a major fan of horror/gore films and in my opinion, this movie was an insult to the genre of horror films. This movie was basically a porno with blood. Sex in movies is acceptable if it adds to the movie, but more than 1/2 of the sex scenes didn't add anything. The gore was weak and didn't even churn my stomach. I have seen old classic horror films that had gore that put this movie's so called ""gore"" to shame. I had so much anticipation and build up for the gore in this movie, I was ready to be throwing-up. When the ""gore scenes"" finally started, I was excited and ready to be disgusted, but to my dismay all of the ""gore"" scenes cut away at just the right part. The story also lacked an interesting enough plot. 3 horny college guys and boobs in my face for an hour is not my idea of a plot. There should have been more focus on the so called gore that this movie was supposed to loaded with. The plot line needed to be developed much more and deepened with some interesting twists and turns. Overall, this movie was a huge let down.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

The rated R rating did not come from the horror expected from this movie. The rating should have been XXX for nudity and swearing. Maybe the writers, directors, and producers will get the horror title correct the next time. When I go to see a horror movie, I expect to be scared, I expect to be jumped, I expect to have an adrenaline rush. When I go to a horror movie, I expect the plot of the story to make me feel for the characters. I expect the movie to make me feel like I am the character.

It may be trash—but it's good trash!,"For the first time ever, a movie distributed in Norway was given the non-existing age limit of 20 years. Non-existing, because the highest age limit in Norway is 18 years—that's our age of majority. So why 20 years? What most people don't know, is that the age limit was set by NBC Universal themselves (instead of the government controlled Norwegian Media Authority, which normally takes care of these things). In other words—it's hyped through the roof.I didn't know this, and was expecting some pretty nerve-wracking stuff. It was pretty gory, but nothing unusual compared to other similar movies. Also it was surprisingly thrilling. The effects was pretty good, and the movie was well directed (still a little involuntarily funny a few places). The acting was maybe a tad better than you would expect from a teen-slasher film. This movie also has a few turns which make it a little less predictable as other horror movies.It may be trash—but it's good trash.

"You can sleep through the first act, but after that you may never sleep again","(Note: my comments refer to the unfinished version of the movie. I've seen the final cut, and a bit of careful editing has resolved most of my issues.)I saw this movie at the Toronto Film Festival this year, and I have only a few things to say that you can't get from the other comments and reviews: Drink a Red Bull for the first third of the movie, because it is BORING. All the character build-up stuff, all the development of the so-called plot, all the set-up as the characters travel across Europe to Slovakia... snore. The actors are decent, but the characters are just so two-dimensional and uninteresting that all the life injected into their performances is wasted. Worse yet, you aren't going to this movie to see interesting and deep characters, which makes the first 25 minutes of the movie even more wasteful.But... when they get to their destination and strange things start occurring... well! Eli Roth is not much of a writer, but as a director and creator of gruesome and terrible things, he shines. The villains are evil, the ""heroes"" are disturbing, and the climax and denouement, such as it was, left everyone in the theatre shocked, aghast, and cheering.Overall I give it 4/5 for style, and 2/5 for substance, resulting in my 6 overall score.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A great flick!,"I would hardly consider myself a horror addict or expert, but this was a great flick. It follows three backpackers who are recommended to seek a hostel in Slovakia which is renowned for its beautiful women. I'll say no more than the the Hostek facilitates some sinister activity.A criticism of this film (which is perhaps well-founded) is that is paints the nation within which the hostel lies (Slovakia) in a bad light. Of course the Texas Chainsaw Massacre doesn't make us frightened of Texas, but people are always scared of environments foreign to them. This adds to to the tension of the film - the fact that the three guys are unfamiliar with their surroundings. The tension eerily builds and the climax is gripping, suspenseful and concludes in a very satisfactory manner.Not for the faint-hearted obviously. One torture scene in particular is horrific and in fact lessened my enjoyment of the film. But overall it is a well-made, tight and gripping thriller that will have you squirming and looking away at times. The film also makes us feel sympathy towards the victims, adding to the intensity.Definitely worth a look.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Not for those with weak stomachs, or a strong opinion of good horror flicks.","I have tried for years to understand the works of Quentin Tarantino, and why he is so highly acclaimed, but this movie didn't help me at all. Now before I get jumped on for this, I must say that even though I don't 'like' any of his films, I have respect for anyone who can stay fresh in Hollywood these days, while still doing the movies he wants to do, seemingly, without compromising his vision.Now, after presenting my stance on the main driving force behind ""Hostel"", I must say why I loathed this movie. I first caught a 'restricted' trailer of this film before ""Saw II"". I was horrified at the preview, even though it was no more than three minutes long. Now, I love horror movies, (hence how I saw the preview), but seeing how many gruesome images someone can cram into 95 minutes of film is not scary, it's more sad than anything.I'm not ripping on the violence because I'm squeamish, but because it's so over the top. I like a horror movie with a fairly comprehensible storyline. In Hostel, not only was a decent plot nowhere in sight, but it seems, as if to compensate for this, the torture scenes were more elaborate to divert attention from the fact that the plot was thin, and, the characters one dimensional. So in the end, you care very little about them, so it isn't a big deal when they die. Most horror movies have at least one character that can be liked or identified with by most people on some level.For those who like the film, I am not saying anything against the fans; I just can't see any appeal in it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Garbage and nothing more,"Look I realize Cabin Fever was an atrocious movie at best but that should not be grounds for saying that Hostel was a great movie. True Eli Roth improved the plot of the move if you compare it to Cabin fever, but Dumb and Dumberer had a more interesting plot than Cabin Fever did. In other words, it didn't take much to improve over the garbage we know today as Cabin Fever. Hostel has very little plot, and if anyone here is saying the ending is unpredictable and exciting then they weren't paying attention. I can honestly say this is one of the single worst movies I have ever paid to see. I usually respect the IMDb reviewers but this time they were far from right. The murders in this movie were pointless, and the senseless gore did nothing to improve the interest of the movie. At the same time the movie did not scare anyone, and it was not as gory as any of the SAW franchise movies have been. The twists were not there and any movie that revolves around guys trying to get as* in other countries should be stopped on the press before it can be viewed by anyone else. It is sad that movies as badly as this one can be viewed as a success. That really shows the difference between people in the world and how we perceive movies. I just don't see anyway to think of this movie as a success, it stunk and will always be complete garbage in my mind.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mostly boring and unsatisfying,"Before I get into criticizing this movie, I feel I should admit that I am human. I often enjoy seeing movies that involve sexual material, and I also often enjoy seeing movies that have a lot of blood and gore shed. This movie certainly has both of those ingredients, and in great quantity, but all the same the movie failed to interest me that much. You can't just put great gobs of nudity and bloody violence in a movie and expect it to therefore be instantly great. You have to put substance with it as well, and that is where ""Hostel"" fails. For starters, the movie is very slow-moving - it takes forever for the protagonists to find themselves in trouble. And during that long period before the crisis starts, what we see of them is not exactly endearing - they come across as simple-minded sex-obsessed youths. While I'm speaking of the characters, the movie also fails when it comes to the antagonists - we learn almost nothing about them. As a result of that, there isn't a great feeling of danger to be felt. You'll just tiredly watch the mayhem and look at your watch to see how much time is remaining until the movie comes to an end. A real disappointment.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Torture, gore, but so much more.","It's important to start off by saying that I am not, in any way, a fan of gore or torture porn. I fins these Horror sub-genres to be in very poor taste at best. I recognize zero cinematic or otherwise artistic value in blowing your arts and visual effects budget on blood, puss and other bodily fluids, or severed organs (particularly when I ""get to"" watch them actually being severed). I don't enjoy it and I try to avoid films flaunting the use of these features the way Hostel did. Still, after all the buzz, I simply had to check it out.I'm writing this review after watching it for the second, and it seems I have forgotten pretty much everything but the main plot revolving around torture. Indeed, there are plenty of scenes I would have rather not watch, but let's give credit when it's due - Hostel is far from tasteless. The gory scenes are not just out there for no reason, but in order to present a realistic and believable human phenomenon as both the main fear factor and a pinch of social criticism. What keeps you afraid is not the use of cheap jump scares (blissfully absent in this film) nor the disgusting gore, it's how you relate to the characters and experience the fear of what's about to happen to them through their eyes and experiences. The build up towards the torture, as people are tied up and realize that every single type of pain is about to be inflicted and there's nothing they can do about it, received more screen time than the torture itself. The helplessness and terror are delivered professionally and amazingly.On this note, the film is absolutely taken to the next level by Eli Roth's direction of the characters and the cast's ability to play the role in the most professional and impressive way possible. Jay Hernandez (Paxton) and Derek Richardson (Josh) played the terror of anticipating their impending torture in a manner that was terrifying and authentic, stressing what a raw deal they received in their casting in Suicide Squad and Dumb and Dumber respectively. Barbara Nedeljakova (Natalya) and Jana Kaderabkova (Svetlana) are so much more than eye candy (though admittedly not painful to look at to say the least) as the hostel's occupants, delivering their role in the most realistic manner imaginable. And to top it all - Rick Hoffman (American Client) and Petr Janis (German Surgeon) are as discomforting, terrifying and revolting as you'd expect, meeting every possible standard.Originally, I rated Hostel a 5, due to being younger, less experienced and honestly less fair. It's improper to criticize a gore torture flick for showing gore and torture, I know that now. My new more appropriate rate is 7, meant to reflect the overall level of the film while accounting for what I found to be a wanting plot and an unfortunate lack of a final twist. Also, some of the scenes were simply too much and frankly unnecessary. If you're a fan of gore and torture porn - you're in for a real treat. If you're not - think hard before you decide to watch this, as it will take you places you might not have wanted to visit or experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is pretty much the worst movie ever made.,"There was nothing impressive about this movie. I think that people had heart attacks because they were shocked at how stupid this movie really was. Sure, the gore was good and it had an interesting concept, but the first hour totally ruins that.I do not go to see a horror movie to see sex. That kind of ruins it. I do realize that the only reason they were in this town was for sex, but it wasn't necessary to show it.Like I said, the gore was good. That's what bumped my vote up to a 2. I was a little upset that they cut away half the time. They will probably show this on an unrated DVD, but there's no telling how much sex will be in that version. That fact also hurt my vote.I was just soo let down. I mean... Tarantino was attached. What went wrong? I didn't expect it to be perfect because I've seen Cabin Fever and didn't expect much from Eli Roth, but Tarantino was there too! My guess is that the first half of the film was Roth and the second half was Tarantino.My recommendation is to wait until the unrated version is out on DVD.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hostel (2005) ***,"Eli Roth's brilliantly horrifying story of what fate awaits three young men looking to sow their wild oats while vacationing in Europe. They're introduced to a strange Slovakian land where sexy foreign women are always willing to bed down with any male (especially if they're Americans) and fulfill every one of their fantasies. After a period of partying and cheap thrills, these friends discover they're nothing more than unlucky possessions in grisly games of torture and death.I think the gradual unraveling of how these sadistic events come to be ia very intriguing and distrubingly real. I've subsequently learned that there were at least two endings filmed, and without going into detail I'll just say that the version which was re-shot to play in theaters upon the movie's original release was the much stronger and satisfying of the two.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hostel = the biggest waste of $10 and 1 1/2 hours of my LIFE,"This movie was absolutely the stupidest movie I have ever seen. Farfeched isn't even the word. A horror movie is horrifying when it is just slightly realistic. The only realistic part of this film was how easy it is to get laid overseas. I would never recommend this movie...ever. Don't waste your time!! The whole movie I sat and waited for a thrill or even some part I didn't want to watch, never happened. I think there has been too much hype with awful films.

This movie should be characterized as a soft-core porn with 30 minutes of overboard killing at the end, killings that don't make sense.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
My first review,"I have recently watched the hostel for the second time and was amased on how good it was. I am very disappointed at customers at my video shop complaining the lack of story and excitement on this movie. I wouldn't categorise this movie as a horror, ad put it right in the top of the list with a nice GORE category. Its not a scary movie, but i must give it 10/10 for its twisted sickness. The only reason i gave it a 9/10 was because I wanted more, I personally did not think there was enough killings, also the way they killed of the Chinese girl with the burnt eye at the end....could of been much more creative.If you enjoy movies such as Saw, Dawn Of The Dead, Final Destination....then most likely you will have a great time watching this movie. The only thing i will warn you all not to have a meal if you get easily sick watching disturbing things before the movie! Enjoy and get ready for Hostel 2 (2007) Kalle",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
not much of a story,A good movie in its genre. Very graphic and disturbing scenes but not much of a story. Although it says it's based on true events there was no reference to it and I don't believe that anyway. But what was disappointing was there was no actual story behind it. No real reason why this was happening except that people with money and the urge to torture and kill could have it arranged for them. The other part I was disappointed in was everything seemed so nonchalant. . From the girls setting it up to the heavies keeping guard it was like another day at the office for these people. Other than the premise of the movie being for a certain type of person it wasn't particularly scary.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Human stupidity at its peak!,"I didn't expect a groundbreaking, revolutionary masterpiece of cinema, I just wanted to watch something entertaining. There is no story, so I thought it will be a style over substance movie - and it wasn't.The creators tried desperately to convince me, that there is a story. 3 idiots going to Slovakia and getting lost one by one. I wouldn't call this a story. The filmmakers couldn't come up anything better in terms of plot, so they filled the movie with nudity and violence. But none of them could redeem this film.Stupidity is everywhere in this movie. The way they depicted Slovakia - stupid and one-sided. The story - stupid. The characters - all stupid. The atmosphere - stupid. The dialogue - stupid. The viewer... well, you get the idea.If I want to see human stupidity, I just walk out of my house. Don't watch this movie, it's not even entertaining.

Hostel,"I've seen a lot of movies. And even a lot of so-called sick movies. But this one was frightening, gruesome, ugly, realistic, stylistic but at the same time funny, entertaining, unpredictable and i don't know the word for ""to think about""... It was like a Rollercoasterride of perversions (and i don't mention the as you Americans would call it ""porn"" sequences, which we old Europeans would call ""evening commercials"") This is IMO very realistic. If you would live under poor circumstances you would deliver your ""guest"" to the butcher for 10.000 $.

This film made Russian women look disgraceful and in American culture they are not seen as it is. I say remove this piece of crap from theaters. Where are our standards? I did not enjoy this film one bit. From the beginning to the end, I questioned the purpose. The joy of killing was glorified.

Not once did I wonder ""Whodunit?"", there was no slow buildup of tension or fear, no in-depth character encounters, just 94 minutes of mind-numbing, IQ-draining nonsense. I realize that there will never be another Shining, Exorcist, or Rosemary's Baby, and maybe those standards are unfairly high, but surely filmmakers who probably make more money than god should at least try to EARN some of it.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Almost a classic.  The best film of its kind since the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"".","This isn't a perfect film, but this is far better than Ego, I mean Eli Roth's previous effort, ""Cabin Fever"", which failed at marrying serious horror with zany comedy. I guess he's been trained to be a good filmmaker by Tarantino himself. Even the speech about the torturer wanting to be a surgeon seemed like something out of ""Pulp Fiction"". There even seems to be a repeat of the ""Pulp Fiction"" scene where Bruce Willis spots Ving Rhames crossing a street.I came in expecting it to be a gimmicky exercise in freaking out the audience and nothing more. I was pleased to find that it engaged my interest beyond the simple showing off gore and violence as if to say ""Look what we can get away with on film!"". Yes, there are character arcs in this. The film is similar to Wes Craven's ""Last House on the Left"" in terms of basic events.Here's the weaknesses:-The first half feels a bit slow and empty and could have cut out about 5 minutes of under-dramatized setup.-While KNB gave us top-notch gore, the eyeball makeup effect (you have to see it to know what I'm referring to) was over the top, phony-looking and anatomically nonsensical for the sake of shock value.-Towards the end, things seem to become conveniently coincidental and all downhill for our hero, taking away from the tension the ending could have had.Still, I came away rather satisfied once we get into the second half of the film. The audience was loudly cheering in satisfaction upon witnessing bloody comeuppance. I'd say this is a good start for 2006. Let's hope the rest of the year will wash away the bland aftertaste of 2005.Much better than ""Saw"" and ""High Tension"". Go see it before it gets ruined by bad sequels and copycats.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
FINALLY...something unpredictable hits the theater!,"Before I start writing a long comment about how hot Jay Hernandez is and how awesome his character was in this movie, I have to say that the making of Hostel was a job well-done. First of all, it is very unpredictable. This is a quality we're losing during an era of frequent remakes. It is nice to watch a movie these days and not know how it is going to end until the actual end. When Hernandez's character escaped from where he is staying in the Slovakian city, I figured...hey, that's great, but he'll either die in the end or the evil characters will win. This is usually what happens in most horror movies, and while a lot of people like that, it gets to be quite an overused approach. The one part of the movie that did not prove unpredictable was when the Japanese girl committed suicide after viewing her deformity. (I really did see that one coming.)Another great thing about this movie is that it is somehow able to mix humor with thrilling and gory scenes. Most intense thrillers do not have truly funny moments that leave you to bust out laughing, but this movie had moments to be scared, moments to laugh as well as moments to clap.For those of you who have not yet seen the movie, I will tell you that the whole ending portion is truly different from anything you have ever seen in a thriller/horror movie before, but do not be discouraged. Change is good and it proves to be refreshing in this movie.The acting is great too. When the backpacker friends are scared, they don't give us this special thought out reaction; they just give us a realistic portrayal of fear. One panics and begs for mercy (which is probably what I would do), and the other shows fear, but also tries to use whatever strength he can muster from his brain to develop his strategy for escape (that would be Jay). I will not reveal anymore about this movie, but I will say that you just have to see what Hernandez does at the end. It will truly serve as a surprise!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
STOP hating on HOSTEL,"For all of you out there who saw Hostel and thought it was a bad movie; STOP, and think for a second. was it really the movie that was bad, or was it just that you didn't like the subject matter? i bet its the latter or the two. i am a huge horror enthusiast (my collection consists of more than 1000 horror films from various countries)and i went into Hostel expecting just another piece of crap like Cabin Fever. i was wrong. DEAD wrong. not only is Hostel very well directed, but it it hearkens back to the old 70s and 80s Italian horror and Giallo films. it shares much in common with the works of such directors as Lucio Fulci, Umberto Lenzi, early Wes Craven, and even the Japanese mad-genius that is Takashi Miike. this film also transcends genres. it is not purely horror, but a sinister look into the human mind. a lot of people comment on how the movie is very unbalanced and gory. THAT has got to be the biggest lie of them all. this film flows perfectly. it starts you off by letting you get to know the characters. you will feel for these characters when they die. they feel like friends; especially Paxton. his character is the definition of a dynamic character; as he completely changes throughout the course of this film. even in the beginning he shows signs of high intelligence. How any Americans who travel to Europe know ANY European languages? and for the gore. i have seen MANY MANY a film gorier than hostel. and most of those films were made in the 70s and 80s.to sum it up, Hostel is a good film, that succeeds on many levels. its major downfall is attracting an audience that doesn't know GOOD CINEMA, even when it hits them in the face and tortures them to death!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hostel's really not that spectacular,"I've seen hostel just a week ago and I must say I was disappointed. I really thought it would be a movie with real Tarantino dialog and a storyline with a twist, but what I saw was more like a b-movie with sick elements in it. Don't get me wrong, the storyline is very original and the movie is reasonable but certainly not what they want you to believe it is. The torture scenes are brilliant and thats why I was so disappointed that the rest of the film was pretty crappy. A movie like saw 2 is much more tense, hostel has very few tense moments, it's really all about the cutting and stabbing and burning people.

But when the group starts disappearing it becomes clear that something devious is going on and their little slice of heaven becomes hell.'Hostel' is a very decent follow-up to the director's debut 'Cabin Fever'. It does take a bit of time before the action really kicks in but one may be distracted by the ample flesh to not take too much notice to it. The ending is nice and sick with a nice amount of gore.

Poor Bratislava,"Poor Bratislava and Slovakia, talk about a place getting bad treatment from the movie industry. First it gets ""armpit of the world treatment"" in ""Eurotrip"", then it gets portrayed as the center of private enterprise torture in ""Hostel"". I saw ""Hostel"" on impulse (seeing Tarentino's name after the film title on the theater's list of show-times) without realizing it was the actually the brainchild of Eli Roth, who apparently intended it as a homage to Takashi Miike's ""Audition"". It is an improvement on Roth's boring first movie, ""Cabin Fever"". Although neither movie (Roth's stuff does not rise to the level of an actual film) is even remotely scary, at least with ""Hostel"" Roth keeps his tendency toward ""Evil Dead"" silliness in check until the last few minutes.Anyway the first half of the film is pretty much a replay of ""Eurotrip's"" Amsterdam and train travel scenes, including the funny pervert in the train compartment. I found myself wishing very early in the movie that the three guys were traveling with Michelle Trachtenberg. This wish intensified during the sauna scene in the hostel where the only exploitation elements were a skanky Russian blonde and her fat slug-like friend. The movie would certainly have benefited visually from Trachtenberg's presence or even from the ""Cabin Fever"" brunette (despite her nonexistent acting skills she at least looked good). Heck, by this time I would have even settled for Jay Hernandez hooking up with his ""Hang Time"" girlfriend Amber Barretto.Anyway the three guys arrive in Bratislava and Roth slowly reveals that it is the home ground of a club that provides its members with people to torture and kill (watch 2002's ""My Little Eye"" if you think Roth might actually be doing something original). At this point the thing starts to look a lot more like ""Toolbox Murders"" or ""The Driller Killer"" than ""Audition"" and I began to yearn for an appearance by Angela Bettis. But instead Roth gives us a confused Asian girl who can't speak English very well.Fortunately or unfortunately you never actually identify with those being tortured. But there is at least a point to all the torture as it gives the hero a reason to inflict ultra-violence once the tables are turned and the audience a excuse to mildly cheer every silly development from that point until the movie itself thankfully expires. There was no audience applause at the end as everyone was in a hurry to get out and have some BBQ down the street.To make matters worse for the Slovakia Ministry of Tourism, the one thing Roth manages to do very well is to convey the isolation felt by a tourist in a strange place and the target on the back of Americans in foreign countries these days. Given our image in the eyes of the world these days if such a torture business did exist it is likely that American victims would be in great demand and would command a healthy price premium. There are not just corrupt police but a gang of street urchins who extort gum and candy from visitors.""Hostel's"" wide theatrical release and $18 Million marketing campaign (verses just $4 Million production cost) pay homage to P.T. Barnum's comment: ""No one every went broke 'underestimating' the intelligence of the American people"". There is little danger that Roth will ever be mistaken for David Cronenberg.

"Well, It Was Better Than Cabin Fever","Well, I should start by saying that Eli Roth is an interesting person. He, I believe, helped to write movies like Citizen Toxie and Terror Firmer for Troma and directed Cabin Fever, which wasn't a bad movie, but could have been a lot more. Hostel, on the other hand, is a sick movie with some good old fashioned special effects.The two stars of the movie and a Swedish guy go off to Amersterdam to really party it out and get laid. When they check into a certain Hostel their Swedish friend disappears mysteriously. Then one of the other stars disappears leaving only one to search for his friends leading him into a sick world of murder for profit.The first 40 minutes of the movie just sucked. I hated the main characters and didn't really care about what happened to them. I hate sex craved characters in movies. The last 50 minutes of the movie is quite good and can be extremely disturbing. The special effects were great in the movie and very old fashioned in the sense that it reminds you of something you may have seen in the 80's. No CGI here, my friends! The intensity is spectacular and I actually found myself really hoping that the main lead character made it out alive. NO one deserves to get killed like this (except for the people committing these atrocities).I would say if you are looking for something sick, step right in. If you are looking for something with story, this is not your movie. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

I also must admit I am biased in this review because I love these kinds of movies just that much. However, I can safely say, gore aside, Eli Roth has created a captivating thriller that can keep the attention of even the most attention-deceived viewer.The beginning really sets you up for a different sort of movie, which is perfectly executed. Honestly thirty minutes into it I was very shocked by the sheer level of nudity.By the climax of the movie, you are enthralled and, if you have a weak stomach, about to throw up! I honestly laughed at the ""goriest"" parts because I've seen it all done before. Nothing new, nothing really shocks me anymore.Thats not it though.

"Does one of the nastiest horror films of the 21st century live up to the hype? Short answer, no","Long answer: Eli Roth jettisons the satirical potential of his screenplay in favour of... not a lot to be honest. The thing is, the torture scenes, while repugnant and disgusting, mercifully don't take up too much of the film. As a result, this is mainly a film consisting of 3 repulsive guys going around objectifying women and having sex, before as always in a horror film their search for action leads to a very bad place indeed. I have heard this film described as a satire or sociopolitical commentary of some sort, and there is something there for sure. The trouble is, there just isn't an awful lot to Hostel. It's nasty and mean-spirited but mostly it's just tedious. There are intense moments but there's not enough atmosphere; basically, the film just wonders what to do with itself for an hour before exhausting the viewer with endless torture porn towards the end. It is undeniably disturbing and the acting is good for a horror film. There's definitely an element of fear, but Eli Roth, although his direction is perfectly fine, didn't quite manage to back up his ideas with a decent script. Watch Saw instead (The first one, not those awful sequels).4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cheap piece of crap,"Is Tarantino broke or has he become greedy beyond reason? Giving his name (and his name solely) for this disgusting piece of hooey. And i don't mean disgusting as in shocking splatter and gore - i mean disgustingly bad and cheap.The first half has you thinking ""slow build-up, get over it, in time we'll get there"". But just when the story finally should start ... it get's real bad! The second half redefines the term ""predictable"". Every move or minute - you see it coming half an hour before. Except maybe the end because there is none. The story just - stops (which is likely what you hoped for at this time. So, second thought: by the time your intelligence has been utterly insulted, even this kind of none-ending is predictable).Ironically: the most realistic detail in this film would be that the average(!) girl in Bratislava (been there several times) is in fact a breathtaking beauty.

"Torture with no edge, suspense, or horror.","A certain phrase has been slung around in popular culture ever since the appearance of the Saw series, and that phrase is ""Torture Porn."" The idea behind 'Torture Porn' being a movie or story that deals with the torture of human beings with no rhyme or reason other than to illicit a sick form of pleasure to a certain audience. I've never liked the term ""Torture porn"" because I certainly got no pleasure in what I saw in the Saw movie, even if the first one is one of my favourite suspense/horror movies, but that's something entirely different. So what about Hostel, the other big name ""Torture porn"" flick? Well, although there are certain sights on display that did illicit pleasure mainly in the form of various beautiful women but that didn't really have anything to do with the torture, so I'm already straying away from calling this ""Torture porn."" But unlike Saw, there is no rhyme or reason here, so if there is a movie out of the two that deserves that title, it is Hostel.Hostel is not a good movie. The torture isn't scary as there's no tension to it. A lot of guts are spilled here and there are some painful looking scenes, but somehow Eli Roth was able to take the pain or horror out of these scenes and the only groans they got from me weren't in disgust, they were of boredom. To make something like this work as horror, it has to be tense, suspenseful, and most of all, have an edge that makes it scary instead of repulsive. Hostel can't do any of this, the only repulsion the film brings is the fact that it's yawn inducing because of how boring it is. The plot is muddled and confused and it seems to be telling two different stories - one story from an American Pie movie and the other from a wanna-be Guinea Pig horror film. Neither work, I suppose the ""American Pie"" section works a little bit only because there is some nice nudity, but it still comes off as idiocy.In the end, there's nothing here for anyone really. Its too tame and lacking in edge to please those few, sick depraved individuals that DO get off on movies like this, and it lacks the suspense and edginess required to make it scary for folks like me who want a few thrills and chills from their 'horror.' And even the part that tries to be a sex comedy doesn't really work either. Hostel is just a stupid movie with practically no appeal, no talent. I only give this a 3 because a 3 is a rather curvy number and the curves are really the only positive to this film.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
not really scary but shocking,"Before I even saw this movie I was worried. Not that the movie would terrible. But that the movie would be almost too successful. The idea is that, for the last half of this 95 minute movie, you are watching guys getting tortured, maimed and disfigured. Take away the makeup and the fact that this movie involves actors and you are basically watching a snuff film.not really scary but shocking yucky too. there weren't any real plot twists.cabin fever was better and had a real story, too.i can hardly believe there is a part 2 in the making, sick, to say the least.i hope i don't have to watc h it with my boyfriend.what input does tarantiono have i wonder? is he just a nameholder, or is he part of the creative team?there are so many better films out thyere, evedn in the horror genre.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good scare for a horror movie but no real story,"Hmm... I watched this movie the other day.. I think its a overall pretty decent movie does not have a REAL good story behind it but it a over all good movie if your looking for a good scare but you will have to ignore some of the cheep easy to spot fake things. But yeah the beginning is sort of misleading starts off more as a comedy i think, and they made the skinny pale guy look like the main character only to end up dieing at about the mid part of the movie... no real good story like i said but its a good movie if your looking for a scare but don't watch this if you do not have a strong gut for really gory movies it tends to get really bloody and graphic at some parts and even made me a little sick at part.

The most awful film I think I've ever seen!,"I absolutely hated this movie. The trailers for it were probably the only good thing about it. They definitely made me want to see it, however it was incredibly disappointing when I did.It was extremely slow to start with and the acting was mediocre. I felt for the first 30 minutes that I was watching a soft-core porn movie and this was not what I went to the cinema to watch. When it finally got down to the bit that people were waiting for, that was when the whole experience turned sour for me. There is nothing new ""gore"" wise but some of the things portrayed in it are absolutely sickening. I personally was disgusted and wondered why i had even bothered coming to see this, even though I knew about and was expecting scenes of torture. For me it was a step to far and I found myself wondering if there are actually people out there who want to do this to people and that is what sickens me most.So basically, if you want to see a cross between Eurotrip and Saw and you want to be sickened, then sure this movie is for you.I wanted to get up and leave many times during this movie and I don't doubt that I was alone in thinking this.It is awful. My advice is DON'T SEE IT! Don't waste your time or money.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Where is the gore everyone hyped?,"This movie is designed for a younger crowd. I went with my wife, who loves horror movies, and we were both watching the time so we could finally leave. What seemed to be hyped as a very gruesome and graphic film was anything but. I saw very little actual blood and gore and the parts you did see were very badly done making it was almost unbelievable.This movie is very slow to develop and uses nudity to try and keep you interested.

Give me gory or give me death (how bout both?).,"As 2006 opens up so does Hostel. I'll say this: what I got was what I expected and at the same time not what I expected. After seeing the preview for it in Saw 2 I figured I had to see it. I also immediately figured that there was going to be a lot of comparisons of Hostel to Saw 2, and that's perfectly understandable. To those who haven't seen this yet: Hostel, in my humble opinion, makes the gore in Saw 2 look like a Walt Diseny movie. This movie is absolutely brutal. The movie in the first half hour however, leads you to believe you're going to be watching another Girls Gone Wild video instead of seeing brutal scenes of torture. The nudity portion of the movie is consistent with the gore portion. Three friends are traveling around Europe looking to get stoned and get laid. After taken in by a guy in Amsterdam they're told about another country where they're going to get laid pretty much for free. They take a train over there and get exactly what they came for. Soon one of their friends disappears, and then another, until we're left with one character (sorry I'm bad with names). Desperate to find out what happened to his friends he goes on a search into a run down building to find that for a price you can do anything you want to anyone. That's the basic summery. Overall the movie is 45min of smoking pot and naked girls, and 55min of torture. The story isn't that strong but keeps the movie going. The scary thing is, is the fact that this is based upon true events. I'd recommend this to horror movie fans, Saw fans, and gore fans (which normally all run in the same category).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not exactly a trip through Disneyland . . .,"With a firm eye on the box-office, Hostel is a mixed bag of gore goodies with plenty of inspiration but a shortage of creative originality.Like a no-brainer version of Saw, Hostel starts off in a dark torture room. There then follows 45 minutes of non-violent action with three male backpackers as they wend there way through a tedious sequence of bouncing bosoms and hashish bongs. Starting in Amsterdam (portrayed none too realistically, with a marked absence of Dutch), they follow a trail given them by dodgy fellow travellers to find a hostel in Bratislavia promising to be brim-full with sex-starved women and a post-war shortage of men. When they get there, they are lured one by one to a neglected building that shows 'art exhibits', such exhibits being people gratuitously tortured and killed by perverts paying a high fee.Although much blood is used to drench the set, writer-director Eli Roth (Cabin Fever) makes the mistake of descending into black humour and then winding up with a suitably crowd-pleasing good-guy-wins ending. One rather wishes he had learnt from his brief brush with anti-Hollywood studio Troma (where he had small acting parts in the low-budget but very effective Toxic Avenger IV and Terror Firmer) and chosen either seriously nasty horror or gruesome Troma-style camp. Although there is no shortage of nauseating images, from chainsaws to surgical instruments, Hostel rather looks as if it used the British Board of Film Censors guidelines as its handbook. The camera jumps away at the crucial moment (except when violence is perpetrated by the hero), and Roth fails to stylise the brutality with either slow motion, detailed close-ups or snappy editing. The pedestrian acting is competent for the limited demands placed on it, but the script is trite and full of the sort of macho posturing American cinema would sadly have us associate with U.S. undergraduates.Such amateurishness of technique fails on two counts. Firstly, horror is defined in terms of emotional impact. Such lightweight treatment means the shock value of the ideas and images themselves have to take the full burden. Since Hostel is no better or worse than any reasonable gore flick, yet was well marketed, it at least might succeed simply by attracting audiences that are either undemanding of the genre or are shocked because of lack of exposure to good horror films.Secondly, given the story line, there are ample opportunities for creative effectiveness missed largely because, as the film has low artistic merit, it must conform to the lowest criteria of the censors. For instance, modern CGI is capable of very realistic simulation of violence (as evidenced in the scene in Irreversible where a man's head is caved in with a fire extinguisher but without the camera flinching away); good editing can also extend the emotional effect of violence to a very uncomfortable level (in Audition, the build up is so subtle, and the first movement of a person tied up in a bag so sudden, that the audience skips a collective heartbeat  and later, in the same film, sadism is extended in time until it is difficult to watch the screen). Both Irreversible and Audition are such cinematic masterpieces that the censor treats the violence more leniently  Hostel is trapped by its own mediocrity into the level of shocks it can deliver.Ironically, Roth had plenty of talent to hand, including the director of Audition, and Quentin Tarantino (both of whom have cameo parts). Yet the most artistic moments are those derived from better films: as a sadist surgeon approaches his victim and gasps for air beneath his mask it recalls the similar scene in Blue Velvet when Hopper struggles for breath in his asthma mask as he is about to attack. Another highpoint, when a torturer loses control, is effectively emphasised by the identical discordant bursts of background music that were used by Bernard Herrmann in the famous Psycho shower scene (where the short, stabbing bursts were even more appropriate). Many other scenes (such as the partly dissected Asian girl) are glimpsed only briefly and not used to their full dramatic potential.In its favour, there is some genuine tension in the car chase sequences, and the marauding gangs of children seem not only authentic but realistically threatening. A girl's suicide borrows effectively from Japanese horror as she is frozen momentarily in the camera before death. For all its superficiality, the main story is almost like a modern day vampire movie with buxom Eastern European wenches luring westerners to their doom before the main hero nails the bad guy. Its token believability (there are no mutants, ghouls, supernatural forces)  heavily supported in the official website by oblique references to horrific happenings  gives it a slightly darker twist than the modern monster movie (Hills Have Eyes) or the overworked (and so less believable) slasher series.Shot in a few months for just over four million, Hostel covered its cost more than fourfold in its first weekend. That it will shock quite a few large audiences and entertain others makes it unfair to categorise the film as worthless, but also makes it likely to be overrated.The three thrill-seeking, homophobic, racist backpackers (two American, one notably Icelandic) are so unlovable that one really doesn't care whether they are tortured and killed or not  it might make for better movies if such characters were permanently exterminated rather than going on to repopulate the more standard fare teen-slasher movie or umpteenth American Pie. In an interview, Roth claims he apologised (jokingly) to the Icelandic President for the irreparable damage he was doing to Iceland. Maybe he should just have apologised for making a bad film.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A wholesome family film everyone can enjoy...,"Hostel was quite the lightning bolt of controversy when it came out in 2006 worldwide-theatrical (from a limited run at 2005's tail-end), because suddenly a slasher film depicted Slovakia in a Texas-Chainsaw-Massacre-like style of gritty nastiness and unrestrained 'torture porn'. And because of its shock-value it's amassed quite the cult following over the years.This film and its immediate sequel make the Saw films look like the works of Charlie Chaplin and Bugs Bunny, and the real-world factor of Hostel gives the movie a sense of unease that never really lets up; it's there and stays there when the credits start rolling. This movie is most definitely NOT a wholesome tale; showing this to anyone too young to comprehend it may very well screw up their mind for life, more-so than the likes of RoboCop or The Descent.Eli Roth apparently thought about doing a documentary in Thailand covering an underworld business of actual clients paying thousands of dollars to torture or kill people, but of course the rest is history and the torture-porn movie was made instead. If it were REAL footage, it might've caused some audiences to die from actual heart attacks. That's how unnerving this stuff gets.So does this film do its basic premise justice? I'd say yes. It's not high art or an 'all-time greatest hits' kind of movie, but it hits all the right freaky notes it needs to regarding the screwed up underbelly of criminals torturing innocent people.Hostel gets 3.5/5 stars. 7/10 IMDbs.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not only does it leave one asking for plenty of terror, gore, and suspense, but it leaves one begging for something - anything remotely resembling texture or talent. The only thing it had plenty of was plot holes and breasts. The only thing deadly was the pace, slow from beginning to end. A shift in focus from one main character to the next was unexpected to say the least - and not in a good way. I use this DVD as a coaster now, to remind myself to that anything connected with Eli Roth is pure and utter stink and that my $11.49 could better be spent on films of substance, like Ishtar. I actually felt guilty for spending money on this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Over the top gore, more comical than horrifying","Eli Roth is back, this time with Hostel, endorsed by Quentin Tarentino, although I have no idea why he would want to be involved with this project. Roth has improved on his first movie, Cabin Fever, albeit, not by much.The first half of the movie does not seem to relate to the second act. The introduction consists of gratuitous T & A, while the conclusion shifts to over the top gore. I have heard people saying that the violence was so realistic, but I think that sometimes less is more, especially when it comes to horror films. I actually found the ""violence"" to be so over the top it was comical. Also the makeup was terrible, you will know what I'm talking about when you see it. I found the movie to be mildly entertaining, but I was fairly bored by the slow pace of the opening act.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Boring, boring... boring !!!","Let's see: This movie has no suspense. The story is bad. The performances are amateurs and laughable. The movie plays like a SAW wanna-be in some parts. The message? There is a message, but it's obvious that its delivery was the lesser of the intentions for the filmmakers. As it is hinted, it does not justify the movie. So what are we left with? Well, of course, with the ""visual impact"", the thing that this movie is getting famous for. But since we are so concentrated in THAT, we expect a lot from THAT. And guess what? The gore is handled with so little style and impact, leaving well evident the intention of the filmmakers of producing shock, that it doesn't work either. It would have helped a little that the actors playing the victims could act more convincing during the torture scenes. But their performances are so laughable, that we lose any sympathy for them, and just wish for the torturer to finish them right away. It's ironic that this movie is in some way related to Quentin Tarantino, since he has made graphic violence and gore something with style in his movies. But that's exactly what we miss here: in the hands of another director, it may have been a better product. As it is, it's a very good movie...for the 15 year old crowd. All of the sudden, SAW I and II seem to be masterpieces !!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Interesting Concept, Execution Lacking","Hostel has such a brilliant concept for a horror movie. Sadly though, I found the execution to be lacking. It was like sex romp comedy and horror thriller film shoved into one film, with the first part of the film being Porky's, and the second part of the film being Hostel.I have to say as a woman that I found the constant references to the ""P"" word (a female body part) to be tiring. I felt that the filmmaker was portraying female sexuality in a degrading and sensationalistic manner. Let's face it, the girls in the film were all sluts, but apparently the filmmaker thinks all women are sluts anyway, since they all run around nude in front of strange men and offer their bodies out freely like Halloween candy.I think Eli Roth is a very cool guy from what I have read about him. I just think he needs to quit making films on the junior high level.On the positive side, Jay Hernandez really blew me away. He truly carried the film.Some of the horror scenes were good, but I thought he could have pushed them further. The ending was terrible and anti-climactic. There were too many convenient coincidences used to resolve the story in the 3rd act.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Awful,When I saw the previews to this movie I could not wait to see it. I don't like to go to the theater to watch movies to many people ruin it for me. So I waited for it to come out on video so I could watch at home. I am glad I did not pay to see it in a theater. It was really a big let down. I did not find it scary at all let alone the scariest movie in a decade. I found it dull and boring. Not worth buying. Not worth rent either. But if you feel you must see it I recommend renting it. After all the hype it is really a let down. The acting was not bad. It just was not scary. It was not even all that gory. I am glad the movie was not more than 94 minutes long.,1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good movie, but nowhere near the hype!","Let me start out by saying that Hostel was a pretty decent horror film. The subject matter is brutal and unrelenting and the actors in this movie do a very good job. But...Hostel is going to be a victim of it's own hype. Every person I heard leaving the theater tonight was disappointed in some sense because ultimately, Hostel was not as scary, violent, or depraved as people have made it out to be. To me, Hostel was more of a thriller with horror elements mixed in. It was painfully slow to get going and by the time the climax hit, the movie was almost over. All in all I was very disappointed and let down when the end credits started rolling. Maybe I was just expecting too much but ultimately I think Hostel was a bit of a let-down.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Enough,"If you couldn't hold your lunch after watching Saw, Hostel will be far worse. But it's also far worse than Saw from a plot and horror perspective.Hostel tells the story of two Americans and one European (Paxton, Josh, and Oli) who are traveling through Europe drinking, partying, and sleeping with as many girls as they can. They are the stereotypical characters: Paxton is the Alpha male leader, Josh is the shy sensitive one, Oli is the big honest fella. In Amsterdam, tired of all the ""tourists"" and the sex for sale, they meet young Alex who tells them of a country that's full of young women without any virile young men, and they're all beautiful and looking for Americans.Off they go to what looks like paradise: a posh hotel with young peers, and they're even forced to room with two gorgeous and sexy women (Natalyz, Svetlana).Of course, this is when heaven turns to tell, and their hostel goes from bondage to torture.If we had more empathy for the main characters, we'd care for them during their struggles, but instead, it's only the gore that we care for, and enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Horror in 2006 started with a bang...and some blood.,"I wasn't expecting much when I saw previews for Hostel, it looked like Saw 3 to me...but I was wrong. It had a story...the whole college frat boy like guys traveling across Europe...the previews should of showed that, I think they would of got more viewers...I mean the first half of the film is very much like Eurotrip...but with more laughs and better characters. Then about 40 minutes into it your blown away and it never lets go. I actually cared about the guys which made it better then just watching some people get tortured. Some people say you have to be sick to like this or very morbid. It's like the original TCM to me in that way. Some things in it are pretty nasty and it does have a lot of gore...however, people are closing their eyes or letting their imaginations go wild. A lot is not seen, people say the original TCM is the goriest horror movie of all time...when in fact there is hardly any blood...but sometimes watching someone scream and knowing something bad is happening to them is much worse than actually seeing the knife,hammer, or hatchet tear their ass up. So in conclusion...if your a horror junkie like me. You will love it! If you get scared easily or you like Saw...you will love it! If you want to see a movie that your friends will be talking about some of the famous parts -eye scene -and you don't want to feel left out....you will love this movie! If your looking for something to take mom and dad to or watching a balls to the wall horror movie with someone just cause you want to get out ....you will hate this movie! and prob get sick!....So from a ""very morbid"" horror fan,I guess they would say.....Hostel has a spot in my top 25 horror films of all time..number 23....",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Influential -- for better or worse,"I am hesitant to call this movie ""entertaining"" because of the suffering that its characters go through.

"Standard Fair, Nothing Original","This movie really contains nothing out of the ordinary.The ""gore factor"" was no higher than other movies of its genre (i.e. Texas Chainsaw Massacre, A Nightmare on Elm Street). For a movie that seems to be banking on the prospect that it is one of the most bloody films going, it falls short.The plot becomes evident very early, so there is no real suspense (such as in Saw). The camera work is standard and the horror comes not from psychological suspense, but from the amount of blood on the screen (see above).The only redeeming qualities I found in this movie were the abundance of nudity (not really something to sell a movie on) and Ollie. Ollie's antics make the movie almost worth watching.My suggestion, wait until it comes out on video and then talk someone else into paying for the rental.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hip to like Tarantino,"I have not seen this movie yet, but I just wanted to make a comment about Tarantino's film. They are always hailed as great cinematic achievements, when in reality they are just the playing out of his puerile fantasies.Now, I have no problem with Tarantino making money off of the crap he makes, but don't tell me it is a great movie and deserves 10 stars.Tarantino may have had a couple of good movies in his early career, but nowadays, it is simply hip to like his movies, even if they don't have any entertainment value (never mind artistic value).I know, I know, personal preference plays into rating a movie, but just like I won't listen to a lunatic who claims that the earth is flat, I will not give credence to someone who says Tarantino makes movies worth a 10 rating.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Good Film, Over Rated, Too much Porn.",The movie was good. I can't get the images out of my head but it was not all that is was hyped up to be. IMO there was far too much porn.

I thought it had a great plot...Unless your a yuppie on the bash-wagon. How can I go on for ten lines without making a spoiler? I am going to see Underworld: Evolution tonight.

God help us all with minds like this at large. The first 30 minutes are mind numbingly boring. When the nasty stuff starts it gets even more boring and stupid and sick, sick, sick. There is no plot line, no real story. What was the point of it? I stuck through to the OTT ending. Then felt I needed a good bath and a drink. Before you ask-no I am not squeamish.

"A Bit of Sick Fun, that Feels Somewhat Pointless by the End","Directed by Eli Roth 'Hostel' begins as a story of two young Americans backpacking through Europe, looking for fun, sex, drugs and more fun. This section of the film is quite sexually explicit (which seems to suit the Ora of the film) and it does introduce the characters with some depth.When the unsuspecting youths are lured into a secret murder for profit business as potential victims, the movie does become a very graphic gore-fest that is pretty disturbing despite the fairly obvious low budget effects.There is slightly more here than some people have given credit for, there is some reasonable acting on show, some strong ideas and a pretty interesting story for the most part.

It seems like this movie was intended more for shock value and not giving you an awesome movie-going experience.

Intriguing,"This movie is about three young lads who backpack around Europe looking to have sex with beautiful and exotic women. The idea is that they should get laid as much as possible in order to have 'experiences' they can bring back home with them and perhaps even into their old age. This makes them prime targets for a hellish turn of events especially given their nationality as Americans. The movie is trying to tell us that sex just doesn't cut it anymore for thrills. Women are basically the same everywhere you go and getting laid is overrated. Some people need something more to feel alive. They need an adrenalin rush that can only be attained through an unspeakable act. This movie is not for god-believers or the faint of heart. Having watched several sex-and-violence-packed films, it didn't bother me very much but I would not recommend it to 'virgins'.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

However, I find it really difficult to believe all that I've heard. Ambulances having to come to the theaters? People puking and afraid to go home? Come on. This is also not to say that I want gore just for gore sake.

"Slicker, more expensive unofficial entry in the GUINEA PIG series","HOSTEL may be effectively horrific to your average moviegoer who has never seen any of the notorious Japanese underground horror/gore GUINEA PIG movies. For those who don't know, these movies are virtually plot less, shot-on-video movies depicting women being tortured, dismembered and murdered.Writer-director Eli Roth adds a story and snappy Tarantino-ish dialog to this obscure subgenre of extreme horror, but little else. Anyone who's seen more than one of these movies will find nothing in HOSTEL particularly shocking.That's not to say the movie is entirely ineffective. There are some creepy moments, impressive make-up effects and clever story elements. I thought the trio of guys getting laid and smoking pot for the entire first half of the movie, juxtaposed with the scenes of torture, mutilation and murder during the second half was a clever comment on what constitutes subversive behavior for different classes of people. College aged guys go to Amsterdam, hook up with beautiful girls and get high; older, more socially refined men go to the Ukraine and pay for the privilege of torturing an innocent person to death.Unfortunately, Roth doesn't do a whole lot with this intriguing set-up, and the movie's final moments fall in to the usual chase and revenge clichés.Despite its similarity to the GUINEA PIG series, the movie that HOSTEL most reminds me of is Joel Reed's sleazefest BLOODSUCKING FREAKS. In fact, it is, in a way, simply a more elaborate, less misogynistic remake of Reed's movie. Like FREAKS, it also attempts to excuse its outlandish gore by purporting to be a pseudo-hip black comedy. The GUINEA PIG movies, love them or hate them, are what they are. They do not pretend to be anything else but tasteless exercises in extreme gore and sleaze, and do not apologize for it.Roth doesn't have the courage to go all the way. He backs off, sprinkling the movie with hip, snappy dialog, stereotypical horror movie clichés and creepy music to remind the audience (and himself) it's all make believe, it's not to be taken seriously, it's safe.If there's one thing to be said for such sickening exercises in extreme horror as GUINEA PIG, MEN BEHIND THE SUN, CANNIBAL FEROX, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE and AUGUST UNDERGROUND, it's that they don't make excuses for themselves. They exist to disgust and shock the viewer, nothing more. Roth obviously wanted to make one of these movies himself with HOSTEL. But he doesn't have the stomach to get down there in the cinematic sewer to do it, preferring to keep his hands clean and distance himself from his own subject matter.You can't pretend to be shameless. Roth tries and fails. Still, HOSTEL is worth a look.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Painful.,"Three horny male backpackers travel to Slovakia and check into a Hostel that is awash with sexy European ladies. What starts out as a dream comes true will quickly turn into a nightmare.Brought to us by two of cinemas greatest self promoters in Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino, Hostel is wince inducing, if ultimately a shallow gore wet dream for the early male teenager. There is no doubting the impact of the ""horror"" on show, with Roth, in spite of his hyperbole as the master of shock, actually knowing how to push all the right genre buttons. But after suffering what basically is a horny youth travelogue for what seems like forever, the blood fest comes as a relief instead of a reward for nervous expectation. Within the story there's some meat as to how sick the world can be, for example one of the titular torturers here has already shown himself to be the father of ""cutie"" young daughter. And some moral posers and decisions concerning our main protagonist offer some intelligence in the script. But it still feels empty, too self aware of wanting to shock with schlock.Hostel was successful enough to spawn an even bloodier sequel, much like that film, Hostel is remembered for its gore than for any thing else of substance. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
worst movie of the year,"I defy anyone to tell me that this movie was at all suspenseful, scary, or very graphic. Suspension of disbelief is relied upon for every single event in the film that moves the plot forward. I thought that Cabin Fever wasn't very good but Eli Roth apparently forgot everything he knew about film-making prior to that movie cause this one is much much worse. The sad thing is that like Cabin Fever the concept of the story is actually really intriguing. The acting was horrible, and the execution was horrible. I hated every character in the movie equally, but apparently I wasn't supposed to hate the Hernandez character because he saw a girl drown.

Entertaining horror flick - and nothing else!,"Hostel received some really bad reviews, some of them claiming it to be one of the dumbest films of 2005. I do not know where you spent your last year, folks, but suppose it was not at the pictures, because when I last checked, there was a real sh*tstorm of much much dumber movies going on in cinemas. But then again, here in Germany the usual Hollywood crap is accompanied by even worse German productions full of fabulous new young actors that all make you want to scratch out your eyes and fill your ears with burning hot lead and finally, say, crack open your own skull and eat your own brains.Accidentally, the Slovakian torture house in Eli Roth's Hostel is very much like a German movie theatre. Only the scratching and cracking is done for you. The story is simple: two Americans come to Europe, accompanied by an Icelandic friend they enjoy the two foundations that made Europe what it is today: drugs and girls. In the Netherlands they meet a guy who promises them more drugs and girls somewhere near Bratislava, they go there and end up in a death trap. Until the torture house sequence the viewer has to endure / enjoy a load of party, fun and sex scenes. There is a lot of stupid jokes and bare breasts in this. The somewhat uninteresting second act is about the guys wandering around in town, sensing something strange going on (and one by one disappearing). The third act is straight-forward disgusting Miike torture action (and Mr Miike even does a short cameo here). There is some good suspense in this part and, of course, a mother-load of gore.I guess Hostel received most of its' bashing for being a movie with the name Tarantino attached to it while not being a Tarantino movie. Do not be fooled! Hostel does one thing very well, and that is to entertain and to keep up your interest for the whole length of the movie, and that is precisely where most American horror flicks fail today. It is a good mixture of old Italian horror, Fulci style, and modern Japanese extreme horror. It strays from the boring ""Scream"" and ""I know what you did blah"" concept of having one villain with some trademark outward appearance, but presents a bunch of nameless, multinational businessmen given the opportunity to let out the darkest parts of the human soul. The need to torture and kill which normally resides inside a sleeping repressed part of your mind is the real antagonist here. That idea, the sheer possibility of human beings paying to torture and kill another human being is what fascinated me most about Hostel, even beyond the extreme scenes of violence. That said, I have to admit that Hostel often looks kinda cheap. Effects are all well done, but camera and lighting are nothing to get excited about, to put it mildly. The score is sub-par, often even annoying and very cheap and cheesy. Acting ranges from okay to good, surprisingly, with brilliant performances by Eythor Gudjonsson and Jan Vlasak. All in all, if you are into horror flicks, go and see this one, it is vastly entertaining, brutal and fun at the same time.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
this movie is utter crap,"this movie is so stupid and tasteless that i don't know why i gave it such a high rating, 3 outa 10 is really pushing it and i only gave it a 3 because i thought i'd show a little respect to those actors who had to put up with the crappy directing and totally crappy plot line.now i will explain my reasoning behind my '3 outa 10' rating....this movie is supposed to be scary, it's not even close to scary, it's simply disgusting and totally tasteless. it was so bad that after the movie was over i took it out of my DVD player and played Frisbee with it (btw, dvds can take a lot of abuse, it took more than 3 tries to bust it against my living room wall, lol). I guess i was expecting something a little more intelligent and entertaining after listening to all the hype my roommate put into it, ""man, ya gotta see this! it's SO cool!' (note to self: Don't listen to the roommate's advice after this debacle, lol!)to me, a good horror movie needs a plot that breaks some new ground, Hostel does break new ground, it's unfortunate that the new ground was more tasteless gore in an era where tasteless gore takes the place of intelligent plots and villains with style in horror movies. this movie has no style at all, it's just sick. (i wish the director would take some cues from 'See No Evil' now that movie has some style and the gore isn't needlessly wasted, it actually serves a purpose in the plot, and the villain is genuinely scary and very capable of giving ya the creeps and that's what a good horror movie needs).i could go on all day about this stinking pile of horse manure that's supposed to be a horror movie but i already wasted 2-3 hours of my life watching the movie and writing my less-than-enthusiastic opinion of the movies' merits. if i ever catch my kids watching 'Friday the 13th' or 'Nightmare on Elm Street' i would probably condone that, if i catch them sneaking 'Hostel' into my house (or any other house for that matter) they will spend more time being grounded than most convicted felons prison sentences and they would also have write a 10 page essay to me on why it's crap and convince me that they have seen the error of their ways before i allow them a taste of freedom ever again, i would want my kids to make intelligent choices when it comes to horror movies and to me 'intelligent' and 'Hostel' cannot be used in the same sentence.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

The storyline is very simple, but what makes the movie is the torturing scene's. They are all done in a gory old fashion way and the blood flows frequently. Were SAW delivered a lot of torturing but in a bit of fantasy this story could happen. the only problem was that some people said that the gore was overdone here to but the SAW franchise down. But SAW had some good storyline that became a franchise. Again Roth made use of real babes and let them suffer in many ways. What we never thought was the fact that it had an open end. Hostel 2 came surprisingly quick after this one. Be sure to watch this first if you would like to catch up with part 2. Be aware of the 'burning eye' and the 'station scene'.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Take the kids to this one!,"I don't think some people realized this a dark dark comedy in a lot of ways. I saw Hostel tonight and really enjoyed it. I love seeing people getting up and exiting the movie theatre after systematically throwing down 8.75 to see it. Eli Roth is a very interesting director let me tell ya. Cabin Fever was hated by a lot of people, because of the humor put in place of scenes that should have been exciting and terrifying. While this turns a lot of people off to his style, it gravitates me towards it, and that's what he did with Hostel. The humor is a little more straight forward, and is brilliantly done. If you can't notice the sheer comedy of this flick, then don't bother to review it because you are to stupid for me to care how you criticize it. Roth intently mixes dark humor and vicious, spine tingling torture in a nice hostel soup. Though not really a horror movie like advertised, it is a on the edge thriller without a doubt. Also, make no mistake that this movie is incredibly brutal and shocking. My advice is bring little Billy to this movie and let him get used to this kind of Hollywood because by the time hes 18, he wont even cringe at this sort of thing....just like I didn't. I loved the torture and it kept me glued to the screen to the last horrifying scene. This movie is one guilty pleasure any gore lover shouldn't miss.

It really didn't scare me at all like House of 1000 Corpses did. It was very cheesy and the element of imagination in horror movies didn't really exist because I didn't care about the characters. They were college kids who wanted to get laid and instead got mutilated. That's not too original. I'm not saying House of 1000 Corpses is original, I'm just saying that it scared me more, especially because of Dr. Satan and its spiritual aspects. I couldn't wait for the blood and guts in Hostel, but then when it happened all I could do was laugh my ass off at how fake it looked. When the girl's eye popped out I was laughing SO HARD. If you must see this horrible film, rent it... do not buy it. The ending was especially craptacular.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Not a good horror flick, has some OKAY moments","This Quentin Tarantino produced picture kind of disappointed me. I liked how it started, it kind of set up a tone which you wouldn't expect it to turn scary, however instead of actually startling you, this film just disgusts you. The performances were decent, the characters were interesting, the writing wasn't bad, but the scenes of gore and disgust didn't really help the film. The direction didn't make it scary, kind of ridiculous, the idea was great, but this film had the potential to be a great thriller like Saw or something but it just fell apart in its 2nd and 3rd act and the first act felt like a softcore porn film, which makes it sad that the 1st act was actually the most entertaining part of the film. Jay Hernandez was good in the lead, this guy was decent in Friday night lights and torque and was one of the bright spots of this movie. Hostel is kind of disgusting, but it was over the top for me and didn't meet my standards of a good thriller or horror picture. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just a Mindless Movie,"I'm not fond of this kind of movies. A movie, with sex and gore as the main theme, definitely not my favorite kind of movie.

If you're talking about ""don't talk to stranger"", it's a kid talk. It's not a morale anymore.Hostel, at one side just show us how a bunch of kids like to j**k off and have sex, while the other side, just a bunch of people who are hungry for gore, and torture's show.What happened when the both side met? Hostel is what you got.If hostel is trying to stand out for being the goriest movie, perhaps it will stand out. But not, if Hostel want to stand out as the good movie. No way.It's really nothing, compared to SAW trilogy.Don't put up too much hope on this movie... Believe me. You want a genius and gory movie, watch SAW trilogy. At least, SAW doesn't just exploit gore and blood, but also a message of morale, but in a rather bizarre way.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Torture... to watch.,"A key thing in setting up horror is making sure that we as an audience care for the characters and are thus frightened and/or disturbed when they are killed off. ""Hostel"" simply presents killing and torture for the sake of killing and torture. The characters are drug and sex seeking college students with lackluster character development and very graphic and disturbing death scenes. This film is practically snuff legalized - ""gorno"" (as I've heard it called) - or whatever you wish it to be called, but the point is, it is sick. It is a lazy, sadistic, bloody mess that desperately tries to be scary but is mainly just repulsive. It has all the things that slasher fans would want - sex and nudity and graphic killings - but absolutely nothing to put them together in the form of a solid story. The string of events is just a thin string that leads the audience along and not really caring where it ends up, just as long as the need to show sex scenes before showing lots of gore scenes is fulfilled.The scenes of torture are admittedly well-done movie splatter, and if their aim is to disturb, then they do their job very well. However, in the age of the art of special effects, the art of story telling (which used to be the primary driving force for films) is taking a backseat. Or rather it is being intentionally put into the backseat by filmmakers who only want to get cheap material sensations out of their viewers. Any fan of horror can name many films in the genre that have considerably less gore, but are so much better due to them having a storyline that is worth paying attention to. ""Hostel"" is just splatter and gratuitousness in one package. What is even worse is that the slasher sub-genre is essentially the simplest form of horror (killer, victims, blood, scares), but this is even worse than that, since they intentionally spoiled the most critical element. --- 3/10BsCDb Classification: 18+ --- brutality, violence/gore",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""Not The Shocking Horror We Wanted, Or Need""","3 friends backpacking through Europe look for sex and booze. They hear about some kind of Hostel that offers beautiful naked women and no attachments. They go off in search for this place, but instead find a torture house. Soon they are finding themselves in a heap of trouble.Eli Roth is being hailed as the new face of horror. As of right now, with the current features under his belt; I must ask myself, why does this guy have this title? Granted I liked Cabin Fever, with it's homages left right and centre to the genre, but was it good enough to have its director considered 'Horror Master'? After watching Hostel, I still sit here dumbfounded.Upon this films release (and after it as well) the only thing I kept hearing was how sick and twisted it was. How there was no real story and that a film like this should not be in print. Being the horror fanatic that I am, I was hoping to see something that I, and the fans of the genre, can enjoy while everyone else trashed it. Now after seeing Hostel, I sit here on the fence as to whether or not I liked it. It's not the vile, porn-torture, disgust of a film that I thought it was, but it wasn't a horrible piece of trash either.Roth knows the genre well, which is evident in how he presents the film and the style throughout. This is it's high and low points. The film looks beautiful in the second half, but Roth overexposes the viewer to what makes horror movies horror movies. For example, an action film usually has gun fire and car chases; horror films usually have blood, sex and violence. In Hostel, we get overexposed with an obscene amount of nudity, then the second half is an obscene amount of sadistic violence. The film plays like two different movies. The first half is soft core porn and is shot like a teen slasher film, while the second is 'considered' a snuff film, shot with a grittier look.My problems with the film are scattered throughout it's running time. For everything good in the film, there is something bad. Horror films are suppose to make you feel a certain number of things. One is to be scared, yet this film is not scary. Instead Roth relies on graphic violence to scare his audience. People claim that the film is a gory trip through hell and back. Did I miss the train? Hostel, to sum up in one sentence: Does Not Live Up To The Hype. I don't know if it's the sick films I've seen prior (Cannibal Holocaust, Dead-Alive, Evil Dead), but Hostel is not what it seems. The film tries to go for shock, but fails to deliver any in its poor attempt.I appreciate the acknowledgement of other horror films Roth shows us. Any horror fan can point out certain places and things Roth homages. One that I liked was seeing Takishi Miike walk out of the warehouse. Here is a person Roth admires greatly and by the time you're reading this has probably already directed 3 more films. While I am not a total fan of Takishi yet, I can respect his films. You can see a touch of his style here. Nobody should be fooled by the title Tarantino Presents. Other then promoting a friends film, he has no touch here. It's a shame, cause this film could have used a touch up.It is suspenseful in some scenes, but the way Roth constructs them is horrible. We are suppose to believe that the main character will go back to save a life, simply because of one line of dialogue earlier? To explain, our so called hero says that he once saw someone die and he could have done something to save her. Later on in the film he hears the screaming of a woman and goes to try and save her. Despite this never happening in real life(unless the person is someone you know/love) the fact that the only suspense in the film comes from this poor explanation, it taints the rest of the film.So in the end, I can't recommend this to any real horror fan, or even people looking for a good film. Instead watch it if you're a fan of the stuff. If your favourite movies include Saw Wolf Creek, then Hostel may be the film for you. I found myself wanting to enjoy it, but simply couldn't. I'll have to wait and see what Roth can deliver to us later, then maybe he can earn his horror title.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not for the Weak,"The beginning of the movie should be rated X.. lots of sex and naked women. I was afraid the movie wasn't going to go anywhere except to the bedroom scenes. I was wrong. Lot's of blood and gore for all those who are looking for the excitement of a horror movie. I have been to Europe, including Eastern Europe and enjoyed seeing the scenery, buildings, etc, although in all honesty it doesn't matter a whole lot where it is taking place. I guess because it is taking place in Slovakia it makes it more believable for us westerners. Heck terrible things don't happen here! (Jeffrey Dahmer?). As I watched the movie, I was able to figure out what would happen next most of the time, but that can be said of most horror movies, but we watch them for their shock appeal.

Good Horror Movie,"this movie is a brilliant horror movie. the gore is just o.t.t and its the kind of movie i like however i gave it a 9 rating because it takes a long time 2 get into it. i don't even see the point of the whole sex part? couldn't they end up in that country 4 another reason except sex and drugs? but when that part is over the movie gets better and better, and u kinda 4get how they ended up there looking 2 have sex with a girl. the storyline is great and keeps surprising you. a great horror movie, not for the faint hearted, if u don't like blood guts and gore this film is not 4 u. its original and being based on true events makes it more scary. if u watch the DVD extras you seem to understand the movie that bit more. and in a way your glad that certain people get killed and others don't. if u love these kind of movies get Hostel. i hope my comment helped but didn't give 2 much away.x",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Is this entertainment?,"This is disturbing. I did not feel entertained afterward, just sick and melancholy.*Spoilers below*The build up is fun and somewhat realistic for those having traveled on trains in Europe. but then torture, gore, death and murder in a WAREHOUSE seems like NOTHING NEW for this genre except for the level of violence.Then, around the time when we could enjoy someone escaping the madness, we get a girl committing suicide due to her shame of disfigurement -- and sadder still, it was predictable.Then the guy escapes but not before the revenge murders in the same torturous fashion. You expect him to kill the guy, knowing this will possibly end the torture club etc. But by showing the violence, you feel he is just like the sick killers. Maybe that's this movie's depressing purpose, to show our « eye for an eye » sense of justice.I don't want moralizing and certainly don't expect a Disney ending, but this movie focuses on the worst of human nature and I don't recommend it.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
More gross than scary...,"The common mistake that horror movies usually make today is using too much blood and guts and relying on grossing out people instead of scaring them, Hostel is one of them. The story was decent and the thought of the story alone is quite a scary one. The acting was mediocre, there wasn't really anyone who stood out. The main three characters are the stereotypical teenagers you normally see in horror movies: the weed-smoking, sex-obsessed teenagers who don't care for nothing as long as they get laid, they hardly had any personality throughout the entire movie which brought the movie down a little. The scenes, however, were well executed and the violent torture scenes were scarily realistic. The direction from Eli Roth is great and it makes you think what went on in the twisted minds of the creators while making Hostel.Even though the movie is quite a good movie, I felt like it relied too much on grossing people out with the torturous scenes in the movie. I didn't get scared throughout watching the movie but the idea and the thought of it is quite frightening. I think it could have been a very memorable movie for the story but, because it focused more on grossing out, it will remain memorable for the blood and gore which is a shame. However, if you like being grossed out, then there's no doubt you'll probably like this too but if you want a movie that focuses entirely on the story and gives you a good scare, don't see it.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
bloody and chilly,"Cast is pretty unknown but these American twenty something are well - assorted.

Maybe Slovakia (though the flick was shot in Czech Republic) is portrayed too much like a monsters land but the idea of post college European backpacking turning into a nightmare has its originality.

They deserved it,"Strange movie. It's like a product of America's post 9/11 mentality meets Porky's. In my opinion, it's worth a look, but I'm not sure what it's trying to say. If it's about American paranoia, and the fortress mentality of ""everyone's out to get us"", it works pretty well, except for one thing: the three leads are selfish, dick-driven ****holes who deserve everything they get. This may be Eli Roth's point, but I doubt any American Hollywood Director would have the cojones or the principles to assassinate his career by making a movie that pushes the view that Americans abroad - including the troops in Iraq - are not heroes or liberators, but are, in fact, ignorant, vulgar, boorish interlopers. Once you take that out of the equation, there's not much left - if it's not a critique of American mentality & foreign policy, then what is it? Purely in horror terms, it fails dismally. It's neither disturbing, suspenseful nor scary and, in terms of gore, it pulls its punches badly (even on the ""unrated"" DVD). So, having said that, 6/10 is giving Roth the benefit of the doubt - maybe he really has tried to slide a subversive something into the American unconsciousness. If he has, then hats off to him - after all, isn't that what really good horror is all about?",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is a movie that had a lot of potential...,"Unfortunately, it didn't live up to its potential. Unsatisfactory, predictable. I'm not a major fan of gore, although I need not have worried about there being too much gore in this film: it's mostly implied. There are buckets of stage blood, but not necessarily more than was used in ""Seed Of Chucky"". I saw where someone suggested that ""Hostel"" might be better classified as an action-thriller, and I would say that's probably true. It just doesn't measure up as a ""horror"" flick. Not that the potential wasn't there... Still though, it's better than Plan 9, or Manos. I guess I'd have to say it's worth watching if the only other options are ""Degrassi"" on Nick, or ""Oprah After The Show"". Yawn.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hostel combines the best of implicit violence (sounds and screams of despair) with effects very well realized within the purest explicit violence,"Hostel is a horror film of the ""gore"" subgenre, which bets on extremely violent and shocking scenes to hold the public's attention. With intense torture scenes, the film has a completely bizarre story behind its gory script. According to Roth, who signed the script, he was inspired by a ""murder vacation"" website, which consisted of paying a sum and traveling to Thailand to kill someone. Before the idea of making a feature film, he considered the possibility of making a documentary as soon as he discovered that the place really existed. However, he gave up, as he would have to sign up on the site to get more information and enter his credit card number. Therefore, he thought it best not to go ahead with the project as it would be too risky to leave the creators of the site with their personal data.The great secret of O Hostel is really the wet and slippery shock and its only intention is to amuse sadistic spectators, of which the Marques de Sade would be proud. Eli Roth is also quite happy in choosing the setting for his story. It is located in Bratislava, capital of Slovakia, a city that the general public knows little about, thus stimulating the imagination. The urban charms shown on the big screen, however, do not belong to the place, but to the old neighboring Czech Republic, favorite destination of producers for its devalued currency, natural beauty and preservation of centuries-old buildings. Unexplored by cinema, Brastislava emerges with an aura of mystery that would not work in any other well-worn tourist destination in Europe. This idea of an isolated, ancient, abandoned and sinister place manages to place the viewer inside the whole situation, making it believable and elevating terror to a new level.Hostel seeks to present a proposal that is different from most works of its kind. There is an effort to deviate from common sense, from the current discourse that sex and violence films need nothing more than - get this - sex and violence to please. It turns out that never before - and increasingly - sex and violence have been so trivialized; never before have they been so much a part of the viewer's reality. It's getting harder and harder to shock, just as it's less and less bothersome to show for the sake of showing. Therefore, the attempt to execute a dynamic plot, in which the genre is accompanied by an engaging story is welcome. However, Roth's stumbling block may be precisely in the script.Of course, the film is not a masterpiece, not even a genius story. Let's face it: there's nothing quite so brilliant about 90 minutes of blood and torture. The story itself is nothing extraordinary. And while the film fulfills its basic objective, which is to grab the viewer by the hair and keep them glazed over until the last minute, there are some very glaring problems of structure and script. The main one is how, from a certain point on, everything that happens depends on luck - a happy slip, an encounter in a lane, identifying the voice of someone on a crowded train, and so on.... Anyway, things that, in real life, would hardly happen, although they seem cool in the cinematographic universe. This ""class B cinema"" tone makes Hostel lose the atmosphere of a serious and realistic film, losing badly in comparison with a classic like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, for example.The first part of Hostel flows naturally. The light, comic tone is perfect for reaching the restless audience sitting in movie theaters. The production knows well what its target is. The young people on screen are the perfect reflection of them. Thus, the film manages to create two important devices: empathy between the spectator and the characters, and the atmosphere to be dissolved in the course of the narrative, in order to shock. Starting from the typically American xenophobic premise that the European imagination is full of promiscuity and ""free love"", Hostel begins by displaying an atrocious futility of tourists, who only think of ways to consume sex at any cost. Dutch liberal girls hide a strange intent, actually a reprimand for fools who seek to get numb and have sex indiscriminately. The expectations of the first act are not confirmed. What is headed for psychological tension results in a heap of frights. Scares and blood, a lot of blood.In a way, Hostel develops as Um Drink no Inferno, Quentin Tarantino's script magnificently filmed by Robert Rodriguez: the spectator is ""deceived"" with a calm, light and even funny beginning, and suddenly thrown into a tense and bloody hell without any major explanations - like you're watching Eurotrip, that fun, silly comedy about young Americans in Europe, and halfway through the movie someone put Wolf Creek on your DVD without you noticing. The first 45 minutes of Hostel are slow, focusing more on the trio of friends' parties and adventures and overflowing with a silly sense of humor; but the moment the characters end up in the dungeon, then the beast catches. Drills, sharp scalpels, dentist drills and chainsaws, among other no less threatening tools, begin to appear and completely change the tone of the film.Roth brings back, in this second film, several elements that already appeared in his debut Cabana do Inferno. Most notable is the sick sense of humor, with black humor and double enterers. Anyone who liked that ""gun for the niggers"" take on Cabana do Inferno will go wild with the new pun that Roth put in Hostel, this time involving a bunch of street kids from Bratislava who could supposedly kill someone for a handful of chewing gum. Another element that brings Hostel closer to Cabana do Inferno is the variety of quotes from other films. Although Roth has stated that he wanted to make an original script, without quotes, it is undeniable that he is something of a terrifying pop culture blender, much like Tarantino is of dark cinema in general. During projection time, you can fish for all sorts of quotes or homages to other films, from the running over of Marcelus Wallace in Pulp Fiction to the famous final scene of the original Chainsaw Massacre (involving a slide and chainsaw on), passing by. Also for a grateful tribute to the bloody ""subway scene"" from the oriental movie Suicide Club.The most interesting reflection in the script for Hostel, however, is the intimate relationship between money and the ""power"" to do as you please - even if torture and murder are included there - are at the heart of a very popular American production. Since the first news about its development appeared. And no wonder: Hostel has a banal but terrifying plot about the darkest side of the human mind. The film introduces us to a place where seemingly ordinary people can pay for access to depravity, torture and murder, as if they were normally going on vacation. In short, a kind of Disneyland for insane and psychopaths - in this case, wealthy businessmen with money to pay for the ""adventure"" of being murderous torturers for a few hours.That Hostel is sadistic, there is no doubt about it. After all, what other adjective could be used for a movie that depicts people being tortured in graphic detail? (At one point, fear and pain cause a tied victim to vomit in horror!!!). The problem is the following: after so many comments that Hostel would be ""the bloodiest"" and ""the most violent"" movie in history, and all the posters showing absurdly graphic scenes (the one with the drill stuck in the mouth is brilliant, but such scene does not exist in the film), many people ended up preparing for the worst, for a human butcher shop, for a visit to a slaughterhouse. And it is not so. Roth often shows grotesque things on stage; but, on several other occasions, he prefers to use only sounds, or creative cuts, to leave part of the horror in the spectator's head, without making it explicit. In a brilliant moment, reminiscent of the good ""70s"" days of The Chainsaw Massacre and Last House on the Left, a young man tied to a chair has an unpleasant encounter with a German businessman (Jan Vlasák), who confides in him: ""I always dreamed of being a surgeon..."". This while sharpening, menacingly, a brilliant scalpel! The viewer already expects the worst; the victim, helpless and completely helpless, begins to cry and begs to leave (in an interpretation so realistic that the actor actually appears to be scared and hurting). Suddenly, the ""surgeon"" starts making cuts that the camera doesn't show - the spectator only hears the chilling sound of the flesh being cut and the victim's screams of pain. It's the kind of psychological torture that special effects tend to destroy. And the extent of the disaster will only be known moments later, when the tortured rises from his chair.Which also works with a sense of isolation that makes the whole situation more tense and hopeless. The three young people are far from home, in an unknown city in a country they know little or nothing about. They barely know the local language; they don't know who to ask for help or where to go in an emergency - worse: no one knows they are there to help them. And when the animal catches, how do you know who to trust? Are the police not part of the scheme? What if all the citizens of Bratislava are together in the terrible business of selling human lives?In the end, Hostel combines the best of implicit violence (sounds and screams of despair) with effects very well realized within the purest explicit violence (prepare to see a chainsaw in action ""on-screen"", something like the remake of The Chainsaw Massacre showed how it should!). And Hostel delivers exactly what it promises: 1h30min of violence and tension, no more, no less. The film doesn't pretend to be genius, to include twists or surprise endings; it's just a good horror story, which keeps the viewer stomach-churning and in permanent suspense from start to finish.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Bloody trash but unrealistic!,"I saw this movie today and was quite surprised of its brutality.I haven't seen anything like that since Saw movie.I'm big fan of horror movies and this one roused my curiosity.What struck me most was a brutal,sick,bloody scene when this humpbacked CageOrk was throwing human parts into incinerator.It was so nasty and disgusting that I'd barely hold myself from throwing up.For me it seems that negative sides of this movie overweights positive sides .I find the plot quite interesting and designing.Three guys traveling around the Europe seeking for nice chicks.Plot unfolds steadily and until the halfway we don't see any gore actions.It seems like Roth prepared the surprise for the end.The main feature of this movie is not to scare you but to make you feel sick of watching so brutal and disgusting scenes.For me this movie is not so scary but brutal,sick,and bloody.Especially when it comes to the torture scenes.As for its negative sides there are plenty of them.The main flaw is the realism of this movie.Where the hell did you see a whole town involved into such kinda business????Why didn't the authorities know about this town?Or Roth supposes that the whole Slovakia is corrupted and there is no law in this country and their state exists only by the income of this animal business?How could be nowadays such a big town not indicated on the map?All this seems pretty far from reality...Another problem of Hostel is that it doesn't correspond the reality.The main mistake that Hollywood Directors make while shooting a movie about Soviet countries is that they don't rely on real atmosphere that takes place in that country but make up an image that they got in USA about Soviet countries.In fact this image has nothing to do with what really happens in such countries.And when people from Soviet countries watching Hollywood movies portraying the life in their countries in absolute different way they just get angry on USA for turning the real facts into fake one.Same story with this movie.Svetlana and Natasha are 100% Russian names so why did Roth use them to introduce Slovakian Gils?Why he couldn't come up with native names????Another scene that struck me is the car scene.I'm not living in Slovakia but i doubt that in modern Slovakia you can find Soviet cars like Volga and Moskwitch.Another question that stuck in my head is about the ""surviver"".Why didn't he after watching and witnessing such an awful scenes just get his ass as quick as possible from this place?If he was so horrified and shocked why did he turn back to save an absolutely unknown for him girl and how could those gangsters standing near the cars didn't notice him getting into Volga?In my opinion any normal human having a chance to escape from this hell wouldn't come back but d use it to get out of this place as fast as possible!!!!All doubts and questions that come up after watching Hostel make me thing of some weaknesses dismissed by the Director.I wouldn't say that its not worth watching but because of these flaws i cannot say this movie is a great horror movie.For those who likes gore and brutality this movie is worth watching but if you are to sensitive for blood you better leave this One out.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
I didn't see anything I hadn't already seen done better in Saw over a year ago.,"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.We'll go ahead and lay this out - this movie had a truly sick, disgusting premise. You would think that with a theme as out there, and true to life as this, that a filmmaker could really say something.This movie could have pushed the limits of film-making. This movie COULD have been a commentary on human nature, the desire for blood, how money can buy anything, the inherent evil nature of humanity, SOMETHING. This movie could have been so many things, but it ended up just being a typical big screen horror film. Same stupid, formulaic plot we've been seeing since we started watching horror. It's a shame nobody can seem to make horror with a solid plot line.I'll give it some credit - it had something going for it until the end. Then it tried to wrap itself up too fast, and lost any and all plot credibility.Long story short...I didn't see anything I hadn't already seen done better in Saw over a year ago.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disgustingly good!,"What is the film about?The students come to Amsterdam for the holidays, and then go to a hostel in Slovakia near Bratislava

And there are various kinds of entertainment happening to them.A slow first half, but then the blood of the intestine and what not. It is remembered for a long time.You can advise people who like horror films of the 2-7 saw type due to their cruelty. The plot is weak there.Hostel 2 (2007)
It's the same, but instead of 3 students, there are 3 female students.The carnage, blood and guts begin even later than in the first part, but the ending and the behavior of the main characters are more interesting here.Watch only if the first part has gone too far.Tarantino also produced the first 2 parts!Hostel 3 (2011)

"Fetish for slashing, chopping and breasts","Eli Roth wanted to make a statement. He wanted to show Americans about there ignorance of the world outside there own. Hence he decided to use his talent to make a ignorant film about a fictitious place in the hell hole of a former soviet block nation, where rich people visit to fulfill there dark desires of killing a person the way there minds intends. A well oiled industry of Slovenians performs the duty of finding the victims for there clients. Whether the statement the director intended to put forward had reached or not through this movie is not known, but it surely does not matter, as the message about the ignorance of common Americans is reiterated each week by several Hollywood films. Eli Roth need not have tried so hard.But looking back at the movie Hostel by Eli Roth which is backed by master of gross, greasy violence in cinema Quinton Tarrantino does not does perform efficiently on the gore quotient. Yes they are very much there, but cannot be said that was the only thing in director's mind while making the movie. The three leads in this slasher movie are straight out of the American Pie franchise. All they have in there minds while moving around Europe are Breasts. Our frat boys, two friends from U.S and other one from Barcelona (so you pretty much know who is going to die first) give us a very insightful tour of Amsterdam's erotic world. Every corner they go girls over there are ready to get laid. A very whacky sequence of the boy's trip down a whore house gives us the idea of the broad and bold textures the makers have planned to use for the film ahead. So showing Amsterdam as sex capital of Europe is very much top of the director's mind. Heck! When our boys enter a local apartment, a couple are busy in there all stoned lovemaking session, oblivious of anyone else being in the room. This is where a very helpful person for our sex starved American tourists informs them about the much better quality of breasts available in the eastern block at Bratislava where due to some war there are very few men left, hence chicks over there are really sex starved pouncing over any stick. So we enter Bratislava, complete with run down factories and yes, the information is right, sex starved women. I mean, for the first hour or so there are breasts hanging all over Europe (some deeply affecting war they had!). So the scene is set and the boys have fulfilled there appetite on the very first night and the Barcelona guy has gone missing apparently with a Japanese girl, who is also present in the hostel with her other friend named Kaana. Now moving around Bratislava, one finds out that the only talent these people had in there country was Torture. They even had a torture museum. And the kids over there are ready to smash heads of anyone for even a packet of gums (after all they are nurtured by the best in the world). So now the movie begins, as our frat boys are sucked into the crowning glory of Bratislava, The torture industry (looking at the rates the clients pay and the voluntary work of the entire town for the cause, this industry must be the economical hub of Bratislava). So our boys go through the entire torturing process with only one survivor, who then goes over to save the Japanese Kaana from a maniac whose torture process of using a burner to melt the eyes off is the ultimate bottom. And then our frat boy hero, uses scissor to cut off Kaana's hanging eyeball (after which I lost my appetite for mustard sauce). Slashing, chopping and then some rescue effort from hell, this movie simply wont cheer you up.Eli Roth's jumbled screenplay wastes too much time in build up to the ultimate slash fest and breasts. The boys are not exactly charming either for us to care for them. There is no room for creativity in the film except for a very chance confrontation of a client and our hero discussing about how to fulfill the rush for killing. In the end what was suppose to be a global Texas chain saw massacre kind of epic gore fest turned out to be a dampener. And the message Mr. Roth wanted to spread about the ignorance, this movie did made me check about Bratislava and Slovenia on the net. Success!",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Excellent Visuals and Special Effects,"This movie is visually jarring and in many ways disturbing. At the same time it probably points to a truth that similar ""hunting operations"" do exist in some odd pockets of this world for the ultra-wealthy, So, I don't consider this horror story pure fiction. It has a share of nudity (mainly women, why not also some of the men?) but the nudity is not really gratuitous because it adds to the plot line. That is the main problem with this movie though--there is a very thin plot here. Basically you know the plot from the advertising and there is no character development, no strange twists or turns (relatively speaking), no revelations, epiphanies--not even the seeds of a sequel. I think Amsterdam gets a slap in the face as only a place for sex and soft drugs--Amsterdam is a lovely city to visit, has a great deal of culture and is a place to experience just for the free attitude of its inhabitants. I thought it interesting that this movie was set in Slovakia--kind of hearkens back to the Frankenstein, Dracula horror movies--perhaps the movie is stereotyping that part of the world too? The guts and gore are not as bad as I heard, but they are still not for the faint of heart. This movie would most appeal to teenage boys I think. This movie is not a ""Salo"" (which had a plot and some artistry to it despite it being as disturbing as ""Hostel"") more on the order of a ""Caligula"". I went to see it out of curiosity, wouldn't see it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A film that makes you ask Why?,"I got this film on a recommendation, and given that I enjoy horror films in general, I thought I'd rent it and see what I thought.From the outset I was just waiting for the main characters to get killed off, they were bland and banal, and for the first 40-50 minutes the only enjoyment you're likely to get from this film is the several shots of pretty girls, and several of them naked.When the plot actually kicks in, the idea is at first laughable, as these three friends wander off to eastern Europe to find the fabled hostel. What follows I suppose is intended to be shocking, but the set-up is so horrendous that I was waiting for some sort of twist or extra dimension to rescue this film which was already circling the drain.What follows mixes a few stereotypes in with some slightly substandard special effects, and finishes it off with such disdain that you wonder if the screenplay was written in an afternoon.I'm unsure of the intended target demographic of this film, given that it would have appealed more to me if I had been around 14-15, although as far as I'm aware its an 18 certificate.And as for Tarantino, I truly wonder if he has lost the plot a little, and it puts me off watching his future work if he was so ready to plaster his name over this half-baked project.Avoid this if you can, there's a huge range of better films out there.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Another example of a great premise unfulfilled due to poor writing,"Wearing the chevron of Quentin Tarantino, Eli Roth has created one of the first gore-filled horror films to hit mainstream theatres in recent memory. HOSTEL, the latest film from the writer/director of CABIN FEVER (2002), has an advertising campaign that makes it come across as a filmed abattoir on steroids.For those who have asked, I've summarized HOSTEL as follows: 1) Take the most gore-filled, pain-filled, dismemberment-filled scene you can remember that makes you flinch just by thinking about it. (I, for instance, use that 5 minute scene from the end of the disappointing AUDITION (1995).) Now, repeat that for about 40 minutes.2) Now take an hour of American PIE (1999) and drop it in the front. In hindsight, I probably should have told everyone to take EUROTRIP (2004) instead.HOSTEL was an intensely gory film, which was poorly written, very very poorly acted, and ultimately only moderately executed.In fairness, the premise was actually superb. I don't want to give too much away, but the premise was reasonably believable, and while not an entirely novel concept, it was given a fresh spin.However, the story was structured in the worst possible way. The first hour was nothing more than pointless nudity (and I don't even mean entertaining, I just mean utterly boring) and cheap humor. Sitting through the first half was tedious and had us wondering, ""are we in the right film? THIS is the great horror film that's been hyped?"" The film then takes a drastic right turn and delves headfirst into gore. Explicit gore. And lots of it. For about 40 minutes.I can only assume that when writing the film, Roth tried to go for maximum contrast: really funny and lighthearted, and then, WHAM, what the Hell is happening?! The failure lies in both the pacing of the first half (insufferably long, light on suspense, total lack of atmostphere), and the horribly written characters. In many horror films, the ""protagonists"" are annoying, and you're just waiting for the Big Bad to kill them. Here, they're so annoying, that you just get bored waiting for it to happen.The gore, however, is delightfully extreme, if you're into that sort of thing. Lots of puncturing, slicing, laceration, dismemberment. Good times, for those who enjoy. But that make it a good horror film? No. No, it doesn't.A good gore scene will make the average person wince. 20 gore scenes in succession just kind of dulls the senses. If not used tastefully (see SAW 2 (2005)), gore for gore's sake just becomes another load of special effects.On the bright side, the gore miraculously managed to escape an NC-17 for reasons that I'll never understand. With the more liberal R rating, and a limited release, HOSTEL will likely be considered a commercial success. This is good, for two reasons: 1) Maybe HOSTEL 2 will be to HOSTEL what SAW 2 was to SAW: a dramatic improvement in writing and ambiance that greatly enhances the rewatching of the original.2) A commercial success for HOSTEL could conceivably drive the industry away from these atrocious PG-13 teeny slasher flicks, and back towards some more serious, disturbing, dark material. Look: I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and quite frankly I likely never will.Do I recommend HOSTEL? Not really. If gore really does it for you, have at it. Otherwise, just watch American PIE and the first 20 minutes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
If Gratuitous Violence is Your Cup of Tea,"The first of, I beleive, three Hostel outings. The beginning is rather slow. In fact it takes mabe 35 minutes to get into the actual plot.

Hostel? No thanks!,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. And why? From the very beginning to the end it's about nothing and less than that.

Furthermore, things are completely wrong presented in this movie and Slovakia is shown as the country where live only prostitutes. There are many 'mistakes' that could be intended (i have no idea why?!?!) but it disgusted me so much. Example: Prague's main station is shown as some German train station (it is done in many movies but this is so obvious that the station is in Prague) and Bratislava (capital of Slovakia) is shown as some town with 10,000 inhabitants. So please don't expect it to be good, because it is not good! Save your evening and have a bottle of wine instead of watching this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Crass teens get their asses kicked by a larger evil.,This film uses a tried and true scenario-crass over privileged teens from North America travel to a less privileged country and get their asses kicked by a greater evil than having no class whatsoever. The film works at a basic level but without giving away the plot lets say the film creates a false sense of victory at the end that the sequel squashes within its first five minutes. In that way this film is nothing more than a conduit to an even darker tale of hopeless suffering & evil. It could be seen as a cautionary tale and perhaps in a way it is. Who knows what goes on in out of the way villages in darkest eastern Europe. Transylvania is in Eastern Europe. This story is derivative of the story of Count Dracula on many levels. 'Vlad The Impaler' was a sadistic individual who killed entire villages via cruel torture methods. Much like the antagonists in this film-a Russian gang operating out of a secret hiding place & camouflaging their particular brand of satanism beneath the disguise of organized crime. Whats the message here? I suppose don't go to such towns-if you value your life. I can see that.,4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not what i was expecting,"When i first heard of this film i was thinking oh Tarantino is producing it, its made by the cabin fever director, and it looks pretty gory. When i first saw the trailer i thought it looked somewhat like a Saw ripoff. I saw this film last night in a pretty crowded theater. The basic story is 3 friends are in Amsterdam and basically just getting high and looking for girls which they find out are very easy to come by. They here about a hostel with these great girls that will satisfy them so they head out there. Then they find out what awaits them at that hostel. I was pretty disappointed with this movie, the trailers seem to put it out as a real scary gory film when its honestly not. This movie is just about as gory as Saw. There's a lot of humor in the movie which i didn't really know about because the trailers are pretty misleading and really don't let you even know anything about the story. There's a few cool scenes but i was expecting a lot more. This movie is not very good, its definitely better than cabin fever but thats not particularly a good movie. I recently saw wolf creek and think both movies rank around the same score but i would say i enjoyed hostel a tiny bit more. Both movies start out pretty slow and could have been trimmed down in time drastically. If you really wanna go out to the theater and see a horror movie then this is the one to see right now but honestly i would just wait for the DVD. Instead of seeing this movie you might want to maybe rent some of the good newer horror movies like devils rejects, saw, high tension which i all enjoyed much more than hostel.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"one messed up movie, but it's still pretty cool","First, I need to say that 'Hostel' is a film that only men will like. I'm pretty sure I'm right on this. There are more naked women in this film than I thought existed. There is more gore and blood than a lot of other films. In other words, 2 things: any typical guy will like it, and if you're looking for sharp character development and an unpredictable story, don't expect it from Eli Roth in this one. Nevertheless, it is entertaining and short enough to make it watchable and likable.Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson) have met up with an Icelandic man named Oli, and have heard of a hostel in Slovakia that is told to satisfy their wildest, wettest, and most perverted dreams ever. They get there, and the place does not disappoint, but they soon figure out that this hostel is not what it seems, and that they are becoming part of a sinister plot involving an infamous torture museum.I must say that Eli Roth had the necessary materials, but like Cabin Fever before it, he doesn't utilize it enough. Also like Cabin Fever, the film is predictable and very one sided. There isn't a lot of character development or realism to a story said to be inspired by real events. What Roth's strength is that he realizes that he's made a few goofs here and there, and provides all the blood and cool gore scenes that you'd come to expect from someone Quentin Tarantino has thrown his support behind. Roth makes up for it all with some really shocking torture methods, and two very evil villains, one who doesn't talk much. Roth manages to make the film very entertaining, even though it gets off to a really slow start. The acting isn't that bad, but I don't think Hernandez or Richardson should bank on this movie to make them credible actors. After seeing Hernandez in a couple more films, I must say his future is very bright in this business. Don't miss him in World Trade Center.7/10 --spy",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Granted, the movie is based on an interesting concept. Some Americans in Europe end up at a place where people pay others to torture and murder people. Fairly clever right? But the movie just isn't that interesting to watch. While I love horror movies, the reason I love watching them is that I can choose witch characters I'm rooting for. Deciding who I would want to live or die. While watching this movie I really never for a moment cared which characters (good and bad) lived or died. The movie did nothing to draw me in. I never felt like I was watching real people, just a very violent occasionally silly movie. Granted if I was 12 or 13 years old I might have enjoyed the movie simply for the fact that their were boobs in it, but by now those days are behind me.

This doesn't compare to Saw at all..,"Fried air is what the should have called this movie, not Hostel. A typical American bad effects movie which doesn't compare with good thought through movies like for example the first episode of the Saw installment.It's terrible to see how yet again the Americans think everything over here in Europe and Eastern- Europe is the same. MINOR-SPOILER The movie starts off in Amsterdam, where I'm living myself, and yet again.. just like in Eurotrip and other movies the DO NOT film in Amsterdam and the residents all seem to speak German instead of Dutch. Which, trust me, doesn't sound the same at all! (I'm 1/2 Dutch and 1/2 German myself). And come on people, Amsterdam is a beautiful city with loads of culture and friendly people, all the Americans seem to think about us is that we smoke pot all day long and visit the Red Light district. Trust me all of those things were invited to attract stupid American tourists ;)Back to the movie. I heard people say this wasn't going to be a horror movie which would look away when something terrible was going to happen..and indeed the camera doesn't look away.. it just goes blurry. Near the end of the movie you've seen so much blood that you don't buy it at all.So Saw lovers, like myself this doesn't compare to Saw at all.. it has a weak to no story at all and if you watch the trailers and spots you've seen the best part of the movie anyways..",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Underrated social commentary horror flick,"An incredibly brutal and entertaining horror flick- Hostel provides a commentary on the extremist violence many other countries face today, all while handling its concept in an exceptionally well executed atmosphere. First off, from a writing standpoint, I truly admire this film. Many other critics and horror fans alike compare this film to James Wan's 2004 film Saw. While both films do contain a fair amount of harsh violence and gore, I largely feel Hostel is the better film (an unpopular choice) but i'm here to tell you why. Although Saw is a favorite franchise of mine, and I enjoy it deeply, it never is quite able to reach the lengths of success with executing its interesting concept on screen. Not to mention, the film is riddled with plotholes and even more so as the franchise goes on. In Hostel, moments can be a bit predictable, but the film is so well thought-out I had to give it a pass. It's beautifully disturbed, and feels so personal that it's hard not to empathize with those on screen. It isn't that the main characters are likable or flawed, its that they are simply put, just unlikeable people- and its interesting to see such a compelling story revolve around people we grow to hate on purpose instead of just by annoyance and poor filmmaking. The film is brilliantly shot, composed, and honestly really well acted. It may not be a popular opinion, but I enjoyed the hell out of it. It has its weaker moments of predictability, but nothing that weighs it down in total. It's truly a breathtaking and gruesome original horror film- and I don't think there will ever be anything quite like it again.My Rating: 8.8/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Eurotrip Meets Saw,"Hostel has taken either heavy criticism or high praise from people. I'm just neutral on this though. It's nothing to get to excited about, but you shouldn't HATE it by any means. The gore is disgusting in this movie, but that's also not a reason to hate it. What I didn't like about this movie was the beginning, and the highly comedic/pornographic atmosphere. There's a time and place for both those things, and when I'm going to watch a horror movie, I wanna see HORROR. The material itself wasn't bad. Some jokes were hilarious, and the hookers were extremely HOT! But I wanted to see 90 minutes of torture rather than just one hour. Once the good stuff gets underway I think Eli Roth (the director) has a fine horror flick here, but it definitely could've been better. Some positive things, first of all is the acting. Most everyone did a great job, the fact that they're all pretty unknown caused me some concern before seeing the movie, but they were all good. Jay Hernandez (Paxton) was the one I particularly noticed for the acting. And I think this has one of the best endings of any recent horror movie. I liked Hostel a lot, although it's definitely not for everyone. Some may vomit numerous times throughout this movie. But if it's your cup of tea then I say see it for sure.

The story is not that great or believable either even though it is based on true events .I think maybe this one needed more time and money spent or maybe just better editing.

Hostel is Hostyle,"Quentin Tarentino is a fan of Eli Roth, the director, of Hostel. I can see why. This movie is similar to Tarentino's from Dusk to Dawn; if you have seen that movie then I need say no more. I am not a fan of horror in general, but Tarentino's name was on the DVD case, so I had to give it a try. I IMDb'd it after enjoying it, and wanted to know more about Roth. I was not disappointed. Hostel has a European flavor, but American panache. The mix of American and European actors from Iceland to Czechoslovakia adds depth to this movie. This movie has it all; suspense, horror, nudity (oh, those European babes are fine) and you get caught up in the action. The element of reality is what brings it home. Roth is able to bring Transylvania back to life in a daring way. If you have traveled or are going to travel Europe and stay at youth Hostels, then this movie will add an element you have never considered. Having backpacked and bicycled parts of Europe via Hostel's, I am glad I saw this movie after the fact. I am a lot older now, but this movie is so well done that it stirred a lot of memories of my youth. The special effects and makeup are excellent, and their is a great group of k...; well see for yourself. Executive Producer Tarentino knows how to pick them, he knows talent when he sees it. Roth started making shorts at the age of 8 according to the IMDb database, and he is an intelligent and up and coming director/writer. ""Kill the Car!"" is a multi-angle interactive feature that you should take the time to watch before the movie. This is the first multi-angle (3 separate cameras) interactive I have seen, and I enjoyed switching from one to the other, it really lets you appreciate how a director can add intensity to a scene with the right angle. I also recommend you watch the featurette documentary of the film as it was being made, ""Hostel Dissected"" which is directed by Gabriel Roth, Eli's brother. Gory, yes, but the writer/director Roth, is able to add a reality to the plot, that is not often present in your average horror movie. This movie, is not an average horror movie. If cute busty nudes,and gore aren't your thing, then don't bother with this movie's portrayal of art of the horror genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"a good time is had by all, well not all but by us at least, for the most part","Okay. first of all, the characters playing the overhyped students are a little too old for the roles, but then that seems pretty much par for the course. Also these silly antics take up a surprisingly large amount of the film. Having said that the sequences are well done, the girls are good looking and it eases us into the nastier segments. And for those more grim, torturous and gory sequences it is off to Bratislava in Slovakia. Except it is not. It is to the Czech Republic and Prague where the action is filmed and maybe just some little joke on the Slovakians? No idea, anyway the action continues, fairly predictably, but still convincingly enough and a good time is had by all, well not all but by us at least, for the most part.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Feel my Roth,"There's a sickness pervading Roth's promo for the Youth Hosteling Association. Having said that it's hard to dislike a movie which features attractive Eastern European women in permissive sexual mode - prone to large bouts of unnecessary but welcomed nudity and not too concerned about changing in view of male roommates. Such cynical devices are employed to get round the critical sensibilities of horror hating people like me who think this stuff is terminally devoid of merit, invention or wit and Roths pulled a blinder. For 45 minutes I was putty in his sick, gelatin covered hands and then, having got to the crux of it with those ignorant, hormonally retarded backpackers getting horrifically tortured for the pleasure of maladjusted 13 year olds and man-child fan-boy mastabators throughout the world, I strangely found myself drawn into Roths dirty little web - the Vincent Price like fly to his predatory house spider. Not in any way what you should be doing with your free time but nevertheless far better than you might dare to hope - Hostel may be a good advert for hotels as well as 90 minutes of well tooled disturbance. Hard to hate - especially when watched backwards.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Immature bull-crap,"Decent enough story, but handled with great immaturity and stupidity. Granted Eli Roth wrote it and secured financing for it, so in fairness he should be able to make any movie he desired. However, someone should of stepped in and suggested filling in the many plot holes and logic lapses so that it actually felt like a real movie and didn't seem quite so convenient all the way through. Also, they could of removed a couple of the unnecessary tit shots and sauna scenes so it didn't so closely resemble a porkys or carry on film and felt more like a horror film. Don't get me wrong as a 26 year old guy I liked the first few, but after the tenth he did come off as a horny 14 year old with licence to see breasts, is he actually still a virgin? Geeze...To sum it up, nice idea- badly handled by a immature filmmaker lacking talent. Which I could of expected coming from the writer/director of 'Cabin Fever', had it not been for the endorsement by Quentin Tarantino, which suggested a film of much better quality. Come on Quentin, I know he's your buddy and kindred spirit but you can't just put your name on any old crap...",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gore but no scare,"Gore but no scare.The movie started off as nothing more than Animal House in Europe bordering on soft porn at timesnot saying that's a bad thing but I was waiting for the horror part of this horror film to start. It is predictable most of the time and the plot was weak. If you want a gory movie with tons of blood and parts being cut off people, this is the movie for you. I love slasher films so I was entertained but to call this movie a 'horror' film is false advertising. It doesn't really keep you on the edge of you seat but the SFX work is pretty good.

"Enjoyable, but Eli Roth could have pushed it further.","Half silly sex farce and half gore-fest, Hostel is unworthy of the hype and controversy it received upon release. It starts excellently, mysteriously and impressively, before descending into clichéd American's in Amsterdam, looking for sex and drugs. Sure, this does provide us with plenty of boob action, but it does little to develop this characters beyond mere caricature. This first section drags, and it's only when the gruesome moments start coming that Hostel springs to life. Sliced ankles, severed fingers and pus-oozing eyeballs are just some of the lovely images you can feast on. Eli Roth intended to push audiences to their limit with this film, ""torture-porn"", but there's not nearly enough gory or inventive moments to make Hostel overly memorable, nor was I ever truly on the edge of my seat with my hands over my eyes. That being said, it is a great idea for a film and it does have it moments, but I just wish Roth had pushed it even further. Perhaps the sequel will impress me more. Your better off watching the first couple of Saw films, for a more inventive take on the ""torture-porn"" sub-genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
This film made me want to have a bowel motion.,"Nothing in my review that no one else hasn't said already. This movie was awful. I was so disappointed to see what was a fantastic idea turned into total rubbish. Some good gore slipped in there, pretty lazy though and nowhere near enough. Because lets face it, you're not going to this film to see high art you're here for the gore. But not enough and nothing was actually shown. In short, this movie was crap. Too much time spent on titties, the characters were lousy, the violence/gore was lazy (but the effects were decent). Script? Crap. Characters? Crap. Directing/editing obvious. And here I want to point out a scene where a woman's toe is cut off but is tightly cut to some trimming their nails. Come on, that shot is sooooo old!

Opinion of the film Hostel,"Genuinely well made as a horror film. The locale of the film added to the overall spookiness. The acting was right on and I will be thinking about this for a long time to come. I have been to that part of the world and am convinced that it must have been filmed on location. One can imagine that the people as depicted in the film were capable of just this sort of sick sadism. In ways it reminded me of that other fine Dutch film, The Vanishing. (which incidentally was poorly made as an American and Hollywood follow-up). Both explore the tragic and sick make up of the leading sadistic characters in these films. Anyone really interested in the behavior of mentally disturbed people should see this one. And be prepared to be shook up.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A different kind of hostel...,"""Hostel"" is a mystery horror movie in which we watch a group of friends traveling around Europe with their backpacks. While they are in Amsterdam they meet a person who tells them about a hostel somewhere in Eastern Europe close to Bratislava where all the girls are crazy about tourists and especially for American men. So, they are going there but everything is too good to be true and soon everything will change for them.I liked this movie because it had an interesting plot and many scenes with suspense which kept me alert for the most duration of it. I also liked the direction of Eli Roth's and I believe he did a great job on it. I also liked the interpretations of Jay Hernandez who played Paxton and Jan Vlasák who played as a Dutch Businessman. I believe that either you watch this movie alone or with company you are going to have a great time since the suspense is in the most out.Finally, I have to say that ""Hostel"" surprised me in a good way because it is a horror movie that combines very well horror scenes with mystery. It's an interesting movie with many twists and I believe that you aren't going to waste your time watching it. I believe that if you are a fan of horror movies you are going to love it but if you are not then it's good to reconsider watching this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
why,"don't you think the location of the movie to Slovakia is rather ridiculous since there is nothing what should remind this country except for a few background songs? The native language used in the movie sounds rather Czech (only for those who could recognize it). All scenes are situated in Czech republic. This fact degrades the authenticity. The authors selected Slovakia - they should have made it there. No worth to travel around the world to get something not authentic. Don't you agree with me there is enough such creepy places all around the world to get the same result? The opinion on this movie in Slovakia varies, but tends to be mostly negative. If the Icelanders were described as a ""drunken sex maniacs"" then the country was pictured as a sick place in the middle of nowhere.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Passable as Enjoyment,"Hosteldirected byEli RothIt might not be as violent and uncomfortable than it promotes itself to be, but Hostel is still a fairly entertaining film.

See it....BUT....,"...don't let the trailers totally mislead you. This film IS very suspenseful and frightening heightened by the fact that it's based on actual events. Where it is flawed, however, is in the prolonged time wasted on the hedonist lifestyle of these travelers in Europe. I know the film makers pour on the T & A to entice a certain demographic but I feel real horror fans would rather, if the film had to lean one way or the other, lean toward time spent on the horrific instead of drug use and sex. Wait a minute.....you can stop throwing rocks at the computer now. Some decadence is good but, keep the film true to its genre. Bottom line...the film, finally, hits the mark and is definitely worth the cost of a (matinee) ticket. I'm positive I know the folks who will hate this film the most. It's the tourism boards of any Eastern European country whose name ends in ""solvakia"" or ""istan"". No offense meant BUT...that area is just plain creepy.

"Over-hyped, disappointing, lame horror","Hostel is another perfect case of an over-hyped horror movie in these past years. Made out to be a sick, demented, disturbing horror movie, it's far from it. The trailer was brilliant and I couldn't wait to see it, boy was I annoyed! Considering it got the dreaded R18+ rating here in Australia, I thought it had to be pretty darn bad. The first 45 minutes of the movie is boobs, swearing, drugs and sex which is poorly done. The second half is blood and body parts galore which is very well done. The only problem there is, there is barely any of it and if there is any, it's mainly offscreen. So for you gorehounds out there, this isn't gonna please.The special effects were really well done and the dull, dirty look of the underground torture place is really creepy. Ultimately, though, this was a disappointment and I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone. Eli Roth's first film, Cabin Fever, was far superior to this in my opinion.2½/5.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Way to long to get started but kinda makes up for it later.,"The first Act of this movie involves sex,nudity and getting wasted. OK but not enough substance especially when it goes on way to long and the plot gets left behind for awhile. Sure these scenes kind of have a purpose but not enough to justify.The second Act involves torture and at this point I thought the movie was quite sick. But I was wrong. I was on the edge of my seat and a little uncomfortable but that meant I liked it because it made me react. Most horror/splatter films don't do much for me because they are to tame. I was actually disturbed a little.But the third Act was sweet splatter release. Highly unlikely the way the events unfold but highly satisfying just the same.The acting and directing are just hovering around average most of the time with flashes of brilliance here and there.If you like this type of movie it's worth seeing.

full of surprise and gore and special effects--but little more,"Hostel is about a group of young men venturing out to fulfill their quenches for sex and drugs. Of course, torture enters into the movie later, as the previews depict, and at this point the movie takes a sharp turn. The film includes a very long introduction which exists simply to show that the protagonists like breasts and pot. The characters are certainly shallow, but the problem here is that it is difficult to feel empathy toward them at any point in the film. Hostel is better than most horror movies. For those who have seen The Grudge and the like, and were rightfully disappointed, you will find that this movie is undoubtedly better. But unlike the truly successful horror movies like Saw, this lacks an intricate plot and good acting--which, despite this common modern belief that gore and quick bursts of loud music or lights flickering on and off to make you jump is all that matters--is actually a problem. Again, the film is gory, although a good portion of the movie lacks any gore--or suspense for that matter. For those who love gore, blood, and fingers breaking off, see this. You will see some images that will more than make you feel uneasy. But this movie could have been better. And you'll see why too.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not like the previews indicate,"This movie was not at all what I thought it was going to be. I was expecting a saw-like psychological thriller type movie. Instead I was handed this piece of crap. The trailers made it look all cool, but as you sit down in the theatre you get a hard slap on the face. It is basically a Eurotrip ripoff (as some other people have said) then for like the last half-hour or so you get to see a little bit of gore/violence, mostly off screen. It is ridiculous to me that someone would need the paramedics called in for them during this movie. I have seen worse things on the TV show CSI. So it is my advice that you avoid this movie for its sure stupidity, but if you happen to get sucked in to going to see this garbage of a film do yourself a favor, bring a pillow and take a little nap. Honestly the worst movie I have ever seen. Well maybe not the worst at least ties with Peter Jackson's King Kong though.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not bad, but I shoulda rented it","I do wish I hadn't paid full price for this film. Thats not to say its all that bad, but its certainly not worth owning.

If you start the film thinking its gonna be awful, that is all you'll see of it, but actually there is something deeply disturbing about the whole concept.That said, there is an over abundance of nudity and sex in the first half, but then that just serves to provide a reason for the events of the second half.All in all the cast isn't bad at all, the plot is no more gratuitous than any other horror film, and the production is good.Give it a go if you like this kind of thing, I think you'll enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

We left the theatre about half-way through, we could not even stay to see if anything would make sense. Do you know what we mean.

At first glance it even looked a playboy movie, but i believe it was made so people would relax, with some kind of soft music that looked a lot like a kid show music. After that the movie gets really violent with lots of gore that showed the brutality of mankind. What do you care if the actor were 20ish? just for that is a teen movie? and deserves a 1 star?

A Nutshell Review: Hostel,"Nudity, sex, drugs, gore and violence. If you're looking for a movie that has all those elements, then look no further than Hostel, which has got them all. Written and directed by Eli Roth, and given the stamp of approval from Quentin Tarantino, this film doesn't shy away from being seen as promoting a decadent lifestyle, and making fun of stereotypical Euros and Yankees, the horny and the stoned, getting their just desserts.The movie tells the story of three backpackers going around Europe, living from hostel to hostel, indulging in sex and drugs. We meet them in Amsterdam, and accompany them to coffee shops for that high from weed, as well as visiting its famed fish tanks. Didn't know what the interior looked like, until today, from the movie (yeah, what did you think?). And yes, those fish tanks which you see from the movie, are what you get (though you can try whipping out your camera and see what will happen to you :P) Anyway, our trio are getting bored with the *ahem* taste of Europe, and are seeking something different. They meet up with a pimp who recommends them a Slovakian city to indulge in, where the chicks will do anything, for the right amount of money. Tempted, the trio really made their way there (surely you've learnt enough not to trust strangers, but I guessed they thought with their other head instead), and checked into the Hostel, where it simply is gratuitous nudity galore, with beautiful easy chicks.So while the first half of the movie focused on them getting their rocks off, the gore and violence didn't arrive until the second half, where one by one, our friends disappear under mysterious circumstances. They get locked up in some strange cell, and get tortured. You begin to wonder exactly what is happening behind closed doors, but I won't spoil it for you. Suffice to say that while it might initially seem like Saw, with its enigmatic psychopath calling the shots, this film offered a more stripped down version to the madness. No elaborate games, just brutal simplicity, picking from available weapons of choice like the scissors, knives, hammers, pliers, scalpel, chainsaw, pistol, you get the drift.Most of the violence happen off screen - your imagination is left to work what exactly is happening, given cues from the helpless screams, and the mechanics of the tools of death. The gore department isn't stinged upon, and there are enough blood spewing, dripping, flowing to keep the blood lust factor up. But there is one detectable cut in the movie, which I thought didn't really mar the sadistic enjoyment (if I can say this) of the movie.However, there is a reasonable logical explanation to all these happenings though, and you'll share with the pain of the victims, and wonder in reality, if such an underground thingy perhaps could exist? I mean, why not? And there's a satisfying ending to this movie too. There are no losers or winners, but the last 15 minutes are filled with so much gore, the squeamish will find it hard to tolerate. And without spoiling it for you, I particularly liked two scenes then which involves vehicles. The first one is one that is seldom seen in a movie, while the second one is perhaps as close to the real thing as possible, without me being a witness to the event.I sound sick, I know. But then, that's what this movie is, Satisfyingly, sick.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"good idea, shame about the movie","I had high expectations for this movie. The idea sounded good: three backpackers get kidnapped and are tortured and killed for the pleasure of bored rich people. That alone, is scary to me.But instead, the film is a let down. Yes, it is gory, very gory in places, but by no means as horrible as the hype led me to believe. Eli Roth makes one terrible, crucial mistake - he doesn't develop his characters. We spend the first half of the film following these three guys as they take drugs, have sex with whores, and just generally behave bad. By the time the torture came about, i couldn't have cared less if they lived or died. If Roth had spent that time building the characters up and making us care, then this would have been a far superior film.The torture scenes are a disappointment too. This sounds perverse, but we spend half the film getting to this point, and the torture is very limited. Yes, bad things happen to them, but I was expecting far more graphic scenes of violence. I would have liked this film to really explore the dark side of humanity. I mean, what does drive someone to torture someone for fun? Unfortunately this is denied us.Plus, it is totally unrealistic. In particular, one of the characters gets part of his hand chopped off by a chainsaw. This guy should have bled to death within minutes, but he doesn't. I can suspend my disbelief in films, but this was too silly even for me.In short, Hostel fails to be the nerve racking horror film we were led to expect. Yes, there are some disturbing scenes (the eyeball scene, for example) and if you're a fan of gore, yes it doesn't totally disappoint. But i feel this had so much potential and it was wasted. It could have ranked up there with Silence Of The Lambs, or even Seven, but instead it went to a writer/director who has no idea of how to create characters. This film deserved to be good, it deserved to go to a better person.Watchable, but no where near as good as it should have been.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

It began with a relatively sluggish tempo, for the totality of the first act; almost nothing happens but then it gradually starts to catch up momentum and the more we reach nearer to the climax, better it gets.That being said, the hardcore fanatics of the genre might still come out disappointed, even if only slightly! The simple reason being the gory aspects aren't as vicious as one would normally anticipate.

I guess i may have a strong stomach compared to some people, but i was very disappointed with the movie, after reading all the reviews. I would recommend it tho, cuz it doesn't have a bad story and the gory parts are pretty good, but the overall lack of ""disturbing"" scenes made Hostel just like any other horror movie.

Lacking of atmosphere and tension,"Just seen this turkey...nothing new. Completely lacking of atmosphere and tension, despite the graphic violence, which, by the way, is too much old-school make-up artistry to have impact. If it had been combined with computer graphics in a way similar to Irreversible, it could have. At the end the movie totally looses focus and relies on way too many convenient solutions. It is interesting that despite exteriors being shot on location, it all seems sanitized and artificial. Maybe because the cinematography is too...looking for the proper word...rigid, safe? Everything is over-lit, except for the ""dungeon"", which is too horror-stylized. A more documentary approach would probably have been more effective, as if it was being shot by one of the backpackers themselves. And this makes millions at the box-office, I guess there is something to be learned from that. Make a lackluster movie with some nudity and gore, make money. I have longed for horror movies to be scary and bloody again, like in the 70s and 80s, but I can live without this.

Great Horror - Better Than You'd Expect,"I saw this movie on Quentin Tarantino's recommendation alone - apparently the previews of it scared my entire friend network and family away. Everyone said 'too gross!' 'too scary!' which I think are perfectly great reasons to see a horror flick. Having read many interviews with Tarantino, one of which in Fangoria, I figured he has similar tastes with me and so I figure if he's presenting, I'm paying to see it on the big screen.Hostel starts out with three friends (two American, one Icelandic) staying at a hostel in Amsterdam. Sex, drugs, and jokes ensue. Actually, the portrayal of the American post-undergrads is one of the better representations I've seen. Usually the kids are really dumb and all cookie-cutter the same, so it was refreshing to see some 'kids' that I probably would have known in college.I should warn the set-up to the gore and horror is slow-coming because I think Roth really wants you to like his characters. I didn't find the beginning set up to drag at all but I know many horror fans will because they want to see the violence right off the bat.When the gore and horror do begin, they don't disappoint. Following a promise for some of the sexiest and easiest women in the world, the trio travel to a Slovakia hostel where they have a pretty good time before one of them disappears. What is this place and why are they killing kids!? I already knew because I'd seen Tarantino and Roth interviewed on late night. If you know the basic premise it will be pretty easy to figure out what's going on.The gore is EXCELLENT and EXPERTLY done. I'd like to consider myself a connoisseur of horror make-up and this was perfect for me. Not too over-the-top, not to stingy. If you were disappointed in not seeing anything sawed off in 'Saw' then watch this! Also to note there are many Tarantinio directorial touches in the film...it's like he said 'Eli wouldn't it be great if you did this with that shot....etc.' So well directed is what I'm saying - great camera work was done.The movies' ending took a bit of an unexpected turn for me but that is because I was expecting something really wacky for an ending (Roth did do 'Cabin Fever'...) but there is no wackiness there..actually it's pretty damn serious.The acting was pretty good for a group of unknowns (and thank god they didn't use another B-list TV star, getting SICK of that!).If you're going to see a horror movie on the big screen, this is the one to see. I'm glad I took Quentin's recommendation.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Honestly, it was not a bad movie","I debated over the weekend whether to see this movie.

"Cannot ""Un-see"" this Terribly Shallow Film.","Tarrantino has gone insane. This film was a blood-fest that offered no clever plot or witty dialogue that we have come to expect from the producer. Hostel is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Aside from severed limbs impressively depicted with cutting-edge effects, Hostel is devoid of anything more than gore. The predictable plot is exacerbated by highly improbable chance encounters that serve simply to allow Tarrantino to kill someone else in, he hopes, a more shocking fashion than the last. Hostel oscillates between sex and torture, two aesthetically intriguing subjects when integrated into an interesting plot. However, these subjects as implemented in Hostel contribute to the shallow and disappointing nature of the production. I left the movie feeling nauseated and envious of those exiting from The Chronicles of Narnia. Even the Family Stone-goers appeared more enlightened following their movie than myself, having retained no capacity for intelligent thought after having the life sucked out of me by Hostel.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disturbing yet a gem in the genre,"The movie is very graphic and the topic makes it extremely disturbing.This is a warning. I can well imagine people simply turning it off due to the content.Yet I place among the top in the genre for it's realism and how it affects the viewer - it feels it with genuine horror.The fact there is nothing supernatural in it, just human nature at its worst makes it just more terrifying.There has been the movie 8mm around, which was for me almost equally disturbing and even though different genre and topic I appreciated both for similar reasons.They moved me, made me really anxious with a feel - such thing could happen.I don't understand the overall poor rating of it here on imdb.You don't have to be a sick pervert to appreciate such a movie for the reasons above.I think it is really one of the best in the genre, even though when I think it makes me shiver in disgust.Human nature doesn't lack on its dark side and this movie exactly touches that field.It is very very disturbing but that fact alone is no reason to take the merit from the director he dared to make it.""Enjoy"" at your own risk.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Send Up to Sleaze That Works,"Eli Roth's send up to sleaze ain't bad. It isn't just terribly good in its own right, but I love the fact that he's making hard-R-rated horror. For an ""exploitation"" film it's tame. You're not gonna get your frills here if you cut your teeth on stuff by Deodato or even early Peter Jackson, but you can still appreciate the fact that Roth is making an effort to put the umph back into mainstream genre pictures. Is Roth the wunderkind savior of horror? No. But, he's trying.And, you know what, it is a decent little picture. Odes to Suicide Club, Takashi Miike's cameo, etc. aside, you can dig the film as an okay addition from Roth.

The film only had about three moments in which I was entertained. At most a rental, if you do a lot of fast forwarding. My girlfriend actually fell asleep during this movie.

Worst film ever...,"I am open to pretty much any type of film but this quite easily ranks as THE worst film I have ever seen (and I have seen quite a few stinkers) - what's worse is that it was made in 2005 with a relatively large budget and Tarantino as a producer - how is crap like this even allowed to leave the studio? I won't go into spoilers but this film pretty much fails on every single level and it is not even remotely scary. I can't believe that this film has been compared to SAW for goriness - it doesn't even compared and the storyline in this makes Saw look like Citizen Kane.Rarely do I ever regret watching a film, no matter how bad, but I certainly regret wasting 94 odd minutes of my life on this crud.I can hardly believe that a sequel is being made for this!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""I always wanted to be a surgeon. But the boards would not pass me.

I also found it the unmatchable cinematic god Quentin Tarantino was producing, so I was all the more psyched. When I finally saw it, I was a little let-down, but not by much. It isn't as genius as 'Cabin Fever', but it does garner some hilarious yet sick quips and some bloody awesome sequences of carnage. It isn't as violent as they say, and I suspect they had to cut a sh*t load of the violence out to escape the dreaded kiss-of-death NC-17 rating.

As for the perverts (who torture people) it is not clear why there are so many people who are fond of this? If I was Slovakian I would not like this portrayal of my country. And as far as I understood the only survivor (Hernandez) and the director of the movie are of the same or of the similar nationality though in my opinion that boy who's name Josh (the shy one) should survive.

Suggestion works the imagination much more than graphic-ness. I can't put my finger on it, but I just wasn't put in the characters' place, as a good horror movie will do. The feel of the film is ""nice,"" in the good, gruesome way of good horror films--dark and foreboding.

Traveling Europe, hooking up with some hot foreigner babes with ease for some romper stomper free reign frolic. I don't mind some fun but COME ON, have some debt or story or .... just SOMETHING here. No worry... no suspense... no creepiness, nothing.Then finally when the ball get's rollin, (and only for a few minutes at that) even the supposed 'gross' or stomach churning points were like a warm flat opened can of coke. No fizzle, nothing! The effects of the, well lets just say the eye ball sequence were blatantly fake taking any fizzle of creepiness from it. Not to mention our 'injured' parties were running around like nothing had been done to them. Hardly a squint of pain to help you remember they'd been, well 'worked on'.If at all anything good, the lead actor has a certain something and I believe he could show up in something more worthy of a chance. The camera work and even the basics of the direction were satisfactory however the script was just crap! They went out for a lil T & A to entice the youths while jumping the (I wanna be like cool like 'Saw'), bandwagon.

Apart from that it is a horror movie and you will be horrified.

"Very good (not great, alas)","I think I built this one up too much in my mind. I LOVED Cabin Fever so I was expecting big things from Roth for his second film on a heavier budget. I missed Hostel when it zipped in and out of the theatres and finally got a chance to check it out tonight.BASIC STORYLINE: Trio of frat guy-ish twenty something's carousing through Amsterdam get wind of a little Eastern European area where the babes flock to Americans like nobody's business. One hostel in particular is a veritable treasure-trove of pu**y, so they're told. Off they go and. Everything about this little country seems great at first. But all is not as it seems.GREAT premise. GREAT great GREAT. Love it! Any guy who has ever been to college knows about these little European backpacking tours (nudge, nudge) which are basically excuses for dudes to get away from girlfriends/responsibility/real life, etc, so they can party and pick up hot euro chicks chicks and live it up before settling into an actual life. It's a frat guy tradition. For someone to make a horror film that preys upon such hallowed ground is like watching someone spit on your grandmother's grave.Starts out awesome. The two ugly Americans are accompanied by an equally ugly Icelandic. They smoke hash, insult people, act like rude idiots, have sex with hookers. All that good stuff. The only minor problem in the early part is that these guys may be TOO ugly. But its a minor quibble cause the beginning is great. A creepy, twitchy (which can adequately describe many people in this film) local directs them to the Eastern European hostel. Off they go. Things are still rolling along nicely.I think the problem starts to set in when they actually get to the hostel. Things there are just like the guy told them. Lots of conveniently available, easy women and so forth. But for me this is where Roth kind of got into trouble. For some reason the air of dread never surfaced. I don't know why, but I actually felt it more when they were still in Amsterdam. Nothing in the town radiated any sense of danger. The roving bands of kids didn't look scary. The girls just looked like a bunch of models. I never felt any palpable menace. The buckets of blood and the gore were fine, but by the end I felt it was just a distraction. I wanted more scares. Gore is great if used well (like in Cabin Fever!) but not when it actually detracts from the sense of menace. I guess I wanted the film to disturb me more than it did. I wanted something that would make me REALLY not want to go to Bratislava.HOWEVER, I should say that I did enjoy this movie. Quite a lot. I think Roth is an awesome director. I was expecting a great deal from Hostel. Too much, probably. And when you're anticipating a film so much sometimes it just can't live up to your expectations. Some great scares. Definitely a lot of blood and guts. What I actually liked the best was when Roth was more reserved and let the creepy characters take center stage, like the weird Alexi and the freako American near the end. Then the film really came alive for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"This ""Horror Movie' is Truly Horrible","From a technical standpoint it's done pretty well but from a plot, storyline and artistic standpoint it's basically a piece of crap.Eli Roth was quoted as saying the reason the movie is full of false representations and lies about Slovak history and who they are is that he was trying to make a statement about how Americans are ignorant about Slovakia. Now for that statement Eli must take the cake as one of the biggest Jerks Hollywood has ever produced.So let me get this straight - Hostel is actually a practical joke that this Boston native is playing on Americans? I'm not sure anyone got the joke, including Europeans. So Eli is going to make a movie in which he makes loads of money from Americans that is actually a practical joke on Americans? Not sure I get it.I can think of better ways to make the sort of statement that Eli made - I don't think that this is the real statement he made - it's clear that this is a jack*** back stepping after making a film that has no clear artistic point.I think there are plenty of educated Americans who know where and what Slovakia is - but I also think there are Americans who do not know a thing about Slovakia - but one thing is for sure - the only thing Roth proved with this movie is that he is the latter.I love great horror movies and I think violence and gore are justified in a great piece of art - The Exorcist is a great example of that. This is no more than a modern day slasher movie - not sure why Roth can't just admit that.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely amazing. Best horror film for ages,"I just finished watching it a few minutes ago and I am feeling something that I have not felt from a movie in a long time.

Seriously, I am never leaving the country again.The film gets off to a bit of a slow but necessary start (annoying and teeny  too many 'F' words, and I can't believe I'm saying this, too many boobs (seriously, I love boobs but there's only only so many you can take). But that creates more of a shock when the real premise of the film begins. It was excellently directed, shot, written and surprisingly, acted. Those guys were awesome The one thing that I love the most about this, is just as the 'Saw' series, this stuff could happen, and probably does somewhere in the world. And the director depicts this by making your imagination run as wild as the special effects team. It is more psychological than you would expect. It's great.It's hard to talk about it without mentioning any spoilers, so I will stop talking now. Just trust me, and watch this film.

never again,"I saw hostel a couple of days ago with my boyfriend. if he hadn't been there, I would have left the moment i heard the drilling sound.What irritates me in this film most is the view of Slovakia. I am aware that Roth's aim wasn't to give the people a geographical course on this country, but from my point of view, he misused it. He took a not well known country and presented it in a way he thought that would be attractive for an average (American) viewer. I don't think it is unnatural, if i watch a film where my country is described as a land of no younger than 40 year-old men and 20 year-old money-hunting prostitutes.Choose an exciting plot, place the story into a country no one knows and modify it according to ur imagination, tell everyone u worked on it with Tarantino, claim that true events inspired u, put as many naked women and sex scenes as it gets and find a guy who can do a pretty cool whistling...this is what i call Roth's recipe for a horror...and it worked...Eli Roth is currently the most unpopular American in SK (ok sorry, the second most unpopular - after Bush) but on the other hand, what he achieved was brilliant - he made a fortune by making a movie which people love or hate. and that's what it is all about - it is discussed - people go and see it, even those who'd like to see Roth being cut with a chainsaw.If Eli Roth's goal was to make me keep my eyes closed for the half of the movie and make my stomach twist in my body, he succeeded.

Torture as Entertainment?,"I found this film to be undeniably compelling and suspenseful, even well-directed. However, I just have a problem with the concept of torture as entertainment. I think that anyone who has ever given thought to the reality of torture in the modern world would find it repellent that the filmmakers would exploit it for a horror film. That goes for Mr. Tarantino as well. My assumption is that there is an ongoing effort to find material to exploit in the horror genre and this is the latest example. The film deals with elements of xenophobia, homophobia, phobia, phobia and more phobia! What makes this film especially disturbing is that, like the video game GRAND THEFT AUTO, the public seems to have little or no reaction on a moral or values level to this kind of material being put forth as entertainment from companies like Sony.

He has said in interviews that Hostel was inspired by viewing websites where one could arrange to kill human victims in third-world countries. Apparently he originally intended to make a documentary about this. For whatever reason (legal perhaps?) this proved impossible. Never mind - the movie clearly appeals to the same crowd as would roll up to see an actual ""snuff"" movie.The only connection with Iraq that I can see is that unashamed celebrations of cruelty such as this have no doubt contributed to the culture that spawned the sniggering torturers of Abu Ghraib.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Unfortunately, I watched the movie to the end, hoping Quentin Tarantino would redeem himself with some wit, some twist, or for heaven's sake, some plot!Aside from a lot of blood/gore, nudity, and swearing, this movie had no substance.

Eli Roth should make comedies,"The best thing (or shall we say the only good thing?) about Eli Roth's first movie ""Cabin Fever"" was its final joke that was totally out of place but funny nonetheless. In his second work, ""Hostel"", Roth increased the silliness and it takes the whole movie one step up. A story as stupid and unbelievable as this one just couldn't have been done as a full on, ""serious"" horror flick. I do believe the advertising was kind of misleading in that aspect. Sure, ""Hostel"" does get down to the nitty-gritty (two, er, thumbs up for the eye scene!), but it's all so hilarious that you're not going to take any of it serious. I sure hope that all the stereotypes featured in this movie were exaggerated intentionally. God only knows, why Roth has all his European characters speak German (and badly) and why he put a gang of criminal eight year-olds in the movie. At times one felt as if this was the missing cousin of ""Top Secret!"" and ""Eurotrip"". Anyway, even though the movie is hilarious to watch, it's questionable how long Roth can disguise bad writing with silly jokes. Is this man able to come up with a really good horror movie? Well, his next project, Stephen King's ""Cell"" is going to show. ""Hostel"" didn't totally change my mind about Roth's talents, but it convinced me that he's got a great sense of humor.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Cool, but disturbing. If you like Gianno & NC-17 Grindhouse flicks then you must check this one","Three guys, one Icelandic and two Americans visited Slokavkia in order to look for chicks. But little do they know the horror that awaits them.That's the premise of this brilliantly shocking film from director Eli Roth. Roth, who previously directed his horror-comedy debut Cabin Fever, has come up with an excellent gore-fest which took his name by storm.Produced by Quentin Tarantino, this film is an exploitative tribute to films like Cannibal Holocaust, I Spit on Your Grave, Friday the 13th and several Italian gore fests including Reazione a catena(aka Chain Reaction) and so forth.The acting is OK. But, the coolest thing about Hostel is the character Oli and Natalya. Oli is a wonderful Icelander, having knew that Icelanders are cool people, he makes one hell of a character. Natalya is also a great character, being a damn hottie. The film is kinda easy to follow, especially when it doesn't have those stupid flashy sequences that has conquered almost every PG-13 horror films.One thing that bugs me is that the film kinda acts as a social commentary. Eli Roth says that this film deals with the ignorance surrounding tourists(especially Americans) who visited a certain country without knowing what's surrounding them. That kinda bugs me, because i'm a traveler, and me being a tourist, i don't feel ignorant about that country. Perhaps he was talking about Western tourists in general, i might say.Still, this film is great. This ain't a chick flick, but if your girlfriend is a freak or loves horror films, then you must bring her on a date, bring her back home, watch this film on DVD with her, and get laid. It's simple, and fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

European Gore Without The Bore,"If you thought 2004's Saw was a massive step into cinematic gore, Hostel does a triple long jump and a pole vault into it. Hostel is sadistic in parts but is a very intriguing film. It is covered in blood, but sometimes there's so much blood, the story is washed away. The Dutch Businessman (played by Jan Vlasák) isn't an iconic horror villain but is one of the cleverest and deceiving villains from recent memory. There are a lot of stereotypical traits (smoking pot in Amsterdam; beautiful girls entrancing the backpackers) but these play out well. OVERALL: A gore fest that can get a bit too carried away at times but can hold itself together.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Bad horror, bad story, bad writer/director and QT has nothing to do with it","This movie is a waste of film. Cabin Fever was a steaming pile and so is this. First off, it is rated-R because the first twenty minutes is just breasts and smoking weed and even that is cheesy that you can not even enjoy some good nudity to take you mind off how horrible the movie is. The blood and gore do not come into play until the last half hour of the movie and even that is so lame that it does not make up for the hour of time that you wasted trying to get to that point. If you are bored and there is nothing else at the movie theater, go home and knit or build a model maybe talk to your relatives but do not see this movie, it is not worth the 7, 8, 9, 10 dollars that a ticket costs.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
hostel,"I really wanted to see Hostel when it first came out. I kept hearing that it was so awesome and that it was so bloody and graphic. Then when it came out on DVD, I went to fye to go buy it and my mom was standing right next to me because they were obviously not going to give it to me because I'm younger than 17 and the girl there said ""You do know this is an R-rated movie?"" and she didn't want to give it to me. I tried to get it but I couldn't then I got recently and I saw it and it was kind of bad. I expected so much more from it. It was barely bloody and I kept hearing it was so bloody. I thought it would be much better because one day I saw Cabin Fever and I loved it and from then on I thought Eli Roth's next movie would be as good but it wasn't. It just ended up to be another dirty bad horror movie. It wasn't that bad but I didn't really like it and I don't recommend it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The worst ever...,"Dear people, you may want to know what I think about this movie. Tell me what is so exciting on a bunch of guys that travel across the Europe just for getting high and having sex with European girls (hehe :-) It was announced to be one of the most brutal and scariest movie ever but the result was embarrassing. When they come to Bratislava there is a sign of city Poricany (That is in Czech Rep, the place this crap was filmed). There are no children gangs that would kill you for a candy. Roth made himself a lot of enemies there. Nothing' happens during the first half, they just have a sex ,party and suddenly they starts to disappear in that hostel. Than some logical looking after them, finding out what's the matter, few dead people, two cut off fingers and quite really good escaping scene in the end.Summary: once you get DVD of this so called ""film"" you can easily use it as a very expensive beer tray...Zero points would suit this ""film disaster"" better.(by the way, this review is strongly influenced by the fact that I'm from Czech rep. and I find director of this crap as a very untalented person.

Can't wait for part 2!,"I was meaning to get round to watching Hostel for a while and yesterday on a boring Sunday afternoon I took the chances of watching it and I was not disappointed. It seem really apparent that anything that gets the Quentin Tarentino's seal of approval is worth a check out. Hostel was a movie that satisfies the gore hound in me , of course if strip everything away it could still be classed as a teen-slasher movie but it is different in the sense where it has these odds moments where one seems to genuinely care about the characters. The plot focus is on 3 back packers trodding around Amsterdame getting stoned,laid etc but then they are given an opportunity to take a ride in the wild side in Slovakia and being 'dumb American teens' they go through with the offer. One thing that Hostel could say has a focus on is the dark nature of humans and how far one is willing to go for the ultimate thrill. Although it as I said earlier one could argue it could be treated as a basic formulaic slasher it just takes the blood and gore level to graphic which makes it all the more amusing. I would recommend this as something different from Europe and is worth a look at , you might be shocked and you might laugh and some bits but it was a ride . My only complaint was that the trailer just gave away a little bit too much so we knew what was coming however Eli Roth has done very well indeed. I just hope that Part 2 satisfies the hunger for my gore better than The Hills Hvae Eyes Part 2 which was just a let down.HOSTEL 8.9 OUT 10THERE IS A PLACE , WHERE FOR A PRICE , YOU CAN SCARE , TORTUE AND KILL!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
OK movie but a little disappointed,"I was going into this movie to see some blood and guts, but instead i saw a lot of nudity. Don't get me wrong the nudity was good but i wanted to see torture and blood. The movie took a while to heat up and towards the end there were some overdone gory scenes. I found this movie humorous and in the theater i heard more laughs than screams. You can not go into this movie thinking it is going to be be scary, it is a ""horror"" comedy, and by horror i mean gory not scary. Overall i enjoyed the movie but was disappointed because the movie could have been a lot better. There were many unnecessary scenes that just dragged out the movie. You will be disappointed if your expecting a good scare. There are some cool brutal scenes but you have to be patient to see them.

"no plot, no problem","I have high expectations for any film that has Tarantino's name on it as all of his films that I had seen previous to this one were very good. However, he did not write or direct this film, he was simply the producer and it is this fact that I will pardon him from this train wreck of a movie.I can see how the hedonistic nature of the protagonists comes back to haunt them, but it is a weak irony at best. This movie was grotesque for the sake of being grotesque. I cannot recall the last time where I was more disappointed in a movie that I paid money to see. $6 was not worth the torment that was watching this movie. I know that the horrible nature of the film is a point in itself, but I believe that the film makers forgot crucial elements of the film such as character development and a good , solid plot when they were thinking of horrendous ways to disgust the audience. Also, in one scene, the lens filter inexplicably changes between angles. This is a poorly done film by almost all accounts.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror

Explict and Total gore... not worth the paper the script was written on.,"The first hour and five minutes of this movie are straight up porn, generated to hook the male audience. The last forty-five minutes are gore that goes past the extreme of Saw causing many patrons of theaters viewing this film to lose their lunch, similar to the nausea caused by Blair Witch Project. Quentin Tarantino truly did not make the film and his name is solely listed on the poster and advertisements to make people actually attend this picture. There are snuff films that do not take it to this level, and probably have better dialogue. The main influence from this film came from internet spam and idea of torture flicks; so they stuck to main influence without making much of a storyline or point. At least the violence of ""Munich,"" is backed-up with actual historical facts, rather than a fictional waste of garbage. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone, any age.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Don't be expecting an all out gore fest!,"Despite this being a well directed and effective film. I feel this, like many other horror films, has been overrated in terms of gore. Slogans like ""The sickest film you'll ever see"" grace the front cover..okay, maybe if you only watch like 5 films a year.I found the gore only came later on in the film, the first part of the film dealing more with the 3 carefree young travellers as they go exploring in Amsterdam. The unpleasant aspect of the film is not the actual on screen violence, more the way in which the 3 travellers are lead astray, promised beautiful women at this ""too good to be true"" place of pleasure, all they have to do is catch a train and go there. Viewing becomes increasingly uncomfortable when you see just how wrong they were to go there, it seems they are 3 decent people alone in a sea of scheming strangers and evil twists. They are in unfamiliar territory, everyone appears to be hostile, you can feel the earlier energy in the film disappear as what was supposed to be a trip of a lifetime turns deadly serious.However, when the violence does come, it is pulled of with precision and skill, no tired clichés, no overblown heroics, just upfront depictions of one human being relentlessly sadistic to another. It is the idea which is revolting...business man paying big bucks just to be able to torture somebody for kicks. The actual scenes of physical torture are brief, but intensely graphic for their short period.If you want all out gore and violence, Hostel is not what your after, watch the remake of ""The Hills have Eyes"" for that. Hostel, under the talented direction of Eli Roth, is an insight into the darker side of human will, and deals with how far some people will go to 'try something new'.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Publicity stunt as lame as the film itself...,"I have to say that it's been quite a while since I've fallen for the hype surrounding a movie like this one. Unfortunately, I got caught up in the promises made by Hostle and was let down in the most disappointing way.A perfect way to illustrate just how this film manages to fall so short of the mark is to compare it to the lame publicity stunt I had to bear witness to on opening night.During the first remotely ""scary"" scene in the film an audience member simply leaned forward and fell to the floor, leaving his girlfriend to scream out for help. Was he so scared by the graphic violence on the screen that he passed out in horror? Were we witnessing what we had all heard was true... would paramedics actually have to be called to the theater? No, not at all.The act was so transparent that it simply annoyed anyone who cared to notice. And the same thing can be said of the film itself. It's just another safe horror movie done by the numbers, dull and unoriginal, that simply pretends to be more than it is.Hostle is no more shocking, scary or disturbing than anything you've seen before. And much like it's failed publicity stunt, this film deserves to be ignored.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Would not waste my money.,"For the first 45 minutes of this film I thought I was watching a porno flick.

Folks don't waste your money, I say this will be out on DVD within about 6 months. The payroll for this film couldn't have gone over 100,000. The acting was awful.

short thoughts on Hostel,"{spoilers ahead} for all the hype my friends and the commercials put on this film, i left the theater feeling somewhat unfufilled. let it be known that Hostel is pretty damn graphic, but some of the things were so disgusting that i found myself laughing at its extremities instead of being scared. i mean there's {SPOILER!} people getting ran over, limbs getting cut off, pussing eyes, and lots of vomiting in between. i hope i don't sound weird for laughing during all this, but seriously the whole theater (which was full as hell) was laughing along with me. another thing that hurt the film is that the first 30-40 minutes is like a giant sex-fest, with very little scares...hell basically no scares at all. all in all hostel strives on gore, and i found that it does little to actually scare its audience. try the original Texas chainsaw massacre, and maybe even saw, but all in all i think Hostel will only provide an hour and thirty some-odd minutes of ""ooh""-ing and ""ouch""-ing.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
This is called horror?,"I had no expectations what-so-ever when I went to see ""Hostel"", all I knew was that it was a so-called horror movie; what I did not know was that I was about to sit through equal parts of porn and slaughter. It seems as if the makers tried to put together all the ingredients that they thought made teenagers (and some adults) watch films: drugs, (hot) nude women, road trips and sickening horror. For me, Hostel was a failure.It is not that I do not like horror, horror is great! ...As long as it is done properly. In ""Hostel"" there were none, or very few, surprise moments and no moments of ""he's coming, he's coming!"" (if you don't count the sex).

Not for the squeamish!!,"Just bought the DVD for this movie - I use it to get rid of girlfriends I am no longer interested in. I am a horror junkie, and this movie gave me my fill. The true horror that this film shows is the dark side of humanity. Imagine yourself living in some poor, forgotten Eastern European country where every day is a struggle to survive, and then some gangsters give you a few dollars a week to simply turn the other cheek as they lure unsuspecting tourists into their torture chamber for the pleasure of clients who've paid large amounts of cash for their pleasure of murdering the tourists in any way they choose. The townspeople in this film are over-joyed when fresh cash and fresh meat show up at the train station, because it means that they will make some money this week. Who gives a sh*t about what happens to the unsuspecting tourists, because it's not happening to you, and if any one in the town went to the authorities and reported it, then the town's major source of income is lost. This film makes you question yourself: ""What would I do for a dollar?"" Of course, your answer depends upon your particular level of affluence, or lack thereof. As one's situation becomes increasingly desperate, human self-preservation takes over as the individual sinks to deeper and deeper lows. An act is ""unspeakable"" only because your individual situation hasn't yet sunk that low. Think of any ""unspeakable"" act, throw the right amount of cash in, and now you not only ""speak"" of it, you do it because it benefits you. Everyone has their price.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Cruel movie without depth,"Sorry for any spelling issues - English is a foreign language.At first I must say that I'm totally disappointed of Quentin Tarantino. I liked his movies and how brutality was used. But Hostel totally shook this opinion. I can't understand how Tarantino could engage his self in a movie like this.The story bores from the minute the film starts. The 3 main characters have no depth and somehow their stupidity makes the viewer lack any feelings for them. The first 45 min. you see them smoke weed, f*** anything that comes across them and that's totally it - sounds already boring? Their play is also more sort of a B-Movie - except there is no point to laugh. Then slowly the ""story"" unfolds - which is easy to get behind - there is no suspense. To compensate this lack of suspense splatter of the worst kind is used. I mean in general I'm a fan of splatter - chainsawing Zombie, exploding heads, we've already seen anything like this - but always in the right place and packed into a story. Don't expect this to happen in Hostel. Drilling holes into legs and cutting of Achilles Heels is not cool, it's cruel and this film shows things like that in Close Up. Don't get me wrong I'm not a sissy, I've seen worse in the hospital where I worked. But in Hostel you don't even care if the 3 boys get killed, you don't have a relationship to them. This film celebrates the cruel killing as its only content. This is not cool, this is boring. Splatter films with zombies are cool, splatter films from Japan are cool, B-Movies are cool. But Hostel is plain cruel and boring - because it doesn't involve you. You're just disgusted by the things shown.Another major issue are the stupid stereotypes. Pot smoking Netherlands, poor, ugly and criminal former Soviet people. Simple characters is the most friendliest term that comes to my mind.Don't get fooled of the trailers and the Tarantino thing, this movie sucks and is not worth your time. Watch From Dusk till Dawn instead and see some nice splatter.1 Point for a film thats ending is as surprising as sand in the desert.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

hostel,"Director/Script: Eli Roth, Cast: Jay Hernadez (Paxton), Derek Richardson (Josh), Eythor Gudjonsson (Oli), Barbara Nedeljakova (Natalya), Jana Kaderabkova (Svetlana), Jan Vlasak (dutch businessman)When I went to see this movie, I honestly did not think I was going to be able to make it through. The characters are so unlikeable and arrogant its no wonder half the world hates us Americans. They were such a bunch of loudmouthed jerks, I was hopping they would all get cut up. However, watching the film to the end, I can see why the director choose to depict the characters that way. The horror in this film really sets off in the second half when they end up at the torture chamber in that hell hole of a village in Slovakia. Really the only jerk in the movie was the Paxton character. However, one develops respect for him by the end of the film and are actually glad that he survives. When his friends start to disappear, Oli being the first, we can see that he truly does care for his friends. When he finally escapes from that dreadful place of torture, he is able to find a car that by chance has the keys still in the ignition! He could easily have left but he risks his life and getting tortured again by those sadistic freaks to save that Japanese girl when he hears her screaming knowing she is getting tortured.By having this film start out as a typical teen sex movie and gradually regress into extreme horror, these people are not so arrogant anymore but fearful beyond anyones imagination. It is probably well known by now that Eli Roth was inspired to make this film based on a Thai web site that advertised the torture of humans for a price that was shown to him by Quentin Tarantino. The web site was probably a hoax but who knows, maybe their is such a place in this world. Their is certainly enough sick f**ks in this world to support such a place! Roth did a very outstanding job of making the events in this film seem real. I must admit that I felt rather unsettled after leaving the cinema. This is without a doubt a more intense horror than is normally shown in theaters. When this comes out in its uncut form on DVD it might be an NC-17. I thought the theatrical version was close. The character of Natalya was quite the evil bitch! Barbara Nedeljakova did a great job portraying her. I agree with another commenter that described her as the ultimate femme fatal!

One from another view,"I'm from Slovakia. I think the whole movie is a kind of reflection of people's worst expectations of unknown parts of Europe today and that's very cool I think especially for a horror fan. Usually most of movies about Europe are made in or around Prague. They say it's like many other places in Europe. They decided to capture it in some Czech city as say's speaking Czech voice at the train station or Czech titles on the walls. As for me it would be difficult to set such a story in real Bratislava because it would not match to the script because of the size and I think it would be hard to make of it such a terrifying place. Today everybody knows that name which is a picture of entertaining, violent and intellectual work, Mr. Tarantino and his movie led me to a particular question. Where is the story set? Those who have seen the film will more likely uncover the background of the location after seeing some website containing panorama views from the city.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Quebec Rating:18+ Canadian Home Video Rating:18A(should be R)Hostel is one of the goriest horror films of recent years.Recently, a lot of horror films have pushed the limits of violence in horror films.So I saw Hostel when it played on The Movie Network.Well I wasn't really expecting much so it didn't disappoint, but those who are expecting great storytelling, don't look here.Hostel basically relies on gore to entertain the audience and while the story is original, there is not much of it.If you watch this film just to see gore, you will not be disappointed however because it has a lot! Anyway Hostel is about three backpacking friends who are travelling in Europe.On their way, they visit a Hostel filled with beautiful women.So they have sex with some of the women but what they don't know is that they are part of this organization where they kidnap people such as tourists, then rich people come and pay money to torture them in horrific ways.Hostel is in my opinion a decent film filled with tons of gore.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gorefest!,"Watching all these years later, Hostel doesn't seem to be so shocking and controversial as it once was, but it still packs a punch.Most certainly worthy of a watch for the non squeamish, the acting isn't of a great standard, but that's not the reason for watching!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
That's it?,"I saw all these trailers that were promising gore and blood and horrible unspeakable acts that were going to happen in this movie. I was excited thinking if they put a decent story behind what they are promising than who knows this could turn into a great movie. I eagerly awaited Hostel's release and I went to see it opening day. After all was said and done I wondered is that it? Its over? Was there blood? Yes. And there were several scenes of torture also as promised. However Hostel fell short in my mind for several reasons First off, my biggest problem was the entire hook that this movie was wrapped around. Its gore. Yes it was present but the commercials made this movie out to be so graphic that if you're a tad bit squeamish don't go see it. I know that the type of people that the premise of this movie appeals to...I am the type of people and the commercials did a good job to really build up that type of person's interest. But when push came to shove frankly I wasn't impressed it was just too little from a filmed that promised too much. There are things in movies that make me cringe its not like it is a hard task or anything. But Hostel didn't make me want to cringe or feel queasy or any of that. My second problem was Eli Roth's laughable directing style. Roth really needs to decide whether he wants to direct horrors or comedies as he falls into the same problem that he got into with Cabin Fever in that he tries to mix the genres. The problem is that at some parts of the movie you're not sure if you should scream or laugh. Since you can't decide you don't do either and you aren't terrified or amused and the scene is wasted. Roth has great directing ability but he needs to focus on a genre. The movie does have its good points. The women are very very beautiful in this movie. Also the storyline while thin could be worse I suppose. It was frighting because in theory it could happen and thats about the only terror Hostel had as it was hardly suspenseful. Eli Roth does throw in some good laughs as well as a couple brutally graphic scenes, albeit far from what the film was told to deliver. In the end, Hostel just doesn't satisfy. I left the theater wishing I would have either had a richer plot or more gore. Either would have sufficed. To describe it best Hostel is much like an amateur sniper. The beginning take a long time aiming up for a perfect shot, such a long time that one gets impatient, and when that shot finally comes it seems rushed and as a result misses its mark entirely. If you want to see gore then save your money and rent or buy Saw 2 when it's released on DVD. Saw 2 is far superior in every way. (I.e. gore, plot, ending, acting, directing) Where as Hostel falls just short on every single promise it made and every thing a horror movie should include. If you're expecting to see buckets of blood you'll see it but you won't see how it got there and to me thats the main point. Don't see Hostel if you want to see a gory movie, or a good horror movie, or high hopes. If you don't go into it with any of these desires you may leave happy, otherwise you'll just leave unfulfilled.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Well, in a word: interesting. In a sentence: Not entirely good and not entirely bad.","Well, in a word: interesting. In a sentence: Not entirely good and not entirely bad.It was nothing like I expected it to be, mostly because the preview didn't show anything other than scenes of people being tortured. Basically I expected to sit through a movie entirely composed of disturbing events. The first scene of the movie however was in Amsterdam and involved lots of drugs and sex. I was puzzled, but found it all amusing so I didn't care. That's how the movie continued for about 45 minutes. Lots of drugs and as many tits as one sees in a porn.Still, I found the movie funny so I didn't mind. Then of course people FINALLY start getting tortured. You don't see a lot of it though, and the only thing that really disturbed me I've actually seen in other movies before. So nothing new, nothing special. I didn't really care about any of the characters until Pax (Jay Hernandez) put a suit on. Suddenly I was invested! It's strange how a nice black suit can make the most boring of people suddenly attractive and bad-ass.The movie was also really short! I couldn't believe how fast it went by, but being that there were only three main characters and a plot that really only belongs in a short story, I can forgive that. The movie would have really reeked something awful if they'd tried to carry it any longer.All in all, good movie. I'll probably buy it on DVD, but I won't be seeing it in the theatres again. -LS",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Perverse,"Perverse - that's the only thing I can say about this movie. Only sick people would come up with a script like that and only sick people would like to watch it.It's got absolutely no scare-value at all. The sexual references in the beginning of the film makes the whole movie appear like a movie for real life Hanibal Lecters who get sexual pleasure from watching people being tortured to death.I don't have any issues with gore *per se*. It's not the gore in this film that disturbs me, but the thought of the people who enjoyed making or watching it. Gore can be scary, gore can contribute to making a story more exciting, gore can even be funny (bad taste, etc). In all those cases, the filmmakers are using our repulsion for gore.This movie is using gore in the complete opposite way. We're supposed to take pleasure in it, and then it just becomes sick.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"not scary, just really really messed up","After all the hype and reading Harry Knowles' pretty rave review of this movie, I was relatively excited for it. Not giddy excited like I cant wait, but in anticipation of ""i wonder what this movie has that makes everyone talk about it so much."" Honestly the clincher for me going to see it was an ad I saw that said ""scariest movie in a decade. -AintItCoolNews"". I trust Harry Knowles and his reviews, so I decided, Hey, it must be incredibly worthwhile.Now I was expecting something absolutely horrifyingly scary. I am NOT a huge horror movie fan, but I've seen quite a few in my day. There have been many movies that have shaken me in my seat, Event Horizon being the one that sticks out most in my mind (only on the big screen though). Even Texas Chainsaw Massacre had moments where you got freaked out and you could feel the tension in your chest.Let me just say that I was not impressed with this movie. I knew it would be really really messed up, but I thought that would be combined with EXTREMELY tense moments, moments that rip your from your seat and make you look away because you don't want to see what happens next. Hostel had none of that. It was just really, really messed up. The beginning was too cheesy with no drama, then once the drama started, there weren't any ""teeth clenching"" moments. Just moments where you said to yourself ""wow, thats just not right."" I just felt such a strong absence of the marriage of gore and tension. The two go hand in hand, and while you can have extreme tension with no gore, gore does improve it in a horror movie. A movie with no tension but lots of gore just leaves you a little white in the face, not wanting to eat BBQ sandwiches for a week, and emotionally you're disturbed.Let me clarify what I mean by tension. I Don't mean tension between characters, or emotional tension of an individual. I mean the tension between your psyche and the action on the screen. Those moments when you feel a knot in your chest, and there is a 10 second pause in the movie, where you're left waiting to see when someone will jump out. Those moments where the camera slowly zooms in on someone, and you know something is about to happen. THAT is the tension I am talking about, and the tension that I feel REALLY makes a horror movie what it is; where movies can scare you worse than you've ever been scared in real life.In summation, this movie was made to 'gross you out' with really really f'ed up scenes. Don't expect a great plot or character dynamics, or even a great ending. If you want to see people die in graphic ways, without clenching your teeth, you can either go to a torture museum, or watch this movie. This is a Gore-or movie, not a Horror movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

The effects in the movie is quite OK, the girls are very pretty and scenery is nice. It might took a bit to long before there 'action' started.

Worst movie ever,"OK, maybe I shouldn't have given it a 1 rating. But considering the fact that we walked out of the theater after an hour into the film should say something.

This movie got so much hype about being scary, gruesome, ""the paramedics were called for test audiences"" Blah, blah, blah. Hype, all made up hype. A bunch of B.S. to promote a movie. Within the hour that we watched there was only one small ""torture"" sequence which involved them showing a drill being picked up, then hearing a man screaming, then showing a bloody drill.

Dark genius that's unfortunately destined to be ruined by idiots.,"I can't help feeling that Hostel is going to become the Clockwork Orange of my generation. What I mean by that is a movie that provides a genuinely original narrative told in a daring fashion that's seen as a cheap 'sex and violence' flick by everyone who either didn't have the balls to see it or had the balls to get in the cinema but didn't have the stomach for it once they were in.Firstly some cold hard facts: There is less nudity in Hostel than there is in Shredder, Detour or Bloody Murder, or any 80s or 70s horror you care to mention. There is also far less violence than there is in High Tension, Creep or Dog Soldiers. Also, the nudity and the violence are part and parcel of the continuation of the plot line, not gratuitous and pointless as some have continuously harped on about. The nudity in the first half-hour is A: Used as a device to display the differences between the three main characters, and to set up Paxon as a character who steadily becomes more aware of where his bachelor habits have got him, B: Initiated by unscrupulous characters in order to manipulate the three weak-willed males into a false sense of security.In a similar fashion the violence (of which there is at a stretch about five minutes of on-screen, not exactly a lot when you consider that Friday the 13th Part 6 has a total of 21 on screen deaths in it's 80 or so minutes) is used sparingly to flesh out the initially unseen horror you can feel creeping up on the cast, and to provide those all-important scares that a horror requires. To be honest, the most frightening thing is that Eli Roth manages to make the killers both worryingly real and believable as people. These are not knife-wielding zombies with vendettas, they're accountants, doctors...lawyers lol. Scary stuff.That said, Hostel is intense, uncomfortable viewing. I would never make the ridiculous claim that this is an easy film to watch. Hostel generates an atmosphere of dread and tension that you could cut with a knife, taking the morbid and inescapable feel of Roth's earlier Cabin Fever all the way up to 11. It's a hard, tough watch that'll leave you gasping for air afterwards, and I have to honestly say I've never been this on edge during a movie since Seven.Really, this is a movie that needs to be watched with an open mind and preferably an understanding of the horror genre. It's a morbid, downbeat and disturbing terror-ride, and it won't be for everyone, but I implore people not to make their mind up before you see it. It IS shocking, it is violent, but it's also intelligent and cultured, a film made by a film-maker, not a film made by committee, and it needs recognition as such.On a final note, everyone who says this movie is sexist can shove that where the sun does not shed light. You need to look at the first act again and get it through your dumb skull that the two Russian girls are in the pay of the 'Extreme Hunters' to entice backpackers to their death. You also must have missed the fact that Paxton goes back to save his Japanese friend instead of leaving her. Also, true fact, I went to see this with my friend who isn't particularly big on gore films or indie horror, preferring things like Team America, Matrix and the like, and she really dug it. Oh, and the theatre was 50/50 girls and boys, so shove it. Really, get off your damn high horse.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Wayward,"Unlike most recent horror films, Hostel shows a genuine talent for scaring. But it also shows that to make the most of this the director needs guidance from somebody (probably somebody not Quentin Tarantino). In particular, this film needed a different scriptwriter (i.e. other than the director), a different cameraman, and a focus on what it was about, i.e. what kind of film it was. The idea of it would have made a very scary short story, and the film could have been as scary, whereas at present only a few scenes scare and the bulk of it is waste motion.The writing and camera-work must be discussed together because both are to blame for the insufficiency of the build-up in the first part. Even granted the director is out to establish the protagonists' lifestyle (during their vacation) as one long hedonistic binge, this needn't have taken more than a few minutes. Where we needed to get to was where they were to end up; Hostel took too long getting them there. And once they were there, it didn't do much about this. We needed to see, with them, their first look at the country, the city, the street, &c. And with them we should have seen things that unsettled us increasingly: at first the kinds of things in other cultures you disapprove of but hesitate to condemn; then things alien, partly incomprehensible; then, in systematic progression, things that were confusing, sinister, dangerous, frightening.... Almost none of this is written into the script, and where it is, the camera-work doesn't deliver it. Some movies are able to instill landscapes with a sense of dread; sometimes you know how they do it, sometimes you don't but find your stomach unaccountably in knots; either way, some such method was required here. Most obviously wanting is the atmosphere of the hostel itself, which I'd expected to be the center of horrific activity (the movie would have been scarier if it had been; but of course this has been done before). The protagonists' experiences there should have added up to more than a few conversations with the girls; they, and we, should have come to wonder about the comings and goings of the guests (especially the goings), the behavior of the staff, movements and conversations glimpsed or overheard in the hall, through the windows, at night when everyone should be in bed.... More significant is the same want of detail of life outside. We see thieving children and a torture museum; these are too obvious, and not nearly enough. We needed to see indications of a callous, brutal environment where ordinary morals are eroded and everything is a commodity, with survival the bottom line; to see enough so when we get where the film is taking us we don't doubt for a second what we see because it's a logical extension of what we've seen before; of the very _air_ in that place.Hostel's basic structure is the central horror film plot: a character happens onto a place (person, situation, &c.); at first it seems innocent, then suspect, and finally, when the character learns the truth, horrible. The basic problem with it here is the same as in almost every other film using it: it's just enough for a short subject or TV episode, and so must be stretched out to three or four times its natural length. If a film keeps to the confines of the structure, the ending is in effect no ending (that's IT?); if it goes beyond the structure into a third act, which almost has to be an account of escape or revenge, it also goes beyond the horror that is its raison d'etre; and since up to then it has been striving to convince us the horror is inexorable, in effect it's undoing what it's done (for examples of the two methods described, cf. the two versions of The Vanishing). Hostel takes the second path, but the director seems to realize he's gone beyond his original story, since he begins to exaggerate the horror and the action to Hong Kong-like proportions, dispelling the seeming seriousness with which he treated the harrowing scenes that preceded. However, in a story of this kind, any attempt at a third act is a trap, and Hostel falls into it. The script might at the beginning have introduced a larger context--war, the economy, anti-American feeling--and returned to it in the end; but that implies a more serious film than I think this one meant to be.In other respects also, the script is probably most to blame for Hostel's faults. Padded as the story was bound to be, what would have filled it out somewhat was a more rounded characterization of the protagonists. The dialogue of the villains probably needed to remain elliptical to be disquieting in the way intended; but we should have gotten well acquainted with the protagonists, seen what each did uniquely, and understood why; scenes so informing us are absent. And there are what I consider misjudgments in structure. The scenes behind the credits are disturbing, but telegraph something of where we're heading and what goes on there, both of which would have been scarier without a prior look. For a first-act payoff, the film introduces a horror shot--its first, I think--and I think this was a mistake; the shot preceding, which would have planted the same suggestion but left us unsure and worried about it, would actually have been scarier. There are two second-act payoffs: one too many. They would have been more effective combined into a single one, probably with the second preceding the first. And finally, there is some unintentional misdirection. The credit scenes mislead us, in a way; and the horror climax--the second payoff--misleads us more: it implies a third level to the system shown that would have made it even scarier (though less credible).In summary: a wayward film from a wayward talent.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
It sucks!,"«Hostel» does not even qualify as a horror movie. It's just a bunch of disgusting clichés regarding Slovakia and Central Europe. A grose Americancentrism makes the whole plot.

Welcome To Your Worst Nightmare,"Paxton, Josh and Oli are backpacking across Europe when they are told about a hostel in Slovakia. Once they hear that this hostel is infested with beautiful European woman who only want tourists, they quickly get on a train to the wonderful promise land. As soon as they get there, they start having the time of their lives. Soon after they arrive, they slowly start to realize that this hostel is hiding a terrible and dark secret.One day, I just decided to see ""Hostel."" I've seen ""Turistas"" first and many people have said it was a complete rip-off out of this film. Well, I can see the similarities but the whole feel for the two films is different, and I actually like ""Turistas"" because it was realistic, more or less and the characters were smart.Compared with ""Hostel,"" the characters are dumb, at least for the first hour. Honestly, I found the first hour a let down, not because there's not a lot of blood - I don't like that - but because it was basically a bunch of nudity and characters going around doing sex and drugs. I do, however, found Derek Richardson performance really comedic, in a good way.After that hour is over, it really gets good - no, not because there's a lot of torture scenes - but because the film slowly turns to a black comedy, and I mean it in a good way. After a mediocre first hour, I was quite entertained by the last half hour. I was really cheery for the characters and laughing at the screen! If only the first hour was like that...still, that last half hour boosted my like-ness for this film.The performances were decent. I, in my opinion, think that it was worth the wait for the last half hour. Sure, the first hour is just plain mediocre and un-entertaining, but what comes next is the fun part.

"Distgusting, yet entertaining, but somewhat unbearable","Hostel, directed by Eli Roth, has it's high points, many of them in fact, and it's low points.

Fun but over hyped.,"Director of the indie hit ""Cabin Fever"", Eli Roth's 2nd feature and latest horror offering is a starker and potentially more disturbing take vision. Though not without a sense of humor, which seems to deliberately compliment some of the more gruesome of the film, ""Hostel"" succeeds most for me during the first 1/2 to 2/3 of the picture. Characters and setup are laid out smoothly and an abundance of bare-breasts doesn't hurt either;) However, once things really start to go from bad to worse, it became increasingly difficult for me to continue to take the situation seriously as scenes go over-the-top and humor starts to leak through. While this was likely a conscience choice on the part of the director, for me it hurt the film and my ability to stay engrossed. I'd have rather the tone and story remained consistent and not made the apparent change-up.Though still bound to be strong medicine for the average mainstream movie goer, Hostel seems unlikely to leave a lasting mark on genre fans. If you've heard comparison's to Miike's ""Audition"" don't expect to have the same reaction because unlike the latter, this film isn't especially disturbing or horrifying. It's a fun time at the movies and somewhat of a step up forward from ""Cabin Fever"", but just the same not particularly memorable.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why did Quentin Tarantino put his name on this ???,"OK, Quentin's movies were always violent, but they had a story to go with it. Hostel is nothing but a cheap excuse for a gore movie.

The prelude is way too long and there is no story at all. The characters fall in every cliché possible and are just plain dumb. It wasn't even entertaining. SAW and SAW II was entertaining, that was just boring and gross. We can clearly see the Asian influence on this film but it lacks the depth that you can normally see in those kind of movies.

Not that pushing the envelope is always a good thing, but if you think seeing on film what might be in your darkest fantasies, then it's a good thing. It took balls to go where this flick goes.Bad points; I don't know about the uncut version, but cutting 20 or 30 minutes out of the first half of the film would make it better (unless you need a lot of T&A to warm you up to the gore). It felt like 2 movies - the first half (T&A)and the second half (what you see on the previews). Maybe it was an expectation thing for me, but the way it was hyped, I figured to see the camera stay on some scenes just a little too long - which would have fit the premise of ""Hostel"" better, but maybe it was designed that way and it wound up on the editing room floor.

We've become so desensitized as a country that filmmakers have to try harder and harder to shock us. Well, Roth did it, but not in a good way. The original idea for the movie was good, but the goriness and blood of it all made me not only ever want to see this movie, but none of Roth's movies.

a Killer Business,"Hostel is a movie that revolves around two American men backpacking through Europe as a life experience. They meet a young man from Iceland along the way and join up with him as they travel from hostel to hostel. The basic idea of the movie is disturbed businessmen pay big money to torture and kill people. What a concept, right? As Hostel does deliver many unpleasant scenes of blood, guts, and beyond; I do feel this movie had one major flaw. When you first start watching this movie, you will slowly start to ask yourself and others in the room if you are really watching the right movie. Why? That's because the first 30+ minutes of the story seems more like a National Lampoon's movie than any horror. I personally feel they took way too much time to get into the heart of the story. With all that said, it did a very good job at depicting a disturbed world of torture. The idea of that even slightly being possible makes me sick. Many of the scenes are very graphic and are probably not recommended for the light of heart. Overall the concept and torture scenes accomplished the mission of great horror cinema. The over stretched story packed with sex and partying was a bit much. I would recommend SAW over HOSTEL any time, if someone asked my opinion. I feel the original SAW was a better movie in every aspect and HOSTEL had many good qualities, but slacked in a smooth story.Enjoy!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Tell me,,, what is your nature?","Horror movies were normally campy slashers, creature features, etc,,, then the 2000s brought along some new kinds of horror movies,, one of them being Hostel. I'd never heard the word before. Never really thought about what parts of the world could be like, other than the shiny/happy, disney inspired type of places. Well, Hostel paints a picture of some American guys discovering just how sadistic human beings can be. As a movie I'd give it a 6.2,,,Josh and Paxton are two American students traveling through Europe, exploring all the hedonistic pleasures the countries have to offer. Along the way the meet an Icelandic friend named Oli, who's traveling around looking for the same adventures. One night they meet a guy who informs them that the hottest and most attainable women are in Bratislava, and they go crazy over Americans. Well, Pax, Josh, & Oli make their way to Bratislava asap! Once there, they meet these girls at the local hostel,, they party,, they do what we all want to be doing more often than not,, then,, the guys start disappearing,,,If your squeamish, easily frightened, not able to compartmentalize,,, this movie is not for you (I've just become pretty desensitized to it at this point). It is brutal, for the most part. Granted,, this movie came out 16 yrs ago,, and brutality has been kicked up a notch in everything since then, even TV (TWD sn7, ep1).

'Hostel',"The wait is over. Was it worth the wait? Yes and I enjoyed myself a lot at this movie. First off, the movie is not nearly as brutal as the previews and other people make it out to be. For a brutal, twisted (American) torture flick watch ""Strangeland."" As a horror film, this movie does stand alone. Everything else you heard about the movie, you already heard. Its not ""scary"" but disturbing, and yes scary to think that yes, there are people like this. The long torture sequences are pretty tame, while the brutal ones are extremely quick, but trust me you probably saw enough.Highly Recommended.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as harrowing or brutal as others make it out to be...,"The subject matter underlying Hostel should have been enough to make this movie a harrowing one. However, the film did not reach the level that it should have in dealing with the subject matter.The main problem with the film was the characters in the movie: they act like typical, horny teenagers straight out of typical, teenage sex comedy movies. If these characters had been in, say, American Pie or Porky's, they would not have appeared out of place. Here, they act as distractions. They are not memorable or have any redeeming qualities about them. The only character who I felt had any depth and substance was the main character, played by Jay Hernandez, but only barely.The story itself unfolds unevenly: the first half plays like a sex comedy and the second half, like exaggerated torture and gore flick. Unfortunately, even the bad characters are portrayed like caricatures and, thereby, ruin the realism of any of the scenes that could have had any massive, visceral impact.Hostel is not a boring or unwatchable film, however. To be sure, there is much genuine suspense and terror throughout the film, especially in the second half, but not to the degree it was purported to have had at the time of the release.A passable, gore film that should please most gorehounds.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another piece of junk from Eli Roth,"Will someone please stop Eli Roth (the ""director"" of this stupid and dull excuse for a movie) from ever making any other films? His ""Cabin Fever"" was bad enough, but ""Hostel"" is way, way worse. This wretched excuse for a movie takes half its running time to get down to business, squandering any intelligence or plot in favor of low-grade porn and the misadventures of three characters that no one could remotely even care about. Throw in a lot of barely concealed homophobia (Eli Roth apparently has issues he's trying to work out) and watch this impotent brew put the audience to sleep. By the time the supposedly ""scary"" stuff starts happening, this movie is so far off the tracks that it crashes and burns into one ridiculous scene after another. Film buffs might get a laugh or two picking out parts of other, better horror films that Eli Roth ripped off and used in ""Hostel"", in exactly the same way he did for ""Cabin Fever"". This movie actually put me to sleep during it's first half, and then gave me a whopper of a headache during the second half, primarily due to aggravation based on the fact that I couldn't punch Eli Roth's face off. The only really frightening thing on the DVD is in the featurettes listening to Mr. Roth talk about how European toilets flush. I told you he had issues. Pass this movie by and save a couple of aspirins. Total garbage!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
decent modern horror,"OK, so the Tarantino reference is somewhat misleading, but what do you expect? it's a trailer, it's designed to get you into the cinema.that aside, any mainlining horror fan won't complain. and let's be honest. your average horror fan by demographic is a teenage hormonally challenged male, mentally or otherwise. and on this basic level, the film surely delivers. additionally, the film has so many cinematic references (The Wicker Man being one example) it's obvious that it comes from the hands of someone who's steeped in horror lore.the plot is simple. backpackers, two American and one European, seek fun and adventure in a 'dangerous' europe. they head eastwards on the promise of promiscuity and more besides.the characters are not complex. but the plot, for those familiar with horror film morality, does not follow an obvious trajectory, and the gore is unsparing. as is the nudity. it plays with clichés and chews them up, then spits them out, big style.this is grown up, modern horror, proud of its roots, but revelling in modern shock value.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Not my cup of tea,"Eli Roth is one of those people I don't think very highly of, he feels kind of like a more mean-spirited Rob Zombie when it comes to his movies.I'm getting a little ahead of myself. This movie has the kind of characters that I don't like, dope smoking, sex-addicted, naive idiots, and there's plenty of dialogue that's pretty trashy like ""I can't even remember the color of her tits"". On that note, there's also way more sex than could be necessary in my opinion. The premise is admittedly pretty unique because murder for profit businesses are a thing that isn't explored much and it's perfect for a horror movie. There's also some stuff to enjoy in the gore department, but there's still a point where it's too much for me, with one particular death being the most mean-spirited I've seen. The characters do feel kind of realistic, but also a bit too naive. You'll be thinking ""don't they think this is all a little too convenient?"" for quite a while. The style also send like it's trying to blend horror with adventure, and doesn't always hold up to scrutiny.But there were some things I liked. While some of the characters were just there to be a statistic, I found myself liking Paxton, because he's not only competent, but legitimately likeable as he shows that he's not all about sex and dope, and punishes a lot of the bad guys quite severely. I'm not a fan of how they depict Russia, because I'm sure a town like that, where the police are supporting this horrible practice, wouldn't exist for a lot of reasons and there's plenty of cliches, but I do like how they used an actual gang of street kids and people actually from the countries they play instead of Americans for their respective roles.All in all, it's a decently made movie, but not as smart or scary as it wants to be. I think it has a few too many horror movie cliches to be anything more than decent, even if it's produced by Quentin Tarantino.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

A very pleasant surprise,"I must admit, Roth has redeemed himself with Hostel after an abysmal outing with Cabin Fever. In that film I could not care less if these characters lived or died because they were so unlikeable. It is SO important in horror or thriller movies to make the characters so relateable that you could imagine that it is actually you in their situation. I am pleased to say that Hostel works very well in this area. Three guys backpacking through Europe together get a tip-off that there is a bevy of beautiful women in a town in Bratislava who are ready and willing for anything. It happens that the guys aren't having too much luck in the people-saturated Amsterdam, so they decide to trek over to this town. And so the mystery and terror begins... One of the things I was shocked by was the polish of this film - not often do people describe horror movies as beautiful - from the cinematography to the score. A good example is the intro with the credits: snapshots of a dank place somewhere with someone whistling, cleaning up a room of some sort from many different angles, often blurred or out of focus - but never actually knowing what the heck is going on. Now, for a supposedly gory and ultra-violent movie, I found these sensoral moments very rewarding. For me, buckets of bloods splattering the screen is not scary - more often what you don't see will terrify the viewer much more effectively, so the actual goriness of the movie only accounts for roughly 20% but, because of the other 80% involved, the 20% becomes crucial to the telling of the story (YES, an intriguing story in a horror movie). After an intro of getting to know the characters, once events happen to take them away from the main action you feel for them and their fate. Even beyond this movie, it leaves you with a sense of what happens next? and not just a sequel for sequels' sake. Jay Hernandez is excellent in his role, showing a great vulnerability for a male lead when it was possible for him to become all 'Die Hard' on us - that said, he knows when to bring out the big guns when required. The other two includes Hernandez's friend who began the journey with him and tries to summon the courage to approach the very forward women in Amsterdam, and an Icelandic backpacker who is the complete opposite joined them along the way who bringing a lot of humour to the tale. The terror in the movie is excellent and the psychology of the characters, intriguing to say the least, albeit disturbing. As with most horror movies, the overall message is the same regarding our human ability to trust others and when it is misplaced. I am hoping with the sequel they can build on and enhance the atmosphere created in this movie and continue to chill the pants right off us :)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Just no bloody good,"I have never given a film a 1 before and always wondered why people do so. I once noticed, for example, that an awful lot of people gave Magnolia a 1 and I thought, why? Why would anyone give a film that makes you think a 1. Why would you give a film with beautiful cinematography a 1, why would you give a film with great acting a 1. Even if you don't like a film doesn't mean it is necessarily bad and deserves a 1. A 1 should be reserved for when a film meets none of the criteria that we might attribute to a half decent film. Moreover, the criteria that makes a generic film a worthwhile part of the canon it seeks company within.Hostel managed this complete lack worthiness. It was neither scary, suspenseful, well acted, well shot, well plotted, it did not supply any pathos (who cared about these stupid w*nkers anyway?) nor did it bother to even disgust. The gore was as pitiful as the acting and direction. It did have some great tit action, but as I'm not a teenager i'm not really going to let that sway me. This film gets a 1.

Eli Roth, who, by setting this film in Bratislava and filming it in Prague demonstrates in 4 ways why so many people hate Americans:(1)he went to a far-off country, Czech Republic, to tell an American story - a particularly retrograde horror film with the 'fear of travel' motif. The 'moral' of the story is not lost on Americans who widely and falsely believe Europe is far more dangerous than the U.S.;(2)by going to another country and writing a script for foreigners to perform - for money - he is basically saying 'clearly they - whoever they might be - are better off letting us present them the way we want them to be seen.' Why is it you wont see Slvoaks representing themselves at your local googleplex?;(3)he affirms to the Slovak people that they are only as useful as their labor is cheap and,(4) he comes back to an absurd level of press accolades (absurd meaning more than zero).Where else but in Hollywood could someone be so publicly rewarded for being so anti-social, mediocre, and self-glorifying? ...Washington?heres the article:Movie newsHostel director scared of Slovakia Director Eli Roth claims he is scared to visit Slovakia after the government responded angrily to his controversial new horror movie 'Hostel'.The film portrays the story of several backpackers, who meet a nasty end in Bratislava when they are lured into bed by beautiful women before being tied up and tortured to death by bored businessmen.And Roth reckons the Slovakian authorities are not too happy with his portrayal of their capital city.He said: ""The head of the tourist board got pretty angry, and invited me to Slovakia to show they don't just murder and torture people for fun.""I have a feeling that now I've made the film, I will get beaten and tortured in Slovakia.""

Horrid movie,I thought this movie was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Too much sex and not enough real gore. And there was no real point to what gore you did see. The story concept was good but executed very poorly. Made what little respect I had for Quinton that much less. I think that most of what happened could have been accomplished and portrayed without all the sexual visuals. That is my main beef with this film. When half the movie is based on sex (which really didn't have much to do with the gore part) before you even get to the gory part then there is a problem when the movie is supposed to be a horror flick about the gore. The sex scenes weren't in the previews which makes the previews misleading. If it wasn't in the preview even a little then it really didn't seem that important. They wanted to concentrate on the gore and scare tactics instead (which wasn't all that scary or gory but it does take a lot for me to get grossed out). Keep in mind this is my personal opinion and you can make up you own minds but I wouldn't see or recommend this to anyone.,1.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Disturbing Horror Classic,"Hostel has been unfairly criticize for being too gory and sadistic, as people ignore what the movie is trying to say on human nature. Hostel's basic tone and plot is this: the exploration of humanity's nature for finding the pleasures of life and always seeking more ways to fulfill it's cardinal sins. The three victims in the movie are all seeking pleasure through sex and drugs, but those who go to the ""business"" in Slovakia no longer can get fulfillment from casual sex and drug use, so they seek their pleasures in sadistic torture and blood. These people will pay large amounts of money and conduct the most horrendous acts just to fulfill their desires. In some sad way, this is so true as everyone has that deep deep desire to hurt or watch someone die, whether one tries to see if there's dead bodies after an accident or killing virtual soldiers or people in video games. To me Hostel explores this secret desire upfront in graphic details. Yes, the film is dark, yes the movie is gory and sadistic, (I was surprised it got an R rating) but so can human nature... all you need to do is watch the evening news and know it's true.

I imagine Eli Roth took a trip to the Holocaust museum and his first thought was ""hey! this would make a great movie! if I slip in enough tits and gore, no one will notice that my characters are nothing but puppets that exist to be chopped up by maniacs! Brilliant!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Didn't watch it all....,"I only sat threw about the first 40 minutes to 45 minutes before I had to turn it off. I rented the unrated and uncut version and found it to be...less than terrible. I hated Cabin Fever and I didn't know the guy that wrote that movie wrote this movie as well. It was advertised a Quinton T. movie more than anything else. If I had known that the Cabin Fever dude was involved I NEVER would have rented it. There was no story in the beginning, just guys getting high and wanting to get laid....thats pretty much it the entire 40 minutes. I think the target audience is young people. I am 24, so I am talking like, 18 or so. Sometimes, some movies lag in the beginning, but get better in the middle, this one had nothing interesting in it-at all for 40-45 minutes. Maybe it got better, I dunno, but it was unbearable enough for me to say screw waiting and shut it off.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
classic horror slasher/torture flick,SAW type of vibes from the 2005 horror classic. Goes from being a touring Europe party-fest comedy to a gore-fest of a horror flick turned survivor film. Needless to say this is worth watching.,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
worthless garbage glad i got my ticket $$$ back so i could rent cabin fever !,"horrible waste of anyones time, yes its true a person knows what this is all about b4 they walk n, only reason i went was to see the cheap euro chix to do the violence, once they showed up , i walked out , its that simple !how sad eli had to sell out once he went bigtime , cabin fever was so well done on all levels it just worked great from the well cast actors to the fresh script and storyline to the production values, it was smart and original like a good movie should b.i got hooked on cerina vincent after cabin fever !! who didn't ? haha but its truly sad how the garbage movie SAW has (badly) influenced a lot young directors, i only went to see saw 2 to catch lovely Canadian actress emannuelle vaugier, when all the dumb ( and thats what senseless violence without ANY rationale is ) came up i shut my eyes and turned off & tuned out, same reason the old movie fight club sucked so bad !glad i got my money back from the nice ticket girl at the counter , i wasn't the only one doing this not by a long shot , there was a younger couple in front of me, i left and rented the well done cabin fever with gorgeous cerina vincent and i also austin powers to cheer me up from the nasty horrible taste of hostel !-------ToddOhio Univ",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
the worst horror ever,"i saw this movie because my friend told me that it was so scary she couldn't sleep for a month,when she talked to me about it she could barely make up a sentence without gasping for air, i'm serious... the movie started out really slow,for about 40 minutes nothing particularly interesting happened,i almost fell asleep,then at almost the end of the movie, all the ""scary stuff"" happens which i thought that it must be very scary to freak my friend out like that,i seriously started laughing for how ridiculous the ""special effects"" were and just for the story plot...i got very disappointed,but at least some humor woke me up. i really thought this was one of the worst horror movies ever.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hostel 2005,"Just rented Hostel and it very well may be one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. A cross between Porkys and some off the wall B horror flick from 1982. What is the deal? Does he think that because he's Quentin Tarantino he can just put together any stupid series of events and call it Art of Film?? His name will sell it? How insulting. Pulp Fiction was fantastic, Reservoir Dogs was excellent, Jackie Brown was almost good (sorta kinda OK), From Dusk Till Dawn was pretty dumb as a whole but had a few redeeming qualities; decent cast, visually interesting enough....But THIS?

Tortured Fun!!!,"Saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival and got what i expected. Eli Roth has the ability to agitate a viewer and evoke a turn-away response with some of the anticipated visuals. The premise behind the movie was also very disturbing, and it is too bad Mr. Roth could not elaborate on this more in the film. All in all, I thought this film was well done for what it is, a B-movie. My only criticism was the ending of the film, which Mr. Roth did so well with 'Cabin Fever'. This film is not for everyone, nor should it be. It is for people who like to have their senses twinged a bit from the other disturbing films such as 'Herbie: The Love Bug' as remarked by the beautiful co-star of the film during the Q&A.

Between the cheesy special effects the gore in this movie looks too fake for the shock value to set in. And by the way don't buy into that inspired by true events. All they did was clump a few urban legends together which make this film about as real as Hellraiser. If you want to see a good horror film thats gory go watch Saw II and least that film has a good plot to go with it. I can simply not find a reason to tell anyone to watch this movie.

Not as expected!........ Better,"The only reason i did not give this movie a perfect score is because the teasers led us to believe this movie will be torture all the way through and i got my guy friends to come and just sort of hangout but it turned out to be well plotted. Rather than torture the movie has a heroic plot and is definitely recommended for couples to cuddle and just enjoy the well balanced sadistic yet genius movie. Incredible acting, super plot. This movie also proves it doesn't take multi-million contracts on a single actor to make the acting good. Also i found this movie to be more of a thriller rather than a horror. If you want to enjoy the hot girls, the sex, yet see a good semi-unexpected plot with some(Notice not a lot) of torture. This is for you.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

I, on the other hand, loved this movie. The previews make it seem a lot more grotesque, but it's not just stupid gore and violence. There is tons of gore in violence in this movie on the other hand so don't think the previews are misleading. This movie has a great story line, that shows real life in an artistic sense.

One of the worst movies I've ever seen!!,"Wow, such a disaster and waste of money. Hostel is nothing it promises to be. It's doesn't contain enough blood, enough horror, enough sex or enough tension. It's just a copy of American horror cinema that has become to be so afraid to accomplish a thing completely.The movie can be analyzed in three parts. The first part is a teen movie, where we're supposed to learn the morals behind the 3 guys going to Slovakia. It's so weird in this part that, an American who's living in a dream world himself, tries to judge the Europeans for being selfish and self-obsessed.The second part, tries to put some horror into the movie. As this part of the movie begins, it's so obvious that ""Hostel"" is going nowhere. Roth, is helpless and it's no surprise that he doesn't find a way out (just a small and idiotic surprise to turn things over).The third part is supposed to be the strongest, where some tension and thrill should be inserted, but this part is so quickly finished, that as you watch you feel like, the film was out of budget so some parts were just not shot!********* possible spoiler *************well, there is however one thing to learn from Hostel. If, one your friends, happens to have an eye flopping out of her brains, you can just cut the vessels or neurons whatever connecting the eye to her brain, and the bleeding will stop.

Lackluster,"Let me preface this post by saying that I was really, REALLY excited to see this movie. A gore-filled horror movie stamped with Quentin Tarantino's approval (as a ""presenter"") sounded pretty good. Opening weekend, 9:30 Show... sold out, 10:30... football-field-long-line. We waited anyway. I'll cut to the chase. I thought the film was poorly written, poorly acted (for the most part), and just poorly done in general. It left nothing to the imagination, and there was simply nothing interesting about it. As far as gore is concerned (if that's all your looking for), Saw and Saw II blow Hostel out of the water. If it wasn't for the pair of gorgeous Russian girls that rarely have clothes on, this would have been a total bust. The first words out of my roommates mouth upon exiting the theater were, ""Why the hell did you want to see that?"" I spent the rest of the night explaining why I thought it sounded like it would be a great movie, and buying them beers to compensate for the disappointment. Hostel was a huge let down.

appalling,"i have used IMDb for a number of years and this is the first time i have been moved by a film so much that i actually registered.This film is an insult to intelligence. We only hired it because of the Tarantino tag and quite frankly I cannot understand why the man would degrade himself to allow his name to be used to promote such a poorly acted, poorly scripted and poorly directed film. It is at best boring and predictable the premise behind the 'hostel' is apparent to anyone over the age of 2.There is only one part of the film that makes you wince and that is totally expected but of such a manner that you cant help but wince. The plot is laughable. The media hype surrounding this film is totally unwarranted it is NOT scary it is NOT horrific it is NOT even well made or even worth wasting 90 minutes of your life watching!

I mean seriously I am sure this movie had enough of a budget to hire a few decent actors. Well I guess if I could act i wouldn't go near this script either. I am certain a bunch of foul mouthed 5 year old kids penned it under the name ""Eli Roth"". Seriously every character is off the shelf stock. Young, pot-headed, hedonistic, horny and above all stupid kids go on massive road trip throughout Europe and end up in an area which lures tourists in and has people pay to slaughter them. Whoa that is a good one... Let me tell you now.

Do Not See this Movie!!,"This movie, is, by far and away, the worst movie I have ever seen. Without ever significantly developing any of the characters, this movie fails to generate an atmosphere consistent with a movie about torture.

Moreover, this abomination of a flick, is too scared to actually show torture, despite being marketed in such a way as to sell itself on this horrid human behavior. At least such an experience would have generated some emotion in it's audience. The film, however, fails to provoke any thought, capture any interest, or generate any emotion in its audience.

Please give it a chance.,"I remember seeing promos for this. I forgot them as soon as I saw them.Then I saw it was playing on television and I literally watched to see some nudity because I knew that much about the movie.So committed to watching for 10 minutes. Then I watched another 10. And another.I couldn't have torn myself away even if so often I wanted to look away.I thought it would be another trashy mess, I really did. But what I got was a slow burning narrative of youths ""so far from home"" whose slight sense of dread grows and grows until it ignites in a terrifying bacchanal of evil.All they wanted was to have some fun but eventually it becomes apparent that playtime is over, at least for them. The film has a hypnotic pacing an visual style. Not giving up the good for quite a while.With so many people smugly parading generic schlock as ""superior horror"" just because it didn't have a drop of blood, I like to remember this movie and think, it's not about the viscera: they intrigued me, they told me a story, they created characters I cared about by giving them depth and insecurities. There's a key scene where the protagonist talks about an experience in his childhood some viewers felt was just shoehorned in. But to me it made him more like a person. He felt like someone I could have known and it justified his motivations later.The final act of this had me on the edge of my seat. It doesn't let off for a moment. Usually a good movie is unpredictable. This movie managed to let me guess what was coming and still be terrified: (""no, no, no don't do it! Please!"" I said).On one level a story of our capacity for empathy but that's shortchanging it. This is a nihilistic depiction of one person's vicious experience.There's even one laugh out loud moment. It totally works in context, you'll know it when you see it.I know a lot of people want you think this is just schlock and splatter. But this is something special.

A throw back to 70's style horror films,"I was born in the 70's. I began watching horror films at about the age of 8. Of course horror films are scary when you are that young, no matter what they are. But then I grew up and began watching those same films over again, and to an extent, they were still scary. Those were the films from the 70's and early 80's. Leatherface will always incite that incessant trepidation in me. How can he not? Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the all time greats and I don't really think another film can duplicate the raw intensity of that film. There were others of course, and anyone who knows me even slightly knows that Last House on the Left is what I consider to be the most disturbing film ever made. Horror films, the good ones that is, can affect you in ways that other films can't. They get inside you. Hostel does that. It is a nightmarish film that takes a grim look at the underbelly of society. There is no other way to put it. This film is scary because of what happens in it but it is even scarier because what happens could be true.Like any typical horror film, everything is great in the beginning. Josh and Paxton and their Icelandic nomad are in Europe seeking out all the best parties and the best women. They are in heaven at first as the women and drugs and parties are as abundant as they first heard. And then they meet another man their age who tells about a city in Slovakia where the women are better than you could imagine. Our three adventure seekers are off the Slovakia and upon entering the hostel, they meet two half naked women in their shared quarters. Clubs, drinking, drugs and sex ensues. This is paradise. What could be better? Up until now the pacing of the film is fast and furious. There is enough character development and eye candy to please those waiting for the horror. And the horror is never far off. The interesting thing about a film like this is that even though the naked women and the bongs and the festive atmosphere is abundant to the viewer, there is always that pernicious overtone, that feeling that something isn't quite right. You can attribute that to knowing what's coming up or to the fact that the marketing for this film, including the trailer is very effective. For me, I knew this happy atmosphere that the boys were a part of was going to end, and that scared me. One friend goes missing and then the plot gets twisted. He doesn't leave them a message as to where he's going, who he's with or an explanation as to why he left. The two boys are leery of this but decide to stay in the hostel one more night to have a bit more fun. Big mistake.By now the film had me intrigued. And when the torture scenes finally happen, although the gore wasn't as graphic as I expected, the situations that are presented and how everything transpires is enough to scare the hell out of you. What is bothersome is that these situations, while ostensibly fictional, are in fact completely realistic and utterly possible. Just like Last House on the Left had three would be regular people doing heinous things to two innocent teenage girls, this film is almost more macabre in the sense that it explores an element to the human psyche that enjoys the kill. It seeks the thrill of inflicting pain. The scariest thing about this is the notion there are people that are so sick, so depraved and so inhumane that they actually have to pay to inflict bodily harm to others. Far fetched? Hardly. Look at the news from any given city in the world and you'll see the heinous and disgusting things that people do to one another. This film is disturbing because it is a reflection of society, no an aberration. I'm not saying that the majority of people want to be able to pay to murder someone, but what I am saying is the realm of possibility is there. That in itself is about as scary as you can get.Eli Roth is imaginative. He is a visionary and he is adept at exploring the darker side of humanity. Cabin Fever was a great horror film, a little off the wall, but quite disturbing. Hostel is a work of art, it is as close to the 70's style of guts on the wall horror as you can get in today's horror climate. I was terrified watching the film and at the end by the end of the film, when you are screaming for revenge, Roth even gives you what you want. Hostel is a brilliant film. As much as I love movies like Scream and Sixth Sense, the true gusto of horror has also been omnipotent in recent months with films like Saw 2, Wolf Creek and High Tension. Hostel is better than the rest. It builds the tension and then boils to the point where the horror is almost too real. This is a very effective horror film and I look forward to the sequel.10/10 A truly terrifying masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very upsetting,"Let me start by saying that I love Quentin Tarantino. I feel that everything he has made or put his name to has been outstanding. However Eli Roth has never impressed me at all. 'Cabin Fever' had to have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen; with that said, 'Hostel' does not do much of a better job.This movie was not only boring but it took crude sex scenes to a new level. I can understand your standard ""B"" horror having an obligatory T&A shot along with the local tramp being had in a random place, but this was ridiculous. There was sex and no violence for a very large percentage of the movie. Nothing exciting happened at all until the last 20 minutes and even that was done in a way that was annoying. I have seen it before and am not really interested in seeing again. Come up with something new if your going to promote a movie this well.My short and sweet recommendation is to wait till this comes out on cable so you can do something else until the excitement happens. I have never left a movie theatre before a movie ended but I was VERY temped this time.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Ugly Americans,"With Eli Roth, Quentin Tarantino and Takashi Miike all taking part in this film, I was pretty sure going in to it that it would be worth the price of admission. Not only was it worth the price of admission, but it will be worth the price of the unrated DVD with commentary when that comes out in several months.The movie is technically appealing to watch for any students of film. QT, thankfully, is a student of film and he no doubt had a big hand in helping Roth shoot and edit his film and the editing choices, sound effects and homages from Suicide Club to A Clockwork Orange films made the film that much more enjoyable.The movie is simplistically suspenseful, using the old adage of ""nothing you can show on screen with compete with what is in the audience's imagination"" that has been used in horror films for several decades. While there is gore, some of the most graphic I've seen in a US film to date (J-Horror still tops it), the most graphic scenes are the ones left up to your imagination... the film cuts away at the perfect moment several times in the film, especially early on, letting the audience's suspense grow.Then what's even more suspenseful is how long it takes for some of the torture scenes to be completed... you keep waiting for it to be over and it doesn't stop... culminating in what will forever be known as ""the eyeball scene"" which puts tremendous strain on your nerves and when over, is libel to make anyone with buttered popcorn bolt for the bathrooms to vomit.But all the editing choices, cinematography and horror homages aside, Hostel is most importantly a movie with a message. Yes, the movie does have a message and this is why the film is and should be loved by critics. The film explains, in the best way possible, through example and a ""walk a mile in their shoes"" mentality to show the ironic reciprocity of how Americans can objectify stereotypical Europeans, especially women, and how those same stereotypes can fall on Americans and come back to bite them in the ass.As odd as it sounds, this film will have an effect on audiences that is very similar to the one that Crash did. This film will make you question not only your sense of sanity or your preconceptions of what is ""too much"" but it shines a light on the dark underbelly not only of Eastern Europe, but shows that the ""Ugly American"" label is appropriate now more than ever.If you are planning on seeing this movie and read this review, do me a favor and when you leave this film, stop and, with what you just watched fresh in your memory, think about this: If you think the bad guys and girls in the film are bad, what does that say about someone who paid to watch a movie about torture for 95 minutes? Hm? Great Movie. Great Film. Great Message.Kudos to you Eli Roth... kudos.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
So what's so horrific about it?,"A day after watching Hostel I still cannot help but ask myself, where was the horror? Because besides a small five minute scene, which was not all too terrifying, I cannot for the life of me, understand why anyone would define this as a horror movie. It's not, it's just silly throw-away trash.The plot, as most of us who have read anything about it know, is that three guys, two Americans and an Icelandic guy they meet up with, are in Europe looking to sleep with lots of women. Does not seem to matter, as long as they have a pair of breasts and a nice ass, they are there. So upon finding out that there are all sorts of women doing anything in Bratislava, the three of them go, only to find the women of their dreams, and the stuff from their nightmares.To define the movie into certain parts, it goes from thirty minutes of sex, breasts, alcohol and drugs, to ten minutes of a thriller, to the rest of the movie trying to be horrific (along with film noir and comedy elements thrown in for good measure), but failing mindlessly. People are brought in, and leave way too soon, either by dying or just by not coming back. None of the relationships or motivations are explained at all. The actors look like walking, swearing zombies. No character, even the sympathetic Jay Hernedez, is the least bit likable. Everyone is a jerk. And to top it all off, there is virtually no good dialogue in the film at all. And for some ungodly reason, there are way too many homosexual overtones at every turn this movie attempts to take, that you begin to feel that the characters should be wearing cowboy hats and making Brokeback Mountain with torture and murderous mayhem instead.When the whole idea of what is going on, and why all of these people are being tortured and killed actually begins to make some sort of sense, you are just left stunned trying to understand how ludicrous the idea is. And after you realize who the lead bad guy is, you still do not get a real sense as to why any of this is actually happening. It only becomes even more ridiculous than it was before hand. It all just seems like heinous and horribly random acts of violence put forth in order to try and achieve some sort of scareful momentum. But the movie fails to deliver it.But Eli Roth's problem is like every other modern horror director. He shows lots of blood, but does not push the envelope. There is nothing new here, and any methods that may seem ""new"" are either not brought to their full potential, or just do not seem to make sense at all. There is quite a bit of blood spilled throughout the film, but its nowhere near as sick or vomit-inducing as this movie was hyped up to be. Instead, it comes off as a hyper-violent disappointment that some campy fans may be into, but traditional horror fans will see right through. He may claim to be trying, but this is really far from. Even Saw, which the movie is border line ripping off, seemed a lot more frightening than this film. And it had three times less blood, and just as bad acting.I have yet to see all of Cabin Fever, but even with the small parts of that movie and the entirety of this movie, I really get a feel that Roth thinks he is being clever, and does not realize that the audience is not as gullible as he thinks. If he's going to make a horror movie, he should make it. If he wants to make a comedy, he should make it. If he wants to make a porno, than he should make it. A film noir? A revenge tale? Merging all of these into one incohesive narrative is definitely not the way to go. It may work for Tarantino, but is does not work for Roth.Take a lesson Eli.Write good dialogue, make characters likable, and add some horror.And for god sake, let the movie make sense.You do not horrify the audience with your images, you horrify them with your horrendous way of putting the movie together and claiming it to be a horror film.3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Afterwards, you'll need to wash","It's really hard to review this film without using bad words, which I know IMDb wouldn't allow. So I'll try to keep things civil. This is a sick, sick film. And NOT in the good way. Not in the ""Tarantino is so cool because of the way he looks at violence"" kind of way. Just in the perverted, amoral, sick-MINDED, ""somebody seriously needs to get some therapy"" kind of way. Yeah, THAT kind of sick. The kind of sick film that you can't have any fun watching because you can tell the person who made it is truly as depraved as he seems. The kind of ""horror"" film that offers no horror other than what is BEHIND the scenes: the horror of Eli Roth's mind, the filth and sleaze that lies within it. The kind of film where physical violence is conceptualized as a kind of pornography and where you're supposed to get your ""I Heart Torture"" jollies watching it. Think snuff films. Think those ""Real Death"" videos that you see in the bin at the Slurp-n-Snort on the interstate. That's the level that Roth/Tarantino were stopping to here, and, though someone will certainly argue that Roth is so ""cool"" because he draws your attention to social phenomena blah blah blah mental masturbation and it's a reflection of intellectual spew which shows us how we artist wannabe claptrap.... No, it's petty, it's disgusting, it's vile, it's corrupt, it's debauched -- and Eli Roth wants you to think it's art.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Complete waste of time,"I hate to say it, but Hostel fits in line of many of its fellow Lion's Gate Films...It was extremely over-hyped and fell VERY short of all expectations.For the first half of the movie, there were countless unnecessary scenes with topless women (one really fat one, too). There were so many naked women, it actually took away from the movie. I expected to see a scary movie with some plot development, but I was very wrong. Apparently they lost the original footage for the first half of the movie and decided to use an old ""Girls Gone Wild"" video and hoped nobody noticed. With an absolutely horrible transition, the movie switches to complete gore. The gore wasn't shockingly horrible, either (contrary to advertisements). There was just lots of it. I honestly believe that Eli Roth decided to try to fit as many naked women and gory scenes in one film and this was the product. The writing was sub par, the acting wasn't much better, and the movie theater didn't allow refunds.If you have any taste in movies, steer very clear of Hostel.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hostile,"In sexy Amsterdam, hunky backpacker Jay Hernandez (as Paxton) and his blond companion Derek Richardson (as Josh) have hooked up with slightly older Icelandic drifter Eythor Gudjonsson (as Oli Erickson). After a night out on the town, they are locked out of their hotel. This works out well because the trio learns about another hotel, in Slovakia, where sex is more readily available. They are told the area is filled with incredibly attractive women who love having sex with American men. Arriving quickly, the men find beautifully proportioned women - who director Eli Roth generously shows unclothed. Along the way, bisexual businessman Jan Vlasak makes a pass at Mr. Richardson, who appears to be bisexual-leaning-gay. Everyone thinks this is disgusting. That's nothing compared to the torture chambers we're introduced to later. Oddly, this film is ugly and uninteresting until the blood starts to fly, after which it becomes ugly and interesting.***** Hostel (9/7/05) Eli Roth ~ Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson, Eythor Gudjonsson, Jan Vlasak",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A lack of sympathy is odd, but inevitable in this case.","I literally just saw this film and I'm puzzled as to how I feel about it.Usually the whole point of watching people being tortured is that the horror stems from not only the visceral horror, but the sympathy for the victim. Without this necessary factor, the thrill of the scene is all but lost.However, in the beginning of the film, when Paxton, a rude American with his rude American friend and a stereotypically horny European male, shouts, ""Man I hope bestiality is legal in this country, cause that girl is a f@$%kin pig!"" (at a prostitute who is nowhere near fat), I found myself muttering, ""God, just kill him now."" We have already lost sympathy for the characters. All we have left is the violence.The rest of the film is overextended sex scenes that cut into valuable film time that could be used to explain why we should care about these men. Perhaps that's Roth and Tarantino's intention--to view the victims as the murderers would: as arrogant, rude, oversexed and boorish Americans that are only good for tourism and death, if anything.Blah blah blah, death death death, shame shame shame. I expected better from Tarantino, master of Kill Bill and helping hand in the amazing Sin City.Even the prize cow needs to deliver sour milk once in a while.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
I went into Hostel looking for a ride... I left a happy little boy.,"Alright, so I went into Hostel with high expectations. The clips that have surfaced took my ""want and need"" factor up about 10 notches, and I was fully prepared for opening night. The movie started and didn't go directly into anything. The story was there, the fleshed out characters were, and the eventual gore. I won't go into it, spoiling anything, but I loved it. The shots were great, good music, good camera movements, and great acting. You really feel bad for all of them. I recommend it, but not for the weak. Four people left separately during the movie, and a lot of EWWW'n came from the audience. Excellent job, Eli. You did it again. People just don't see your films for what they are.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Killer movie,"I had been dying to see this movie and was excited to be able to see a screening of it in DC last night.Thanks Eli for going all out and producing a really great dark movie. The plot works well and all of the characters are very true to life. I especially appreciate all the local casting in the film.Of course, I ""used"" to stay in hostels and meet people in clubs.. and had planned on spending a month in Europe next summer - there is no chance of that happening now. People let me assure you that this was an actual scary horror movie.I highly recommend this to all the sick depraved people of the world!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
