Like a great relationship gone bad,"This reminds me of the start of a great relationship, starts out wonderful, continues to grow, and then out of nowhere, BAM, it ends and you are left wondering what just happened.As so many other reviewers have stated, it starts out with great suspense, originality, and creativity, and somewhere in the last 20 minutes, you are left wondering, did it really just end that way? Ouch! I found myself incredibly disappointed.We all love Jaime Foxx's funny side, but really wanted to see something else happen to him in this film. I get the idea of the end, that he learned his lesson so to speak, but it was still really weak for what it could have been.However, I'll still give it an 8 as it kept me quite intrigued throughout...so hard to find these days in a quality film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Failed ""protagonist""","At no point do I ever side with the so called ""protagonist"" played by Jamie Fox.

"One Protagonist, One Antagonist...","I am just not sure which is which.I am trying to avoid spoilers here, because it is a definite film you must check out because it is a great new take on the prison based thriller genre, which provides 90 odd minutes of great entertainment with lots of twists and turns to keep the story fresh.My main criticism is that the story seems to twist and turn so much it gets itself into a nasty tangle. The base of any thriller for an audience, is to want the protagonist to prosper at the downfall of the antagonist, but at the end, i was unsure which of one of the two mains, Nick Rice (foxx) or Clyde Shelton (butler) i should be 'cheering' for.Each Character has their fair amount of being the good guy, but both were more of the bad guy, a very confusing aspect to a thriller.Never-the-less, there are some brilliant performances and a very entertaining fresh story kept me glued to the screen for the entirety of the movie.****/5",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A morality tale with plenty of action,"This is a movie that's extremely fun to watch in the theaters because you get to hear and see everyone's reaction to each of his killings. The best one had people actually saying loudly ""wow"" and ""oh my god!"".What drew me to the movie was the fact that the hero wasn't going around killing people with his bare hands or face to face. He was doing it with his mind, with careful planning, and deft precision. That was something refreshing to see. I can totally relate to his feelings of anger over the flaws in the justice system and his desire to take matters into his own hands - to make things right.The ending was disappointing but the rest of the film was not and I liked it overall.",,Anonymous,Crime
Seething expose of America's justice system,"LAW ABIDING CITIZEN has all the trademarks of a great film. A non-linear plot, plenty to say about the state of the world today, some tough performances and explosive sequences. Best of all, it blurs the line between good and evil so that you're never quite sure who you're supposed to root for, which guy's the villain and which guy's the hero.Gerard Butler stars as the ordinary man whose family is killed in a burglary gone wrong. Butler then undergoes a startling transformation as he sets up a campaign of revenge against all those who failed to bring the killers to justice. The film goes from there, starting off dark and becoming increasingly more bleak as the running time goes on.It has plenty of incident to keep it running along, and some great scenes: Butler's manipulation of the prison regulations, for instance, or the way he manages to wage his vendetta from the INTERIOR of his prison cell. But, along the way, the film's sense of realism diminishes until we end up with a completely ludicrous event at the end which is designed to bring closure. It's not on par with, say, EAGLE EYE for suspension of disbelief, but it's getting there. It's just a shame, as with some tighter writing this could have been a truly great movie. It turns out to be an intriguing oddity, instead.Butler is good as the 'bad guy', effectively channelling some of that Leonidas rage. But, as usual, Jamie Foxx is completely out of his depth as the lawyer. He's a vacuum of talent, an empty space in the middle of the movie surrounded by other, better, more seasoned performers. It's a shame, as the combination of rubbish actor and rubbish ending scupper this movie's best intentions.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Citizen Abides,A solid movie. It was not predictable. The actors were great in their roles except for a sub-par Leslie Bibb (TV actress with waning looks). After the first five minutes I thought I made my assumptions of what was going to happen but I was totally wrong.Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx work perfect against each other. There are a few lulls in the movie towards the end but overall it was a real good movie.Perhaps the message of this movie can somehow persuade real change in our legal practices. It is worth seeing. The way the film is shot and the sound effects make this an intense movie.,8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good but not great due to Foxx and bad ending,"Clyde Shelton's ( Gerard Butler ) wife gets murdered in the beginning of the movie and justice doesn't prevail because one of the killers is only sentenced for 10 years. Clyde is angry as hell and will make sure the people responsible for the horrible trial of the killers will all suffer and die. So basically you got yourself a revenge movie here. Clyde is killing them and isn't even hiding it, he admits it. Nick Rice ( Jamie Foxx ) is the DA on the case and needs to find out what the hell is going on. Now the fun part is that Clyde is performing the kills from within his prison cell, he even has to sit out in solitary and is still killing people, now how cool is that.I totally dig the idea of a highly intelligent man orchestrating kills on specific times and places from his prison cell, all planned ahead of time. If you're a smart ass while watching this movie you'll find out there are a lot of plot holes so I recommend you not to think it all through. Heads up for Gerard Butler, this guy is making some mayor progress on this one after some sh!tty movies last year. I think we'll be seeing more of King Leonidas in the future so hurray to that. On the opposite, Jamie Foxx is on a decline. Ray was an excellent movie but after that it's just bad. As Nick Rice the DA he is just one stone face mofo, no emotion no nothing. Jamie and the ending of the movie are the only 2 things that suck. The movie is just handing out it's surprises like candy, like spoiling your daughter's birthday present a week before her actual birthday. Watch it with a time progress bar and stop the movie before the last 15 minutes, then close your eyes and make up your own ending and I promise you it will be way better then the awful piece of movie you just skipped...",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Law Abiding Citizen will not disappoint.,"This movie really takes the cake. It's focused on a father (Clyde) who gets beaten and his wife and daughter are killed by 2 crooks. However the crooks' punishment was dimmed down because of a deal made by the lawyers(Jamie Fox). 10 years later, Clyde decides to take out the entire corrupt justice system.This movie really keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the main character Clyde really makes this movie something memorable and just extraordinary. You can compare Clyde to the Joker pretty much, but in my opinion 10 times better. Clyde devises sneaky and cunning ways by taking down his victims and the whole sense on whether he is the hero or villain also adds to the excitement. Jamie Fox also does a great job playing his character, a heroic yet corrupt lawyer.There are a few scenes that will guaranteed make you laugh and a few scenes that will pretty much tell you that Clyde is just one kickbutt character, no questions about it. Every scene you will be wondering what will happen next, because you honestly won't know. The movie has a few twists and turns and will always keep you guessing. If you want to see something that is highly suspenseful, will keep you on the edge of your seat, and includes 2 very unique and questionable characters, then you must see this movie. Law Abiding Citizen will not disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
An ending that works (for me),"Almost everyone agrees. Law Abiding Citizen is a great movie but the ending sucks.The problem is, with about 30 minutes to go, the movie wants us to stop cheering on Clyde (Gerry Butler) and suddenly start thinking of Nick (Jamie Foxx) as the hero. That's not going to work, the audience has just invested about 90 minutes of wanting Clyde to continue with his vengeance. Damn right too.The plot should have continued to its logical conclusion. Clyde was trying to teach Nick a lesson, that the system was so broken that it could only be fixed by being destroyed first. Rather than the squeaky-Hollywood-ending-slop they served up, here's what should have happened...In the solitary confinement cell at the end, Jamie Foxx's character Nick should have taken the cell-phone from Clyde then remote-detonated the bomb at city hall, blowing up the mayor, the brass, the whole rotten system, then gone off to watch his daughter's cello recital.Now, that ending would have been really insane, but it would have taken the movie to its logical conclusion. Nick's conversion would have been complete. As an ending, it would be right up there with Jimmy Cagney at the end of White Heat, 'Made it Ma, top of the world!' Morally dubious, yes, but it would have given us a bona-fide classic. It would be rating 9.8 here on IMDb rather than this insipid seven-point-bleh.Oh, and the movie loses a point for Gerard Butler not using his own voice. Gerry is a Scot and has a fine Glasgow accent, he should use it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Law Abiding Citizen is a thrill ride,"This film is gory, but the gore is mostly suggested rather than shown. You can make up your own mind as to how gory you want it to be. Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) and Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) are excellent as ""frenemies."" They still sympathize with each other, in a way, as each teaches the other a lesson. Butler is excellent as the crushed father and husband who believes he must use his unique skills and talent to make an example of a justice system that has forgotten the victims. You sympathize with him even as he enacts his vicious lesson plan upon Foxx's coworkers. Foxx is an arrogant self-serving assistant district attorney who is only concerned with his conviction rate as he claws his way up the ladder in the justice system. He has forgotten the victims. But when he has a family of his own, he begins to see Clyde's point, yet he cannot give in to all of Clyde's demands to stop the carnage. Beautifully films in a noir tone with excellent timing on the stunts and effects. Law Abiding Citizen is an adrenaline-pumping experience. Bring your heart meds.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Way Too Many Contrivances,"Let's face it. Because a person is capable of pulling off the kinds of things done here, doesn't make the likelihood any greater. There is so much precision and luck involved in making things work that it would take a god pulling strings to allow these things to fall so easily into place. Even a silent partner is not going to do the job. I enjoyed the setup but the lengths gone through for revenge really pull it apart for me. The guy has so much power that he is completely in control. There would be a point in law enforcement where they would finally say, ""Screw you!"" The technology would have taken a fortune beyond imagination to work out. While I like the actors in this film, I can't recommend it's far fetched totality. Done in a more controlled and believable way, you have a stunner. It's just too much.

An underrated gem.,"A man is put through a horrific ordeal, frustrated by the lack of justice in the system, he decides to take matters into his own hands.How often do you watch a thriller, and the parameters are very clear, you have the good guys and the villain, Law Abiding Citizen tears up the rule book, and makes you fully aware that all isn't that clear.This film is hugely underrated, I've read some of the comments, and can't argue with those that say it's gory, that opening is brutal, those that say it's a bit hard to believe, definitely is, but enjoy it for what it is, a film that really does have you rooting for the other side.Who is the real villain here, I'd argue it's the system itself. You're made to see that justice in the eyes of the law is some sort of bargaining chip, no longer about a clear cut case of innocence and guilt.Jamie Foxx is excellent here throughout, Gerard Butler is on another level, it's films like this that show what a brilliant actor he is.Such an underrated film, 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Entertaining if occasionally implausible thriller,"""Law Abiding Citizen"" starts out like a modern-day version of ""Death Wish,"" spends a few moments aping the ""Saw"" franchise, then settles in as a cat-and-mouse crime drama centered around the theme that the American legal system seems designed as much to thwart justice as to enact it.The movie stands firmly in the long tradition of wish-fulfillment fantasies in which the victim of a broken legal system - functioning as a stand-in for an equally frustrated and helpless audience - finally says enough is enough and takes matters into his own hands, even going outside the limits of the law, if that's what it takes, to achieve justice.As with the Charles Bronson character in ""Death Wish,"" Gerard Butler's Clyde Shelton witnesses his wife and daughter being brutally raped and murdered by a couple of armed intruders. When the worst of the perpetrators cops a plea and is back out on the streets after a mere three years behind bars, Clyde is forced to take matters into his own hands. But he isn't content merely to bring down the killers themselves but to systematically go after everyone in the legal system – from strict-constructionist judges to hamstrung attorneys - who helped facilitate the injustice. That's where Nick Rice, well played by Jamie Foxx, comes in, the decent but by-the-book prosecutor who helped set up the deal and has now, along with everyone else involved with the case, become a prime target for Clyde's take-no-prisoners reign of terror and retribution.The one thing that distinguishes ""Law Abiding Citizen"" from similar films in the genre is that it's not afraid to have a deeply troubled, possibly even psychotic, character at its core. For Clyde does not fit the mold of the typically lovable antihero. The audience is, in the early stages at least, asked to root him on as a conventional Angel of Retribution dispensing the justice that the court system saw fit to deny him, but so much of what he winds up doing steps so far over the line that we eventually balk at his tactics. It's this moral ambiguity that helps to mitigate some of the implausibility of Kurt Wimmer's screenplay, which often goes for effect at the expense of credibility. Indeed the movie's insistence at making him a sort of omnipotent, omnipresent existential force of nature to be reckoned with takes the movie out of the realm of reality and cheapens some of what it is trying to do. And, in the process of reaching its climax, the movie takes a plot turn so ludicrous and credibility-defying that the whole thing pretty much crashes and burns at the end.That being said, Nick's interactions with Clyde are fun to watch and, thanks to taut direction by F. Gary Gray, there are some moments of genuine suspense scattered along the way. So if you can put your skepticism and critical-thinking skills on hold for the duration, you can have a pretty decent time with ""Law Abiding Citizen.""",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
GOOD ASF,"Gerard Butler played the living hell out of this role, Jamie Foxx played the hell out of his role as well because that was a well written character but he deserved everything that happened to him in this movie. Jamie & Gerard had intense chemistry, and the dialogue between them was witty and sharp. I love that their talents were not wasted on a weak script and I especially loved that you can tell they added their own swag to bring these characters to life and make them believable for audiences.This is such an iconic film to me because the message is very clear. It's a story of revenge, injustice, justice, betrayal, action, and consequences. This is the first film I've ever watched where I wanted the antagonist to come out on top of it all at the end. Granted even with that being said the ending of the movie did not disappoint at all, it makes sense and it leaves no room for questioning.Overall this is a GOOOD MOVIE! I recommend it to those who love a good revenge vs.justice story with lot's of action, violence, suspense, and great acting.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Well that's true, but when Clayton kills derby and leaves the scene he throws the car keys to the tied police man at the back of the car with bare hands and even touches the car ,the car as shown in the film was left in the same scene of murder.Claytons finger prints on the car would be a clear evidence ,tire marks of Clayton's car on the scene of murder would be another evidence, !! *When the judge is being shot dead , why did chief and Nic (Fox) wasn't thinking or chasing that there might be someone (expecting to be Clayton) on the opposite building who just shot the judge and is trying to escape??? *Ofcourse the climax when Clayton was caught red handed by Fox in the cell ,Clayton behaves stupid to activate the bomb that proves that this character is so dumb..! which is contradictory to his brilliance.! it destroys the confidence we have on the character.! bcoz when Clayton finds Fox in the cell it is clear that he definitely knows the whole plans of Clayton,and there are chances that bomb might be deactivated but he still activates the bomb.!

Cheering for the villain,I would have scored ten but the ending could have been better. I love the idea of the bad guy who started off as the good guy managed so many successful attacks. There are some very graphic scenes so a strong stomachs are recommended. Everything is explained and it all makes sense. A really enjoyable film. Some great explosions also some great set pieces. It's so odd watching a film when you don't care for the good guys but you cheer for the bad guy. Some of the scenes are quite shocking and unexpected.

Foxx and Butler Are Great,"It begins with a Death Wish type of premise with the murder of a man's wife and young daughter.

"It's the Script That's Insane, Not the Characters","Law Abiding Citizen is about as close as a movie can come to being good while still having a ridiculously poor script. The acting from Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx is fine, though not exceptional. Butler basically does a good job with a very inconsistent character. The production values are good, and the movie has a few nice gory scenes, although most of the outdoor scenes were so green-tinted that I suspect the entire movie may have taken place in the Matrix and I must therefore entirely forgive the plot holes.The problem is, from start to finish, the movie is filled with silly plot inconsistencies, unresolved details, and twists that throw prior scenes into question. The characters also make decisions that seem incongruous with their professions, knowledge, and with reality.If you can enjoy a movie with a lot of bad writing, there's still a lot of movies I would recommend first, but Law Abiding Citizen is watchable at the very worst.",,Anonymous,Crime

Law abiding citizen will have you sitting on the edge of your seat, jumping out of your seat at parts. This movie shows some technologies and capabilities in our world today and I'm pretty glad they've done that here as you don't get to see too much of that in films these days, well not in the way this film does. Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx really do work brilliantly together. For me the last five minutes were predictable but not the rest of the film, it had me floating in suspense, and that's when you know your watching a great film. I was surprised that this film actually only won one award because I can think of more than five that it should have been nominated for, and won.

Mixed feelings,"There have been plenty of movies with a similar theme and everyone who only has seen Gerald Butler playing the nice (romantic lead) characters might be in for a very big surprise. But then again, he has shown that he can carry action movies (300, Gamer etc.), but this is the first time he goes that dark. Empire Magazine said, that because nobody seemed to want that role, Butler who also is a producer on the movie, decided to take the role and leave the character he wanted to play at first to Jamie Foxx!!!If you watch the movie you will understand why. You might also get the feeling that there have been many re-writes and that the ending feels a bit ... well rushed. While another director was attached to this, he parted ways over creative differences. And again I'm sure he wanted a different ending. And I also think that there could have been something else at the end.My other problem was, that someone did spoil me the ending of the movie. Not very nice, but what can you do? She didn't do it on purpose, but I'm sure I would have enjoyed the movie more, if I hadn't known what was coming (although ""enjoy"" might be the wrong word here).As stated above, this is not for the faint-hearted, because it is brutal and it is graphic in it's depiction (and that was the cut they showed in cinemas ... on DVD/Blu Ray it's even a bit ""stronger""). If you are up for the challenge, this will be a roller coaster ride ... though I can't promise that you will end up with mixed feelings after the credits start to roll ...",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
You can't fight fate. Right?,"Gerard Butler stars as Clyde Shelton, a man forced to not only watch his wife and daughter be raped and murdered in his own home, but to also have to sit there and watch the justice system fail him. So he wages a one man war against pretty much everyone involved.Hoo-Hah! The big hitting critics hated it, with comments ranging from it being sub-normal, preposterous, ugly and morally corrupt, to it being a comic book film of moral hectoring! Naturally, as the critics were at pains to point out that it would, it made a pot load at the box office and is generally well liked by a good portion of the action/revenge/thriller loving populace.There's always a big grey area with revenge/vigilante movies that really brings out the debate crowd, but what rarely gets said is that through the actions of these cinematic waste layers is the chance for many, many, folk to live vicariously. Yes! 99% of the common man and woman do indeed sit back and trust our respective legal systems to do what's right and just, but oh how we feel that given similar circumstances we would want to vent spleen with furious anger.Law Abiding Citizen is a riot, at its heart it does have something to say, even asking some pertinent questions. Do these social smarts come bursting through the bloody haze to make a point? No, they get submerged in a whirl of kinetic fury and socko violence, but they are there, caustically so. But hey!

Flawed action thriller,"This is the far-from-original story of a man who seeks revenge about the double murder of his wife and daughter. His is not just ""a guy"" though. It never is! He is ...the best of the best (not original too).The premise is still interesting though. There are mind games to play in this. It's a thriller. It's not a Steven Seagal movie.BUT (I'm writing a non-spoiler review) the ending is preposterous and ridiculous. It ruins any possibility to take this movie as serious as you might have thought initially.The cast is terrible. Jamie Foxx is a really really BAD choice for the lead role of a macho D.A. with high conviction rates. This actor is more for comedic roles like in horrible bosses. Here, his acting is bad and his presence on screen even worst.The direction and editing is OK but the music is not. It has a character but in my opinion a wrong one. Don't like the mood it creates in combination withe the unsaturated blue-ish cinematography.Is it fun to watch? Not really. Blame Foxx, and the more dark and grizzly tone than it should have.Overall: Watch it if you want but you will be unsatisfied.

Extreme and unique,"When I first saw the trailer, I couldn't wait to see this one. I was really intrigued. It did reminded me of the Death Sentence, but I can assure you... it's way different.Gerard Butler was the perfect choice for the part. Although I wasn't expecting too much after all the love comedies I saw him starring, I was hoping for the best, and I was surprised. He combined all the emotions... the anger, grief, insanity, rage, and putted them out there on the big screen so realistically, so skillfully... I was really blown away. No doubt, this kind of profiles suits him best.The basic plot was kind of already-seen-story, but the whole concept was very unique with some unexpected and original twists. It's brutal, sad, powerful and well paced action-packed thriller. It's also funny at the times and it's one of those movies that makes you cheer for the ""bad guy"" even though you can't be really sure who is the real ""bad guy"" here.It met my expectations as it's the best of the mentioned genre this year.

The ending was fine,"This movie both repulsed and intrigued me in the same way as 'Eden Lake'. The man seeking revenge was really interesting to watch but his choice of victims made him less sympathetic. It had a touch of the 'Silence of the Lambs' Hannibal Lecter' where a seemingly powerless person uses his overpowering intellect to manipulate events. This was the best part.Many commented on not liking the ending and their observations were valid, especially on how it was contrived. But it was fitting because the DA finally got one big win over the evil genius. It restored some balance to the movie.I didn't root for the protagonist because I didn't like his choice of victims (except for one) but a movie like this must have victims; so be it. I loved the revenge against Darby, the actual thug who assaulted his family, it was very macabre and fitting as Darby was the most loathsome character in this movie. The events were well within my 'suspension of disbelief zone' where I didn't mind the liberties they took to get things done even if it was unrealistic.Regarding his choice of victims, how about the clowns on the forensic team who botched the DNA evidence? I'm not going to blame the defense attorney because it is his job to be an advocate for his client.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brain Must be Turned Off for Enjoyment,"Law Abiding Citizen is a violent film that gets progressively worse until the credits start rolling. By half-way through the movie I was quite surprised by the polish and cinematic value I was getting from Law Abiding Citizen, but then it becomes absurd and just plain dumb. The acting is awkward. Two actors are thinking masterpiece while everyone else has cheesy B-horror on their mind. Butler, without much competition, gives his best performance, and Fox gives his usual great performance, while nearly everyone else gives the level of acting one might expect from a Saw flick. I despise the fact that there are numerous unanswered questions in Law Abiding Citizen. With all of the negatives said, I still enjoyed it. It is a fun mash-up of gory horror, action and a tiny bit of drama thrown in. Is this movie for you?

This COULD Have Been BIBLICAL!!!,"""Law Abiding Citizen"" opened here in the first week of this month. I was eagerly waiting for it because Gerard Butler, who plays Clyde Shelton is one of my fav actors. I like his acting very much. I loved Dracula, 300, Butterfly on a Wheel, P.S. I Love You, RocknRolla & the more recent, very sexist film The Ugly Truth. Gamer didn't release here, so I have to wait for it on cable.The point is Gerard Butler's portrayal of characters always moves you, whether to a positive or negative for his role is always the viewer's choice. He is one of those actors who manages to pull you into his world (like Johnny Depp, but he's even more amazing).In Law Abiding Citizen, he plays a father whose family is brutally murdered.. I rooted for his character from the opening scene. I won't go into the plot details too much. I didn't even have any issues with the director's twist of him as super-genius. In this 110 minutes roller coaster of a movie, the last 10 minutes is a slap in the face for us audiences. We had been anticipating so much more in the climax, than the lame excuse for a typical Hollywood ending. Aside from the last 10 minutes, this movie rocks & yeah I also didn't like the way they showed how he managed to kill all those people from his prison cell.Butler says to Jamie Foxx's character Nick Rice that ""This Will Be Biblical"". It COULD have been BIBLICAL if the writers didn't get cold-feet at the last moment & made a pathetic ending. My recommendation would be to get out of the theater before the last 10 minutes, so you could go home with a satisfied feeling instead of going home dejected & trying to find all the possible cuss words for the director & writers. 7 on 10 for the very trashy ending. You may have seen that I didn't talk about Foxx or any other characters, that's because you don't give a damn about any of the others. It's Clyde all the way & we love it.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Clear Lines of Demarcation!,"Law Abiding Citizen is one of those films of which the production team is likely to think that it is cleverer than it actually turns out to be. Nevertheless the thing that fascinates me about LAC and like films, is the vast chasm of difference existing between critical and general consumer reaction. Case in point is that at time of writing, it has a Metacritic average of 39%, a Rotten Tomatoes rating of an even worse 26%, whilst an IMDB rating of 7.4 from over a quarter of a million contributors. This is saying that by and large, the critics hated it , whilst the general punters really liked it. In any one's language that's quite a differential. I'm giving it a fence-sitting 6 for the following reasons.It's a well-made film from an experienced director with a cast list that exudes quality. The story undoubtedly raises some very valid questions about the strength of integrity surrounding the ongoing workings of not just the U.S. legal system, but those of Western countries in general. It's almost a daily occurrence reported in various media outlets, that alleged perpetrators of serious crimes are given seemingly sweetheart sentencing deals. Law Abiding Citizen takes a what if approach in playing out a scenario, where the wrong type of person, with the right type of skills and resources, has his revenge on the system that he perceives let down his loved ones.In an almost horrifyingly gripping prologue, Clyde Shelton loses his family in a home invasion. He later feels betrayed by prosecuting attorney Nick Rice's actions in handing the instigating crim a pretty generous deal to secure his accomplice's conviction of murder. This begins a compelling narrative, that does occasionally throw up some genuinely unexpected twists.To my way of thinking it is pretty entertaining while you watch things play out, but does require viewers to accept a number of genuinely contrived story points, that at best have slight degrees of realism and at worst are pretty much absurd. At a movie level this sees us having to accept the revelations that Clyde Shelton has a (ever-reliable in movies) Special Forces background, a lawyer's knowledge of criminal law, a genius ability to invent and adapt tools and resources he requires and the ability to build and resource hide-outs in the most unlikely of places.LAC thus becomes a variation of the vigilante movie in reverse. We wonder which of the ostensible ""good guys"" are going to be the next victims and how is it to be achieved.Gerard Butler both produces and plays Shelton, which was originally offered to Jamie Foxx, who requested instead to swap with Butler and play the increasingly frustrated DA. Both actors are very convincing, especially Butler who demonstrates he is adept at highlighting both his goodness and badness in the one character. The hook with this film is that no matter how horrid his actions are, a percentage of the audience will see Shelton as the aggrieved hero and Rice, the villain of the piece.For me, as entertaining as it is and to a degree thought-provoking, ultimately Law Abiding Citizen becomes just too unbelievable to take too seriously at all.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Keeps the term 'popcorn-movie' in business.,"Let's get one thing straight: despite being released in a late January slot surrounded by Oscar-hyped films, Citizen is no award winner. Thank goodness. As much as the Oscar season can contain some of the best movies of the year, they are invariably all dramas and tend to be emotionally heavy. Citizen is anything but emotionally heavy, subsequently proving to be the ideal way to just switch off and enjoy the escapism.It all starts with the ludicrous screenplay by Kurt Wimmer. The Equilibrium and Street Kings writer makes a smart move and ensures the dialogue isn't taken too seriously – ""It's gonna get biblical"" – and the 'awesomeness' factor is amped up to eleven. You may find it difficult to forgive the implausibility of the plot entirely, however the aforementioned qualities of the script, along with a few insanely, almost tongue-in-cheek lashings of violence, should help gloss over the nonsensical parts. Sure, it's a massive stretch to believe just about anything Butler and Foxx do on screen, but damn they look cool doing it.F. Gary Gray adds to his muddled output of thrillers; this film coming after the decent The Negotiator, the second-rate A Man Apart, the underrated The Italian Job remake and the disappointing sequel Be Cool. For all his unwise film-making decisions throughout Citizen though, Gray contributes something very important: flair. He shoots passionately and confidently, allowing the two megastar leads to shine as expected. Gray can also lay claim to an awe-inspiring, fiery slo-mo shot near the end, a particularly bravura moment for the director.Butler and Foxx add plenty of style to a flick that keeps the term 'popcorn-movie' in business.3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Law Abiding Citizen: Challenges the system and imaginations,"As justice too often goes, so go movies about justice. The law abiding citizen does not always win. But then, what does it take to win? Do we know when we have won? Some call it ""good enough"" while others who feel cheated define justice their own way. Law Abiding Citizen was just that. One man's definition does not agree with the system's definition and now one man steps up to challenge the system because he can and he is mad.Gerard Butler, in my opinion, pulls off the best performance of his career. A monstrous Dracula, a misunderstood phantom and one ticked off warrior among Persians could not stand up to the anger this 21st century man used to overpower a system gone wrong. He was able to display that anger in a way I do not believe many others could have equalled.People who will like this movie will be those who feels justice has too often gone awry and needs adjusting and also those who pull for the underdog.As good as the story was and as good as performances were for the most part, the movie disappoints in the end. An exciting concept of one man fighting the system so ruthlessly met an early, anti-climax. The ending was rushed either because the end result could not be either conceived or possibly achieved.The system wins but the citizen scores to satisfaction. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Criminally underrated.,"For years, my inner (and if I'm honest - outer) snob wrote off this film - and Gerard Butler in general - as a pile of conveyor belt, Uber-masculine nonsense.To be fair, broadly speaking - despite Butler's undeniable talent - I've been proven right. He seems to have defaulted into typecasting, and he appears to be booked up to that effect for the foreseeable.But this film is a truly honourably exception, in every possible respect.It's really well acted. It's relentlessly entertaining, even in its more low-key moments. And it's moral ambiguity makes for a surprisingly thought-provoking tale.It's obviously silly, but it's smart too. I loved it.

I was a bit angry, because all the good points the movie makes about the law system in the US, there was no final point which satisfied me.

A Solid Thrilller,"All the internet chattering aside, LAW ABIDING CITIZEN is just what it sets out to be - a thriller that keeps the viewer involved in the mind games of a passionate man right up to the end (uh, well almost - except for the needlessly sugary revolting Hallmarky last few frames meant to clean up the mess the movie suggests...) Kurt Wimmer wrote this 'taking justice into our own hands' story with a good deal of imagination and gadgetry and F. Gary Gary keeps the momentum of the story going along at a breakneck pace. Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) opens his home door to face two thugs who beat and kill his wife and daughter and injure him substantially. Shelton seeks a good lawyer and finds himself in the hands of smarty guy Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) who sets the film in motion by accepting a plea bargain on behalf of the killers - one will be sent to prison with the death penalty and the other just gets a little time. Shelton is distraught at this abuse of the justice game. Jump forward 10 years and the one killer has a botched heinous execution while the other, now free, is is laughtered hideously - both by Shelton. There is a plan in Shelton's head to destroy everyone who allowed justice to misfire and the rest of the film is how the genius mind of Shelton (jailed after his slaughter of the killer) manages to wipe out everyone involved in the court system that instigated the terror.Butler and Foxx make a good sparring pair and there are some excellent cameos by Colm Meany, Viola Davis, Bruce McGill et al. Yes, this is a violent film, and not for the squeamish, but it does make us look at the judicial system with different eyes. If only the director hadn't glopped on the sloppy goodie-two-shoes happy-wappy scene that ends the film and feels like a purging cathartic....Grady Harp",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Our justice system is very flawed and half the time prosecutors don't have faith in themselves or have more cases than they can handle and simply plea bargain with bad guys.

Culture shock series: Law Abiding citizen.,"Before I go into the review, allow me to give you some facts about this movie on the other side of the earth. Firstly, it was among the highest ranking movies on popular Sino movie site Xunlei, with an incredible 9.8/10. Secondly, most Sino viewers actually think Clyde Shelton stands for goodness in this movie. Some of them even thought that he's the noblest martyr of his kind. Thirdly, the favorite scene considered by them and me was this one. The female judge was having an emergency meeting with lawyers Nick Rice and Jonas. When she got a phone call on her cell phone, the lawyers were startled by the fact that she's violating the law about no cell phones in the courthouse. She commented casually that the point of being a judge is she can do pretty much whatever she wants. The moment she picked up the call and put the phone to her ear, the phone exploded, and the tiny bomb blew her head open, killing her. Instantly, I burst into applause because it's too satisfying to see an injustice justice being punished by someone in the prison.Does this kind of judge exist in practice? I am afraid most of you would say, ""Definitely"". OK, do good judges exist then? Honestly, I am not sure. I don't have any hard evidence about any judges' compass, be them pointing north-north, or north-northwest. But, after I saw Clyde Shelton's story, I guess bad judges do exist, so do madmen like Shelton. My question now becomes, do badness and madness have bounds on the screen, or do I enjoy this madness and on screen bad deeds each time they go a bit crazier? My answer is a reluctant yes, thus I admitted my sins watching movies. The point is I now know there's a need, a call deep from my soul that it's better to stop enjoying such a movie experience. The moment Clyde Shelton claimed he's a ""Law Abiding Citizen"", this term along with its original meaning in the USA constitution corrupted, since anyone who has seen this movie would unconsciously avoid using ""law abiding citizen"" by expressing his respected citizenship. Of course, there are exceptions, especially we Sino people who have come to believe there was no ultimate good in the first place, and everything including the law is all relative depending on which social class you're in. While the Americans may be able to tell there are good judges and there are still goodness in the juristic system, we Sino people can't. That's because we Sino people don't believe so even before we see the movie.Even the American audiences can have some thrills watching it, actually. I've read on IMDb that a lot of people do think US jurisdiction system is faintly ill, which provided the hard facts as the justification of Shelton's rage. If one's rage can be justified, rationalized, then the next thing in line you need to nod to will be madness. Shelton wanted to see good in law, but actually he stocked more in revenge. His life was tore apart, yet he didn't know anything to seek beyond the law. If such a dramatic, tragic development of character is an art house rule, then Law Abiding Citizen the movie should be called a testimony for Split personality. I don't have a story in my life which is sadder than Shelton's, but if there's a chance I could talk to him, I'd say law cannot enforce itself. And, it's not a great discovery made by me or Columbus. It's just written in an old, ignored book, the Bible.Actually, I don't plan to persuade any Shelton to abandon his revenge and self-induced justice, neither does the Bible. See, laws are for humans to know their sins, not for them to capture any goodness. In fact, there's nothing humans can wield to capture the goodness. The law, the education, the marriage can all be inspiring goodness if one's soul still have some brightness. On the contrast, the law, the education and the marriage can also be ongoing disasters if one has decided to eliminate that remaining brightness in his soul. OK, the fact about humans is that the brightness in souls are always dying, so the only way to be redeemed from that direction is to repent and turn to Jesus Christ, who in the Bible, provided he has come not to abolish the law, on the contrast, he has come to fulfill the law with his love and spirit.Movies like Law Abiding Citizen didn't happen in the real world, but oops, that's only a half-truth. Mayhem on the screen was pushed to their most degraded, horrifying way, which more or less leaves a mark on audiences' souls. In the first place, it didn't happen physically, but then those who think they have immunity as a reasonable adult would find they will need to see something crazier to be satisfied next time. The not-so-convincing ending ensured the movie to be politically right, but still, comparing to the point the movie made with its disturbing illustration, such a political rightness is only a lie. You would think the Bible asked too much from you by calling you to reflect and repent, but compared to Law Abiding Citizen which urged you to question laws, moralities and goodness to the end, the Bible's much more forgiving.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
An Amazing Movie Throughout,"The focus in ""Law Abiding Citizen"" is on one Clyde Shelton. In the beginning of the movie, he watches his wife and daughter die at the hands of a pair of textbook thugs. Gerard Butler flawlessly executes a role that will keep you guessing through over an hour and a half of well thought out killings, tauntings and flauntings. There is the occasional predictable death after an incredibly snide remark or one character's brash overconfidence; you'll see it coming a mile away. However, the story is fantastic and by the end of it you'll find yourself rooting for Clyde, who is supposed to be the bad guy. Jamie Foxx plays a District Attorney who is, of course, your standard movie attorney. The system is perfect, we do what we have to do, push your morals aside, so on and so forth.

A Challenging Film on many levels,"An excellent and complex film that manages to explore the idea that justice can be a double edged sword. A rarity in that sense also, since it presents but doesn't judge, allowing the audience to make their own conclusions rather than championing one side or the other. Clever. Subtle yet action orientated. It got to the point that I was not sure who I was really rooting for myself, after seeing the mincing that was going on behind closed doors regarding what to do and who to do it to and if they could get away with it all. Fascinating take on the modern justice system quite unlike the black and white renderings of same that appear on television on half a dozen syndicated crime shows.

The director who debuted with Friday went ahead and became a director of dramatic films, like The Negotiator and A Man Apart, films that have their moments if they are, obsessively-repeated TV airings notwithstanding, forgettable. But with a film like Law Abiding Citizen, he should have taken a better look at Kurt Wimmer's script and seen what he had to work with. It's really two movies, sort of shoe-horned in to one another. The first one, at least in the first half hour, would appear to be an injustice-revenge flick where a guy watches in horror as two thugs break into his house and rape/kill his wife and child. But at the trial one of the thugs rats on the other, one of the thugs gets death row and the other pretty much walks. Then, years later, when the one thug is about to be killed by the lethal injection, he strikes his first blow of revenge... and then another... and then...Then it becomes the second movie, which is basically a comic-book flick (think the Joker in the Dark Knight) set in a realistic urban-crime center. The problem mostly is in this second half, and in how the actors are made to play it. Gray doesn't know really how to make this into something as silly as it really is - how Gerard Butler's Clyde Shelton is the biggest criminal mastermind in the history of, well, this year's masterminds - so he plays it completely straight. As actors, good ones, like Jamie Foxx and Colm Meaney and Bruce McGill go through the motions of the script, it becomes oddly, not as interesting as its premise would make us believe.Part of this, I wager, is on Butler's end. Some may disagree, but his performance did nothing for me. The character requires someone with a lot more dramatic hump and subtlety, maybe even ambiguity, and Butler, after the opening set-up scenes, goes into a Hannibal Lecter imitation that is just unconvincing (some have suggested it's because he has to put on an American accent, but is that the reason for sure or is it just the material?) And, again, the script and direction clash with a heavy-handed, jarring mix. Some scenes are seriously compelling. Others just had me laughing at how Shelton was able to basically blow up ANYTHING within a hundred mile radius, including cell phones.Gray could have worked this into something much more entertaining if it left its BS moral complexity at the door. It can't be both styles - dark/deep and crazy - and it should have been either/or; it had the potential to be something that goes for broke, but the absurdity that mounts isn't the right kind with the tone of the film, not to mention the predictability that comes out of the script as it is (for example, any time a character says they wonder if they really did make the right call with the Shelton-family killer, the next scene, dead). It's a split in the film that is never reconciled, and while I could always see a better movie being made out of some scenes, it didn't come together on the whole.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""It's not what you know, it's what you can prove in court.""","I don't know how many times I've seen this film, but I love it every time. Great story, exciting thriller, great action, and a good twist.One of Gerard Butlers best films in my opinion he delivers a great performance as the cold, and calculating Clyde Shelton, with Jamie Fox as Nick Rice. They both play off each other very well as protagonist, and antagonist.While admittedly the film requires a certain matter of suspending ones belief, but really almost all films do. This film plays very well with possible and impossible.A very entertaining film from start to finish.

"Whereas David Fincher's Seven 1995 received accolades, this masterpiece went unnoticed.","This film counts as among the best movies I have ever seen. It is a solid revenge based thriller, with tense drama and terrific performances by Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx. Indeed these two actors will be remembered for this film when they are no longer in this world.The plot of the movie is about a man Clyde Shelton(Gerard Butler) whose wife and daughter are murdered right before his eyes as he remains incapacitated by his attackers. Afterwards he seeks help from the law - particularly his attorney Nick Rice(played by Jamie Foxx). To his great distraught he finds that one of his attackers Clarence Darby(Christian Stolte) has cooperated by giving a full confession of the crime and putting all the blame on his partner Rupert Ames(Josh Stewart) who was innocent. Rupert promptly gets the death penalty by lethal injection and whereas Clarence is given a reduced sentence of manslaughter in the third degree and sentenced to only five years of imprisonment.Outraged by all of this, Cylde seeks justice against the entire judicial system in his own brand of justice...Verdict: this movie is a stylish A-grade thriller in the same vein as Fincher's Seven(1995). Acting, directing, photography is top-notch. The excellent screenplay is by Kurt Wimmer who has written great screenplays for movies like One Man's Justice 1995, Sphere 1998, The Thomas Crown Affair 1999 and Equilibrium 2002. F. Gary Gray is a superb director who has directed another good thrillerT he Negotiator (1998). Brian Theodore Tyler who has done all the music of The Fast And The Furious Franchise, handles the background music and effects exceptionally well.

Wronged man does right,"Finally here's a film that really shows the justice system for what it really is, and the frustration of the victims who've lost their loved ones the account of scum. The story puts a new after twist for the catalyst, and for it's originality factor, makes it a film that's super intriguing and exciting, if a little daring. If only justice could be delivered the way, wronged victim (Gerard Butler) who witnessed his wife and kid being slaughtered (and the movie doesn't waste any time, showing this scene) the world would be a better and safer place, or on the flip side of that coin, could make it a world of turmoil and mayhem. This film shows us how justice should really work. Plea bargains suck and in this case they really suck, where the real murderous hand gets off, with an easy sentence, where justice is delivered supremely on this victim, thanks to the methodical and calculating mind ex CIA expert, Butler. The much weaker, younger, and vulnerable killer may turn you off executions, where his equipment is corrupted with. LAC is a purely a vengeance tale, straight down, where everyone associated with Butler's trial the trail, pays, unavoidably escaping Butler's searing vengeance. The way a female magistrate buys it, is a killer. I really hadn't heard of Gerald Butler, thinking that he was a newbie, until this film, realizing he's been around (300, Timeline) the latter a movie I wished I'd never seen. Some of the scenes of vengeance are bloody brutal like that of the main killer, whose remains are a butcher show, plus an inmate getting stabbed by Butler who becomes incarcerated, but still has his people do his work outside. I must say the last fifteen minutes were preposterous, but what's a movie without a bit of escapism, and this is indeed the perfect vehicle for that. Lovers of revenge, this is your type of flick, which will probably satisfy you, the way those Spit On My Grave movies do. I know that main perpetrator, would be a grave, I'd definitely spit on.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The director showcased a surprisingly poor ending yet delivered a solid storyline.,"Negative Aspects:1. Nick Rice's Character Development: Your primary concern lies with the character of Nick Rice, portrayed as overly confident and lacking any visible remorse or self-reflection regarding his decision that impacted Clyde Shelton's family. Unlike his assistant, who shows some doubts, Rice remains unapologetically self-serving throughout the movie, which you found unrealistic and unsettling.2. Lack of Strategic Depth: You expected more intricate strategies from Nick, especially given the high stakes. His last-minute 'unreal' discovery felt contrived to you, undermining the character's credibility and the film's tension.3. Emotional Engagement: You found Nick's lack of emotional depth and introspection particularly disappointing, suggesting that even a few moments of vulnerability or regret could have enriched his character arc.4. Ending: The conclusion of the movie, especially the dialogue and Nick's sudden 'superpower,' felt melodramatic and unsatisfying to you, likening it to a soap opera.Positive Aspects:1. Clever Strategies: You appreciated the intelligent strategies and the portrayal of the legal system's manipulation, which added complexity and intrigue to the storyline.2. Clyde Shelton's Preparation: The narrative surrounding Clyde's ten-year preparation was compelling, lending credibility and depth to his motivations and actions.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Just ""Law and Order""  Episode for Big Screen","Law Abiding Citizen is a story of a man whom his family were brutally murdered, then after being let down by the court, decides to give all the people involved a lesson. (he said it's not a vengeance, but I believe it is).And because he's so damn smart, he confesses his crimes, thrown to jail, even kept in the solitary cell and he can still killing people.So, it was ""Death Wish"" meet ""Silence of the Lambs"", a genius and very angry guy who has all the skill needed to wipe out the entire city if he has to and also do his homework so he can play well in the game of law, is aiming to balance score and even want to 'fix' the corrupt system.This premise is so promising but does not live the hype because the script is weak. After his 3rd victims, he (I may say the script writer) has become uncreative and predictable which make me feel like watching another episode of ""Law and Order"" TV series.After watching the movie, I keep thinking why they didn't make his family murder as a conspiracy. So after his revenge to all those thugs, he start killing people who give the order one by one, and the DA has to use all of his resources to unfold the conspiracy, discover his method before this 'hannibal' gets him too at last. This way, the story can be kept unpredictable and amusing than targeting government officials as sitting ducks and saying that it's not a vengeance.And if he's so damn genius, why he can't figure out a simple fact that killing all the gov't official will not bring the system down or even fix it?. They will simply be replaced by another official, and then what? kill em all again and again?So, this film execution itself is fine but lacks of a good & strong script, which make me give 6/10.

A review well thought out in the beginning but failing near the end,"When I was going in to this movie I was thinking that ""this movie is going to make me think,"" and lo and behold that's about the only thing I was able to think throughout the whole movie.In all honesty though, Law Abiding Citizen is a movie that in trailers presented itself very well, but ends the movie by jabbing a pencil into its open eye socket. We open with a scene that depicts the brutal crime against Clyde (Gerard Butler) and his family before jumping to the trial. Attorney Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) cuts a deal with one of the offenders against Clyde that lets him off the hook. Jump years into the future and Clyde has turned full circle and decides to take a full out revenge against the killers and the justice system.I'm sure most people are thinking, ""well bonkers (yes bonkers, I said it) this sounds like a culturally significant movie that challenges the morals of today's justice system with such a plot line as that,"" and that is precisely what the movie trailers wanted you to think. Law Abiding Citizen is one of those movies that has a first act interesting (and by interesting I mean intelligent) enough and raw enough to make you lean forward in your seat close enough so they can smack all the intelligence out of your brain with the rest of the movie. In short, Law Abiding Citizen is misleading, and at the very best, killed by limitations.The main reason for this is because it spends the first part of the movie making you feel sorry for Clyde. Its something we've seen happen before. It is the story of the man whose daughter gets raped (in this situation family killed) and he sees the rapists go free. He then jumps into action by doing what the law couldn't do, and that is serve justice on their asses. This movie takes it a step further, reminiscent of Death Note (simply in the taking the bad guy and making him easy to identify with at first before making him absolutely bat **** insane). It then proceeds to realize that it might be getting a little too intellectual for the normal blockbuster crowd and proceeds to add explosions and to completely drop all the points it was trying to make but inserting the picture of the story writers genitalia in your face.No, in all reality, what Law Abiding Citizen feels like to me is a movie that got cut short, either in money, time, or manpower. It feels like the writer got choke chained by the producers and didn't have the time to write the challenging cultural piece he was going for. Either that or someone told him Gerard Butler was going to be in it, and somewhere a black guy was falling down an oddly placed hole.While I can't say this movie is lacking at all in the acting department, I can't stress enough how misguided the previews and indeed the movie itself are. Bottom line, you aren't getting a well thought out movie here. I would honestly like to say don't waste your time, but like a few recent Dean Koontz books, there are just a couple parts of this movie that everyone could see. What is lucky about this movie is that it isn't the only challenging moral movie ever made. If you feel this movie is lacking just give it another five or ten years and someone may come along with a good enough schedule or budget or idea to actually get the point that got lost in the explosions in Law Abiding Citizen in some other high brow titled movie.Final Rating 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

However there is an old Chinese proverb, "" He who seeks revenge should remember to dig two graves.""If it were not for this moral conflict, Law Abiding Citizen could have easily become just another vendetta film.

Therefore, ten years later, Butler decides to invoke his own style of justice.What follows is one pretty clever and gruesome way of killing someone after the next.

Justice not served in the court of law due to technicalities and back room deals? That part does happen in real life. But what the ""law abiding citizen"" was capable of would make him a super villain with ultra intellect in a comic book. Also, the burden of preventing further actions by Clyde fell on the shoulders of Nick, who is only a lawyer. Realistically any clues uncovered should have been handed over to law enforcement. But this was done for the dramatic effect; the two nemesis facing each other.The ending was a bit anti-climatic.

Pure Dumb Fun!,"Law Abiding Citizen is a hardcore action/suspense film starring Gerald Butler and Jamie Foxx. The movie begins with Clyde (Butler) being portrayed as a family man. His wife and daughter are murdered less than two minutes later. Nick Rice is a district attorney who arranges a plea bargain for one guilty man to be executed and the other to spend a few years in prison. We cut to 10 years later, when Clyde is able to rig the execution, giving him a painful death. He also tortures and murders the man who set free and is arrested promptly afterwards. In prison, Clyde makes a series of demands that must be granted or else he will start killing people. How he somehow manages to kill people while he's locked up is a mystery, but that's what makes the film so damn entertaining.The intense plot description above would normally sound like spoilers, but all this happens in the first half hour and is all revealed in the trailer. You might also notice that Clyde's intentions are very similar to Dexter's. He is taking the law into his own hands when he's not pleased with the outcome of a trial. I normally wouldn't mind this, but there were a lot of noticeable aspects, such as when Clyde shows the pictures of his family to his victim. At least it had a unique twist on that when Clyde takes his time to torture his victims and leaves everything behind as evidence.Law Abiding Citizen is directed by F. Gary Grey. He did The Italian Job, which I thought to be a high quality remake. Although, he also did the mediocre Be Cool. He doesn't make the greatest films, but they're definitely not terrible. I didn't have a problem with his directing, I thought it was a very well made suspense film. As for the acting, Jamie Foxx has been better in the past. This isn't another Oscar worthy performance from him. Gerald Butler seems to be perfect for this role, though. These kinds of roles that he plays in movies like this, 300 and Gamer are so much better roles than the awful romantic comedies he's been doing recently. I don't understand how anyone thinks that these action movies are ruining his reputation as a romantic lead, when it's exactly the opposite.As a critic, I think that this is a fairly difficult film to review. On one hand, it's very dumb. On the other hand, it's highly entertaining, even exhilarating at times. It's difficult to know which one is more important here. The critics here clearly have sided on one angle giving it 22% Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. I'll have to disagree with the consensus there. When I pay for a ticket, I would want to have a good time. I will try anything to have a good time, but if I can't then I just don't like the film. In a movie like Law Abiding Citizen, you just have to turn your brain off and be genuinely entertained. Just train yourself to laugh at cheesy one-liners and plot holes. Some of the worst films of all time also may happen to be the most fun to watch with the redeeming quality of unintentional comedy. People praise these films for their many flaws and that's exactly what should become with Law Abiding Citizen, but to a smaller scale.To get an idea of the dumb scenes can be found anywhere in the film. For some reason, Gerald Butler gets naked before he gets arrested, which isn't mentioned at any point in the film. Also, when the film jumps forward 10 years later, the characters either look even younger or exactly the same. It's not believable that they would look like that after 10 years. I also hated the ending. It was just very satisfying and unsatisfying. The ending brought the movie down for me. There was even a scene where they said the title of the movie like they were winking at the audience. Although, I'll have to admit there were some pretty clever plot twists and kills. The movie even made me jump at certain points.To conclude this review, I'll definitely recommend Law Abiding Citizen for the entertainment value and the fine performance from Gerald Butler. I'm going to give Law Abiding Citizen an 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Fantastic, one of the best films I have seen - SPECTACULAR!!!","What a fantastic film.I was amazed at every step. The acting, the plot, the twists - everything = AMAZING!!! I popped onto IMDb after watching this film to see who the writer was as I was so impressed and noticed that this phenomenal film was rated 7.3 This is a disgrace! This film should have been a straight out 10.I have read some of the reviews with anger at the ridiculous claims.One of the most astonishing - Jamie Foxx is a bad actor.WHAT!? During the film, I was compelled to comment on how fantastic an actor Jamie Foxx is, astounded at the range the man has and the quality and credibility he brings to every role.I can't understand people giving this film 1 star, shocking.The ending was brilliant, a perfect finish to a film that had us swapping sides minutely.I loved this film, will watch it again and will recommend it to everyone I come into contact with.'If you can't say anything nice - don't say anything at all' This seems apt to those who gave unjustified reviews.To all others; this film is astonishing.

You want/expect to see the justice system brought down as from early on this movie gears the plot towards this, the ending just seems to make the whole story kind of pointless, just an excuse for mindless action and gadgets.

A silly yet enjoyable popcorn muncher,"There's no two ways about it, Law Abiding Citizen is a stupid movie. That's not to say it isn't entertaining, which it is.This is the classic case of a film constructed on an implausible premise, making use of ridiculous leaps of faith, to tell a story that is jam packed with popcorn munching entertainment.I know it sounds conflicted, but if you can buy into premises that the dead can walk or an alien from the planet Krypton can fly and be Earth's saviour, then turning off the brain's logic switch won't be a titanic effort to enjoy a movie that delivers such a fun ride. This isn't to say that Kurt Wimmer's screenplay doesn't try to provide a plausible explanation for what transpires, but that it's a stretch by any leap of the imagination.The movie tells the story of Clyde Shelton (Butler), a mysterious Philadelphia electronics hobbyist whose life is suddenly torn asunder when his home is invaded by two thieves who murder his wife and young daughter.Enter Nick Rice (Foxx), a career-minded prosecuting attorney more concerned with blemishes to his conviction rate than actual justice. Fearing acquittal, Rice works out a plea bargaining deal which sees one of the two robbers do minimal prison time, and the other sentenced to death row. Only problem is it's the thief who did the killing who gets off lightly. Thus is laid the foundation for Shelton's epic quest for revenge, not merely targeting the killers, but the entire justice system which he sees as corrupt.Director F. Gary Gray (2003's The Italian Job) does a yeoman job ensuring there's a good mix of action and story, and the performance of all involved is capable and adequate. My only reservation rests on the decision to make Gerard Butler speak with an American accent, which makes the Scottish actor at times appear as though he's got a mouth full of marbles.If you like things ""blowed up real good"" and have no trouble with plot devices that stretch credibility, you'll find Law Abiding Citizen a fun ride.

Will there be a sequel?,"Clyde Shelton has not died he is to smart. Failed to notice that his garage was broken into with crowbars but that is only a minor glitch. He had not one, the discovered, but two tunnels to each cell and he escaped again. This time, after 1-2 years(do not make him to old) he becomes friends with reformed Nick Rice (the justice system is either forced or fooled into leaving Clyde alone) and both work in the line of fighting deadly sophisticated terrorists: Clyde uses his superb brain to turn bad guys into dust, and Nick makes sure that those few that slipped though Clyde's traps end up getting proper three drugs with limited chosen audience. The justice system far from perfect improves, country gains efficient and genius terror fighter, and the bad guys are faced with something they cannot cope with. Clyde could be another Jason Bourne and James Bond. Could be interesting.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Like watching The Joker without makeup,"Law Abiding Citizen is a decent film if not for the amateur ending. The story's good and that's something one would expect from the film's writer, Kurt Wimmer.Gerard Butler plays Clyde Shelton, a family man forced to witness the brutal murder of his family. A flaw in the justice system lets the killer go free and Shelton takes the law into his own hands. Shelton threatens to kill more people if the justice system is not corrected and he makes his demands to Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), the prosecutor who must stop Shelton before more innocent people die.The movie picks up after Clyde Shelton's first murder. Shelton readily admits to killing the man who murdered his wife and daughter. Now in prison, Shelton makes demands to prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) or he threatens to kill people. While in prison.Gerard Butler's performance is fantastic and I felt like it was comparable to Heath Ledger's Joker as the movie's bad guy who got all the attention. Butler is very convincing as a cunning madman who only wants to see the world share his misery.The two disappointments in the film are Jamie Foxx, who is usually reliable, and of course the poor ending to an otherwise good film. This might be confusing but the movie's ending is actually quite fitting. The movie could have ended a la 'Silence of the Lambs'.Instead it saved us the dreaded prequel/sequel to look forward to.

This is probably the best drama/action/thriller I have ever seen in this decade...it deserves the IMDb top 10 spot,"WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW!!! I love this movie! I can't stress how amazing this movie was. It was so unpredictable the whole time. The judge office scene was amazing, I honestly did not expect that. It just adds to how badass Gerard Butler's character is, and how badass Gerard is in real life for being in this movie. This guy can not only do great comedies (the ugly truth), but he can do thrillers and action movies with flying colors (see 300).Where do I start with this? Well first off, let me get this off my chest. If you decide not to see this movie just because you heard of it having gore in it, then you do not deserve to live. Simple as that really. You can't go on with your life without seeing this movie. I can only hope this movie wins an Oscar, but those only get saved for cheap Oscar bait movies like the reader and benjamin button, it's a shame the Oscars are so biased.The movie starts off with the plot right off the bat at the intro. The cause and effect. The effect is what gerard butler is doing as his character to anyone who let those scumbag criminals get a free pass. You kinda' hate the Jamie Foxx character at first, but then you start to understand his reasons, but you still end up rooting for gerard butler's character till end credits. The ending is great, well executed. Many people compare this movie to the Dark Knight, and gerard butler's character to the joker. I can see why, and frankly, this movie is 5 times better than the dark knight.I heard of kurt wimmer before, well only when I heard that he will be directing the metal gear solid movie, and now that I've seen this movie, I can't wait to see metal gear solid directed by him, he's PERFECT for that movie. This movie just proves that he can do action espionage action even more. This movie did kinda have action espionage in it, especially Gerard's character, he was trained in that field for whomever he was working for in the past. You can kinda notice it at the opening intro of the movie when he works on something.All I gotta say is, he's still a hero no matter what he did in this movie. And very badass too. This guy makes the pulp fiction lead characters look like little school girls. I can only hope that whenever I become a successful Hollywood film-maker, I can reach a step close to this movie. This is the best movie I have seen so far in the first decade of the new millennium, I don't think anything else can take the cake. Now, I wait for the day when a movie is made to surpass this.Not only is this movie badass, but it just proves that revenge is ALWAYS the answer and is very sweet and satisfying. If this happened to a family member of mine, my mother, I would go nuts! I'd kill everyone responsible for it. The lesson here is: Everyone is held accountable for what they do/did. Do not pass on this movie, seriously. This is certainly a blu-ray buy in my books. 10/10 for an amazing plot, an amazing acting performance, and an amazing director with fine directing and creative skills. I really hope to work with Kurt Wimmer some day. And if anyone on the crew of this movie is reading this review, I got some pretty good news for you guys, all the shows were sold out, it was full. I wish you good luck and I hope this movie takes the box office for this, and next month so that we can see more great movies from you, Kurt. I'm really looking forward to Metal Gear Solid.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Who's the hero?,"Expectations are everything. I went into the movie (shown on Channel 4 this week) expecting gratuitous, ""Saw""-levels of gore and a shockingly bad ending. Instead, I found the violence to be fairly restrained (mainly taking place off-screen) and the ending not nearly as bad as everyone makes out.It runs as an interesting concept-thriller where the main character is clearly in control every step of the way. Clyde is a lot like Michael Scofield in ""Prison Break"". He's in there because he chose to be there and every little event takes place for a reason.It also explores themes around the sensibility of the law quite nicely, such as the scene around Clyde's application for bail.However, here's a fundamental problem with LAC, namely that there's no clear hero. Obviously, the audience is supposed to side with Clyde, at least initially. His wife and daughter have been horribly slaughtered and the real killer receives a minimal sentence. Clyde wants justice and he gets it, exacting torturous revenge on the murderer. Now it's fair to say that Clyde seems fairly demented at this point, despite his careful strategic planning. But then his crusade for justice goes further afield, and it's here that our sympathy starts to wear thin. Are we to continue supporting his murderous campaign against the justice system? Or are our affections now supposed to shift to ADA Nick and his band of legal beagles? A much more interesting story would have been one in which Clyde saw justice triumph through a clever manipulation of the system itself. If that sort of thing appeals to you, go see ""Fracture"". As for LAC, an interesting cat-and-mouse thriller entertains for most of its running time, yet ultimately disappoints in the final analysis.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great Movie,"This movie really wins my trophy. It's focused on a father, Clyde, who gets beaten and his wife and daughter are killed by 2 crooks. However the crooks' punishment was dimmed down because of a deal made by the lawyer, Jamie Fox. 10 years later, Clyde decides to take out the entire corrupt justice system and does so in manners to where he can get his way with the system. This movie is generally aimed at the adult crowd being that there are really no fantasy characters or anything that would call for the younger crowd.This movie really keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the main character Clyde really makes this movie something memorable and just extraordinary. Clyde devises sneaky and cunning ways by taking down his victims and the whole sense on whether he is the hero or villain also adds to the excitement. My favorite part of the movie is when Clyde calls the crook on the phone and tells him that the cops are after him and lets him know how to get away without being caught. Towards the end of the conversation he tells him to take a police car that is parked near the river because there is a cop sleeping in it. He basically sets the man up because he turns out to be that police officer that is about to murder him. You can compare Clyde to the Joker pretty much, but in my opinion 10 times better. Jamie Fox also does a great job playing his character, a heroic yet corrupt lawyer.Every scene you will be wondering what will happen next, because you honestly won't know. The movie has a few twists and turns and will always keep you guessing. If you want to see something that is highly suspenseful, will keep you on the edge of your seat, and includes 2 very unique and questionable characters, then you must see this movie. Law Abiding Citizen will not disappoint and I would recommend everyone to watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
""" Playing Chess with the criminal mind is nothing short of lunacy ""","The last we heard from Gerald Butler, the extra-ordinary actor was holding the pass of Thermopylae in ancient Greece against the Persians. Now, he has fast forwarded to playing Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) an innovative inventive genius and a "" Law Abiding Citzen "" in typical American fashion. One day at home he, his wife and child are savagely attacked in their home by two brutal killers. Unlike his wife and child, he survives and attends the murderers' day in court. Expecting both assailants to be convicted and executed, he learns, the ambitious District Attorney Nick Rice, (Jamie Foxx) has made a deal with one of the killers. Vowing revenge, Shelton, a bitter but brilliant and resourceful individual sets a clever trap for the killer who was release and punishes him. Everyone in the District Attorney's office is reflective of their original failure, except Rice. Realizing who the culprit is, Rice now challenges Shelton to a supreme cat and mouse game to see which one will prove the superior strategist. Throughout the entire film, Shelton proves it's he and stays well ahead of the D.A. Failing to beat his adversary within the law, Rice becomes as aggressively despairing in order to win, a notion, Shelton concedes. The movie is an exciting and violent film and one wonders if the adage is indeed true. In order to beat an enemy, one must become as vicious and destructive as he is. A remarkable and undeniable truism if ever there was one. This is a milestone film for Butler and predictably will become a Classic for him. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Don't expect corn to taste like caviar,"Entertaining action-thriller starring two of the biggest stars in Hollywood, Gerard Butler and Jamie ""Give me that role, I can make pigs fly"" Foxx.

Like this review, the movie started out painting a picture we'd be sorry to overlook. Too bad it couldn't sustain its initial momentum of a clever thriller with action which blow your pants off.

Awesome,"On pe of my top favorite movies, could have got a better cast. Wish there could have been a sequel.

Clyde is angry as hell and will make sure the people responsible for the horrible trial of the killers will all suffer and die. So basically you got yourself a revenge movie here. Clyde is killing them and isn't even hiding it, he admits it. Nick Rice ( Jamie Foxx ) is the DA on the case and needs to find out what the hell is going on.

Gripping Thriller!,"To be honest, when I first started watching Law Abiding Citizen, I thought this was an action film. But it is more of a thriller and a good one too. This film sort of creeped me out since this kind of plot could happen in real life, I think. But, F. Gary Gray made a gritty thriller that somehow many critics hated.This film is about how one guy systematically murders people while in prison due to a flawed justice system. Does a prosecutor and the city of Philadelphia have what it takes to stop this guy?I heard lots of bad things about Jamie Foxx in this movie. He wasn't half bad but I wish Denzel took this role. He would have blown the movie out of the water. Gerard Butler is convincingly scary as the madman with the plots.Overall, this is a time-ticking, great thriller.

"Decent Revenge Flick, But Turn Your Brain Off","I wouldn't exactly call myself a big fan of revenge flicks, but I am a fan of the concept. Here we have a great concept: a man who loses his family and watches the man responsible for this get a minimal sentence for the crime, blames the justice system and takes revenge on them...while being imprisoned. I groaned when I knew what to expect, someone with another blow-hard message about justice in the U.S. Still, the fact the main character is imprisoned and still killing off people intrigued me. And for the most part, it is a pretty entertaining film.What makes this film particularly entertaining is its relentless pace. It's almost non-stop. Despite being predictable and the trailers giving away too much, there are several entertaining action scenes here. It help that Gerard Butler once again proves he's a charming action star. This is the kind of stuff he should be doing. Jaime Foxx on the other hand is less entertaining as a success-hungry lawyer.Unfortunately, as entertaining as the film is, much of it leaves something to be desired. The writing is mediocre and much of what happens during the action scenes is beyond unbelievable. I understand suspension of disbelief, and believe me I can probably perform such a thing more so than most people, but this film stretched it. And not just in the way the action scenes play out, but in the message of the film. Butler's character is so blood lusty by the end of the film, and Foxx's character seems to have had so little character growth, that you really don't care for any of these characters and their senses of justice. It's a good concept, but one that is DOA.This leads me to the two biggest problems in the film: the fact that there is no real protagonist and the ending. A film needs a protagonist of some sort, especially and action film. And, in a revenge film, we're supposed to support the character in their quest for vengeance. Here, it is almost impossible to care about Butler's character, as he has killed a number of innocent characters and essentially become the villain that we are supposed to hate. Likewise, by the end, Foxx seems to have learned nothing from the ordeal, or at least has not grown as a character in any satisfying way. And then there is the ending, which is so ridiculous one wonders how it can be acceptable. While the whole thing was kinda cool in a special fx kind of way, the message the film was trying to tell is shot right out the window. Way to go.Now, I realize there is quite a bit of criticism here, and that's only because, for such a preachy film you'd really have to be an anarchist to support its message. But the cat and mouse games in the film are actually well written and the quest for the truth is interesting enough to sustain interest. Sure, there are huge leaps of logic here (instead of transferring the man out of the city, they keep him imprisoned in it? ), but if you can suspend your belief for a while, there is some decent action here and even a little suspense. It's not a great movie by far, but if you want to kill some time with a fairly entertaining film, this should suffice as the new film of the week.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""No, I don't think I will excuse you.""","I feel like this film's more of a one-off, as in, when you watch it for the first time, it's at its best, but after that, its value decreases a lot. I'm not sure if anyone else felt/feels this way. That's the vibe I got. But the initial, first-time effect still happened; it's not like it never existed because of what follows.For me, I thought this film was pretty entertaining. A huge part, I'd imagine, was how different, from every other film I've seen so far, it was. There were a few grim scenes: the beginning of the film, the torturous demise of a particular character, and ""the scene"" in the judge's chamber, which made me jump. And the atmosphere, in general, was pretty tense and suspenseful.At the same time, I feel like, with the final act, the storytelling began getting a little weak. It's like things were progressing in a stereotypically, 'this is the final act, so we have to finish everything off' sort of way. I hope that makes sense.And the ending itself was the crescendo, the ""final nail in the coffin"" of that stereotype. Then again, it's not like I was rooting for either character. Clyde's feelings were valid, but he went off the rails. Nick's perspective made sense, and his decision at the end was understandable, given everything that happened, but the ending was ""rushed."" For lack of a better word.I don't know. I don't necessarily know how to feel. The ending kind of left a bit more to be desired. Not only that, what was the 'lesson learned?' Everything in this film that happened almost felt unnecessary. And I guess it had a pretty flimsy narrative for revolving a film around, and it seemed stretched out, too, only for the conclusion to not seem like one, to seem flat, instead.As far as the specific elements of the film are concerned, none of the acting performances stood out that much; Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx were at the top, obviously, given how their characters got the most focus. The cinematography by Jonathan Sela was pretty decent, I suppose. And the score that was composed by Brian Tyler, who has, what I'm assuming is considered, quite the résumé, and it showed: this film's score stood out a lot.This film was entertaining, but I'll refer back to the first sentence of my review: I feel like this film's more of a one-off, as in, when you watch it for the first time, it's at its best, but after that, its value decreases a lot. And, interestingly enough, Roger Ebert, more or less, said something similar. ""Law Abiding Citizen is one of those movies you like more at the time than in retrospect."" (I mean, come on, you're thinking. Still, there's something to be said for a movie you like well enough at the time.) I thought that was interesting.Other thoughts:The acting by Ksenia Hulayev, Clyde's daughter, stood out to me. Something about it seemed pretty decent: like it came naturally.At times, Gerard Butler sounded a lot like Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon.Josh Stewart, the actor who played Rupert Ames, looked like Jason Clarke a little bit. Especially as ""that"" was happening. His strained face and the VFX did most of it regarding that. He doesn't look much like Jason otherwise.There was also a similar-sounding likeness in Christian Stolte's voice to Ned Luke's voice, aka Michael De Santa. At times, anyway. Not only that, I initially didn't realize he's that one guy from Chicago Fire.If there's ever an L. A. Noire TV show or film, Colm Meaney would make a pretty decent Rusty Galloway.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

An entertaining thrill ride with a disappointing end!!!!,"Clyde Shelton is an upstanding family man whose wife and daughter are brutally murdered during a home invasion. When the killers are caught, Nick Rice, a hotshot young Philadelphia prosecutor, is assigned to the case. Over his objections, Nick is forced by his boss to offer one of the suspects a light sentence in exchange for testifying against his accomplice. Fast forward ten years. The man who got away with murder is found dead and Clyde Shelton coolly admits his guilt. Then he issues a warning to Nick: Either fix the flawed justice system that failed his family, or key players in the trial will die. Soon Shelton follows through on his threats, orchestrating from his jail cell a string of spectacularly diabolical assassinations that can be neither predicted nor prevented. Philadelphia is gripped with fear as Shelton's high- profile targets are slain one after another and the authorities are powerless to halt his reign of terror. Only Nick can stop the killing, and to do so he must outwit this brilliant sociopath in a harrowing contest of wills in which even the smallest misstep means death. With his own family now in Shelton's cross hairs, Nick finds himself in a desperate race against time facing a deadly adversary who seems always to be one step ahead.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Do not mess with an intelligent guy.,"I identified with Clyde, because I self-represented myself in court during a civil proceeding and was fighting against lawyers and spouting precedents and legal to make my case. Clyde also had me laughing like crazy during the whole movie because he was making a clever mockery of the justice system. It's the craftiness and meticolous attention to detail, with his statements to Foxx that had me cracking in my seat. With me, this movie had a dark humour about it where Clyde was just menacing throughout the whole movie and playing everyone there for a fool.If you are into dark humour movie that makes a mockery of the justice system with one law-abiding man that loses it then watch it.Apart from this aspect, I found some major holes in terms of realism or believability, but overall, it's the funniest dark humour movies I've seen. The part with the judge scene, where he first fights against bail, then blasts the judge for giving him bail, and then he is denied bail and held in contempt of court -- cracked me up. Other funny scenes include plea-bargains for ridiculous demands by Clyde that just make you laugh.If you like this sort of film, there is another movie called ""The Interview"" and it stars Hugo Weaving that sort of has that same cat and mouse game where the accused is making a mockery of the prosecution by admitting to a murder then explaining it away and using technicalities.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Cool, but what does it really show in the end?","No, I'm not telling you what happens in the end. Relax.So main guy Clyde, played very well by Butler, goes up against society and it's justice system because his family was murdered and one of the murderers goes free. He takes 10 years to develop a plan, and he's going to involve his original lawyer, Nick Rice, played by Foxx. Nick made a shady deal that allowed the criminals to have soft sentences. Somehow, Clyde orchestrates a series of murders, all from his prison cell, and no one can figure out how he does it. At first, Clyde goes after the bad guys, but it's soon revealed that he had a lot more in mind, such as government officials.What works here is Gerard Butler. He looks like he is enjoying himself as he sits back and watches his plan unfold, teaching people ""lessons"". Sort of reminds me of Saw in that respect. What doesn't work is Foxx, or at least the script of his character. We know that he has acting chops, he played so well in 'Ray', but there's no way he convinces me as a D.A., simply because there are just too many things someone of his intelligence would never do. The movie eventually gets a bit out there in the ""real"" department because this infection of things that are improbable start affecting other things too. Since the movie is taking itself seriously, I have to come to the conclusion that it wants you to believe everything here is on the ball. I'm not sure if I enjoyed how it eventually ended, either. What did we all learn from it? How could anyone have taken the actions and words of something similar to a terrorist to heart as a comfortable life lesson? Unfortunately, we first like Clyde a lot, sympathize with him, then we are forced to hate him. You know how Charles Bronson, Rambo, or any other ""I'm gonna get you"" character is still somewhat likable in the end? Not here.But let me not hit too hard because I still enjoyed the revenge-but-something-bigger-than-that based story. Some of the scenes were clever, and it did have some cool AH HA! moments.

"A flawed, but entertaining piece of throwaway cinema","On an ordinary evening, Clyde Sheldon (Gerard Butler) watches helplessly as his wife and child are killed in front of him. Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), a hot shot lawyer with a record conviction rate he is not willing to sacrifice, takes the case and manages to send one of the criminals responsible for the murder to death row. But the real perpetrator gets off with a much lighter sentence. Rice sees nothing wrong with this based on the lack of evidence, but Sheldon does not feel justice is served. Zap forward ten years later, where Sheldon begins his quest for justice and people involved with the case are picked off one by one.When I first saw the trailer for Law Abiding Citizen, I was immediately reminded of David Fincher's brilliant psychological horror-thriller Se7en. Whereas Se7en revolved around the investigation of John Doe and his randomly chosen victims based on the idea of the seven deadly sins, Citizen revolves around a wronged man choosing his victims based on their involvement with his case. The film takes away the suspense of trying to figure out who is doing it, and attempts to focus more on the why and how. For the most part, we get to watch every kill and get to slowly piece together how and why everything is happening. There is nothing random about any of the events in the film, and the suspense lies in the comprehension of what is occurring, not in the horrific one-upping randomness of the events.But the momentum that Citizen has in its early moments is lost quite quickly as the film goes on. While Se7en basked in toying just as much with the two leads as it did the viewer, Citizen seems content at laying everything out rather easy and waiting for the viewer to pick up on the reasoning and eventual twist. I will admit that I was surprised by that twist, but a lot of what leads up to it feels very mundane. There is a very thrilling aspect to the events taking place, but after the first few characters bite the dust, there just seems to be very little life left in the story. It feels like it was an intriguing idea to start that gets tapped out far too quickly. More maddening (albeit very intriguing) is the absence of some things most films would find key. We learn very little about Sheldon (outside of what the trailer already tells us), we learn very little about Rice (outside of how dedicated he and his team are to his records), and we learn almost nothing about the murders that start the film off and are the reason for what happens in the first place. Not all of these things are bad, but they do manage to feel bothersome at times anyway.Despite all this, Kurt Wimmer (the man responsible for the hideously underrated Equilibrium and the just plain hideous Ultraviolet) manages to still make the story entertaining and interesting enough to sustain the audience for the entire ride. The intensity of some of the sequences, and the sheer bloody and unflinching brutality of some of the murders more than make up for the flawed screenplay. He seems to be a stronger writer than a director, and I can only hope he sticks to writing. F. Gary Gray, a veteran action director, does not exactly bring a distinct style to the film, but competently brings the story out quite well.The acting, much like everything else, is flawed but still not all that bad. The supporting cast unfortunately gets very little to do outside of attempt to hold their own against Foxx and Butler. There are a couple of cast members who do quite a bit for the film, specifically Leslie Bibb and Colm Meaney (who has been all but missing in action from mainstream films as of late), but the script never really lets their characters flourish outside of being one-note and one-dimensional. Practically everything we try to learn about Bibb's character is either never elaborated on, or brushed off entirely. I would have liked to have seen more of a presence from all the supporting actors, but these two specifically could have done with more material.Foxx has failed consistently at trying to perform anywhere near the majesty of his Oscar-winning turn in Ray. There is no doubt that he is a great actor, but he has yet to prove since why we all believed he could pull Ray Charles off so well. In Citizen, he seems a bit too muted. In the scenes where the world begins to close in on his character, we can see the pain coming through, but never really get to see Foxx attempt to shine the way we know he can. He just seems to be going through the motions, hoping the lines will do the work and not his acting. It is a decent enough performance, but that is it.Butler on the other hand does his best work here since 300. He just looks like he is having fun with the role, and chews right into the twisted individual Sheldon quickly becomes. Watching him interact with Foxx's character and running circles around him is reason enough to watch the film. His performance is not incredible by a long shot, but there is more life and depth within Butler at any given moment than there is in the entirety of the film. When the film goes limp, Butler just keeps on putting everything into the role. My only qualm is with his uneven accent, which seems to be a consistent problem for him.Law Abiding Citizen is an entertaining piece of throwaway cinema. It is incredibly flawed, but there is enough value in what is good about it to make it a worthwhile watch. Just do not go in expecting something on par with Se7en.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Overrated - A Mediocre Action Thriller,"Before I saw this movie I first perused the many user reviews on IMDb. They were, overwhelmingly, positive. Nearly all rated the movie 9 or 10 stars. Sadly this is not the case.The movie has an intriguing premise at first glance but it quickly fizzles out as we watch a once good father become a sociopathic killing machine whose intent is to teach a 'corrupt' lawyer and a 'corrupt' justice system some lessons.Throughout the movie the viewer is supposed to believe that this man, Clyde, (Butler) is a good man attempting to teach Nick (Foxx) a lesson. In fact, teaching us all a lesson about America's corrupt justice system. And we are supposed to believe this as Clyde continues to murder innocent after innocent. The movie is hardly believable and the schemes Clyde concocts are not too surprising and definitely not worth the price of admission.If you want to see a good action movie that actually entertains see ZombieLand instead.

It still took me a fortnight to comply with his request and I discovered that this whole build up was not necessary for the movie.The concept of the story is good. One feels that the movie does throw light upon certain aspects of the justice system which are basically wrong though not completely unjustified. It tries hard to allocate accountability but lets us know that in the real world nothing is black and white.Not exactly brilliant but the director succeeds in dishing out a decent action thriller which would have been a runaway hit in the first few years of the decade.The action sequences are OK.The screenplay needs major amendments to add bite to the otherwise morose dialogues.Watch it if you have to.

Audience get a feeling that Clyde, who been wronged at an unimaginable scale deserves a fiery vengeance but his actions present a moral dilemma and that forms the backbone of the story. Clyde's nemesis Nick's character is also deep. Nick is presented as a lawyer who had tried to find his own way to success through his life while conforming and promoting the corrupt system until Clyde comes to picture.Writers has unfortunately took the safe road regarding the ending.

"Everything that Taken did right, this movie did mostly wrong","When you watch a movie about revenge, you want to root for the hero all the way thru the movie and feel sympathetic even when the hero has to resort to violence (e.g. The Brave One, Taken, The Fugitive). Here we have a person who has experienced a great tragedy and has every reason to want revenge. Which is precisely the emotion that I'm sure was intended for the viewers as well. In this movie, the villains are not restricted to the original perpetrators. The Law and the lawyers who manipulate it are also villains in this movie. Initially it appears as if the hero, Gerard Butler, is going to enact his revenge on the Law by means of the great wealth of law knowledge that he clearly absorbed during the 10 years since his unfortunate tragedy. The court scene and initial prison interrogation scenes are brilliant and you can really start to see where an intelligent scriptwriter could have taken this movie to a breathtaking level. Instead, the revenge enacted by the hero becomes too bloodthirsty and the hero stops being a sympathetic character in my opinion. This is where the movie quickly got off track leading to the extremely ungratifying ending. The pursuit of retribution should have followed a more intellectual path, which is where it appeared to be headed.How much better and sympathetic would this movie have been had the hero exacted his revenge against the legal system by staging assassinations of other violent sex offenders who he had researched over the years that were free due to some legal finagling rather than the lawyers and judges themselves? Imagine Foxx and his legal team trying to outwit Butler, while these sex offenders are mysteriously dying while Butler is still in prison. Tell me that's not a better movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Gerard and Foxx are a hit-combo!!,"What do you get when you combine 2 of the world's most talented and intense actors of all time? An award-winning performance even amidst a rather ingenious storyline with might I say, more than a few loopholes.You will be blown away initially, with the gore, violence and pure intelligence of the way Gerard's character, Clyde, a tormented father, mourning the loss of his wife and daughter after 10 years, plays out the murders of the people who were involved in the trial against the murderers of his family. No doubt for a villain, Gerard is captivating, menacing and wittingly charming all at the same time. He is so convincing that at times, he makes you feel his motives for the murders were 100% justified! Foxx definitely kept his end of the bargain up by delivering a cocky, self-righteous, successful lawyer persona when he compromises the trial of Gerard's murdered family by allowing one of the 2 killers off with a light sentence. Throughout the movie, you can see Foxx's demeanour changing, losing his focus and strength after being worn down by Butler's incomprehensible and systematic killings, even as Butler is locked up at a maximum security prison! I won't go into details as to what the loopholes are, cos if we analyse it too much, we tend to forget that this movie, at its core, has an original and compelling storyline, somewhat a mix of Seven and The Bone collector.

Good Thriller. Intense.,"Clyde Shelton's (Butler) family was brutally murdered via a home invasion. Clyde blames Nick (Foxx), his lawyer, for making a deal that lets one suspect testify against the other in order to get a light sentence. Clyde has plans to show Nick you do not make deals with murderers.And, those plans are spectacular. I was not ready for them. But, considering that Clyde gives himself up after killing the other suspect in his family murder, it was too early in the movie for this to be over. So I wanted to know more. I was hooked. Nick was fond of saying that it's not about justice, it's about what you can prove in court and Clyde took it all to heart. What a guy.I am not that familiar with Gerard Butler except to have seen him in one ditzy chick flick so this intense drama showed me something more about him. And, it was all good. I expected him to go on a rage like a Mel Gibson character when someone does something bad to his family. But, this was not Clyde's plan. Hard to do anyway since he was locked up in jail.

"Excellent thriller, and bravo, Gerard Butler!","This film flew under my radar for a decade; not sure why I'd never heard of it. Jamie Foxx is solid and excellent in the part of the straight man (always the toughest character to put across), and Gerard Butler is an outstanding 10+ as the ""good guy/bad guy"" villain. The plot, up till the very end (when things do spiral a bit out of control) is excellent, and the writing is top-notch throughout: understated and menacing.Reviewers' criticisms tend to focus on:
First, the wide liberties taken with legal procedure, police procedure and reality. I can't disagree, but I had no trouble enjoying this as an action/psychological film, start to finish. If we held every movie to a strict burden of accuracy, there'd be damned few films left. Sometimes---frequently, in fact---one must put aside the real world and simply take a film on its own terms.Second, the ending. Again I agree; it's a comedown from the previous hour and a half of tight action---but that wasn't enough to spoil the film for me. The ending flashes by quickly, and we are spared any after-the-fact moralizing or explanations. Didn't really bother me at all.P. S. - I can't resist commenting on one of the ""Goofs"" posted on IMDb: that the cello fingerings in the recital scene do not match the soundtrack.

It's a very far fetched film, the story goes in a very ridiculous direction and I felt like it simply would have been a much more interesting and compelling film if it had stayed realistic. It is also unnecessarily violent, it was extremely graphic and unpleasant, that's not what this movie started out as and I was surprised, and honestly unimpressed, that it became such a gory mess.

A different prison(er) thriller,"There are dozens of prison dramas where convicts try to persuade their innocence and most of the plot is based on letting viewers to guess are they right and whom to blame - some of them have even got Academy Awards or nominations at least. Law Abiding Citizen is ""plain"" in that sense: viewers are let to know about the guiltiness and the person in question does not deny it. Nevertheless, interesting twists and turns begin, a real cat-and-mouse play between legal personalities and a criminal mastermind. And here, at first, weaknesses of democracy are clearly visible - as solid proof is very hard to obtain. Anyway, the thrill is maintained throughout the movie (well, sometimes at the expense of rather improbable scenes, i.e. escapes and passing through high-level security), although the final 20 minutes are a bit protracted.The cast is evenly strong, first and foremost the leading performers Jamie Foxx, Gerald Butler and Viola Davis in a memorable supporting role.

Law Abiding Citizen,"Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) is at home playing with his wife and young daughter when suddenly he hears a knock on the door. When he opens the front door, two thugs Clarence Darby (Christian Stolte) and Rupert Ames (Joshua Stewart) burst in. Darby stabs Clyde, his wife and child. Only Clyde Shelton survives this event and he turns to the ambitious lawyer Nick Rice for justice. But since DNA has been denied at trial, Rice opts for a deal in which Darby gets five years for testifying against Ames who gets the lethal injection. This sombre, dark and serious backdrop is surprisingly and unexpectedly the set-up for an effective dark comedy in which Clyde Shelton not only takes revenge against Ames and Darby, but also teaches Nick Rice a lesson that he will never forget.I am inclined to regard ""Law Abiding Citizen"" as a dark comedy/fantasy, because I cannot imagine it working any other way. Gerard Butler does not play his character straight, but rather with a comic and sarcastic edge almost as though from the very beginning he is out to make a point that the system of justice (as he sees it) is ridiculous. The facial expressions and the emotional response are different from what you expect from a man who lost his wife and child. Just compare Butler to Brandon Lee in ""The Crow"" and you will see what I mean. ""Law Abiding Citizen"" is also more of a fantasy than an action thriller, because what it is really about (if you think about it) is a victim fantasizing about what he would like to see happen to the criminals who ruined his life and to the justice system that (in his mind) let him down. Since the movie is about Clyde Shelton's fantasy and not about anything real, it features many unlikely and fantastic (but nonetheless entertaining) twists and turns that could only be found in a revenge fantasy. For example, Clyde Shelton launches countless terrorist attacks against the justice system while he is in prison. To be sure, the film explains how Shelton is able to do this, but(without giving away the surprise) the answer provided is itself implausible. The frequent face-to-face encounters between Nick Rice and Clyde Shelton in prison are also part of this fantasy, because they are too unlikely to be believed. A prosecutor would simply not spend so much time visiting a man that he had sent to prison. Lastly, the concessions to Shelton - which include a nice bed and a Frisco's steak - are highly unlikely, which is why those scenes and more particularly the reaction of the cell mates to them are so funny.I think this movie is going to appeal more to people who are themselves victims of crime and fantasize about taking the law in their own hands and about meting out justice to those who have wronged them. But I also enjoyed watching ""Law Abiding Citizen"" when I stopped taking it seriously and saw it more as a revenge fantasy with a dark comedic edge - and on that basis I do recommend it. For all of the implausible plot developments, ""Law Abiding Citizen"" has kept me entertained right to the end. Finally there is something quite refreshing about the Clyde Shelton character - and the way Gerard Butler played it - because it is different from the Hollywood characters in the revenge genre. Butler did something bold and original here, which indicates that he is more than the typical Hollywood actor (a la Keanu Reeves) and that the writers for once actually gave some thought to making this character not only intelligent, but subtle and intriguing.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Revenge Rampage Which Can Get Unbelievable,"Only once in a rare while do we encounter a movie with two main characters who are both protagonist and antagonist at the same time. ""Law Abiding Citizen"" is one of these movies where the line between right and wrong is blurred into an almost invisible line by the circumstances that surround it.The movie goes directly to the point. Clyde (Gerald Butler) loses his family right before his very eyes. Public prosecutor Nick (Jaimie Foxx) cuts a deal with the perpetrators to get a compromised win. Clyde did not appreciate this, and takes the law into his own hands. He planned not only to kill the criminals, but also to reform the entire justice system with an elaborate plot which he describes to be ""of Biblical proportions.""This ambiguity of everything that is going on is the best thing about ""Law Abiding Citizen."" I just felt that too little was established about Clyde to convince us that he is really capable enough or even monstrous enough to pull off this Machiavellian scheme of his. If you can just look beyond this gaping plot hole (and the pretty high violence and gore quotient), this film does have its engrossing points. It keeps you guessing to the very moment of climactic revelation.People who love action and a good mystery will enjoy this film. It is a good film to pump up adrenaline with, and to match wits with the writer. The extreme violence and gore (which at one point gets uncomfortably gratuitous) may appeal to some people, but turn others completely off. You can however shield your eyes at just the right moments and enjoy the rest of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Super entertaining revenge thriller, with a twist","I enjoyed this one a lot despite the ridiculous ending. Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler both do a decent job, Foxx plays it cool as the driven prosecutor/dad and Butler, well I was definitely rooting for the bad guy with his character... up to a point, then he just goes from anti-hero to psycho/serial killer, very violent and kinda scary actually as he is unstoppable. A clever plot in that respect.""Release me by 6am."" ""Or what?"" ""I kill everyone"" -Hard to have much compassion for ""that"" guy.The story follows Butler as Clyde Shelton, a family man who takes justice into his own hands after his wife and daughter are brutally murdered in a home invasion and his hotshot prosecutor fails to deliver justice. When a plea bargain sets one of the killers free, he wages a deadly vigilante campaign targeting not only the killer but also the district attorney and others involved in the deal.I liked figuring this one out. Initially not much makes sense and I was surprised by the 10 year time leap as we try to understand why Butler lets himself get arrested (naked) and how he is able to do what he's doing from behind bars. How is he his own accomplice? (this made a whole lot more sense once it was revealed that he had been a former spy/assassin).Sure its all a bit absurd at times, more violent than I expected too but an original thriller that tries to make a social statement; the system is corrupt. 3/17/15",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Great film,"It is a very good film. It has a story where we can empathize with its characters and offers us a wonderful portrait of a father with extraordinary abilities (as Liam Neeson in Taken) who can create ingenious mechanisms to deliver justice (as Tobin Bell in Saw) and who is virtually unstoppable. (as Keanu Reevs in John Wick). All of these films owe a debt to this important film because it gives us elements that are not credible but that allow for enormous enjoyment; We all recognize that the judicial system is questionable and that words like honor and sanity are practically worthless.

Gerard Butler: a very smart killing machine,"This was one of the better films I've seen in a while. It begins with Gerard, playing Clyde, an average family man. His home is invaded and his wife and daughter are killed. Jamie Fox plays the prosecuting attorney, Nick. The robber, Darby, whom did the killings testifies against the other guy. Darby gets a light sentence, while the other guy gets lethal injection. Clyde is very upset the one who did the killing got away.Jump 10 years ahead and the execution is taking place. Something goes wrong with the lethal injection and investigation begins. Soon they are after Darby, but Darby is a set up. Clyde has vengeance on his mind and takes care of Darby in a very gruesome manner. We now know Clyde is more than an average man. The rest of the movie is a game he plays with Nick. How is he still doing the killing while in jail?

A movie worthy to watch,"Law Abiding Citizen tells the story of an everyday guy decides to take justice into his own hands after a plea bargain sets his family's killers free. His target: The district attorney who orchestrated the deal. It is very interesting but also I think its a little unrealistic. Full of action and adventure, Law Abiding Citizen is a well developed thriller with a fast paced rhythm that will keep you on the edge of your seat for almost two hours and with a completely unexpected ending. The cast is conformed by Gerard Butler as Clyde Shelton his performance is very good, you can really feel his desperation on the first part of the movie and his cynicism in the second part. Jamie Fox is also very convincing as attorney Nick Rice and the supporting roles of Bruce McGill (Jonas Cantrell), Colm Meaney Detective Dunnigan) and Leslie Bibb (Sarah Lowell) are f very good help in the development of the movie. In conclusion, Law Abiding Citizen is a movie worthy of a chance to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Butler portrays a vengeful father/husband in this action-thriller,"Gerard Butler is an interesting actor. He has done comedies (The Ugly Truth) and many action movies (300, Gamer). Personally, I think he is better as an action star. In Law Abiding Citizen, he plays a man with a plan to take down the justice system. The movie is a good thriller with lots of violence and mystery.Clyde Sheldon (Gerard Butler) is an honest, law abiding, family man until two home-invaders attack Clyde and murder his wife and daughter. Jamie Foxx plays Nick Rice, a lawyer who decides to make a deal with one of the killers. Flash forward ten years, one of the murderers is being given lethal injection, while the other perpetrator has gone free after a short prison term. When the injection goes horribly wrong and the other killer is found mutilated in a warehouse, Clyde gives himself up to the police as the murderer. From within the prison walls, Clyde begins to orchestrate the assassination of anyone involved in the case.The story is a classic locked-room mystery, how does Clyde continue to kill people even after he has been locked up? The answer to this question I thought was a little weak of an idea, but it was still inventive and proved just how resourceful Clyde was. Otherwise, the story is believable and makes for a good thriller. I felt that the script was quite good for a mystery-thriller, one of my favorite quotes comes when Clyde Sheldon states that he is ""gonna bring the whole f***in' diseased, corrupt temple down on your head. It's gonna be biblical.""I bought Gerard Butler as a nice, family man. He was also believable as a vicious serial killer (although ideally I would have preferred to see Clyde fall into madness, but this would be a whole other movie). Gerard Butler does seem a little bit too nice when he tortures the murderer of his family, but when you consider what he's doing, and how he talks about it later, his character is actually quite real. Jamie Foxx is good as a lawyer, but he doesn't show as much emotional depth as I think could have come from this role.Overall, Law Abiding Citizen is a good movie to watch, especially for people who like action-thrillers. The film is gritty, violent and is enjoyable to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Blending Saw with an Action Movie with a Strong Message on Corruption,"This is a movie that intrigued, but I missed it in the theater. This would have been when I was in college. It was near the end and at that time so I'm guessing money got tighter. I like Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler though. This is one that I saw on DVD right after graduating.For this, we get a similar premise to something like Death Wish or Death Sentence. Clyde Shelton (Butler) is home with his wife and child. Clarence Darby (Christian Stolte) and Rupert Ames (Josh Stewart) break in to rob the place. Clarence brutally attacks Clyde's family.We then shift over to seeing the state prosecutor team. The head of it is Jonas Cantrell (Bruce McGill). Under him though is Brian Bringham (Roger Bart). The best guy on the team is Nick Rice (Foxx). He has a high conviction rate and he doesn't want to jeopardize that. He makes a deal with Darby to put Ames on death row while he gets a reduced sentence. Clyde doesn't want this, but his hands are tied.10 years later, Ames' execution doesn't go as planned. Darby is attacked next. This is just the beginning of all those that are associated with the case are attacked.I'll be honest, the first time I saw this movie I loved it. I thought that it was an interesting blend of Saw with an action movie while also having a good message on the corruption of our justice system. Clyde isn't a bad guy, but he is doing bad things. There are times where I think that the way things play out is a bit too unbelievable at times. There are too many moving parts. If you can shut your brain off and just enjoy this, I think it works much better.The acting is good though. I think the cast is solid across the board with Butler, Foxx, Leslie Bibb, Colm Meaney, McGill, Regina Hall, Viola Davis, Michael Kelly, Stewart and Bart to just name some of them. It is well-made. The traps and the different ways that people are killed is interesting. This is a heavier popcorn film in my opinion. There are some triggering things in this, but I think how they're handled keeps this from going into the extreme or even the horror genre with the revenge aspects. It does flirt with it though.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A contrived but usually kick-ass thriller,"Despite a highly unbelievable plot and an anti-climactic finale, Law Abiding Citizen gets you hooked because it has a kick ass edge to it and a small does of cunning and irony to its story, in addition to two slick actors at the top of their game.Clyde Shelton is an engineer and a family man living happily in Philidelphia. One night, his house is broken into, his wife is raped and his daughter killed. A mistake on the part of the justice system results in what Shelton considers to be an insufficient sentence for the two perps. He comes up with a plan to get back at both the killers and the prosecution who he feels didn't do their job. it is a plan ten years in the making, but there will be blood for sure.Law Abiding Citizen does a good job of building not so much suspense but rather energy. As the film builds, it keeps you going, but therein lies a problem as well. With each chapter, the plot gets more contrived and less believable. By the time we reach the climax, the story almost cracks under the weight of its own absurdity. Who would believe that one individual can outsmart an entire city's law enforcement. On top of this the ending has a dumb payoff.The one element which maintains its strength is the duality of Fox and Butler. Their screen time together is solid. This is the film that Fracture could have been if it wasn't so confused in direction and more focused on the people. Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling are no match for these two.All in all, Law Abiding Citizen is not an intelligent movie, and it is certainly not for the squeamish kind, but I enjoyed it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"What begins as a reflective film that mixes suspense and action well, mixing good guys and bad guys, ends in the same way as any Hollywood action film, with pyrotechnics","Scripted by Kurt Wimmer, the feature shows how much the filmmaker excels in his technical skills, while exposing, again, the fragility of his screenwriter, responsible for the terrible ""Ultraviolet"". Wimmer gets it right by stating, right off the bat, the desperate situation that Butler's character went through. Helpless to see the most important people in his world being slaughtered like animals, Clyde needs to see that act of violence punished. When the justice system, represented by Nick, fails to do so, it generates the motivation for the horrendous acts to be committed by the once father of the family.This beginning to the deaths of criminals is shown tremendously effectively by the film, putting into vogue the old, but not outdated, issue of justice by one's own hands, already used so much in several stories in the most different media. However, Wimmer's text decides to complicate the situation even more, with Clyde, even in prison, orchestrating a real master plan to eliminate everyone he considers responsible for not punishing the bandits. The big problem is that the film massively dehumanizes the character in doing this, simply taking the focus away from the antagonistic views on justice between Clyde and Nick, which generate some of the best dialogue in the film, and transforming the once law-abiding citizen into a worthy character. Of MacGuyver, giving him superhuman planning and execution skills, mischaracterizing that figure that should be the public's source of identification. Questions about the functionality of the system, then, are thrown to the background, transforming the prosecutor played by Jamie Foxx not into an action character, but almost into a detective whose only function is to react to the absurd actions of his adversary, culminating in a an absolutely ridiculous outcome that totally disfigures the interesting premise presented in the story's prologue.From the beginning of ""Law Abidin Citizen"" it is clear the antagonistic force existing between Clyde Shelton and public prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx). Shelton enters the story as a good man, while Rice seems to occupy the position of the evildoer - the kind of corrupt law enforcement official who shakes hands with a murderer with whom he has just made a deal. As the plot unfolds and with Shelton's growing fury, we see, or should see, a reversal of roles, when Shelton becomes an effective threat to the entire justice system and Rice is portrayed as a defender of the common ideals of society, for seek the condemnation and punishment of the former. Although Shelton's method is extreme and incredibly violent, the character does not develop properly and continues to look like a good guy, just as Nick Rice continues to emulate the bad guy in the story, damaging the entire structure of the film.We have two characters who, on opposite sides of the law, duel to do justice by following what they believe in, changing character and beliefs with unreal ease. Let's take Nick's character as an example: at a given moment he makes the sensible decision to resign for not being able to perform his function satisfactorily, accumulating only a series of wrong decisions and the tragedies that resulted from them. All it takes is for the town mayor to mention the word ""promotion"" for Nick to be clutching a bible, taking an oath to stay in the profession and involved in the case that, until that moment, had claimed the lives of several of his colleagues and threatened his own. Safety and that of your family.The film has no problem getting off to a good start, involving the viewer with its mixed theme between action and a more controversial theme, present daily in the life of any citizen. The film doesn't know how to end this theme, maybe because they didn't have a good solution to close a movie and keep their minds working on what they've just seen, maybe because they thought there wasn't enough action and put everything to explode, literally, like in any other obvious action. Firstly, the film involves everyone with justice. Is it relative? Are there larger cases that prevail over her? And what about taking justice into one's own hands, is it still considered justice? Gerard Butler manages to do a great scene in a courtroom between him and Annie Corley, who steps into the shoes of a judge. The scene is practically a monologue of the genius and disturbing mind of the character, who gives himself reasons to get out of jail without needing a lawyer and, when the judge gives him freedom, he scolds her giving reasons to remain imprisoned.Another factor that still makes me excited about the film is the fact that everything is presented in a different way, but this soon proves to be a double-edged sword. While Clyde proves to be a devoted father at first and soon becomes a killer a la Saw, Nick is a corrupt prosecutor and soon becomes a defender of justice. No one is a protagonist in the face of justice, but this change in attitudes left the characters with attitudes that were not very credible in the beginning. While Gerard Butler surprised me in this film in certain scenes with a good performance, Jamie Foxx proved average in a good part playing the good cop-bad cop. Other than that, the film still provides good effects for situations that didn't need to be there, as it loses focus on the discussion of justice to be able to show how terrible Clyde's side is, and the one who was previously a Dexter, a psychopath doing a justice with his own hands and still giving sympathy to the public, he became just another sociopath quite disturbed in not being able to hold back on an infinite revenge.The film gives you the right questions, but you shouldn't expect answers. It's not because they come through metaphors, it's because they don't. Through a dubious screenplay full of holes, the film manages to end badly, but still keeps the initial questioning in the air. It's a movie to stop after the first hour, when mysterious organizations and a horrible past for the story's villain begin to emerge. Law Abidin Citizen is an action movie that doesn't offer less than that, but it gives a little more. The problem is to know if this plus is worth it or if it would be better for him to continue in the median already checked. Director F. Gary Gray is one of those responsible for the problems mentioned above for not being able to work satisfactorily with ambiguous characters, such as those proposed in Kurt Wimmer's script. The director had already made a mistake by letting the anti-heroes of ""Uma Exit de Mestre"" become caricatures, and here he fails again at the same point. By looking for an excess of veracity in his protagonists, Gray ended up making them questionable and not very believable. Wimmer, however, did not help to change the situation: his misrepresented concepts of corruption and justice have been erroneously developed since ""Street Kings"".F. Gary Gray's film starts well, with its realistic violence and discussions of the US justice system and the arrogance of superstar prosecutors. The victim's (Butler) first attacks are interesting for the way they are built on the executioner's intelligence and skills. The problem is the old mania for ending stories in a spectacular way, like the climax, explosive and pyrotechnic. Butler's character gains the profile of a super criminal genius with cutting-edge technology. And all that interesting subtlety from the beginning is literally lost in the smoke. There is no suspension of disbelief that can withstand the succession of implausible information that the film offers. It is certain that the directors had a good idea at the beginning, but did not know how to solve it. As much as Gray managed to put Clyde's actions on screen in visually interesting and even frightening ways, the fact is that their existence completely clashes with the message that the film seemed to be trying to convey, making the feature practically become a new edition of "" Deadly Games"". In addition, the film never gives space for the public to be able to see the public's reactions to the actions seen and putting the authorities to carry out highly imbecilic attitudes, see the meeting that creates the climax of the film. At one point, the mayor claims that ""the population is in a panic"", but we don't see anything that justifies the general fear of the people, since Clyde's targets are always specific. Apart from the fact that, analyzing the structure of the film in a logical way, the character's crusade should generate polarized opinions from citizens, thus throwing the debate about the motives of the actions of the ""villain"" to the people. On the contrary, the tape insists on focusing only on the main characters, transforming the other figures in the scene into mere pawns.Instead of following the initial debate, justice and public safety x revenge into their own hands, the director and screenwriter preferred to find an easier and less believable way out. What begins as a reflective film that mixes suspense and action well, mixing good guys and bad guys, ends in the same way as any Hollywood action film, with pyrotechnics. As much as Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx are talented (and they really are), this type of tape doesn't just rest on the shoulders of its protagonists, especially if the script decides to systematically sabotage them. ""Law Abidin Citizen"" cannot even resolve the conflicts and questions it raises, leaving open its proposals to ""solve"" the problems it debates throughout its duration. With a rather easy and anticlimactic resolution, there is the feeling that the film's solution to all the issues it addresses is to keep everything as it was before.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"If you're looking for a recent film, get this.","I don't understand how the ending of this film generated such an unpopular vote. This movie was fantastic. It's hard to compared this film because it involves so much. So for a non-spoiling synopsis: A man and his family are attacked at his house. With the father being left with a ravaged and murdered family, full knowing who the perpetrators are he is left with the leaky American Justice system who find the main assailant with a bargain of a maximum of 5 years in prison and the other man who did nothing but watch with the death penalty (which doesn't find him for another 10 years in the judicial system). The father (Gerard Butler) is left with no real conclusion or relief from the murderers and so for the next 10 years he plans.The movie unfolds with Butler as a vigilante to then a very intelligent and thought out murderer. Much like SEVEN's Spacey. But without all the religious influence. Just pure vengeance. Gerard's bad-assness is much like Liam's TAKEN's character, but much more passive, but with the same end note: Pure vengeance. As the movie goes on you find yourself trying to figure out the end game to all of this, however, if you read the other reviews, the end is a bit lack-luster of what you would want, however it does end semi-realistic.All in all, you have to be a bit dormant in the brain to not fully enjoy this movie and wanting to watch it again to see if you can catch the full ending of the movie.

Satisfying thriller with plenty of badass moments,"To be completely and painfully honest with you, the only reason that I decided to watch this film when it came up in my Netflix suggestions is because I have been a Jamie Foxx fan for a long time, and have also found Gerard Butler's previous movies to be entertaining. I figured that I had nothing to lose by watching this title, and instead was blown away by the premise of this film.The acting is good, the character stories are more developed than some run of the mill action movies and as such I found myself in the conundrum of not knowing whose team I should be on. I sympathized equally with Foxx's and Butler's characters, and found the banter and conversation between them to be well-written and well-acted on their parts.Even my mother (who admittedly hates action/thriller type movies) watched this while glued to the television screen, indicating that the background to these characters stories run deeper than most films, and as such lend to a move enriched movie experience.I would definitely recommend this film if you are a fan of the action-thriller genre. There are enough twists in the plot to keep you happy, and plenty of exciting and suspenseful scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat. Well done overall.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A reliable trajectory next to intelligence,"An angry citizen declares war on the criminal justice system. The film was nominated for Best Director and Best Actor. Broadmeadow Prison and Philadelphia City Hall were used to create an authentic atmosphere.The struggle of a lone hero with the system is a separate genre of cinematography affecting state institutions of power.Gerard Butler's hero directs ""righteous"" anger and rage of a ""biblical scale"" not only at murderers and rapists, but also at surveillance officers, whose function and task is to protect the rights and freedoms of a citizen.The main theme of the film indirectly points to the will of the ruling elite, but is fixated on the brutal path of the ""vigilante"". Having abandoned proto-humanism, the grief-stricken husband and father enters into a discourse with a representative of the executive branch, Jamie Foxx, who is concerned not with observing the rule of law, but with his 96 percent of convictions. For him, human tragedy is just a dry statistic in an ambitious ascent to the heights of vanity.Most of the picture is captivated by events and unexpected turns, and the ""crusade"" against corruption and indifference feels close and understandable. But the intellect of the ""domestic terrorist"" is drowning in merciless revenge; his position is justified, but devoid of the main goal, lowering the curtain of the endless hell of the suffering father.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A good movie if you are looking for action and gore.,"Warning: this review contains spoilers.Plot: Law Abiding Citizen is about Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) as a criminal prosecutor, and Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) as a victim of a horrific crime.It starts with Clyde Sheltons (Gerard Butlers) normal family life being rudely interrupted by the brutal rape of his wife and vicious murder of both his wife and child by two burglars. While Shelton himself, also being stabbed, is laying helplessly on the floor bleeding.Nick Rice (Jame Foxx) is prosecuting the two men who did it. To maintain his prosecution rate, Rice decides to cut a deal with the murderer, without telling Shelton. He lets the real guilty one of the two burglars get less prison time, letting the other one go to death row.10 years later Nick Rice is a family man himself with a wife and child. They are all attending the execution of the same burglar when things start to go wrong. The man being executed is violently shaking and screaming before he dies. Rice finds out that the injection modules are tampered with. He suspects the other burglar did it (the real rapist and murderer), who is now a free man. When he arrives at the suspect's house the murderer is just getting away, thanks to telephone instructions of his victim, Clyde Shelton. Shelton is guiding him out of the hands of the police. Not to help him, but to systematically torture and kill him.Clyde Shelton is arrested but is playing a very clever cat and mouse game with Rice and the police, he sets demands, or other people involved in the case will start to die. When they actually start doing so, Rice does everything in his power to stop Shelton, before it is too late.Review: 5.5 out of 10, I found this movie not very good. Even though the plot is well thought out, the action is not bad, and this movie has real nasty gore scenes. The acting is pretty good and it isn't boring either, I simply found the movie very wrong.While watching this movie I could not help thinking that the creators where set out to confront people with as much torture, murder and violence as possible. They created a grand display of erosion of the US constitution. The movie makes the viewer personificate with the victim of the crimes, Shelton, who initially seems to expose the flaws of the United States Justice Department.When Shelton actually turns in to a murdering terrorist the viewer will feel as if they should never have doubted the US Justice Department. Full fledged police state propaganda follows with random police checkpoints and warrantless searches. The police bending the law is all accepted to keep people safe. Nick Rice turns from criminal prosecutor, to police investigator, to District Attorney in a matter of days.I found the end disturbing where Rice decides to become a murderer, and kill off the imprisoned Shelton himself, to prevent more from dying. It ends when he coldly smiles watching his daughter play the cello after that.I also don't like Jamie Foxx for some reason, so this review may not be entirely objective. Go watch this, if Jamie Foxx and police propaganda do not bother you, and if you like movies that contain rape torture and gore.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

A touch of tim robbins and shawshank redemption in this one, but how different Gerard Butler is in this one from Dear Frankie and another love story thingie I cant remember the name of. first class, give him the Oscar now for best actor, I loved jamie Fox in the Soloist and I liked him in this movie also but Gerard Butler as Claude is absolutely brilliant, you will want to watch this movie from beginning to end, its very climatic though I do agree that the ending is a little on the weak side but the real good guy had to live and poor Clyde had to be out-thought sooner or later. God save the Mayor! Felt a bit sorry for the two criminals at the outset, Darby and Ames, how unlucky to stumble upon the household of such a genius as Clyde Hamilton. this is not my favourite movie but its the best movie for all round things. You cant watch this film and be disappointed, surely not. Chester was a mysterious connection for me, so called boyfriend of the blonde haired assistant. Terrific film, yes it has flaws like the ending but all the best movies do and take the rough with the smooth. Enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Entertaining for what it is,"Sure you have these pseudo-intellectuals who are slamming this movie as the worst thing they ever saw when in reality they are lying. That or they have a very limited list of movies they have seen. Trust me...There are some horrendous stinkers out there and this is not one of them. Is it award winning, no. Saying it is the worst just shows you are a paid lackey to sink the movie so something else rises or just a spoiled child with no real concept of what is good or bad.Sure there are some things there are hard to believe but unless you only watch true documentaries all movies have things that could never happen. There are movies out there that slip in things that they claim are real but it could never happen. This doesn't do that. It tells you an entertaining story about some super genius gone to the dark side. If you discount every movie for that reason then you are skipping a lot.I was expecting a different ending but I will not say the ending is bad. A lesson was being taught by the genius darksider and he accepted the outcome. Was it an attack on the judicial system, sure. Was it something many of us agree with except maybe not to the extent he went to, sure. I think there are far too many prosecutors out there that worry about their win/lose record more than justice. Like was said in the movie, ""You didn't even care, you didn't even try, you could've walked out of that courtroom with your head held high I could've lived with that."" Not everyone would accept the loss and it's a lose/lose either way if it goes wrong. Though I think that if the case was lost in court Clyde would accept the system tried and he would just go after the bad guys and it would be over. But that's doesn't make a movie.Bottom line is, with all reviews you should toss out all the 1's and 10's. They are all either paid or have no real experience with movies or reality. Even the absolute worst movies I have seen I rarely rate a 1 because there is some value to them. If I do rate a 1 it is to show my distaste for a movie that was wasted on wokeness or pushing a political agenda. But those are still rare. If I can get to the end of it it is worth at least a 3. If not then it is a 1.Scan the 1's and you can see they have no clue. Scan the 10s and you will see the same.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Missed Opportunity,"The premise of this movie is a bereaved Husband and Father seeking vengeance for the cold-blooded murder of his wife and young daughter in a burglary gone wrong. His sense of injustice is magnified when arguably the main perpetrator benefits from a plea bargain and is jailed for a bare 3 years. So once again, justice falls short, and Gerard Butler, the ""law abiding citizen"", becomes the determined vigilante looking for revenge. As the plot unfolds, and increasingly complex and unlikely scenarios lead to a climbing body count, our ability to suspend disbelief is stretched to ridiculous lengths. Not content with that, when Butler is finally imprisoned and manages to continue his campaign from within his cell, it all then becomes even more ludicrous... particularly the ending... which I won't go into.

Great Movie,"A thriller about a man whose wife and child are raped and murdered by burglars in front of his eyes. Due to a botched case in the justice system, the primary rapist gets away with a plea deal while the other defendant gets the death penalty. In the real world, plenty of criminals get away with crimes due to terrible justice. Brock Turner is an example of this: Raped an unconcious woman and got off with 3 months in jail because the judge didn't want to ""Ruin his life"" and his dad claimed he shouldn't be punished harshly for ""25 minutes"" of rape. He deserved much more. So I can really see why Shelton is pissed at everyone.Anyway, Shelton, played by Gerard Butler, spends the rest of the movie getting revenge on everyone. Great action movie, lots of violence. Jamie Foxx is the lawyer who doesn't prosecute the case correctly due to his desire to get a 95% conviction rate. The acting is great.

Vigilantism or Madness,"Silly, implausible and entertaining. 'Law Abiding Citizen' is all that. It is helluva entertaining, fast paced and it actually buts your brain to work while watching although it all falls apart in retrospect, but who cares - it was fun. Wasn't it? Some critics complained that the film is unnecessarily violent. I personally don't think that - 'Law Abiding Citizen' pales compared to some other highly praised films (Tarantino). It has it's gory moments but they fit into the films overall tone perfectly. The chemistry between two leads Jamie Foxx (Nick) and Gerard Butler (Clyde) is magnetic while these two are engaged with cat and mouse play where the line between good and evil (wright or wrong) by the end of the film is pretty thin. There are many pleasant surprises and plot twist along the way, and I like how they keep avoid predictability.Add rich supporting cast with stellar character actors and clean directing style by F.

I'm a really big Jamie foxx fan so I really only watched this for him but I do enjoy this type of film. The script was pretty good in my opinion even if the plot wasn't.I'd say the biggest issue with this movie was the absolutely ludicrous plot. It borderline made no sense.

Very earlier on, the character motivated to revenge begins to turn into what resembles a Batman villain without the costume, but with the mannerisms and personality.

Flawed system revealed,"This movie was trying to make a point which it does quite well. At first it appears to be not so different from films which show why people are driven to seek revenge. But it's not so straight forward as one learns when nothing happens for a good period of time.Democracies like the US, the UK and Australia lean too heavily on the side of the individual which then adversely affects the quality of life for the majority and community in general.This is aptly demonstrated in the movie.However much one agrees with the actions of the main character, the fact remains that this is a work of fiction and, in life, people suffer the frustrations of a very flawed justice system.

Perhaps a mis-guided belief in the hollow lie that is the ""war on terror."" In this film, we start out with a fatally flawed legal system and an egregiously maligned citizen, with the potential for writing a fine morality play; but the movie falls flat on its face when the antihero (Jamie Foxx the lawyer) is permitted absolute redemption. Others die around him, his own family remains untouched, he is even promoted to fill a space created by the death of his direct superior, but all he must say for redemption is ""I don't make deals with murderers any more.""

Asks questions that the current justice system sucks,"(2009) Law Abiding Citizen
PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLERDirected by F. Gary Gray who has a small role in the movie as he plays another detective who handles the evidence bag. Passable film about ordinary blue collar man, Clyde Shelton (Gerald Butler), after family is slaughtered before he is being pushed over the edge, as a result of being unsatisfied about America's justice system, provoking him to do serious drastic measures. Plot holes are very apparent throughout which doesn't add up to some of the disastrous results. Some possible influences are the ""Dr. Phibes series"" than ""Death Wish"" and ""Silence of the Lambs""!

A recipe that is messed up on a few crucial points,"It appears that the executives wanted to recreate the success of movies with Hannibal Lector, the calm and all-knowing criminal, who sits behind bars but is in control of the situation. However, if your expectation is to see another Silence of the Lambs, you will be severely disappointed.Law Abiding Citizen is a concept that speaks to the primal feeling of distrust and hatred within some of us towards the big powerful government man. Gerard Butler plays one angry mastermind whom we get to see take his anger out on everybody. You could do much with this concept, but you do need some complexity to tickle the viewer's brain throughout such a film, and you have to be careful not to mess up all the little details. Sadly, this one got messed up.While the story may have a few unpredictable turns, being unpredictable is not a good thing if the twists and turns do not lead to anything satisfying. The makers do not follow through with the evil genious concept. Neither do they go for with a brilliant-detective concept. The movie ends up being somewhere in the middle of nowhere and middling is what this movie is, while the ending ends up being a total letdown.Jamie Foxx is an ambitious Academy Award winning actor, but I'm having trouble separating him from his origins in the Jamie Foxx Show, where I absolutely hated his routine. It is entirely possible that this bias affected my opinion of him in this film, but I did not buy him as a smart district attorney, who never lost a case.The talking doesn't make things any better. Most of the dialogue between the two main characters, the district attorney and the angry Butler, could be taken away and it would make no difference whatsoever. The two are talking intensely, and you may for a while think that you do not understand whose point is more just and what that point even is, but do not worry, it's not you, it's the movie. If you don't understand it, it's because there is no clear point, moral or other - just English words said in a thrilled tone and then repeated at the next encounter between our two leads.This is why, although the acting presented is ok, the characters seem a little dead, and they make the story a little dead, which in turn makes the movie a little dead. I remember Hannibal Lector, I remember Norman Bates, but I already forgot the name of the antagonist from this movie.If the characters aren't particularly interesting, then you tend to look for something else. So, what else is there? This is a thriller with not many special effects, so the action is not the centre piece. The thrills kind of work, even if due to the viewer's confusion more than anything else. A curious result of the shallow main characters is that the rest of the cast gets more spotlight, which they take gracefully.Law Abiding Citizen is not terrible - it's bi-curious. It doesn't quite know what it wants to be. In a way, the fact that you don't know where it's going, combined with a healthy dose of violence, keeps you on the edge of your seat for a while, as you're waiting for an interesting payoff. However, the satisfying release never comes - the pretty silver bowl is empty.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best Movie I Have Seen In Years,"This was by far the best movie I have seen in years (although it's no Killer Klowns). The title doesn't exactly scream ""watch me!"", but it was a phenomenal movie.

It is a tense and gritty thriller that I highly recommend everyone watch.For all the parents: if you are OK with a bit of gore and the overall theme of a vigilante trying to exact his revenge on those deserving of it (IE the justice system), then this movie will be OK. The tense parts are very well done in that they are very tense, and you wonder how far it will take it, but it will cut out at the appropriate time. No sex or suggestive themes.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"I do not stand up for the substandard characters and the ludicrous premise, but I did enjoy the movie on the fact that I could not predict what was going to happen next","Perhaps a movie as needlessly violent, preposterously staged, and nonsensically ludicrous as ""Law Abiding Citizen"" deserves the negative publicity that it has already received. Yet I did find some mild movie pleasure while experiencing it. No, I do not stand up for the overly vulgar screenplay, the substandard characters, the unbelievably harebrained plot, and the eye-rolling banal clichés that I spotted here and there, but due to the fact that I could rarely predict what was going to happen next, it kept me mildly interested despite its rational complications and I give the movie a marginal note of recommendation.""Law Abiding Citizen"" stars Jamie Foxx as a Philadelphia district attorney who finds himself the central point of a series of brutal killings when a deranged vigilante (Gerard Butler) takes out his anger on his family's recently-released killers and then upon the entire city. Foxx captures Butler and imprisons him, yet chaos ensues and it becomes a race against time to discover what accomplices, if any Butler has on the outside, and to stop him before it's too late.In a basic plot description, ""Law Abiding Citizen"" sounds like the standard vigilante movie and in a way, I guess you could say it is. It's just as harebrained and lopsidedly silly as the many I've seen recently. But on the other hand, I guess you could say it's not on the same level. It's a step above because again, it's nearly impossible to tell what's going to happen next. The tone, spirit, and style of ""Law Abiding Citizen"" reminded me of another, much better gloomy vigilante thriller, ""Se7en"" from 1995. As Gerard Butler's character shocks the other characters with his scene-chewing performance, we too sit and wait for what he's got under his sleeves next.But the problem that costs ""Law Abiding Citizen"" its potential status as a truly great thriller is the fact that it does not have a feeling of connection or personality or conflict between or in any of the characters. I like Jamie Foxx and I think he pulled off an on-par performance, but he was just playing the same old, stand-up-for-the-right-thing flawed protagonist that I've seen a thousand times over. I've seen enough of the man who spends all of his time at work and not enough at hope with his wife and children and then ponders over that as he risks his life doing his duty. Gerard Butler, too, I like him and his performance, but he doesn't have any fresh or startling personality as a villain. His character's personality is also the same old vigilante we've seen before. His actions aren't, but his manner is. While his schemes did surprise me, the way they were alerted to me by the character did not. Whereas say the actions of Hannibal Lecter from ""The Silence of the Lambs"" are along a similar line, but they dropped my jaw and sunk with more impact because of the development and the fleshed-out personality of the villain who was carrying them out. After all, every big moments needs a good lead. In addition, Foxx does not have any real connection to his wife or friends and fellow investigators, they just stand around and serve more or less as props. Mostly, the scenes between characters are just time-fillers. A minor complaint I also have concerns the screenplay, which is packed with vulgarity. Now, I have no problem with foul language in thrillers, for it has become rather formula in Hollywood now, but when it's thrown again and again where intelligent, thought-provoking dialogue could have been placed, it runs a few scenes down.I have been rubbing the flaws of ""Law Abiding Citizen"" into its face pretty hard during my review. But again, although these flaws as marring and do cost the movie a lot, I did enjoy it, but not because of the characters or the screenplay or the story—the three elements in a movie that matter the most. Simply because I could not predict (most of the time) what would happen in the next scene, I enjoyed it. But it could have been so much more.And one footnote, I personally am getting a little bit tired of the action movie cliché where a character sets of a timed explosive, walks away from it, the bomb goes off, and the character doesn't even flicker an eyelash as flames and debris fly around him.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Refreshingly chilling sans gross-outs,"This grisly tale is full of suspense. It does not pander to the current gross-out lust that permeates many recent thrillers. The story is intense and the sadistic violence is worthy of Hannibal Lector, but most of the ugliness takes place off-camera. Be advised: This is a profoundly intense movie! It will give you the creeps but, unlike many recent gore-fests, it is not a film you will wish you could un-see. It is, rather, a movie that invites multiple viewings. Anthony Hopkins move over! Gerard Butler is quite adept at playing the charming genius monster! That sums it up, but since IMDb requires 1000 words I will press on. Jamie Foxx is unremarkable in his role as assistant district attorney, but his performance is adequate. Gerard Butler upstages the rest of the cast.

Lesson of Ethics,"What can you learn from this movie?There is two types of ethics, what you can follow. But only one at the same time. as Max Weber says, the ethic of conviction and the ethic of responsibility.The ethic of conviction means, that you, for example, never lie. What you feels, is correct and good. The ethic of responsibility means, that, each of your action is being rationally computed caring about all the consequences. See more in Dostoievskij's Karamazov Brothers the conversation of reborn Jesus (conviction) against the Great Inquisitor (responsibility).The beginning of the movie, Shelton is the man, who is forced to be the man of conviction. I feel sorry for him and understand his behavior. Nick Rice, the working class hero of the system seems like a guy of responsibility.After 10 years we realize that Nick Rice is forced to be a man of conviction and Shelton turned out to be the perfect responsibility-thinking criminal, a real genius. He spent the last 10 years planning to create a diabolic burning hell to all of his enemies, Rice at the first place.Shelton exchange his ethic to Rice's.

Great Movie!,"This was a very good movie. The way the movie panned out about who is the good or bad guy completely goes against what you thought.

A great thriller!,"Law Abiding Citizen is great, there's no denying that. The story is well thought of and brilliantly written and leaves you gripped, watching the battle of wits between Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx was brilliant. The acting was spot on, Gerard Butler played the vengeful Clyde fantastically and Jamie Foxx as Nick was great as well. You could really feel the emotion from Clyde who wasn't only tormented but was extremely clever and didn't stop at anything to get the results he wanted. The characters were brilliantly written, the direction was done well and the action scenes were okay but I felt the ending was rushed and lacked in timing and pace, which let the movie down in my opinion. Another thing that let the movie down a little was the amount of blood and violence, I think it could have been toned down a little since the storyline was very good anyway and had you thinking.I was kind of expecting your usual revenge/thriller movie, which has been done many times before, but Law Abiding Citizen manages to make it its own movie with an intelligent story and very smart characters. I really liked how you were set up to root for the 'villain' and not the 'hero'.

"Great Film, Ending is a downside","The Film starts out our Main Character CLYDE SHELTON is working on a new invention, we get a decent close-up of a necklace his daughter made him, which he wears as a bracelet(this symbolizes his humanity) when getting the door he and his wife and daughter are attacked, his wife raped and stabbed, he stabbed bound, helpless, his daughter is taken to a back room, were all we know is that she is killed, we jump to the trail where Jamie Fox's Character Nick Rice, assistant D.A. for Philadelphia breaks the news to Clyde that he's made a deal to get one of the two men on death row, and the other, pretty much Scot free, Clyde doesn't like that, and tries to reason with nick to go the other way and take it to trial, Nick refuses.Ten Years later, one of the men who killed Clyde's family is killed in a painful manor, aside from the painless execution he was supposed to be given by state law, they find a lead which leads them to the other man, his name is DARBY, who via Clyde escapes, unknowing to him Clyde is pulling all the strings.From this point in the movie if you haven't already guessed this is by far the most entertain and most creatively ingenious movie of the year, Pitting Clyde, an EX-BRAIN(which are better killers than spies.), puts his wit and his creativity to the dedication of destroying and re fixing the justice system to put it on a tighter leash, his initial goal is to get Nick Rice to learn consequences for his actions and to be a more severe District Attorney, Clyde admits at one point that this whole thing could've been avoided had Nick taken the case to trial win or lose, but this fails, Nick refuses to see any guilt until it is needed via the death of 6 other Assistant D.A. one whom he has a bonded relationship with as a Mentor and Teacher, who continuously questions her motive for choosing law.This film pulls no punches, and as said before is a masterpiece of intellect the likes that haven't been seen all year, or even most of last year aside from the epic DARK KNIGHT, this movie in any case a win, never slowing down and makes you feel what it wants you to feel, as an example, there are a few scenes where Nicks daughter is playing at a recital and even though you know this movie is going to be crazy, you can't help but feel a warm heart, as well when Clyde Kills a certain Character with a sniper rifle you feel nothing short of an Adrenaline rush from the sheer shock and timing of this event.All in all the only downside is the way the film ends, it particularly didn't sit right with me, but that's what keeps it away from perfection, This movie is pretty damn good, it get's all your detective senses working to find how Clyde is doing all of this or if he has someone working with him and who? 4.5/5 9.5./10 stars, i recommend it if you enjoy a good intellectual action movie",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Don't believe the naysayers,"To those who may think (and quite rightfully so) that the vendetta/ vigilante genre has been seen, done, that the t-shirt has been purchased and then thrown away: Law Abiding Citizen is still worth your while.Though Gerard Butler appears so far to have taken on quite generic roles that don't really demand exceptional skills even if he does perform well in them (Dear Frankie, The Phantom of the Opera (a good voice was required here, and the Butler delivered), 300, and the like) he gives himself a slightly edgier challenge with Law Abiding Citizen.Here he must be Clyde Shelton, someone that to all appearances is just a ""regular guy"" as he informs the judge at one point: an engineer/ tinkerer who holds a number of patents for some inventions. A man who loves his family - the love for his daughter is evident at the beginning, and will remain throughout.Yet there is more to Shelton. This is where Law-Abiding Citizen sets itself apart from the recent Kevin Bacon, Jodie Foster (in my opinion abortive), et alii attempts.The whole idea of the individual man taking on the regulation of justice, of what is good and wrong, of giving himself the power to dish out fatal punishment is thrown out of the window in this film. There is no room for doubt; even in the first instances of Shelton's revenge his reasoning cannot support the methods he employs and the ends he achieves, even if his overarching intelligence is astonishing. Nevertheless Butler still manages to garner our sympathy during the initial stages of the movie.The script, acting, soundtrack, pace - everything is well selected and executed in Law-Abiding Citizen. Jamie Foxx, though it appears he was initially cast as Shelton, still pulled the egocentric lawyer through successfully.Butler as Shelton is quite impressive. As we slowly gain more insight into his mind his undeniable insanity unfolds smoothly and eerily. It is the depth of his character that keeps the movie going. Bruce MgGill as the elder lawyer Cantrel advising Nick Rice (Foxx) is worthy of note, and Colm Meaney could have been put to more use as he is a superb actor. Finally, Leslie Bibb put on a surprisingly good performance.If you enjoy thrillers with hard-hitting action added in the mix, this picture is for you. 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The line between morality and sin are arguably crossed, as justice is brutally carried forth by the hands of a grieving anti-hero, and by the film's end, the audience finds themselves wondering if their judgement of character is misplaced, or if they allow emotions to drive themselves to side with the true villain of the movie?It's well made, well executed, and quite a thrilling ride.

"A gripping thriller, Despite the ending","I've seen Law Abiding Citizen a few times now and despite feeling that film would be poorer on the second viewing it was not the case. For me it's an intense thriller experience which explores the two main characters (Played by Butler and Foxx) in great depth. Many people seem to complain about how they were expecting more violence, but the style of the film is to emphasise the importance of the scenes of violence in terms of the deep human emotions of the lead character, without making an hour and thirty minutes of grotesque torture.You sympathise with Butler's character and accept the motives behind his actions; the main themes are morality and the justice system which in my opinion is the enemy in this film. The film does frustrate as the ending is a little 'Hollywood' and unrealistic which detaches itself from the gritty realism of the rest of the movie. It is also very hard to agree on who is the real hero in the film at first we are supposed to back 'Clyde' a man who has everything taken from him but as the story goes on we are supposed to take a more liberal view by backing 'Nick Rice' and the authority figures.The film is very good at exposing visible flaws with the justice system and taps into the misconceptions of morality. Overall it's a fairly clever, well paced gripping thriller slightly let down with the clichéd ending.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A well behaved miscast citizen and hole filled film.,We just watched this movie and really thought the thing was a load of far fetched Hollywood tripe. Its always disappointing when a poorly scripted story begins to show holes and continues to become a far fetched fantasy that our 3 year old wouldn't buy. We thought the introduction was a little messy and the story just got worse as it went on... I don't really think it deserves a 2 so I am going to change that to a 1. I'm starting to think Jamie Foxx might be better off sticking to music and the other main character better in a remake of Braveheart with Mel Gibson as the village elder and Tom Cruise as the loner who comes in to assist when the s*it hits the fan... and everyone lives happily ever after.

Well, if you have money and technical know how, you get even and set out to prove a point. I know if anything ever happened to my family, I would feel the same way the father did in this movie. This movie points out the flaws in our justice system and one mans way to point them out. This movie reflects how easily a plea bargain happens without the consent of the victim and how he can make his dissatisfaction known. His techniques are brilliant, but a bit psychotic. This movie also shows us what can be accomplished through modern technology. I'm sure the actions taken in this movie are unrealistic but with the right brain and money, who knows?

Inspiring,"Any film which inspires a person to do the right thing or to try to make amends for an injustice, is a beautiful thing! People love, and some people even *need* a strong vengeance tale. Law abiding citizen is certainly a fine one.I even referred to it in My real life when I was dealing with a detective who had failed to pursue appropriately (or at least notify Me of pursuit of) a person who attacked and hurt Me even though they had an admission and all the relevant information to do so.I believe that when the justice system fails, it becomes conscientious citizens responsibility to pursue justice instead. Too many persons guilty of terrible crimes against other people are walking free because of an ineffective judicial system full of irrational technicalities and irrelevant loopholes.So when justice isn't served by the system, the responsibility falls upon the people. Justice is ""an eye for an eye"" whenever such is possible and reasonable. But it must not ever involve harming an innocent party.In Law Abiding Citizen, these ""rules"" are pretty well adhered to, though there is a sense of impending harm that looms over certain innocent parties though. I believe the film ought to be viewed by those studying sociology and psychology to trigger discussions on the subject, because it is very real.The pursuit of justice is performed by an incredibly resourceful genius who has long planned every move before it happens. Nothing performed by our vigilante is random, every move has been plotted precisely. And the perpetrator is clear, though there's no clear explanation as to how it occurs while a man is in intensive prison lock-down. There's an exceedingly interesting, touching and creative script. The audience as perplexed as law enforcement is, in solving ""how does he do it? How was that even possible?""Acting is great, as are the sets, dialogue, sound and effects.I was a bit upset about the ending, but found that it was the only decent solution possible to the plot at hand. I highly recommend this film! It is a very satisfying movie that will capture your attention!Appropriate for individual viewers, couples, families with their children a subjectively mature 14 yr's or older, and for small gatherings of friends.Foul language is kept to a minimum, there are brief moments of implied drug use, brief innuendo of rape, and a quick shot of a nearly nude woman resting.

A Nutshell Review: Law Abiding Citizen,"Law Abiding Citizen is one of those thrillers that has a great premise and idea, but bogged down by so many plot loopholes that it becomes an effortless comedy. What was supposedly an excellent run riddled with implausibilities became even more ridiculous in the final 10 minutes that you'd wonder if anyone had any inkling of a logical conclusion, or had decided to cop it all out to avoid being branded as anti-establishment, and as a result, just plain ordinary lacking the guts to just stick with its plan to the end.Jamie Foxx stars as hotshot (assistant) district attorney Nick Rice, who boasts an extremely high conviction rate, a fact that he repeats many times, and we learn his dirty little secret was to make deals with the guilty - charge them for less, but they still get charged anyway. A conviction is better than no conviction at all should he lose the case. Too bad his latest case was, in my opinion an open and shut one, and he steps on the shoes of the victim, Clyde Sheldon (Gerard Butler), making a deal with the murderers of his family such that one gets sentenced to death while the other gets a short jail term. Not very ethical, but he gets to chalk up his positive statistics.The perversion of the justice system gets highlighted, since justice is blind and the law can be manipulated with flip-flopping highly paid lawyers and incompetent judges. So Clyde decides to take on the system and teach them all a lesson. Which is a walk in the park because he's a clandestine strategist, but who had misguided faith in the system which explains why he sits around and does nothing, until 10 years later, which is acceptable according to an old Chinese proverb, to exact some form of revenge, making this like a torture porn outing, but without much of the gore on display.I'd appreciate the film for its take on vigilantism when the system fails you through its corruption and incompetence, and just how much the limit actually is in order to push a man over the edge to declare war on just everybody, and pissing on the system while at it. Turning the system's tools and procedures over its head and onto the same organization may seem like guilty fun, but when the payback gets a wee bit sophisticated each time, you'd start to wonder on the plausibility of it all, even though it was established that Clyde Shelton is a man who can kill you softly while looking directly at you.The film boils down to which side will you be on, and who would you root for. There's this shade of gray in both men, one willing to make deals with murderers to keep up his personal record, the other taking the law into his own hands, only to not want to stop when the going gets good, but being more ambitious in wanting to take down the whole system. From his prison cell no less. Although Clyde has a valuable lesson to impart to Nick in that what's important is doing the right thing, it did go a tad overboard in order to amplify its idea, especially with sweeping statements like how the entire city got gripped by the apparent acts of terrorism.Gerard Butlner plays his character crazed since he's a man with absolutely nothing to lose, though it's quite unbelievable that for someone who's well versed in clandestine operations to be ambushed like you see in the trailers, without so much of a counter-strategy in place. But between the two leads Jamie Foxx seemed a little uncomfortable as he can't really portray that degree of arrogance required, and given the emotional distance from his family director F. Gary Gray failed to allow you to feel Nick's fear when his own family got threatened by Clyde.But the real stinker was the insult to the audience's intelligence in the final moments which tried way too hard to be clever in introducing an impossible twist which has to involve time travel. It's quite the slap in the face telling you that Fate will shine its light on the powers that be, or on any one else bent on seeking justice, but one must know when to stop before going too far and lady luck begins to turn her attention away. Recommended for the build up, but not its unsatisfying, gutless ending.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
