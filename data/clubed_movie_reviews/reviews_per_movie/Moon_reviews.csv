A great Sci-Fi movie,"The Moon has always been a source of wonder and mystery. It is so far away, yet much closer than the stars. Man has reached the Moon, but there is still so much that is unknown about it. It is a bridge between mystery and fact, and director Duncan Jones uses it as a brilliant setting for his science fiction film Moon.The movie stars Sam Rockwell as a lunar astronaut also named Sam stationed alone on the Moon for three years. He isn't entirely alone, because the AI computer GERTY (Kevin Spacey) is constantly following him. Energy companies have discovered vast amounts of Helium on the Moon, and they now mine that Helium in order to power the Earth. As Sam begins his last two weeks stationed in the mining facility, his mind begins to break down and he soon realizes he just might not be able to make it back.It is quite obvious that the main intention of Moon was to pay respect to the older science fiction movies like Alien and 2001: A Space Odyssey, and it is a great homage to the genre indeed. GERTY is possibly one of my favorite AI computers ever in a movie, because it constantly shows its mood through a series of different smiley faces, and has Kevin Spacey's voice. The overall story of Moon is pretty good, and it definitely tugs a bit on your emotions because the main character Sam is so real and relatable. It is a bit more of an art film, but I have found that the mixture of art and Sci-Fi is a brilliant combination.The absolute key ingredient to making Moon was finding a capable actor because it is essentially a one man show, and they picked a winner with Sam Rockwell. Rockwell gives one of his best performances to date, and while it might be a little early to predict I can see him getting an Oscar nomination for his role. The other great thing about this picture is the special effects. Since the budget was so low this could have been a disaster, but the shots of the Moon Rovers and Harvesters were astonishingly realistic, and a typical movie goer would think this had at least a 40 million dollar budget. It is amazing how much more was accomplished with this tiny budget compared to the $200 million dollars poured into Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.Overall Moon is a complete film. It isn't groundbreaking, but it accomplished everything it set out to be, which are a great homage and a chance for Sam Rockwell to really show his acting prowess. I found myself leaving the theater with a great feeling of satisfaction that I have only received from a couple movies this year so far.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
half way between solaris and space-odyssey,"I was led to this movie, partly because of a sort of dissatisfaction from what we've known as science fiction due to Star-Treks, Star wars, terminators and transformers. On my visit to the local independent movie theater, I was only expecting something like Apollo 13 and I would've been satisfied with just that.But the movie proved to be much more. It wasn't just the cinematography, few captivating shots of the moon surface, or the great acting performance. It was as if the movie took a while to ponder over philosophical questions that science and technology raise- something that every science fiction ought to do.This work won't be unworthy of a comparison with Kubrick's- space odyssey – only that it is probably not as visually stimulating as the latter. It does make good use of classical music like Kubrick's. I found the movie to be a bit more accessible than Tarkovsky's Solaris in that it is much more fluid and entertaining (Solaris was 3 hr long – executed very slow albeit with a similar idea). Like Solaris, the protagonist's recollections of the life on earth eventually result in some mental instability, but the movie stays away from getting into long philosophical debates on human experience or our place on earth.In general, do expect a lot more than space travel in this movie. To cite an example, the isolation of Sam made him more attached to memories of his life on earth. I don't recall many other movies that have expressed it so well that in isolation, nothing really means anything. Kudos to the director! Such existentialist reflections aside, there are many instances when the movie makes a statement about unethical corporate practices, evasive HR responses - almost to the extent 'Michael Clayton' did. I think that makes it more worthwhile to watch. Still despite all that, it avoids taking any stances on controversies that bother all of us in modern times. It puts us through the fears of the unknown, catastrophes of distrust and what arises from distrust and isolation and all of that.Still, somehow the movie isn't really as dark as the script might make it sound. There is isolation, mistrust, schemes, confusion, curiosities and despair, but the human experience probably transcends the realism of its existence – that was the idea I carried back from the movie theater.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A worthwhile one-man show,"Originally posted to titsandgore.com, April 2009:Moon is an auspicious debut from Duncan Jones (née Zowie Bowie), a talented new director who happens to be the son of David Bowie (let me officially be the first person to predict that every review of this film in the mainstream press will have the tagline ""SPACE ODDITY!""). Sam Rockwell gives a truly remarkable performance as Sam Bell, a lunar miner who is nearing the end of his 3-year contract at a single-man mining outpost. His only companion is the station computer, Gertie, a straight-up HAL homage that tantalizingly suggests how a culture informed by decades of watching 2001 might choose to design a companion robot.To say too much more about the plot would be to spoil its central conceit, and while I'm sure many reviewers will talk openly about it, I want to preserve the surprise if at all possible at least until the film gets its theatrical release this coming June.Suffice it to say that Jones admirably mixes together stock genre tropes, paying tribute to a number of classic science fiction features while retaining his own idiosyncratically dark vision. Familiar filmic concepts of the ""clean future"" and the ""dirty future"" are mixed together to create a unique atmosphere; the milieu is suitably claustrophobic, the cramped quarters of the mining station serving the film's conceptual purposes while masking the shoestring budget. In fact, it may be hard to spare a glance at the meticulously designed sets with your eyes glued to Rockwell for the duration of the picture. His performance is utterly mesmerizing, inhabiting the role so completely that it is impossible to imagine any other actor having the chutzpah to pull it off.Which is not to say that Moon is without its problems; the pacing is hardly consistent and Jones' reliance on Rockwell tends to undersell his direction. Parts of the film veer dangerously close to identical thematic elements in Steven Soderbergh's recent adaptation of Solaris, without being as emotionally potent. But what it lacks in originality is mostly compensated for by the sheer audacity of its central performance and the careful economy of its direction.Moon may be dressed in familiar clothing, but it is a singular experience, a clever, darkly funny and genuinely moving journey into the nature of individuality. Jones is already at work on a second science fiction feature, and it is welcome indeed to see such a promising new talent continue to develop his voice by working in genre film-making!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Small in scope, Grandiose in concept","While book racks are brimming with thought provoking, high concept science fiction, the movie genre tends to be populated by invading aliens, intergalactic wars, and adventure, which makes Director and co-writer Duncan Jones' Moon that much more of an oddity.Not since Steven Soderbergh's much overlooked 2002 rendition of Stanislaw Lem's Solaris has a movie firmly rooted in the sci-fi realm delivered reflections on the human condition, which Moon does deftly.It tells the story of Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), the only inhabitant of an automated lunar mining base extracting Helium-3 from lunar rocks to be shipped back to Earth to fuel the energy starved planet.Sam's isolated three year posting is about to come to an end and he longs to return to Earth to see his wife. His only company throughout this sojourn has been that of Gerty, the base's HAL-like robot voiced by Kevin Spacey. Unfortunately, the final weeks and days are proving to be the most difficult, and Sam finds himself going a bit squirrelly, leaving both he and the audience to wonder if what's unfolding is actually happening, or merely a drama taking place in his addled mind.That's about as much plot detail as I'm going to deliver, for to delve any deeper into the story would give too much away. Be prepared, however, for a thought provoking narrative that touches on issues such as scientific ethics, corporate greed, human identity, and compassion.There are no aliens, lasers/phasers, wormholes, warp engines or jump drives here, just a lonely space age concierge, an unflappable monotone robot, and a whole lot of fodder for your brain to chow down on.This is what science fiction was meant to be.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fantastic...,"In short, this is one of the best sci-fi movies I have seen in a LONG time. Sam Rockwell plays it perfect, making the viewer feel his isolation and lonelieness. For a low budget film, the few effect shots work seamlessly. I'm trying to remain spoiler free, so I won't bother to explain the plot. If you like older and more story/character driven sci-fi, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, than chances are you will love this movie. If you aren't a huge fan of sci-fi, take a chance with this one. You may find it a very rewarding experience. I loved this movie, and I can't stop thinking about it. In Moon, you may begin to think that everything is a big cliché, but than with all of the seemingly cliché plot points, Moon changes them into something entirely original and unexpected. It is an excellent piece of art and I have a strong feeling not enough people will see and appreciate it like I did.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Utterly Fantastic and Inspired,"Go see this movie! I've been lucky enough to have an opportunity to see this movie down here at SXSW and I am the better for it.You don't really stumble upon many riveting, independent, sci-fi films that look beautiful(let alone don't contain aliens and space magic) and capture major emotional themes successfully. Moon accomplishes this, and with very little CGI at that.Sam Bell is an astronaut working for a corporation on the far side of the moon. His job? Maintaining a lunar facility and the automated machines which are harvesting the moon's surface for Helium 3. The harvested material is then sent back to Earth to use as energy.Sam is on the very last leg of a three year contract and is quite anxious to return to his wife and daughter. Barring any incidents, Sam will be able to leave his solitude. But something does go wrong.That said, tremendous acting by Sam Rockwell carries this film - mainly because he is basically the only person in the movie. I'm not talking about Cast Away meets the moon This film explores loneliness much deeper than that, and with much more emotion as well. Luckily for us there are no pieces of sports equipment on which the lead dotes, but instead we're blessed with a monotonous talking robot(voiced by Kevin Spacey) reminiscent of Hal from 2001 notoriety.I advise that people go see this film, not only to support Duncan, the director, and Sam, but also to explore to possibilities of space and the humanity of loneliness.Don't go in expecting to find what I have discussed, but go in expecting to find something inside yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Classic sci-fi driven by a Sam Rockwell tour-de-force,"I attended a screening of ""Moon"" at the 2009 SXSW Film Festival in the  legendary Paramount Theatre. There wasn't an empty seat in the  1300-capacity palace. Directed by Duncan Jones, ""Moon"" stars Sam  Rockwell, one of our generation's most powerful actors.  The notion of a film being unique seems unlikely in 2009. Not here.  While ""Moon"" is a modern-day science fiction film set in the future, it  pays homage to recent classics like ""Blade Runner"" and ""Alien."" Viewers  will be dazzled -- fans of the genre will nod in approval.  Science has developed a way to mine the rocks of the moon for clean  energy here on earth. Private enterprise, in the form of a corporation, sends astronauts on a three-year work stint to carry out  this ongoing mission. Sam Bell (Rockwell) is the latest to undertake  this task, with the trusted robot GERTY by his side watching over the  base's operations -- think HAL with a heart. Of course, things are not  what they seem, and the viewer is mesmerized as puzzling and surprising  events unfold.  Cinematographer Gary Shaw contributes to the impression of the eerie  stillness of life on the moon with the copious use of still camera and  slow tracking shots, only using hand-held when necessary. Nicolas  Gaster's editing is sure and steady, emphasizing the slow pace of Sam  Bell's multi-year work assignment. Remember those pre-CGI days when  special effects meant miniature land rovers on a bumpy table? It can  still be done -- and be believable. ""Moon"" is evocative of the sci-fi  greats whose visuals were done in-camera, i.e., on set as opposed to  being created by computers in post-production. Sam Bell's unearthly  home is comfortable yet aging like the patina of an old cottage.  Nathan Parker's screenplay (Jones wrote the story but handed over  screen writing duties to Parker) makes the most of Sam Rockwell's  considerable talents. This was quite a physically demanding role, as  well, and rarely has the actor been better (watch ""Snow Angels,""  though). He doesn't just carry the film -- ""Moon"" is almost a one-man  show and Rockwell conducts a master class.  ""Moon"" is a classic, down and dirty (literally) science fiction film  with a baffling mystery that challenges the viewer to live in the shoes  of the protagonist. It's hard to imagine a better one than Sam Rockwell  or a more effective, entertaining, and satisfying cinematic experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nothing short of astounding,"This was the best movie I have seen in a very in a very long time and immediately jumps into my favorite movies ever. MOON puts a relatable human touch on an intriguing and deep sci-fi story that, while it originally appears to be taking the path of 2001 Space Odyssey, is a unique adventure. Sam Rockwell puts on a spellbinding performance and Kevin Spacey's GERTY voice-over is eery and excellent. I have never seen a movie that had me so engrossed and intrigued from beginning to end. Some may say the film starts slowly but I found the first half hour to be an important and gripping portrayal of what it would mean to be alone in space, without which the movie would not be as effective. I don't want to ruin the plot so I wont go into further detail. As an avid movie watcher who is not a sci-fi buff I would recommend this movie to anybody who wants to see a movie that will take over their lives for 2 hours and have you leave the theater wanting to do nothing but discuss how beautifully layered it was.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent low-budget sci-fi drama with an amazing cast! ;),"Okay, here's the basic plot (without the twist-spoiler):Place: The moon. Time: A future not long from now (2030-ish I think). Sam Bell, astronaut, is working on a lunar base of some sort. He is the only person on the entire base, only assisted by an all-knowing robot called GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey). He has been stationed on the base for almost 3 years, his contract nearing an end, and with his flight back to earth scheduled only 14 days away, he can't wait to get back home to see his wife and daughter again. However, suddenly one of the automated moon-vehicles (harvesting rock-samples or whatever) goes awry, and he goes outside of the base to investigate it... but then something unexpected happens, and he has to change his perspective on everything.End of basic plot summary.Bell is played by the brilliant Sam Rockwell, whom you probably know from ""Charlie's Angels"", ""The Green Mile"", ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"", ""Matchstick Men"" or the equally brilliant sci-fi movies ""Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" and ""Galaxy Quest"". This is probably his biggest part in a movie EVER, and I doubt if he will ever get a role as big as this again (not because he's not capable or worthy of it, but because it was a HUGE performance). If you're a fan of Rockwell (or perhaps of Kevin Spacey's voice), then you will not be disappointed, as they're both great in ""Moon"".For sci-fi lovers, this movie is really a blast. It takes some inspiration from such classics like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Outland"", ""Silent Running"", ""Alien"", and others, but still manages to be unique and original, something which has become increasingly rare in the recent big-budget/massive special effects/quick fix-tradition of Hollywood nowadays. ""Moon"" achieved something great for a budget of approximately 5 million dollars, which is ridiculously low by regular movie-standards, where a feature film usually would cost ten times that amount.As for the theme of the movie, the subjects of alienation, solitude, dehumanization and disbelief are risen (among others), which often leads to some of the best movies (in my opinion), as is the case here too.All in all, this movie definitely ranks among my personal top-20 all-time sci-fi favorites, and I will presume it will be placed equally high on most sci-fi aficionado's lists. An excellent debut directorial by Duncan Jones, and clearly one of the 5 best sci-fi movies made in the last 10 years. Already looking forward to his next feature film, which allegedly is also going to be a sci-fi movie (although with a much bigger budget).Final rating: 9.5/10 - a nearly flawless movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good idea, had potential, but is too dry and barren to enjoy","I see an idea in Moon, but I don't see a motion picture. This character driven sci-fi/drama which explores being human feels too cold, bland and overlong to work. It takes a while to make its point, and relies on our identification with a character who is portrayed with confused acting. The last time Sam Rockwell was in space was in Galaxy Quest. There he was a scream, here he is a yawn. Moon (I suppose) works in small chunks but the big picture feels dull and not very enriching.Sam Bell, for three years, has been running an energy station on the moon. The energy harvested there supplies an environmentally friendly Earth in the near future. Sam's only companion is the station's computer, Gerty (a more mobile version of HAL 9000, with a smiley face). One day/night, Sam is investigating a wrecked harvesting machine, and inside he discovers a body.... another Sam. What does this mean? Is Sam #1 going crazy from being on the moon for too long? Is Sam #2 a clone? Is Sam #1 a clone? Are there any more bodies out there? and whose side is Gerty gonna take?Moon probably sounded good as a pitch, considering all the questions that come up once you block out the plot. Unfortunately the movie never really comes alive. The ending is the most exiting part, but ten minutes of solidity doesn't necessary warrant a time investment in eighty minutes of ponderous direction. Moon is tricky to recommend.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This is sci-fi that sticks to our own sensibilities,"Lunar Industries is mining an alternate fuel, helium-3, when a massive oil crisis exists on Earth. The station is run by a single man, Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) with the help of Gertie, a Hal-like computer who drags itself around with a chain that has rollers on the ceilings of various compartments of the station.. He has a lilting voice (Kevin Spacey) just like Hal and is completely benevolent helping Sam in any way he can. I would prefer this thing over Hal any old day. Sam runs tests and makes reports, drives a mobile unit to the mines and packs canisters of H3 and sends them back to Earth. But he is nearly done with all this. Sam Bell is getting short, as they say, having only two weeks before going home after a three-year tour of duty. Then things begin to unravel.This is sci-fi that sticks to our own sensibilities. It's futuristic in a most limited sense. There are no extravagant elements, time travel, parallel universes, or monsters that walk through walls. Sam Bell would probably have the same attitudes towards these things that we do. In other words, it takes place in ""real"" life. The interior of the station is clever but there is an admirable restraint. It's like Alien in this way.There are other credits, but Sam Rockwell has 99% of the burden. A wonderful resume item, succeeding as he does not only carrying the film but holding it up like Hercules who has the world on his back. He imbues Sam Bell with an exuberant child-like demeanor that pulled me into the movie. He bobbles around the room to his favorite rock n' roll. But he's not irresponsible or a ne'er do well with his job. He is deadly serious, but wavering with the events of his life in these last two weeks.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Its like it knows what your thinking, but doesn't want to correct you right away","The Sci-Fi department is a very hard market to break. Hence why greatness always seems to come from that genre......because normally when they are made, it usually takes millions of dollars to cover the special effects and what not......so the process of choosing the right script is somewhat limited, but they always leave their mark. However, this one is changing that pace.....in a rhealm of big budget Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica flicks, this movie chooses to take the independent route. By only spending 3 million for its budget, and using old school techniques for its special effects.....can a movie like this thrive in todays market? Well you know how i mentioned that the script selection for a Sci-Fi movie isa very tough market to break......and how the script better be incredible if it is going to make it anywhere........well this movie is just that. This movie was just plain brilliant. For those of you who have no idea what this film is about, allow me to shed some light on the subject.........In the future, our main character Sam Rockwell is living on a one man space station on the moon, whose should purpose it to retrieve and send precious resources from the moon back to the earth.....in this process he becomes very lonely and begins to uncover a horrible truth. The movie is directed and told in such a brilliant fashion......they never try to WOW you with its special effects, which are very moderate but pass with flying colors. Its script and method of storytelling are probably the best part. Instead of answering all of your questions all at once, they sort of draw them out and make you claw and scratch for the truth......but the thing that i like the most is how they approach everything.........they take a route that lets you know that you have seen all the other Sci-Fi classics, and addresses all of your concerns of what may happen or what is going to......and then just carries on like its hidding this secret from you.....almost like the movie knows what your thinking, but chooses not to correct you right away.......brilliantly told and shown in an even better light......and with Clint Mansell directing the musical score(Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain)......my god, how could you not be pulled in. Now the part that i am excited to talk about the most is the acting......because i really have not had anything to rave about so far this year.......but Sam Rockwell is hands down the best actor so far this year. He has already proved himself to me with ""The Green Mile"", ""Frost/Nixon"", and ""Choke""......but he knocked this one out of the park. It was a difficult script to pull off for an actor, and he did it with leaps and bounds.......job well done. I will be very upset if he is not at least nominated this year. Bottom Line.......well, ""Star Trek"" gave you the action/entertainment portion of your Sci-Fi.......whereas this one gives you its underbelly. This is easily one of the best Sci-Fi movies i have seen in a long time, and that is saying a lot coming from me. There was not one thing wrong with this movie......maybe the end was a little sketchy, but it was still not enough to destroy this brilliant film. I urge all of you to go to your local independent movie theatre and watch this movie........you will regret it if you don't.......easily one of the 10 best movies i have seen this year.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
There is so much to admire about this film!,"""Moon"" is an amazingly different film. First, the film is a sci-fi film that is set on the moon. It has exceptionally nice special effects--yet only cost five million dollars to make!! Second, it only stars one guy--Sam Rockwell. Along with the voice of the computer (Kevin Spacey), and BRIEF glimpses at others through memories or over phone calls, this IS the entire cast! Third, and most importantly, the film really kept me guessing throughout and is thoroughly original! The film is the first full-length film of Duncan Jones--the son of David Bowie (Bowie's real name, by the way, is David Jones). While he's only made one film since (""Source Code""), I cannot imagine him not getting many more opportunities because his skills are so evident in ""Moon""--a film he not only directed but he came up with the story as well! This guy is something.The film is set in the near future. To supply the Earth's energy needs, NASA is mining Helium-3 from the Moon. On this moon base is Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell)--a guy who seems to be losing his mind. It's probably because he's been alone for nearly three years. What is obvious is that something is amiss--and he is either hallucinating or there is another version of him on the base as well! Yes, following an accident, he awakens to see another Sam Bell.At this point in the film, I KNEW exactly what was coming next. Well, I was 100% wrong!!! The film really took my by surprise and the dark turn really caught me off guard--and I really, really like that in a movie. However, I don't want to spoil it. See the film yourself and see a wonderful example of a film that is highly original, intelligent and cheaply made! A truly unique film--and one that is available now on Netflix. And, like ""Gravity"", it's a space film with a tiny cast that thoroughly kept my interest.By the way, my only complaint about this film, and it's minor, is that the movie is rated R. You do see Rockwell's butt and I wish that scene was chopped out--not because I am a prude but because a lot of teens won't be able to see the film due to it's rating and some adults might avoid it as well. As a parent, I would certainly let my daughters see the movie--it's really something special.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Valiant Effort, Flawed Story","*Spoiler Alert*What can I say? Based on the high praise that Moon received from critics and fans alike, I had high expectations going in. Sam Rockwell gives a fine performance as the hapless Sam Bell(s), the miniatures- driven special effects are very well executed, and Duncan Jones has definitely done his homework- referencing sci-fi greats like 2001, Outland, Blade Runner, and others. So what's the problem?For starters there's definitely some flawed story logic. I find it very difficult to believe that cost of training and employing new workers for the mining operation would be that prohibitively expensive, especially considering that it only takes one person to staff the base. Overlooking that, if Lunar's goal was to save money by not having to train new workers for their mining operations, why not simply automate the entire process? By the looks of things, the operation was already almost completely automated. GERTY (the computer) seemed like a sufficiently sophisticated AI to oversee the day to day operations and fix problems as they arose, and with an abundant fusion power source they could have had a fleet of redundant ""mining bots"" ready if one of them encountered a catastrophic mechanical failure. In the rare event something did go wrong that required human attention, they could simply send a repair team.In any case, either one of the above scenarios would be much easier and less expensive than: A) Developing human-cloning technology. B) Finding a way to prematurely age the clones to adulthood. C) Finding a way to ""program"" their brains with the memories of a particular individual. D) Creating hundreds (if not more) copies of them and keeping them in cryogenic stasis.This seems like a highly-implausible level of technology for the near future, but assuming that Lunar had cracked the secrets of directly programming the human brain (in all it's incredible complexity), this only bolsters the idea that they could have programmed some type of AI to run the operations, rather than creating an army of human clones. I realize of course that the idea of clones and their ethical treatment is central to the premise of the movie, but I just wish that more thought had gone into making the circumstances more plausible.My other main gripe with this movie is that I feel that many of it's devices seemed derivative. I know that the similarities between the look and portrayal of GERTY to '2001's HAL were a bit of intentional audience misdirection on Jones' part but come on...could he have at least tried to be subtle? The countdown to the arrival of the repair team/assassins was right out of Outland. The concept of artificially- created humans with a built-in short lifespan was right out of Blade Runner. Unchecked capitalism and devalued human lives...countless movies within the sci-fi genre, but most directly lifted from Alien(s) and Outland. I'm not saying that it isn't okay for directors/writers to pay homage to other science fiction films or touch on classic oft-explored themes, but please do so with enough restraint so as to prevent the viewer from engaging in an involuntary game of ""spot the reference"".I really wanted to like this movie, and I hate to disparage it when it's clear that Jones' was making an honest effort at creating the kind of intelligent science fiction so often ignored by Hollywood. Better luck next time.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Like the Moon itself - big, pretty and largely lifeless.","Moon opens with an advertorial that informs us that the moon has been identified as a huge source of energy for Earth, and that ""friendly"" big corporations are doing their best to provide us with reliable pure energy.It seems one of these energy production centres on the far side of the moon is staffed by a lone maintenance guy named Sam Bell, who is at the tail end of a three year contract. His only companionship is a computer called Gerty who is sorta like the mechanical arms from Iron Man, only he has Kevin Spacey's voice.As Sam is all by his lonesome, he fills his time with hobbies, exercising, TV, tending to his garden and waiting for dispatches from employers and his family on Earth, which are delayed as the far side of the moon gets no live signals due to inaccessibility. His only action is when one of the many ""harvesting"" machines is experiencing malfunctions or needs maintenance.On one of these call outs things don't go according to plan, and Sam wakes up afterwards in an infirmary.And this is where sh*t goes pear-shaped.I'm not sure how SPOILER free people want their movies these days but as some key info is about to be outlined. WARNING! HERE BE POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!Sam is quarantined on base by Gerty, but he gets a bit toey and manages to con his way out with a plausible excuse, at which time he goes to investigate the crash site. The evidence from the accident is all around, and indeed there is still someone in the vehicle that requires urgent medical attention.It is Sam.The remainder of the film revolves around the obvious questions and dilemmas that would arise when one unexpectedly co-habits with an exact replica of themselves. - Who is the clone?  - Why is there a clone?  - What is real, and what is imagined, (or implanted)?  - Who has caused all of this and why?So Sam(s) ultimately team up to work out just what the hell is going on, and what is really behind this perceived deception. They search high and low, on base and off for clues and evidence, which of course lead to conflict and disagreement between the Sams, and to them putting in place a daring planI got bored.I didn't care which Sam was real, which wasn't and why. The first plodding hour put paid to that. Other reviews have lauded the technical skills shown in having multiple Sam Rockwells on screen at once, and that is honestly impressive. Also impressive is the on-moon shots that look especially realistic and cool, but the action (if you might call it that, I wouldn't) is so slow that when the plot does advance rapidly near the end I was already out of patience.I have consulted the IMDb boards to make sure I ""got it"" when the movie wrapped up, and I am pretty sure I had most of it right before I went to the internet cheat sheet. That revelation alone was disappointing, as the fact that I did understand what happened and still wasn't blown away was annoying, as I waited 90+ minutes to get to that point.I'll leave it to the individual to decide if the ending gives merit to what came before, and I hope others get more from this film than I did.Ultimately this was a fine acting performance by Sam Rockwell wasted on a lightweight twist that seemed to be only a mild surprise when it finally arrived.Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. I think I am pussing out on this, I want to give a lower score but can't help but feel there must be more than I saw. I won't spend another 100 minutes of my time investigating this though.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Worst 8.0 IMDb rating movie I have seen,"Generally you can go by the IMDb ratings to give you a good feel of how good or bad a movie is,but that is not the case with ""Moon"".

Amazing Throwback Sci-Fi,"There is little that I can do by way of review. There is a minor REVEAL a third of the way through that, though it would not ruin the movie, would ruin some of the cumulative effect of the subtly clever tale.Sam Rockwell plays Sam (for some reason I love it when that happens) who is a one man show on a moon mining base for a Big Energy Company.

GERTY expresses himself with emoticons which are chuckle inducing.The brilliance is that writer/director Duncan Jones (son of rock idol Davey Jones. No, not that Davey Jones, but rather the one that took the stage name of David Bowie {which makes Jones' movie taking place in space... OK, nevermin}) lays delicate red herrings at various points where the viewer is suddenly convinced that it is going to be THAT type of movi... er, no, I mean OK, we saw that in 2001 it... er, no, that's like Solar... hmm.As I mentioned, The Reveal comes pretty early, but this is not a M. Knight movie, so The Reveal is not what drives the film. After The Reveal the movies turns into a quiet and contemplative commentary, maybe, or perhaps an extensional wrapped philosophical study. I'm not sure, actually, which is why the movie stays with you. It allows one to read quite a bit between gratuitously wide-spaced lines, take it at face value, or approach it in the abstract. It is more ambiguous in its purpose than something like 2001 which was purposely extensional and ambiguous, if that makes any sense.I must also add that the movie made me very, very sad. It's hard to explain why for the movie did not have a classic ""sad ending,"" but the effect that it had on me bordered on profound. This is by far my favorite movie in a long while.And lastly, Sam Rockwell was absolutely amazing.The fact that my anticipation was so high for the film and still did not disappoint probably means it is even better than I am claiming. Do yourself a favor though: If it plays near you, go see it.10/10 *****/***** Three Thumbs Up and a Bucket of Popcorn",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fabulous film,"I saw this last night and it was fabulous. It's hard to discuss for fear of giving away any spoilers but I'll try.I thought it a magnificent film and when compared to the bloated, nonsensical 'lets have more pointless explosions' of Transformers 2 it shows that you can still have such thought, style and cleverness in a film for a fraction of the budget.Normally with the independent art-house films they are set on Glaswegian council estates. If remotely sci-fi they are almost forced to have a horror - sex element to help them sell to the teen market.This was so refreshing for demonstrating genuine craft and story telling. A film that even as your mind is racing ahead to predict the typical ABC outcome of film, manages to keep surprising you.There were no silly twists or WTF moments to make up for the writers lack of logic and it offered a subject matter that resonated with you long after.Sam's performance was stellar but it is frustrating that one can't elaborate for fear of giving stuff away. I know the film didn't have a big cinema push, well certainly not in the UK, and was only out to piggy back the anniversary of the lunar landings, but I really hope it gets some more exposure.Sam deserves recognition for his talent as does the writer and director. I've enjoyed some good films this year but that was certainly the freshest, most inventive and well executed one that I've seen so far.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great Hidden Gem!,"Wow! This movie blew me away! I really didn't expect it to be as good as it was. I really enjoyed following the story and seeing how it all played out. I wish it was even longer or they made a part 2! It had a slight Blade Runner or Alien feel to it which the director, Duncan Jones, states. I heard MUTE will have more of this feeling so I'm really looking forward to that film. Now some people state that it was too slow paced. Maybe it's just me, but I found that enjoyable, and helped for the unexpected mysteries which lied within. Sam Rockwell played Sam Bell perfectly too. He deserves a lot of credit for nailing that character. It's like you're just following him on his journey trying to figure out and put the pieces together on what is really going on in his world. And, what a unique and fascinating world it is! I also enjoyed Kevin Spacey as the voice of ""Gerty"". What else can I say without giving it away except watch it!

A good film.,"Moon is about a future where the majority of mans power comes from harvesting the rocks on the moon and tells the tale of Sam Bell who has almost finished his three-year contract working there.The acting is probably the best and most distinct part of this film. Sam Rockwell is practically the only actor in the entire hour and forty minutes and shows so many sides to this Sam Bell its captivating to watch.The film looks the part. Its not revolutionary, its pretty much classic space station. There were some gorgeous shots of the moon though, the monochrome grey and long shadows very effectively created a sense of cold and isolation.The pacing was off. There was no real suspense leading up to the turning point and the way they dealt with the aftermath was predictable and boring.Granted, new ideas are difficult to come by, so there's nothing wrong with re-using some old one - only it's got to be done better. Moon has taken so much from other films but just hasn't added anything new or different or interesting.Moon is a good film but would be much better if you had nothing to compare it to.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Moon,"Moon starts off strong, with some nice visuals and good set design. The VFX/miniatures are all fairly weak and very noticeable, when they go to the exterior the movie immediately feels really cheap. Though the miniatures do hold a certain charm and are arguably very well made, just not convincing enough due to the directing. There's countless examples of how to make miniatures look convincing, this movie isn't one of them.Directing in general is passable, it's kept very straight and simpel though. Story is really good, conceptually, but it really shows they didn't have the means to pull it off perfectly. It feels half baked. With mediocre performances, poor pacing and editing. There's these fade to black transitions that don't work, made it feel like a TV show, a cheap one.Acting, well there's not much to talk about because there's pretty much just one main performance worth talking about and that was from Sam Rockwell. It was exhausting to watch him, his scenes felt so slow, so lacking in emotion. There's so little range that big moments felt really odd. Any big reveal just feels like it got glossed over. And this movie should be a those human emotions and small moments. I know the actor can do better, or maybe this movie just wasn't a good fit/badly directed.Music is noticeably absent but also the main score is noticeable bland, it almost mirrors the movie in it's mediocrity and tempo, it's repetitive and monotonous.The movie didn't provoke interesting thought's in my like some other reviewers mentioned, it's even worse due to the sloppy ending with the cliché news reporters. Felt rushed. This wasn't the type of movie that engaged me enough to care about the moral implications, the ethics..bla bla, it felt like the movie didn't care about that either.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Over the moon with moon!!!,"Well dudes, I saw Moon and I am 'over the moon' with the results! What a fantastic movie! Sam Rockwell's performance is simply amazing, serious. Oscar worthy stuff. Also, considering it is a directorial debut, Duncan Jones (Think that's right) has done an absolutely tremendous job. The cinematography is second to none and the overall feel/atmosphere is the very gritty sort of space/spaceships we so loved to see back in the 80's in flicks such as Alien. This film doesn't lack anywhere except for perhaps the running time. I really would have enjoyed sitting there for a further 30 minutes or so. Heres hoping for a Directors Cut with extra footage!

Moon - A must see film for 2009!,"I have just seen Moon at my local independent cinema after it was mentioned that it won Best New British Feature at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. To be honest I did not read much into the film before I went but must admit I was totally blown away. This is a LOW budget film, I think about £5 million and it is amazing the overall results achieved from such a low budget.I wont reveal much about the story but it is about the life of a loner Astronaut Saml Bell who is towards the end of this three year stint on the Moon. The story is intriguing and grabs your interest from the onset. Sam Rockwell plays an incredible role as Sam Bell within the film and Kevin Spacey as the computer GERTY is perfect.If you have any doubts about seeing this film. Don't.

"Curiouser and curiouser, though this might be familiar territory for sci-fi buffs","Moon (2009)At first this will seem like a poor man's 2001: A Space Odyssey, then with a touch of the American Solaris thrown in. But it's grittier, and has an everyman quality rather than an ethereal one, and so it makes you sympathetic as well as curious.Curiosity is a big part of this kind of movie, where you are on the moon (literally) and don't know quite why, or how it works, or how it is that a single person (Sam Rockwell) could be operating this sprawling operation (one of many implausibilities you just overlook). The HAL-like robot (with the voice of Kevin Spacey, no pun there, I suppose) is made less sinister and cuter, for sure (and dirtier, a nice touch) but his role takes on some nice twists later, so in a way, there are two characters. Or maybe three, or four, depending how you look at it--I'll not give that away.None of this is flawless. If the everyday qualities make you comfortable with the lead character, they also make the tension and bizarreness less intense. There are moments when I think we should be just blown away, and yet (maybe because we've seen this in other movies too often) we are just made to perk up a little. The movie is, in fact, interesting, and it's not overlong, and so it does succeed. It just doesn't find the beauty, or sci-fi wonder, or human tragedy, of a great movie, whatever that might be. Maybe some people will discover some ideas about life and identity spelled out here for the first time, and in that case this could be a completely memorable, even meaningful experience. I hope so.Otherwise, it's still a fun, well made, different experience. And Rockwell, in the lead role(s), lets it all hang out. Impressive acting.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Enjoyable light weight lunacy,"I enjoyed watching Moon, finding it to be entertaining enough rather than earth-shatteringly brilliant.Moon plots the story of Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), who is nearing the end of a three year contract working in isolation on a moon station that havests fuel for an eco-friendly earth. Apart from his earth-based memories and memorabilia, his only companion is a talking computer/robot called GERTY who attends to his needs.Does three years in isolation screw up the mind? That's the opening premise of Moon, so when Sam discovers - as revealed in the film's trailer - that he is not alone we are invited to wonder if the second person is real or purely in Sam's imagination. As the film progresses, the dark truth is revealed.A good plot well told, with settings and effects that are just convincing enough rather than outstanding, Moon very much stands on the shoulders of 2001 : A Space Odyssey (and also Solaris) in style, but certainly doesn't match the former for it's originality or brilliance.Much of the enjoyment of this film may centre on your like or dislike for Sam Rockwell's acting - he dominates the film throughout, and there are no other characters save GERTY to have an opinion on.For me, the slightly maverick Sam Bell didn't quite cut it; he seemed like the wrong type of character for that position to begin with, and his reactions to certain reveals appeared too dead beat. If you don't quite warm to Sam, as I didn't, there's not much else too root for. If you find yourself caring for him however, you might well get far more from the film than I did.Finally, a 'hats off' to the film for a dig at corporate greed and deceit - that aspect was very believable indeed.Good, not great.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Starring Sam Rockwell... (and also starring)...,"Sam Rockwell.Sam Rockwell is one of the greatest actors we have right now so i was (obviously) impossibly excited for 'Moon' and I went to see it yesterday. In short, the film was so amazing that after it finished, I didn't want to move... ever again. I was also excited to see the film because of the director (Duncan Jones) and the fact that it was filmed in 33 days on a super-low budget. A low-budget space movie like this should have been near impossible, but Moon looks way more amazing than films with way bigger budgets. Sam Rockwell is impossibly good as 'Sam Bell' and watching him fall apart made me pretty emotional. He plays the character(s) like the roll of a dice, switching from angry and manic one minute to helpless and desperate the next. Moon is part 1960's/70's space movie homage, and this was a total throw back to the 'WTF is happening' sci-fi movies that kinda got lost with the new ways of cinema. The film isn't over-complicated but it throws you into the vast unknown and leaves you with unanswered questions, which is the best way to end things. The main question in Moon is 'What would you do if you met yourself?'... and I guess throwing space into the equation makes the whole thing even scarier to think about. You would still be lonely, even if there were more of you. I'd be lonely.Inside, I am completely geeking out over Moon. But I won't write it all on here because I don't want to spoil it for anyone. Even if you're not that into sci-fi... I'd still really urge you to see this film. I'm still on another planet because of it... (pun intended) and Moon is pure space escapism at it's best.P.S Clint Mansell did the score for Moon, and he is ultra-beyond-everything-scanners-head-explode-genius.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
So lonely..,"Directed by Duncan Jones, (son of David Bowie) ""Moon"" is a thought-provoking and introspective science fiction film that often flies under the radar despite its remarkable storytelling and strong performances.Set in the near future, the story revolves around Sam Bell, portrayed by Sam Rockwell, who is nearing the end of his three-year solo mission on a lunar mining base. His only companion is an AI named GERTY, voiced by Kevin Spacey. As Sam's isolation and fatigue take their toll, he begins to experience strange occurrences that challenge his understanding of reality and his own identity.""Moon"" stands out for its minimalist yet effective approach to sci-fi storytelling. The film delves into themes of identity, isolation, and the ethical implications of corporate exploitation. Sam Rockwell delivers a captivating performance as he grapples with the emotional and psychological challenges of his situation.Duncan Jones's direction creates a sense of claustrophobia and unease, mirroring Sam's emotional state. The lunar landscape and the production design enhance the film's atmosphere, immersing viewers in the isolated and sterile environment.The film's exploration of the human psyche and the blurred lines between humanity and artificial intelligence are executed with depth and nuance. The relationship between Sam and GERTY adds an intriguing layer to the narrative, as they navigate questions of trust and companionship.Despite its relatively low budget, ""Moon"" manages to engage viewers through its compelling storyline, strong character development, and thought-provoking themes. It captures the essence of classic science fiction while offering a fresh take on existential questions in a space setting.In conclusion, ""Moon"" is a hidden gem that provides a contemplative and emotionally resonant journey for viewers willing to explore lesser-known corners of the science fiction genre. With its captivating storytelling and Rockwell's standout performance, the film offers a unique and memorable cinematic experience that leaves a lasting impact.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Sam Rockwell is the Entire Film, Which is Really the Biggest Plus.","Is Moon, the first film by Duncan Jones, David Bowie's son, recalling 2001, or does its excavating station on the far side of the moon just happen to date back to the 2001 epoch, which was indeed eight years ago? I'm prone to the second theory. After the mission carrying Dave Bowman vanished beyond Jupiter, the human race decided to concentrate on the moon, where we were already, you will remember, directing activities. In Moon, the inside architecture of the new lunar station was inspired by the 2001 ship, and the station itself is supervised by Gerty, more of a companionable version of HAL 9000 that elusively bolts around.One can't peg the story's period, but this station on the far side is geared by a single crew member, Sam Bell, played by Sam Rockwell. He is the entire film, which is really the biggest plus. As an actor with such pure and natural presence, he has been criminally underused, and now we are trapped with him all alone with absolutely no one else around, and he must carry the film all by himself, much to our delight. He's working out the final days of a three-year contract and is near breakdown from isolation. Talking to loved ones via video link doesn't do the trick. The predominantly computer-programmed station traverses lunar rock to extract Helium-3, processed to supply Earth with pollution-free power.I want to take a step back and consider some latent issues in the film. In an era when our space and distance barriers are being pushed way outside the human comfort zone, how do we cope with the trials of space in real time? In reduced gravity, how do our bodies handle the diminishing of bone and muscle mass? How do our minds deal with such seemingly infinite cycles of seclusion? The 2001 ship dealt with the corporal trials of its centrifuge. Dave and Frank had each other and HAL. Sam is all on his own, save for Gerty, whose voice by Kevin Spacey proposes he was programmed by the same voice synthesizers used for HAL. Gerty seems sound and affable, but you never know with these cybernated things. All Sam knows is that he's past his best before date, and about to be reprocessed back to Earth. Space is a bleak and desolate hole without mercy or care. Sam has no reliefs at all. Who would enlist for this assignment? What kind of a corporation would ask him to? We, and he, eventually catch on.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Shot for the Moon. Missed.,"The movie Independence Day was released on the 4th of July (1996). Tim Burton's upcoming post-apocalyptic animation feature 9 will open on 9–9–09. So you'd think, wouldn't you, that a movie called Moon would have come out on July 20? But no, evidently Sony Pictures Classics figured that, after 40 years, missing by only 3 days wouldn't be that big a deal.Of course, as we know from actual flights to the Moon, the 1st 400,000 km is the longest part, but not the hardest; if you're off by a tiny fraction of a percent on arrival, you crash. And that attitude, regrettably, also shows up in the movie itself. They start with an absolutely dynamite idea — the sort of SF story that I always beg and plead to have made into a movie — and fritter away all that potential with gaping logic holes during the execution.Sam Rockwell stars as Sam Bell, who is (we think) the only live person represented on screen, since he's the lone (and lonely) tech on site at a mining operation on the far side of the Moon. It's vital that he be there, since Earth has nearly exhausted its supply of fossil fuels but continues to maintain its materialistic lifestyle thru profligate use of fusion power — fueled by the Helium-3 found in usable quantities only on the Moon (as we learn from the film's opening sequence, a ""commercial"" touting Lunar Industries Ltd., the megacorp that runs the helium mine).Recent coverage of the Apollo 11 mission reminds us that the video camera that captured the stunning live pictures of Neil Armstrong's historic ""1 small step"" was itself left behind, as was all the other stuff the mission designers could reasonably unload. That's because basic physics and economics dictate that it's horrendously expensive to boost mass up out of Earth's gravity well, so you do it as seldom as possible, and pack as lightly as you can.This is exactly the thinking of Lunar Industries, which has signed Sam to a 3-year contract. As the movie opens, he's looking forward to going home to his beautiful, loving wife and adorable baby dotter in only 2 weeks, when he reaches his ""sell by"" date. However, as it turns out, that's not just an awkward play on words, since Lunar had something else in mind. It costs money to ship mass back to Earth, too, y'know.Sam starts seeing other people, people who can't possibly be there. Normally a rock-steady performer (psychologically screened for the job, we readily assume), he's increasingly distractable. His health starts deteriorating, similar to the way the equipment is starting to wear out (most distressingly, the lost communication signal from Earth). He worries that he's losing it.And here ends the plot description, because there are several plot twists (not just one) the rest of the way, and I don't want to spoil them. They are the elements that, as I said above, made for a dynamite story idea.Normally I'm thrilled when movie-makers give the audience credit for some intelligence and imagination, and that's the case here. The automated helium harvesters that Sam superintends are known prosaically as 1–4, and we're left to infer from casual conversation that Sam calls them Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The fonts and abbreviations used in the command center are identical to what Stanley Kubrick used on Discovery in 2001, and director Duncan Jones just puts them out there as Easter eggs for the cognoscenti. There's even some sly meta-humor in naming the movie's production company  Lunar Industries!But here's the thing. If you expect the audience to be sophisticated enuf to pick up on those subtleties, how will they not notice such glaring incongruities as equipping Sam with a large supply of whittlin' wood (way heavier than MP3s)? Or a ping-pong table (for a 1-person camp!)? Or the idiot use of multiple large antennas, evidently for the sole purpose of jamming communications — something that the base's robot intelligence GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey) could easily have accomplished for a tiny fraction of the effort? And it's not giving away too much to say that, if you see the film, you too will wonder ""Why so many of them?"".It's one thing to find yourself thinking, an hour after having left the theater, ""That didn't make any sense."", ""No, they wouldn't have done it like that."", or ""Man, no way all that stuff could have happened in that short a time."". It's quite a different thing when those thots keep running thru your head when you're actually trying to watch the movie.Too bad. Coulda been great. Shot for the Moon. Missed.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The dark side of the moon,"When I think of the word moon I don't just think of our moon, the Moon, but a distant body floating along, slightly disconnected but close enough for contact. That is more what Duncan Jones' debut film Moon is about.It stars Sam Rockwell as Sam Bell, the one man crew of Lunar Industries energy base located on, you guessed it, the Moon. He is alone with the station's computer/robot Gerty (voiced marvelously by Kevin Spacey) for three years and is only two weeks away from his return trip home. He has a wife and child he has yet to hold back on Earth. Everything seems to be going well.Then it happens. An accident while checking one of the harvesters. He wakes up back in the base and is bombarded with tests by the computer. His memory of the incident is gone and all that he knows is there has been an accident and he is not allowed back outside. He is determined to get outside.What happens next I don't want to get into. Watch the trailer to try and get an idea for yourself. What ensues, at least to me, is one of the best psychological science fiction stories of all time. It asks so many questions about what is right and wrong, the value of one's life, and how far is too far for science to go. This film shows what happens when a man is pushed to the limit in a place where the limit is very confined.This is Rockwell's defining moment as an actor. His characters up until this point have been surprisingly good (especially in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind), but this is the one. You can read his face and know exactly what he is feeling. There were times when I wanted to tell him everything will be alright, even though I wasn't sure. I can only imagine what three years in virtual isolation can feel like.The real winner here is Duncan and his spectacular approach to this genre. He uses very recognizable technologies tied in with futuristic advancements that are a stretch, but not by much. From a visual standpoint you will be hard pressed to find a more realistic looking sci/fi film. I'm guessing he used a combination of green screen, models, and some CGI to create such a realistic lunar landscape. It gives the story an added boost.From start to finish this is an impressive film from both a technical standpoint and a stylistic one. Moon is that rare piece of science fiction that tinkers with the way you look at the world we live in and not just the future. There is a good amount of deep thinking that can be dredged up from watching this film. Some people might find that annoying. I think that is what makes film so enjoyable. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie before it leaves the theaters. Waiting for this one to be released would be a mistake.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good science fiction does not grow on trees,"Good, serious science fiction is not really something we are fed up with. Looking back at the history of American sci-fi cinema we see a pretty meager landscape. Over the years there have been one or two signs of life. But no organism big enough to have a body, the genre is very much still an embryo. It's like the ape in Kubrick's 2001 threw the bone in the air, but nobody was there to pick it up. Therefore, this feature debut from British writer-director Duncan Jones is a movie pretty alone in it's kind, which would seem fitting given it's plot involving one man alone on the moon. Sure, we can find some hints and homages here and there. Suffice to say, if you were at all fascinated by Solaris, Alien, 2001 or Blade Runner, you will enjoy this movie. But that's also as far as it goes. One could say, if you enjoyed those movies then hurry up to catch this one because they don't come along very often. As far as movies go, quantum wise, it's lonely in space.Any admirer of this genre will approve the setup of the movie. In some close or parallel, would-be future, we energize the planet with solar energy, taken and generated from the sun to Earth, from generators located on the moon. There is one job vacancy for an administrator up there. Thus, within the large facilities we meet Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) who has been up there for three years and now has but two weeks left of his contract. He is beyond homesick, talking to himself and several plants and gazing at loved ones through video messages through cold machines. His loneliness has even driven his health to a shaky state. What was that? Am I alone in here? Probably just imagining things. Right, exactly. His only company is that of Gerty, a friendly computer moving by the ceiling, expressing his mood in smileys and carries the voice of Kevin Spacey. Gerty seems to be a very sweet and innocent baby brother of HAL 9000s but geez, everybody knows you can't trust any kind of artificial intelligence in space. The movie, exceptionally well paced from start to finish, gives you the morning (and evening) routines of Sam's and then we start the plot mechanisms when Sam has a little accident, is knocked unconscious and wakes up at the medical ward. ""How long have I been gone?"" he asks Gerty's happy smiley. ""Oh, not very long"" is the reply. But it looks like Sam has got some initial problems moving his legs and if you've seen Kill Bill you know enough to get suspicious. The story that follows is pretty much impossible not to follow with interest and excitement.This is a movie you can't really make much of a review of, since so much of what happens in it is for the viewer alone to find out about. But there are certain things worth mentioning. Much of the content in Moon are things that have been the subject of many science fiction movies, even campier ones, and I guess if anything holds it away from being truly great and ""merely"" enjoyable it's that it moves within it's own comfort zone, not breaking any significant new grounds, specially in contrast to the perplexing heights at which real sci-fi masterpieces have gone. Perhaps this is a beginner's trade. In any case, it's a highly notable first feature. What probably struck me as the very most impressing thing in the movie though, was Sam Rockwell's one man show (or, ""one"" man show if you will... or maybe one ""man"" show.. nevermind, you'll get it later). It's been clear to me since a while back that he is a quality actor - variating his roles to that of alcoholic looser/hair-trigger in Snow Angels to Zaphod Beeblebrox in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - but this time he really holds up much of the entire movie on his shoulders. Without spoiling anything, I can say he gets to use body language, psychological presence and provide action from his character facing intense and unimaginable emotional situations. I hope he feels proud of his work in it, because it certainly comes off as hard work.It's difficult not to recommend a movie like Moon. It is rare we see movies of it's kind, and for any fan of the genre it's definitely worthwhile. It's a well made, adequately thought provoking, proper science-fiction movie, it's only actual flaw being that it's not better than Solaris.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Till Now, the Most Original Sci-Fi of the Twentieth-First Century","In the future, the Lunar Industries, Inc. is the largest producer of fusion energy in the world, supplying 70% of the planet with clean- burning helium-3, the energy of the sun trapped in rock harvest by machine from the far side of the moon.The entire facility is operated by one man only, Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), and the computer GERTY (voice of Kevin Spacey). The three year-contract of Sam with Lunar Industries is near to the end and Sam misses his beloved wife Tess Bell (Dominique McElligott) and his young daughter Eve. His only contact with Earth is through Tess and Sam is anxious to return home. A couple of weeks before the scheduled day for his voyage back to Earth, Sam is a little disturbed, having visions and daydreams. Sooner he has an accident with his vehicle, crashing a harvest machine, and becomes unconscious.When Sam awakes in the infirmary, he is without recollections and having difficulties to move, and GERTY keeps Sam on the berth in observation. However Sam decides to walk and overhears GERTY reporting the incident and updates to the representatives of Lunar Industries. Then GERTY evaluates Sam and the Lunar Industries management informs that they will send the Rescue Unit Eliza to fix the damaged machine and bring Sam back home. When Sam goes to the stalled harvester, he finds a man wearing astronaut suit trapped in the damaged vehicle and he brings him back to the facility. When he asks who the man is to GERTY, the computer tells that he is Sam Bell.

Throughly Engaging,"When I first heard of this from commentators, it was along on the lines good effort from first time feature director, Duncan Jones, son of David Bowie.When I did finally come to watch it, this is not a good effort, this is a masterpiece. Not just a good compact script but Sam Rockwell delivering a blistering performance as Sam Bell, a technician living and working in isolation maintaning a Helium 3 mining facility on the moon, with the only real time communication is GERTY (Kevin Spacey), the ROBOT companion. With the help of a bizarre event involving Sam crashing his lunar rover, the truth of his existence dawns upon him as he nears the end of his 3 year contract.What can I say, this is just a good simple and meaningful storyline. And it does not pay homage to sci-fi flicks of the 70s/80s as Duncan Jones the director explains. It's in a class of it's own. It's amazing the director pulled this off on such a small budget, but perhaps, the lack of money for too many effects gives it the edge.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Gerty, we're not programmed. We're people, do you understand?","Directed by Duncan Jones and starring Sam Rockwell, Moon finds Rockwell as Sam Bell who is coming to the end of his three year contract on a lunar station working for Lunar Industries. His only companion is an intelligent computer named GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey). When Sam has an accident he awakens to find he is now not alone and all he thought and believed in is just not as it seems.Forget any fears about a low budget and any plot similarity to 2001: A Space Odyssey, for this is a cracker jack of a science fiction picture. Film quickly fills us in on Sam Bell the man and his function up there on the lunar station. His relationship with GERTY the computer grabs our interest whilst the production design has a sort of medicinal sheen to it. Once Sam's solitude is established, the minimal contact with Earth explained, the pic then spins into another dimension, dragging both Sam and us viewers into the vortex.To say more would be churlish, but this is adult science fiction, clever in existential whiles and scathing with observations on corporate shenanigans. Narratively it's evocative in its telling, even haunting and philosophical, where a brilliant Rockwell nails every inch of Bell's search for being, and crucially, the truth. It's all building towards a finale of some devilish substance, no cop outs or easy fed answers, just a pertinent question asked of the viewers. Moon comes highly recommended to sci-fi fans who are after a bit more than mere sparkly fluff and robotic chaos. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Underrated SciFi movie,"Sam Rockwell executes a magnificent performance playing both ""Sam"" roles. I was instantly drawn into the story at the beginning and was glued to my seat until the very end.

Way better than I was expecting,"The movie spends it's runtime examining a single wonderfully realized, harrowingly plausible idea. It has a minimal cast, almost no action and moves at quite a slow pace (normally the kind of film I would hate) but is thoroughly engrossing thanks to great direction and acting. There are some inconsistencies and minor 'but why would anyone do that?' moments but they're pretty easy to overlook.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The best unadvertised movie I've seen since ""Below""....","I had never heard of ""Moon"" before checking the Internet that weekend to see what was playing in my area. When I saw it was rated R and filmed in England, that was a ""Go"" for me, and boy am I not sorry (although I did have to drive about twenty miles to the nearest cinema that had it). The problem for me here is that I would have to give away major plot points to discuss this at all coherently, and for the viewer the discovery of these plot points for oneself is a big plus. So here's what I'll say just to try to get you to see it in the (probably limited) time it'll be in theaters. Essentially a cross between ""Silent Running"" and ""Outland"" with elements from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Solaris"" mixed in, it features Sam Rockwell (last seen by me a decade ago as a death-row inmate in ""The Green Mile"") and the voice of Kevin Spacey as a robot. Rockwell's character Sam Bell works alone (or does he?) at a lunar outpost producing helium for use on earth. (The company for whom he works has a slick ad proclaiming their dedication to humanity's needs, so we know they're doubtless up to no good.) He has a three-year contract nearing it's end. He has pictures and recorded messages from his family (suspiciously, no live communication from earth is available). He has the robot attending to his every need; in maybe the movie's best touch, the robot has a ""face"" consisting of those excruciatingly annoying ""smiley face"" ""emoticon"" symbols (the voice is Spacey's trademark monotone). As Bell starts winding down his tour preparing for his anticipated replacement, he starts ""seeing things,"" and that's as far as I want to go plot-wise.""Okay,"" you may be wondering, ""exactly what should draw me to this?"" A virtuoso performance by Rockwell, making one wonder why he hasn't been a ""big star"" already; superb special effects--you won't believe this was shot in a studio in only about a month; a sustained mood that becomes ever more ominous yet poignant as it goes along; plot twists that shouldn't strain your credulity nor insult your intelligence; besides, to repeat, it's rated R (although I'm not sure why except for a few F-words). Come on, folks, we need to let the movie moguls know there's an adult market out here, and not just for horror flicks or sex comedies! One more thing: if you think a robot can't ""act,"" watch for when this one gently puts it's mechanical arm on Bell's shoulder; stunning how effective it is...",,Anonymous,Mystery
It always feels like somebody's watching Rockwell,"Who could you watch in a movie if they were roughly the only actor in the film? It worked with Tom Hanks. ""I am Legend"" was a hit for Will Smith. Could probably work with Denzel Washington and maybe Brad Pitt. Who came up with the idea that Sam Rockwell, eternally under-appreciated lead actor often used in supporting roles, could pull off such a feat? If you're a Rockwell fan (I am), you know he's up to the task. He delivers big-time as a harvester of energy resources on the Moon, who encounters an unusual, yet familiar individual. There are obvious tips of the hat to ""2001"" all over this movie, but that's a good film to emulate. Director Duncan Jones does a great job at establishing the isolation of Rockwell's character, Sam Bell, left on the Moon to communicate solely with order-keeping robot, GERTY, voiced by Kevin Spacey.Let's go into everything above in depth. ""Moon"" doesn't pack the budget of a film like ""District 9"" or ""Star Trek"", but successfully creates a plausible Moon surface, lunar domicile and hi-tech mining machines. Its main asset is not in whiz-bang visuals, but in creating an eerie existence for its main character, Sam. In doing so, ""Moon"" hearkens back to a not-often-visited form of science fiction – the thinking-man's sci-fi genre. Think of the great movies in this class – ""The Thing"", ""Outland"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"". That's good company, and ""Moon"" belongs there as an excellent mood piece.Unsurprisingly, Sam deals mostly with boredom and restlessness as he finishes up a three-year contract mining The Moon for Helium-3. Space being a lonely place isn't exactly a new concept, but it's handled well here as Sam's reminiscence and longing for a return to his family is coupled with a mysterious (and perhaps nefarious) company that has hired his services. GERTY is Sam's only friend, but being a computer, GERTY is more interested in the tasks at hand than anyone's well-being.I know what you're saying, ""Yeah, that's 2001"". And you're right. I think the thing that makes ""Moon"" unique is Rockwell. I think this film benefits from his status as a not-so-leading man. He can embody all the different sides of Sam Bell with equal ease and a great sense of humor. All that time alone on The Moon allows Sam to get to know himself, and he gets more of an extra opportunity than most of us. And as Sam discovers how Lunar Industries is using questionable methods to prolong his employment, Rockwell brings real pathos to his situation, and makes ""Moon"", in the end, a moving film as well as intriguing science fiction.So, with all this praise, why not four stars? I thought the ending was a little abrupt. When such care is taken to build up this plot to the climax, I wanted a little more time with the denouementand a cigarette. Finally, all the homage, in the end, makes ""Moon"" a touch too familiar to take me completely out of my comfort zone like ""Blade Runner"" or ""Dark City"" did. I think Duncan Jones proves with ""Moon"" that he can graduate successfully from commercials to features, and in the future, he won't need deference to great works in order to make his own.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Interesting but not fascinating,"With the highly rated scores, my expectations were sadly not met. While the concept was great, the story-line took too long to deliver.

"Derivative, but recommended for fans of sci-fi who like to use their brains.","Derivative (adj.) 1. Not the original; Copied or adapted from others. Moon looks and feels like so many other films before it, with certain elements that appear to be directly copied from 2001: A Space Odyssey, Solaris, Alien and more. However, all of the cloned bits in this film serve the purpose of setting up the viewers expectations for one thing and delivering something else instead. The upshot is that this film is a more than welcome entry for a sci-fi genre that is mostly dominated these days with shockingly high budgets poured into creating mindless violence and excessive special fx served up at brain-numbing speeds -- all intent on giving you absolutely nothing to think about. Sam Rockwell gives superb performances, as always.

My favorite film of the year.,"Anybody that knows me knows that I'm a sucker for a Sci-Fi story. Just two years ago I was bowled over by Danny Boyle's shimmering spectacle ""Sunshine"" which provided human drama And Made for one intense thrill ride. Two years one and Duncan Jones releases ""Moon"" a low budget, human drama that just happens to be set out in space starring Sam Rockwell, who happens to be one of my favourite actors working today. All of these ingredients should mix perfectly to create a film that's highly emotive, beautifully acted and a sight to behold but is this moon landing a giant leap, or just a small step.An astronaut miner extracting the precious moon gas that promises to reverse the Earth's energy crisis nears the end of his three-year contract, and makes an ominous discovery in this psychological sci-fi film starring Sam Rockwell and Kevin Spacey. For three long years, Sam Bell has dutifully harvested Helium 3 for Lunar, a company that claims it holds the key to solving humankind's energy crisis. As Sam's contract comes to an end, the lonely astronaut looks forward to returning to his wife and daughter down on Earth, where he will retire early and attempt to make up for lost time. His work on the Selene moon base has been enlightening -- the solitude helping him to reflect on the past and overcome some serious anger issues -- but the isolation is starting to make Sam uneasy. With only two weeks to go before he begins his journey back to Earth, Sam starts feeling strange: he's having inexplicable visions, and hearing impossible sounds. I could go into more depth about the plot of this film but, honestly the less about this film you know the better.Photobucket Firstly the film looks sublime. Much like Danny Boyles ""Sunshine"" this low budget spectacle uses effects to enhance the story rather than distract from it. Mix that with some harrowing shots of the environment and you've got a film that both looks fantastic and, thanks to Clint Mansell's superb score, sounds great too. Sam Rockwell is a versatile actor, his range is absolutely phenomenal. One moment he is relaxed and friendly the next he's ready to slit your eye open with a pocket knife...but let's not spoilt that for you. Simply put. This is a Oscar calibre performance My only major grip with the film was with Kevin Spacey as GERTY who, does a good job, but often distracts you from the realism that the film strides for. All of these elements work just great, mixing together to display some fantastic presentation. It's the story and the direction that leads me to believe that this is the greatest film of 2009.The story is told at a steady pace. The film never ruses and the pacing feel organic, but its this slow pacing that made me feel distinctly uncomfortable while watching this film. The filmmakers never shy away from showing you a deserted hallway (cribbing heavily from ""Alien)and calling it disturbing is a severer understatement. So much so that once the film decided to give us answers you're so involved that seem personal to you. The film never shies away from pulling on your heartstrings either; a phone call to earth makes for one of the most emotional moments of the year. You might not think that ""Moon"" is the greatest film of the year, the things I've described may not appeal to you. However, don't dismay this film. Even if it doesn't sound like it for you please go see it. If just to make your opinion on it.Verdict: Moon is a stunner on many levels. The direction is methodical and precise mixed seamlessly with the tour de force performance from Sam Rockwell. An eerie, disturbing and moving film, but not without occasional bursts of humour, Moon is a refreshing antidote to the dumb action-orientated futuristic fodder has dominated cinemas in recent years.

A hugely impressive first feature from Duncan Jones,"I enjoy sci-fi movies just as much as the next person, and heard so many great things about Moon. To me, it was every bit as good as I had heard, and notable for two things especially.One is Duncan Jones' direction. For a first feature, I was hugely impressed by the assurance and consistency of the direction here. The other is Sam Rockwell, I have always liked him, and in Moon he is simply amazing in perhaps his best performance.But these two elements are not the only outstanding elements. The production values may be low-budget, but looking at the film you wouldn't guess that, it does look very polished. The story is explored in a delicate and intriguing fashion with themes of loneliness and humanity, and the script is intelligent and poignant.The rest of the cast are fine, in particular Kevin Spacey as the voice of Gerty, and the characters are interesting.

Not quite original enough,"Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is a worker on the Moon, nearing the end of his three-year shift. His job is a lonely one. He's the sole occupant of a station built to monitor the humongous harvesters scouring the face of the Moon. But then he injures himself in an accident and things start to get weird.Moon has a good premise. The basic idea of its plot is an interesting one. Unfortunately the execution leaves something to be desired. And I think a lot of that is due to Rockwell. He's a pretty smarmy guy in appearance and general demeanour. And that alone is not necessarily the problem, although it makes it a bit more difficult to root for his characters.The problem, which might also be because of the script, is how nonchalantly he takes all the weird stuff that starts to happen at the station. Sure, he eventually reacts, but it's delayed, weirdly enough. Perhaps they were going for shock or something like that, but it's still odd to expect a story beat, a reaction, that never really comes.To the film's credit, it is very well filmed and made. The production design is fantastic and makes the whole film look really good. One of the more realistic looking five-minutes-into-the-future scifis I've seen recently.Moon has its upsides.

Film Of The Year,"Definitely the most intriguing film of 2009. A study of one mans loneliness, isolation and longing to return home. I wasn't disappointed. The look of the base, the title sequence, the muted atmosphere all added up to a film with a style very similar to the first Alien movie. The director intentionally created it as a homage to such classic sci-fi, along with 2001 Space Odyssey. It succeeds on many levels. In fact, when the character Sam Bell finds and opens a hatch on his Selene base, I half expected Ellen Ripley to pop her head out with a flame thrower. Who needs Sig weaver though, uh?

"""Moon"" is a brilliantly psychological film driven by Sam Rockwell's utterly incredible performance","""I want to go home""Duncan Jones' Moon is a magnificently beautiful character study and a dazzlingly complex and ambitious sci-fi film. Aside from some rather subtle similarities to other genre classics, the film rarely feels unoriginal, mostly due to the masterful storytelling and superb direction.

"Thoughtful, intelligent, emotionally resonant, and anchored by a fantastic performance by Sam Rockwell, Moon is a modern day Sci-fi classic","Set in the future, mankind has elevated their energy needs by establishing mining bases on the moon that harvest helium-3 for use in fusion energy production. One such base, Sarang, is operated by Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) a contractor for energy company Lunar Industries who is nearing the end of a three year contract wherein he is the sole employee at the base with only the base's robotic AI assistant GERTY (Kevin Spacey) for company. While performing maintenance on the harvesters, Sam sees a hallucination of his wife Tess (Dominique McElligott) and the momentary distraction is enough to cause Sam to crash his lunar rover. Sam awakens in the infirmary with no idea how he got their aside from GERTY telling him he was in an accident. GERTY has been instructed to keep Sam confined to base until the arrival of a rescue team. After Sam convinces GERTY to let him outside to do some repairs on the base exterior, Sam discovers a man who looks identical to him at one of the harvesters.Moon is the directorial debut of TV commercial director Duncan Jones (born Zowie Bowie), the son of famed singer and actor David Bowie. Initially Jones pitched to Sam Rockwell the script for his Blade Runner inspired Mute which didn't resonate with Rockwell as he was more interested in playing a blue collar character as opposed to one of the villains in the Mute script. Co-written with English screenwriter Nathan Parker, the film was specifically written for Sam Rockwell and was designed as a low budget chamber piece with Paddy Considine as an alternate should Rockwell turn down the role which luckily he did not. Made for $5 million, Jones made conscious efforts to keep costs controlled by keeping the cast and crew small and filming primarily within a studio and even recycling abandoned set works from a cancelled film version of BBC's Red Dwarf series. Jones elected to keep the usage of CGI limited preferring to use model work and even brough in Bill Pearson whose work could be seen in Ridley Scott's Alien. Sony Pictures eventually acquired the distribution rights and briefly considered releasing the film direct-to-video, but following positive response at Sundance the movie was given a theatrical release by Sony where it scored rave reviews and became a modest hit theatrically but was discovered on home video and ancillary avenues making Jones a major up and comer. The movie was deliberately designed to appeal to fans of serious minded sci-fi such as Solaris or 2001: A Space Odyssey in that in wanted to stimulate the brain as much as the eyes and Moon effortlessly reaches those lofty heights it aspires towards.Undeniably Sam Rockwell is the heart of this movie. Rockwell faces a challenging role for any actor playing a dual role without many of other actors to fall back upon and he does well conveying the tension, unease, isolation, and even heartbreak that comes from this situation that he finds himself in that causes him to question his identity and perceptions with each revelation. I recall the marketing for this movie being very nebulous as to what was going on focusing mostly on showcasing the environment and Sam Rockwell's performance and when I first experienced this twist on my initial viewing in the theater it was both an amazing revelation and played for some heartbreaking moments that dove into the nature of the twist and my opinion has only increased with subsequent viewings with all the little details and background elements becoming more noticeable in the best possible way with how well thought out they made this world and this revelation.But Rockwell's performance aside, I'd be remised in my review if I didn't call attention to how amazing Moon looks despite only costing $5 million and 2009 was not a bad year for Sci-fi (Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen notwithstanding) with District 9 becoming a sleeper hit, Star Trek being successfully relaunched, and even Avatar becoming the highest grossing film of all time, and yet despite those movies having budgets of $30, 150, or 300 million, it's moon with its low scale approach and usage of mattes, miniatures, and plywood sets that made for the most tangible world that feels living and tangible. Using 1/40th the budget Michael Bay had on the same year's Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Jones created thought provoking and thrilling sci-fi that made you want to learn more about the world and how it works. Even those in the scientific and space communities were impressed by the attention to detail in the film which is not an easy feat.Moon is easily one of the best science fiction films of the past 20 years and may even rank alongside forebearers in the genre like 2001 and Solaris. Duncan Jones creates an amazing scope and scale despite his limited budget, and Sam Rockwell's dual role in the lead is good enough that he should have been given Best Actor consideration. I've seen this movie about 5 times at this point, and odds are I'll see it another 20 times in my lifetime.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Moon,"It is a true marvel that Moon got made at all when it is so out of step with current film making trends and its all the more remarkable that it turned out to be an excellent film showcasing everything that can be good about low budget independent cinema and announces débutant director Duncan Jones as a real talent to watch in the future. The film stars Sam Rockwell as Sam Bell, the one man crew of a mining station on the dark side of the moon on a three year contract with only an endlessly cheery computer GERTY, voiced with brilliantly creepy calm by Kevin Spacey, for company. While the base is mainly automated Sam is required for maintenance and monitoring. His live communication link to Earth is down and he relies on video messages from his wife and child for comfort as he comes up to the end of the contract and the limits of his sanity. Whilst on a routine repair mission to one of the base's remote harvesters he suffers a bad accident and well, to reveal further would ruin the movie.Sam is one of Rockwell's best performances in a roller-coaster career, here he is able to constrain the 'zanier' aspects of his performances whilst still portraying someone on the ragged edge of their soul. His character wears the psychological scars of such extreme loneliness with such pitiable sadness that within minutes of the film's opening the audience has to question what kind of man would submit to these conditions, that reveal, when it comes, is a quite brilliant turn. Whilst praising Rockwell's performance I have to mention Spacey's voice acting that uses age old sci fi conventions about thinking computers to twist our expectations and encourages the audience to speculate ad constantly re-evaluate GERTY's motivations. GERTY'S design also evokes sci fi of old with his clunky panels and simple smiley face screen, a facet reflected in the base itself. A sparse and dirty environment, giving the impression of industrial space exploration, not the sleek lines and lens flares of the modern Star Trek but a vision of corporate exploitation. Everything about the base, from its single person crew to its basic food and living quarters and its clunky moon buggies reeks of a company spending as little money as possible for the biggest profit. The whole piece represents a throwback to the paranoia of the 1970's, sci fi's boom years, when space was seen as just another place ripe for exploitation by greedy corporations and authoritarian governments.When sci fi was created it was typically used as a means with which to examine humanity in extreme circumstances and the universality of the human experience. That has become lost lately, and notably this summer, as it becomes a tool for Hollywood to create ever larger explosions and ever shallower characters. This summer has already seen Wolverine, Star Trek, Terminator: Salvation and Transformers 2 assault the senses to varying degrees of success but with hardly a moment for the audience to catch their breath between them they epitomise the ultra high tempo of modern sci fi film-making. In that context Moon slow, thoughtful approach comes as a real shock to the system, here characters engage and discuss, they contemplate in silence as they try to comprehend the enormity of their discoveries and when the twists come they are slow reveals that the audience are trusted to understand without a flip chart and diagrams. Moon is one of those interesting, neat films that come along every so often to show what sci fi can still achieve and is destined for a long life on DVD. A thoroughly recommend sci fi slow burner on the nature of identity, find it, watch it, discuss it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A rare treat,"I had heard good things about Moon, so decided to check it our recently. I'm not a big fan of Science Fiction films and only tend to like those that are more intelligent than the norm. I was pleased to find out that Moon is definitely more intelligent than the average Sci-Fi film.The film follows Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) who is mining on the moon for the earth and is alone except for his computer Gerty, voiced by Kevin Spacey. He is serving a 3 year stint and looking forward to returning to earth and his family.I believe the film was made for a low budget and bearing this in mind looks quite good. The acting is nicely played with an interesting and involving script. The film is well worth checking out.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great SF,"In a year so many weak and disappointing movies, this is a gem. It not only stands out among movies released in 2009, it stands out among science fiction movies in general. And let's make sure we're on the same page with the term ""science fiction."" Lord of the Rings is not science fiction! It's fantasy. Why people would confuse that I have no idea. Star Wars is a gray line. Space Opera (which is how Star Wars is defined) is fantasy in the guise of science fiction, because it's not about scientific concepts, it just uses motifs borrowed from science fiction in a fantasy context. Fantasy is all about magic and the impossible, science fiction (that is hard science fiction) is all about what is possible or may be possible within the realm of science as we currently understand it.Moon is science fiction, and it's a rarity. It's very simply a story about a guy up on the moon by himself. Which on paper looks like it would be very boring. But it's not. Actor Sam Rockwell carries the entire film by himself and does an amazing job at building a very suspenseful plot.This is a limited release, so you have to hunt it down, but it's worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Silly...,"It baffles me that so many people find this movie to be an enjoyable watch. The movie moves at a snails pace, is extremely predictable and steals in a too obvious manor from far superior predecessors. Rockwell turns in an uneven performance but it's always nice to catch the highly talented Kevin Spacey, even if he literally phoned it in this time.The story could have worked had it been told in a shorter amount of time, had it skipped the many absurd lapses in logic it needlessly featured and had it dared to sire some original thought. As it stands, the story has been told many times before and in Moon just lacks the zest, intelligence and imagination to pull it of. With a script too repetitive and a lazy score (sounding exactly like the crap I made in the 80's with my first sequencer, perhaps I should sue for plagiary) very poorly timed in places, the movie became sort of annoying especially considering the potential it had. Whatever was left to enjoy was surely ruined by the incredibly dumb and completely nonsensical ending where a man survives a trip through space being exposed to G- forces which in reality would result in a spacesuit filled with a gory mash of meat and bones.With a reasonable production value nonetheless, Moon remains a simplified 2001 and Solaris redux for the MTV generation with apparently on par appreciation.

Low key and effective Sci-fi,"A nice 'throwback' feature more reliant on plot and character than flashy CGI and 'exciting' action scenes. The story is certainly interesting. It takes on the ideas of AI, cloning and space explorations in a nice way. Sam Rockwell does well heading the small cast. Kevin Spacey's voice is obtrusive, not just because it's Spacey, but because the 'name' voice intrudes upon the low-key setup (and, of course, his inclusion is even more dicey today).The movie works in a sort of Twilight Zone kind of way. It's low key, and makes good use of it's budget. Director Duncan Jones (son of a certain Space Oddity named David Bowie) shows some care and attention to detail (his follow-up, SOURCE CODE, did as well). Clint Mansell's score is exceptional. The special effects aren't the most ambitious but neatly fit the package. SF fans will dig all the references to 2001, BLADE RUNNER, DARK STAR etc., and it holds up even better on second watch.",,Anonymous,Mystery
very well made and acted... but I do not get it,"I give only 6, because for all its strengths (excellent acting, very good music, directing, special effects etc) I just do not see the point of this movie. Oh loneliness sucks? Hmm, I did not know that. A person alone for 3 years starts to talk to himself?? Wow. A father and a husband misses his family?? Revelation. The entire premise of the implanted memories of his (their) wife and child makes no sense, because they are... CLONES!!! Why would the sinister company behind, that sent Sam into space, even consider implanting memories about a fake family? I do not know, other than to give the film more emotional and psychological depth. But it is stupid nonetheless, because... they are CLONES!!!! The company could have made and programmed the clones not to talk to each other, for example, and to have NO memories whatsoever, other than the need and desire to work. If they can implant any memories, why not that of a cult of efficiency and necessity to do as much work as possible while asking as few questions as possible. But then there would be no film, u see. In addition, the new Sam's ""victory"" at the end is very short-lived, as every clone is clearly designed to live exactly 3 years only. So for me the film is very well crafted, but pointless. Unless its point was to support the idea of human cloning. In this case it is very good.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Great Movie,"I thought Sam Rockwell did one heck of a job in this movie. One of the best pictures of all time and the very best for 2009.

The scenes were haunting and the story kept me hanging on edge the whole time. I was trying to guess the ending but, alas, I was completely surprised at the end. If you are looking for a lot of bullets, chase scenes, wrecks and idiotic script then this is not the movie for you. If you want to be placed in deep thought as you watch this movie then see it. If you want to be taken on a cerebral journey, then it's for you. You will become completely engrossed in the movie. Its story and special effects will soon grapple and hold you tight throughout. It will cause you to realize that somethings the future holds for us are not too far fetched after all. You will like the challenge of answering questions that come to mind as you watch. Those questions keep you second guessing until you come to realize that you were a long way down the path of misunderstanding all along.

Story Was More Crescent Than Full,"(Flash Review)This film was too basic with too thin a story and it thought it was more grand and philosophical than it was. It's one of those films where the protagonist wrestles with the solitude of being the ONLY human working at a mining plant on the Moon which sends resources back to a mineral starved Earth. Does being the sole human strain his mental state or is something else strange afoot? Plots like this are typically interesting yet this one was unconvincing or that the main 'characters' were irritating. The drab and bland writing and the jarring unsophisticated emoticon faces the talking robot had didn't help. The preposterousness of the logic they established for the Moon mining activity encourages a furrowed brow. On a positive note, the Moon special effects were very good.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A welcome return to sci-fi core values,"'Moon' represents a very successful return to sci-fi as those of us who *read* sci-fi understand it. There are no monsters, no disembowelling, no gratuitous sex, no car chase equivalents. What's more it's an original story, rather than yet another poor adaptation of a sci-fi novel! There is simply one man in extreme and somewhat inhuman circumstances trying to understand what it means to be human. There is no attempt to shock or revolt us just to get a reaction, instead we are treated as intelligent and discerning viewers with the ability to reflect on what we are seeing and our own responses to things.The film moves slowly in a way that invokes '2001'. There is time to be thoughtful, which some viewers seem to find ""boring"". It is a reminder that once upon a time films did not flicker by with epilepsy inducing rapidity, bombarding us with light and sound and action until thinking is not even an option. 2001 is invoked in other ways as well but Jones decides not to follow the masses down the well worn road, but cuts a new path that is quite a delight. There is plenty of time to experience your own reactions to the dilemma which is quite rare in sci-fi movies.Moon raises serious grown-up issues and leaves you to decide what to do about them. It's not a polarised good/evil, light/dark kind of Hollywood movie - it is about a subtle moral issue, and again this seems to leave some viewers confused and flailing.Sam Rockwell is a credible actor, and some of the special effects (again muted and fully in context rather than the usual blare) are really very clever. As the truth dawned it occurred to me that Duncan Jones is a talented writer and director, and that I can hardly wait to see what comes next. Let's hope he's not a one hit wonder as I really want to see more of this kind of thing!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nothing to write home about,"Now don't get me wrong... Moon is a good movie, but I think the 9 and 10 scores from many of my fellow reviewers are a bit over-the-top. Having said that, I enjoyed watching the movie, but I don't have any desire to see it again.The message of space loneliness and the cold, somewhat soulless void that we call space, is well delivered in what is generally a cold and soulless movie. It's like watching and endless scene shot in a pristine hospital operating theater. Stark and clinical. But I guess spacecraft and space itself is very much like that.I have no gripe with the acting or the set design, nor with the (not totally believable) lunar surface shots and machines. The all-knowing, slightly sinister on-board computer was also fine. But as I watched, I couldn't help thinking that the director was trying too hard to make a masterpiece and a modern-day 2001 space puzzle. The plot certainly gives food for thought, but the answers to the questions are weak and spoil the intellectual chase. Imagine if Mr. Kubrick had explained everything; would his movie still have been a masterpiece? Moon is entertaining and original. For sure it is worth watching. But is it ""One of the best sci-fi movies ever""? Maybe, but only just.",,Anonymous,Mystery

A beautiful achievement for science fiction and movies in general.,"(possible spoilers) When I first started to watch this movie, I became enthralled instantly. After about 30 minutes of the movie and especially after the scene of the crash I actually became skeptical about the plot though visually, aesthetically, and atmospherically the movie did not disappoint me in any way. I continued to watch having faith in the movie because of the many aspects of the movie that I credited towards being phenomenal. This movie didn't let me down at all! Not only is the story one of my favorite parts of the movie, it should be noted that the pacing and execution of the story is perfect.The entire movie never goes outside its realm to pay homage to or otherwise drift apart from its successors, such as the obvious 2001. I also enjoyed many tribute scenes such as Sam launching back to earth in an array of colors and lined shots of the moon and earth. It all worked for the movie. Sam Rockwell was amazing in his roles. One of the best main characters I've seen in a movie in a long time. He managed to take the movie from the beginning to end, again remaining perfectly in the boundary set by the movie, playing two lead roles convincing me and I'm sure many others that the two characters on the screen were dynamic and separate entities.As for the visuals, I can't say enough how much this movie captured what I love about science fiction movies. The technology used in the movie is credible and believable and fits the theme of the movie to a tee. GERTY is a wonderful and emotional character and dare I say, more intriguing than HAL could ever hope to be? The decisions made by this character are felt but again, never drift into a place that makes him feel like he has anything above AI. He also provides some great comedic relief and I just all around enjoy the design of GERTY.The music is enticing and catchy. Not only does it fit the mood but it develops everything on screen into something beautiful that the viewer can connect with. It's not obnoxious and overplayed but it's used sparingly at key moments to push the story. I especially loved the pick up of the music at the end and the tie in with the main piano loop to create a mysterious but much needed intensity that would've been otherwise lacking.All in all I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The criticism that this movie might receive for being cliché or being too much like its successors is mislead because the movie's originality and beauty push it to mean something more. It's not just a tribute film, it's a film that can be enjoyed on any level. It's not just a scifi film, it's a story that's gripping, intense, unique and most of all, makes us think and question many things about ourselves and our world. It delivers so much emotion and sucks you into this other world. It's the very reason I love science fiction and in that, becomes not only a tribute but a major player in the films that inspired it.I give 10/10 gladly for this movie. I don't think it deserves anything less :)",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Dark side of the Moon,"Here is an engrossing intelligent small film that repays a bit of knowledge of its genre. Referening a host of the 70s cult sci-fi films (Dark Star, Silent Running, Solaris, Outlands, Alien, Blade Runner, 2001 etc.) we are given what appears to be a man and his robot minding a corporate lunar mining venture.With a Clint Mansell soundtrack, (which I'm listening to on Spotify), this film sounds great. Unfortunately it sometimes looks a little sub par because, well, the limited budget. You will wince a little at the use of miniatures for the outside moon shots. But stay with.Sci-fi has always been used to explore social politics, and this film touches on various borderline issues but in a fairly close, emotional and involving way. Which is why maybe Silent Running is its true parent.In order to deliver the homage, we do get the old pat and outdated clichés; corporates are all bad, computers can understand humans, unnecessary countdowns etc. This doesn't stop the enjoyment, but makes me appreciate the recent well financed TV series sci-fi for taking the time to push the envelope a bit. I hope the producers trust the makers with a touch more cash to really make something a bit bigger.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Sam Rockwell's performance is incredible, but the film itself is slow and tedious","Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is an employee of Lunar Industries and is on a three year mission whereby he is searching for resources on the Moon and these resources are resolving the power problems back on planet Earth. Close to the end of his three year contract, Sam starts to see and experience strange occurrences which make him question his own sanity as well as making him question the company that he's working for...Moon is one of those films that is full of intrigue and mystery early on and the isolated setting certainly lends it an air of claustrophobia. It does a good job of demonstrating how being isolated for a long period of time can drive a person crazy and it also does a good job of establishing an emotive core - the desire for Sam to get back home and see his family and the effect all of this has had on him mentally. All of this makes the first 30 minutes or so to be quite absorbing viewing, but it seemed to fall about slightly in the second half...It's clear that once we get to the point of 'the accident' that director and writer Duncan Jones didn't really know what to do with the story and many of the scenes involving Sam and his doppleganger were repetitive and tedious and for the most part not particularly insightful. The presence of GERTY who is a super intelligent computer could have proved to be an interesting addition to the story, but Jones gives GERTY no discernible personality making many of the exchanges between Sam and GERTY feel rather dull - seriously would a bit of humour have hurt here??? Jones seems to dangle many carrots along the way here and one does feel that Jones is going to offer some kind of big pay-off for much of the boredom and tedium that has been offered up in Moon, but this simply doesn't happen.Duncan Jones really owes a lot to Sam Rockwell here as it is his performance that just about keeps the picture above water. He's the heart and soul of the picture and it's a shame really that such a good performance is confined to such a dull film.In some ways, Moon reminded me of both 2001; A Space Odyssey and Black Hole so if those sort of films are your bag then you may enjoy this film. However, for me I just found it a tad repetitive, tedious and aside from the first 30 minutes I found it rather boring and uninteresting.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Questions to ponder.,"Science fiction is invariably a fairy tale nowadays. You can probably connect with a handful of movies showing a fictional future. Most just serve to entertain with cheap visual thrills. Moon is an exception to this degradation of scientific imagination in our modern day script writing.Instead of pondering over the power levels of imaginary ""cores"" and flashy laser weaponry, this movie strives to ask difficult questions from the audience. Questions that will leave you with no clear answers long after you have seen, dissected and digested the movie.Script is remarkably simple and there are no ""big"" secrets except one, which is revealed around the middle. The rest of the story is what gets the gray cells all juiced up. Instead of delivering a complicated plot, the movie delivers a complicated premise.Soundtrack is excellently suited to the pace and texture of the story telling. Visuals are clean and precise, and most importantly believable - without being boring. The dialogs are also well - real ! No flamboyance or theater grade facial mannerisms here. Just plane and simple acting, done in a most convincing manner. Rockwell is a gem.A well laid out story which tries to tickle our moral brain maps, this movie is a must watch for hard science fiction fans.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Instant Classic!,"How wonderfully surprised I was to see this film.. I felt as if I had stumbled into an art film house in the seventies. It's an instant classic.

Forget all the hoopla about special effects, and explosions, and blood – nudity. Tell people a good story, and that's how you make an instant classic. As far as sci-fi/sci-fantasy goes, it's up there with ""Metropolis,"" ""THX 1138,"" ""2001 A Space Odyssey, ""Blade Runner,"" and ""Millennium.""

The result is a movie that is pleasant to watch but real sci-fi fans (and by that I mean people who read sci-fi, not just ones who watch it) should tell the difference between good sci-fi story and movie like this.

One of the best films of all time.,"Moon is that rare breed of film that seamlessly weaves existential introspection with thrilling story-telling resulting in the most satisfying and touching of film going experiences. It is a tour de force of technical achievement from the set design to the acting to the score to the directing.The film tells the fascinating story of Sam Bell (Rockwell) who when coming to the end of a three year stint as the sole crew member on a moon base encounters a duplicate of himself. This encounter sets the scene for some mind-bending self-reflection and a heartfelt bonding between the two men as they not only discover who they are but that their lives are in danger. In telling this story, Jones constantly plays with the audience's expectations exploiting their knowledge of film convention in general and science fiction convention in particular so that the narrative is kept fresh and unpredictable and the audience kept on their toes.Like all great science fiction films Moon looks great. The production design is truly excellent with more than a few nods to 2001: A Space Odyssey, while the visual effects are simple but immaculate. The magnificent Moonscapes against which the exterior action takes place are nothing short of sumptuous. Moon is a testament to the idea that the clever and restrained use of visual effects that is necessitated by an independent budget can produce a quality far beyond that of even the most expensive blockbusters. Like 2001 and Blade Runner before it Moon uses its look and visual effects not to impress the audience in a vacuous attempt to show off but as a subtext for the story. This only heightens the visual experience and gives the film's look a life of its own.The script is tight and economical with not a word of dialogue out of place or wasted. Given that the film only stars one actor and that loneliness is an important theme there are extended periods where no words are spoken. In such circumstances score can become critical and the audience will not be disappointed as Clint Mansell's unforgettable music carries you throughout the film colouring every scene with a pervading sense of mystery. Indeed, his score is so subtly haunting that you continue to 'hear' it even when it's not there.At the centre of this film is Sam Rockwell's powerhouse performance which is possibly the most impressive piece of acting since Pachino's portrayal of Michael Corleone. As with that latter performance, Rockwell takes on the mammoth task of portraying two different versions of the same character and he succeeds so wonderfully that at times you feel you could be looking at two different actors. Of course the real trick was in playing the character differently enough to account for the personality changing over time but similarly enough to reinforce the point that they're the same person. And it is in pulling off this trick that Rockwell lays the groundwork for some of the most unique and profoundly touching acting in modern film history as the two Sam Bell's grow past their initial suspicion and resentment of each other to the point where they become bound by genuine compassion and concern for each other. For me, this is the punctuating performance in this maverick actor's career and one that confirms him as the standout actor of his generation.Sam Bell's AI companion Gerty is superbly brought to life through a combination of Kevin Spacey's perfectly measured vocal performance and an incredibly innovative conception of robot-human interface where Spacey's monotone voice becomes emotionally embellished through the use of emoticons. Though the existential relationship between the two Sams is the heart and soul of this film, the three-way interaction between Rockwell, Spacey's voice, and the physical robot is at times equally touching and this is never better realised than in the moment when Gerty breaks protocol to tell Sam the truth.Ultimately it is the poignancy of Moon that makes it so deeply brilliant and that poignancy is drawn from the story through the intuitive combination of Rockwell's searing performance and Jones' profound and visionary direction. In one standout scene this perfect harmony between the two and their respective crafts is realised as Bell sits in his rover talking to his daughter who is back on Earth. As Bell begins to emotionally crumble before our eyes Jones cuts to an exterior shot, which slowly pans behind the rover and the more distant blue sphere of the earth. This is perhaps one of the most beautiful and haunting scenes in the history of cinema.Duncan Jones' Moon is the best debut since Scorsese maybe even since Welles. It is the best science fiction film since Bladerunner maybe even since 2001: A Space Odyssey. The more often I see this film the higher it rises in my estimation. In fact, Moon might just be one of the best films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
All the ingredients were there but it didn't quite work for me,"I often say Sam Rockwell needs to be in more films because he's an incredible actor. I recently realised how hypocritical I was being by saying this though, considering I haven't even seen all of his films. So in an attempt to do so 'Moon' seemed liked a good place to start. Kevin Spacey lending his voice to the film helped to spark my interest in the film and get me motivated to watch it. So did I love it as much as I hoped to? Sadly, no.Firstly, while Sam Rockwell's performance is fantastic, this isn't the type of role I most like him in. I like him in roles where I couldn't imagine anyone else playing the part. This one did not come across that way to me. I had the same sort of problem with Kevin Spacey's voice work. While it was pleasant to know it was him and hear that familiar tone, it really could've been anyone and it wouldn't have made a lick of difference to the film.As for the concept of the story, I liked it without loving it as much as I should've. I liked it in theory, but not so much in execution. I thought it could've been crafted better, both in terms of the reveal to the audience and also how the concept was played out after we find out what is happening. The whole thing ended up coming across a little dull and boring for my liking and the final third of the film just kind of petered out rather than ramping things up.'Moon' is a very good looking film though, there is no question about that. Add in a fine performance from Rockwell and a thought-provoking concept that will certainly intrigue most who watch it to some extent, and you have yourself a very watchable film.

The low production costs of the movie are apparent throughout.But good movies don't need good special effects. The trouble is this movie has other failings - such as any sort of pace. It plods along. The middle section, in particular, feels like Purgatory.I wanted to give this movie 6½ out of 10 but gave it 7 because, at its heart, it is a serious science fiction film with something, maybe not very much, to say about humanity and consciousness. Several interesting themes run through it, but most are confusingly presented and none are very well developed.I agree that it's a good first movie and Duncan Jones has potential. It's a pity they don't give you a discount on the price of a ticket because of this.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Weird, well-made psych drama","Big Questions: Can director Duncan Jones, David Bowie's son, get out from behind his father's shadow with his own space oddity? Is ""Moon"" the thought provoking, 2001-esque science fiction flick it's being billed as? Will Sam Rockwell, being the only person on screen for most of the time, be able to anchor a film all by himself?Rockwell plays Sam Bell, an astronaut working for Lunar Industries, a company responsible for 70% of the Earth's energy, which they harvest from the moon. After a good three years of sending parcels of energy back to Earth, Sam is just two weeks away from being able to see his wife (Dominique McElligott) and young daughter (Kaya Scodelario) again. The three years of isolation, and only having the ship's computer Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey) to talk to, have not done Sam's state of mind any good as he either talks to himself or starts seeing things at different points of his day, his wife included. Just a very weird thing happens after being bombarded by a storm of rock while on a mission at one of the mechanical harvesters. Injured, he is awakened later in the infirmary thinking that Gerty saved him. He's told that a rescue team is on the way and that he must stay inside until they arrive, but disobeying orders he heads back out to the harvester and finds another him, unconscious. He brings the other him back to the ship where a lot of questions lay in front of them both.Nathan Parker's screenplay is nothing mind blowing but if you're in the mood for a good psychological drama, this one more than fits the bill. It's slow moving but your head will be working a mile a minute trying to figure out the secrets that lay in store here. Which one of the Sams is the real Sam? Has all this isolation finally driven Sam loco? Could the company that Sam works for be playing with him, putting him into some kind of experimental test or something? Jones proves to be an expert in paranoia, creating a claustrophobic and weirdly surreal situation. It gets so crazy at one point that the two Sam's even start a fight with one another. The production design is really good too, the lunar rovers and the space shuttle, with its dirty white walls that somehow add to the suspense in their own way, are like throwbacks to old movies such as Alien and 2001: A Space Odyssey, and, in a way, the movie is kind of an ode to both.And Sam Rockwell is terrific here, taking on the dual roles with a level of quirky craziness and moving vulnerability that keeps Sam compelling. Kevin Spacey also gives a good robotic vocal.Moon will alienate some with it's slow-moving, overly-thinky subject matter but if your in the mood to give your brain a work-out and be prepared to talk about it afterwards, Jones' first directorial effort is a major success.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Un-original Story but Well Acted,"Just finished with this at the EIFF. Sadly the story was a bit too obvious. If you've seen any form of Sci-Fi before, then 30 minutes in to this film you'll have most of this story worked out, and 45 minutes you'll have it all worked out. In fact, there is nothing in this story (or the imagery for that matter) that hasn't been done in the TV Comedy series Red Dwarf. It ends up feeling like a straight version of ""the best of Red Dwarf"".Sam Rockwell does put in a very good performance but that is the only high point. The directing is straight-forward and the dialogue is nothing-special. This is not to say that it's a bad film, it just that the main focus in this film, the plot, is unlikely to keep anyone enthralled. By the end you just want to know if you've guessed the specific number correct (I'll leave that comment vague!).",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Our Culture is Erasing Itself,"When you want to make a science fiction film, and you are obviously aware from the moment you start that you have watched Solaris and 2001 fifty times, you would think one would contemplate that out of respect you should stop there.I'm not a purist. I don't mind a revisit to a genre. However, those two films hit the things we needed, and it takes much more than the little ideas in moon to make for a movie even half-worth an homage.Our current generation of 20 year olds did not grow up watching 2001 or Solaris, so there is no frame of reference to catch this film and throw it directly onto a late night broadcast on the sci-fi channel -which is where it belonged back in 1985 when we weren't watching MTV.It's a damned shame film. Shame on these ""filmmakers"". Good grief. And, shame of some of the best reviewers, not excluding Roger Ebert himself, for not taking a blazing torch out and screaming for the negative of that film to be strung out for all to see.Neither Kubrick nor Tarkovsky would be stirring in their graves. They would in fact rise from the dead, take the director out for a night of heavy drinking, and then swat his bottom before putting him to bed and handing him a mini dv camera, telling him to spend the rest of his life video taping traffic.It's okay to make a movie that takes place in space. It really is. But, if you're going to do it, start from scratch, not from theft.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Brilliant!,"Sam Rockwell carried this movie by himself SO well. He plays an astronaut on the moon harvesting a mineral to be sent back to Earth. Machines run by themselves and when they have collected a full tank of minerals, Sam takes a rover to change out the tanks and send the full tanks back to Earth. His only companion is a machine voiced by Kevin Spacey. Each astronaut is given a three year tour aboard this space station and it is almost time for Sam to return to Earth. Shortly before that time approaches, Sam starts to see things. It could just be cabin fever...or not. Sam Rockwell shows all facets of his acting abilities in this movie, weak, strong, funny, angry, silly, he shows them all. The only thing that bothered me was how pristine the station was and how dirty GERTY was. This movie was perfectly cast and well written.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Old style sci-fi for people who like something to think about,"Excellent sci-fi, particularly notable for its use of physical model work rather than cgi to create the moon base and lunar landscape, giving a reality often missing from todays bigger budget offerings.Also Sam Rockwell's performance is nicely understated with an immense amount going suitably unsaid to add yet another layer of reality that over scripting his characters thought process would most likely have removed.If you like Bladerunner, 2001, Solaris and other similar films, you'll love this. If you're looking for big explosions and girls in tight rubber, you're looking in the wrong place, but go and see it anyway cause you may be surprised at how enjoyable true sci-fi can be.And as sci-fi should, the film has something to say about technology that may loom only just over our horizon as well as about current attitudes to humanity.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Poor,"I had hoped for finally a good SF, but it was a bit disappointing (a lot actually).The similarities with 2001, Soljaris and Blade runner are obvious, but the film lacks the length and tranquility to create the same atmosphere/tension. Some themes (paranoia, loneliness, man versus technology, etc.) often require a certain length/slowness in the film to make the development of characters clearly tangible.
If as a viewer you can't bring that peace of mind: just watch Avatar or the latest King Kong version, I'd say.Also the shots of moon-earth universe are clearly meant like in 2001, but absolutely incomparable, as is the use of classical music. The contrast classical-high tec in 2001 was both desirable and effective, with Moon it's just tucked in without knowing why. In the end Soljaris only had his planetary surface, but all the foregoing gave this a certain threat. Moon remains visually very flat.The whole thing was somewhat ""overacted"" and sometimes nonsensical. Suddenly I even had the idea of watching ""Midnight cowboy"": a movie where by the way is acted very well.With these actors (and this budget?) you probably can't make a masterpiece like the 3 above mentioned, so don't try it, I mean, this film could easily have taken place somewhere on earth in a kind of Gattaca-like setting (I'll call it something).Maybe a nice Star Trek or Twilight zone or something like that, but that's all, unfortunately.Take a look at Microgravity, although very short, but then you'll see that it's still possible. It's just not easy.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Good indie old-style sci-fic movie,"A great British indie retro-sci-fic film that tells the story of a solar station on the moon and of San Bell, one of the caretakers, at the end of his 3-year contract.The aesthetics of the movie are very much the same you could find in classic sci-fi of the 1970s, with miniature lunar sets, clean white interiors and furniture. Even the robot is chunky and heavy, more emotional than functional, nothing to do with modern robotics. The lunarscapes are also very retro, with the use of miniature vehicles that do look real. It is a well-known setting by sci-fi lovers and very enjoyable to see reproduced. Even the atmosphere is classic, with that unsettling feeling of old sci-fi movies.Sam Rockwell really shines in his double performance, especially in the skin of the first character, showing what a great actor he is. The changes of clothing are minimal, but his performance really gives life to two different people. Really, this is a performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. In fact, Rockwell makes the movie, as it is him who carries the weight of the story and makes it believable.Keven Spacey, the voice of robot Girty, is not especially inspired, though, as his voice is dull and plain and improper of a robot like the one in the movie, which is very chunky, heavy and not that developed. One would expect 1/ a more mechanical voice, if the robot is as it looks 2/ a more human voice, with more human inflexions and tone, in case the chunkiness is just apparent.The storyline is excellent, but the script and the mood of the movie get deflated mid way, as the movie does not have a marked tempo and the in crescendo necessary for the viewer to get excited and anxious towards the end. Although the story carries on very well, there is not enough tension and mystery to give the movie the little push up it need it to get a more rounder film.I hated the voice in off at the end, summarizing what happens at the arrival to earth... which I found a little bit cheesy and unnecessary, unless you want to shoot another movie departing from that.The DVD contained a short film ""The Whistle"", which I found quite interesting, with good ideas and characters, but dull and with not enough dramatic and mystery tension.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Possibly the most moving Sci-Fi ever made,"A genuinely touching sci-fi film set in a not too distant but very grim future where the only solution to the energy crisis is to mine for ores on the moon.

The current employee of lunar industries is coming up to the end of his 3 year stint and is desperate to get home to his wife and newly born daughter, however all is not as it seems. Upon investigating a damaged piece of machinery he discovers another person, himself. Sam isn't sure whether he is mad or if there is something more going on.Something of an emotional roller-coaster, not in the least bit pretentious with the plot, rather focusing on the moral end ethical implications of Sam's predicament. There are many scenes where holding back tears can be rather difficult.Overall, this is one of the best films I have ever seen, made even better with Clint Mansells haunting soundtrack.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good, but not great","""Moon"" has a lot of things going for itself: Duncan Jones' direction is unagitated and focused, Clint Mansell wrote an atmospheric score (once again) and Sam Rockwell finally delivers that one performance that absolutely puts him on the map as the great actor he apparently is. Still, I found myself looking at the watch a couple of times during the movie.While ""Moon"" has an intriguing premise, the mystery is not really in the center of the story. In fact, this mystery is solved pretty quickly. Problem is that a pretty existentialist thought arises from the fact that the main character has to deal with meeting someone who looks just like him, but that this thought is never really elaborated on. What could have been a highly philosophical movie that takes a stance on human nature, ended up as more of a science- fiction-drama.Make no mistake, ""Moon"" is well worth seeing, but it's not in the same league as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Solaris"" as it strives to be. It is, however, a promising start for Jones' career, so all eyes on this new talent and his upcoming projects!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good, Real, Brilliant Sci-Fi!","Zowie Bowie (a.k.a. Duncan Jones) has completely knocked this one out of the park, to use a baseball metaphor. He has conceived and directed this art-house science-fiction masterpiece, which I'd rank right up there with all my favorites. I'll happily go see whatever he decides to direct next.(To give this some reference point, my favorites tend towards the dark and thoughtful and include Blade Runner, Silent Running, Dark Star, 2001, Iron Giant, and Gattaca, in no particular order and for various reasons.)This film surpasses them all for existential musings, corporate malfeasance and the most understated zinger of an ending. Pay _real_ close attention at the very end.The acting is excellent. Kevin Spacey is superb as the voice of Gerty 3000, as is Sam Rockwell as the excessively flesh-and-blood Sam Bell. The science part is pretty good, mirroring some very real strategies for mining the moon. And, I just can't say enough about the story. Rock solid sci-fi for real old-school sci-fi fans of dark fiction.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Exciting concept, well-made low-budget but a bit naive","The premise is great, the acting, directing and set decoration are excellent, but I personally found that Moon lacked some edge. The big flaw here is that Gerty the robot is too much benevolent and tractable to create tension. Maybe Kubrick set too high a standard with HAL-9000, then Tarkovski introduced too much intellectualized poetry before Spielberg capped it all with his heavy sentimentalism. Unfortunately Duncan Jones seems more at ease with these two than with Kubrick's inescapable noir vision.Moon feels more like these naive ""flower power"" SF movies of the seventies (Logan's Run, Silent Running) than like a sharp homage to 2001. Even Saturn 3, despite its flaws, is way more edgier.In the end it's OK because it is so well done, but it could have been much better with a script polish delivering a better suspense with increasingly more actual danger for the hero.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I'm over the moon about Moon,"We all saw Castaway. You didn't? Well you didn't miss anything. It was two plus hours of Tom Hanks pretending he was a good actor and talking to a volleyball. It was completely forgettable and utterly boring. Okay, maybe I'm being a little harsh, but it was a painfully average movie. Tom Hanks tried his best, but he just couldn't pull it off. And the themes of isolation and pain just didn't come through very well. I had a tough time feeling sorry for Tom and his absent wife (even when he got home and found her remarried). I didn't really buy him talking to the volleyball (it felt like he was just pretending to be a little crazy so he could instantly snap back to sanity once he was rescued, and we always knew he would be rescued), and I don't think anyone else did either. I wouldn't say I hated the movie, but I did completely dismiss it a few days after watching it. I absolutely cannot dismiss Moon. This is one of those movies that gets under your skin. It's one of those rare gems that leaves an impression, one of those movies that simultaneously impresses and inspires you. It's one of those movies that lifts you up only after beating you down. The drama is realistic, and it's filled with passion and anger and depression and hope. Sam Rockwell does what Tom Hanks couldn't do, he carries the movie mostly on his own. read the full review at www.tickleishpickle.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best 2009,"I saw this with a group of fellow film students, so they were ready to bash the film as we were standing in line at the concession stand. There were a lot of negative/mixed commentaries about set design about homages to Blade runner and the pacing that I heard after the movie, but to me it stood as a really fantastic indie (well not really it's still a 5 million budget) a true directorial debut of Duncan Jones, the movie has great poetry to it in my opinion which is hard to achieve in sci-fi movie. Love the idea of the script - certainly something that hasn't been exploited as much in indie films. It did run a bit too long but as I think about it you kind of needed that to play it as a character study rather then a suspense sci-fi movie. I get the thinking process behind casting of Spacey, but that was a bit of a problem for me personally just because he is enormous and his voice is so overpowering in this scale of a film your mind jumps to that immediately when you hear him for the first few times. The movie to me also had that great feeling of an 80's sci-fi mainly because of set design and the fact that this genre lately has only been done with ridiculous budgets. Please see it and judge for yourself because it makes an unique impression on pretty much anyone who sees it",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Pays homage to sci-fi classics of the 70's,"First of all, I didn't know that the director of this movie was David Bowie's son, Duncan Jones, until I read about it in here. It wouldn't have mattered, a good film is a good film, no matter who did it.This film reminds me heavily of sci-fi classics from the late 60's and 70's. I was reminded of ""2001"", ""Silent Running"", and even the TV show ""Space 1999"". This might be because I think the special effects were achieved through model-making like they used to in the 70's, rather than computer CGI as they do nowadays. It shows that there's still a place for model-making, and in certain circumstances it looks more realistic than CGI.The filmmaker even uses our knowledge of these past films against us. For example, we're all used to the evil computer HAL on 2001. So when we watch the computer on this base, GERTY, we have certain assumptions about its motives, and thus we're surprised by its actual motives in the end. Even the use of the actor Kevin Spacey, as the voice of GERTY aids in the illusion, since we know his roles from the past where he's played some very strange characters, makes us think this is going to be similar to one of his old roles.Sam Rockwell's performance was excellent, as Sam Bell. And we shouldn't forget Robin Chalk's performance as a young Sam Bell. I would say that the actors, Rockwell, Spacey, Chalk were actually part of making the special effects illusion work.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Hard Sci-Fi,"Moon stars Sam Rockwell and Sam Rockwell. Oh and Kevin Spacey's voice. Yeah this movie may seem small in scale, budget and release. But the movie explores many thought provoking ideas that I absolutely love.Moon is a story about isolation, loneliness and reality. It is a great movie that makes you think. While I've heard many people say Moon is boring I must say I was never bored while watching the film. It was an excellent movie experience. The movie sucked me in and I was trapped for the rest of the film. It made me think, it made me sad and a plethora of emotions rushed through me while watching the film.Sam Rockwell seriously got screwed over at the Oscars, because his performance in this movie is just magnificent. Duncan Jones, the director of the movie really set the bar high for his next movies, because this is a science fiction masterpiece. Especially considering the relatively small budget they used for the film. They just milked every penny out of that budget to create this and I can really appreciate it when filmmakers do that.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"An interesting and thought-provoking movie, that, however, isn't always entertaining","Even if science fiction movies aren't your cup of tea, some products of this genre manage to move and entertain you way beyond the simple idea of life in outer space. 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of these films. Blade Runner or Solaris as well. And the newest addition to this small amount of movies is the debut by David Bowie's son, Duncan Jones. The Briton explores life in complete solitude with Sam Rockwell doing one of the best turns in his career in the hugely affecting Sundance drama Moon.An obviously HAL-3000-commemorative electronic pal named GERTY who has his voice lent by Kevin Spacey tells Rockwell's protagonist that his days without any interactions with other human beings are coming to an end in one of the first scenes of this movie. The three-year moon mission he's been doing is in its final stadium and he, sharing the first name with the actor that plays him, can look forward on seeing his wife again and his young daughter for the first time. It is clear that Sam isn't in his peak form, yet he is a sensible guy that doesn't show any alerting signs of illnesses. For now. A couple scenes later, hallucinations start to kick in, and they turn out to be the reason for a momentous crash that starts the detection part of the movie. A mindblowing explanation for everything that happens in Moon is revealed, but in parts, so that the audience can utter their wows in an even order. While the introduction scenes in the movie seem to foreshadow a too realistic and thus boring approach to the story, Jones reveals his talent for creating suspense later on and while becoming more and more confused, the audience also develops a greater bond to the protagonist respectively the movie itself.Besides the amazing one-man-job that Sam Rockwell delivers, the subliminal references to the sci-fi classics that influenced writer/director Duncan Jones, or the realistic design the team managed to call into existence, the distinctly biggest asset of Moon are the many important questions it poses. To reveal them would be a spoiler in a lot of cases and I think that it becomes clear what you should think about when you're watching the movie. To just give you an impression of the movie's philosophy (without getting into spoiler territory): How much do people need other people to survive? What does it mean exactly to be human? Where are the verges of morality?I personally found Moon to be a very interesting and thought-provoking movie that was also deeply stirring and emotional. The great score by Clint Mansell (the genius behind Requiem for a Dream's music) gave the scenes an auxiliary touching effect and, as I've already mentioned, Sam Rockwell acts absolutely masterfully. The visuals are definitely not as interesting as in some other movies of its genre, yet the look is quite an achievement if you consider the small budget. An issue that pretty much everyone will face while watching Moon is that it tends to be quite tedious and you will really lose interest during some of the long wordless shots. However, that didn't bother me that much since there were lots of other well-made scenes and the general feeling I had while watching the movie, which was an unsettling sadness. Moon is relatively unique and impressing and I'd recommend it to everyone who appreciates material to think about when watching a movie.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Rather clever and well done,"Oh no, a space movie without lasers, aliens or other supernatural happenings. Sam is nearing the end of his three year contract on a moon industrial plant that is harvesting He-3, which is then sent back to earth and provides 70% of the energy to power the planet, all clean energy. It may be low budget, but it has high budget looks. Sam's only companion is a computer named Gerty, who is programed to protect him. Immediately, one will notice that they are not operating under low gravity as would be on the moon. In fact, there is only one scene where Sam is bounding over the surface of the moon outside. But so what, it is the story, not the special effects that are important. Sam's performance carries the movie. Sam came to feel that three years is much too long, and as the end gets near hallucinates. And on Earth, he has his wife and infant daughter and he cannot wait to get back. Everything regarding harvesting the He-3 is automated, and all he has to do is collect the canisters, and ship them back to earth.

Excellent SciFI film that has a plausible storyline around a topical subject for today.,"I have been waiting for a film that is as good as 2001-Space Odyssey, Moon comes close. With a similar theme but based on a more realistic scenario this film brings a possible future situation nearer when we are looking for good commercial reasons for returning to the Moon and the urgent need to find alternative sources of power. The excellent acting by Sam Rockwell and directing by Duncan Jones shows that SciFi's films do not need aliens and zombies to produce excitement, tension and visual drama. Gerty, the computer who looks after Sam Bell, the sole inhabitant of an automated lunar mining base extracting Helium-3 from lunar rocks for Earth's Fusion reactors, is, like Hal in 2001 but not so sinister.

Sam Rockwell Steps Up in Moon,"While space conspiracies have been done to death, Moon stands out as the most heartbreaking. Rarely has a science-fiction film made issues such as isolation and the notion of self so affecting. That Moon treats these issues with respect and that it does so with heart and humour makes astronaut Sam Bell's story all the more tragic.Earth scientists have discovered Helium-3, a clean-form of minable energy on the moon. Following the tradition of suspect corporations in sci-fi films, Lunar Industries sends astronauts to operate the mining equipment. Bell, played by Sam Rockwell, is at the end of his three year journey. Struggling with loneliness and betrayal, Bell's physical and mental deterioration is immediately noticeable, and gradually becomes poignant.While obvious influences include 2001: A Space Odyssey, Alien and Blade Runner, Moon diverges from the genre by focusing on the purely human element of space exploration. In a way its closest relative is Gattaca, delivering a pseudo-scientific approach to understanding humanity in a truly cinematic experience. Whilst director and co-writer Duncan Jones includes elements of sci-fi, and enough suspense and mystery to establish an intriguing storyline, the film draws its strength from Rockwell's hugely empathetic and surprisingly humorous Bell. Played by anyone else, Bell could easily be overly-pitiful. Rockwell succeeds in making him likable enough to warrant our affections, making his ultimate, and potentially clichéd, line, ""I just want to go home"", heartbreaking. Nevertheless the films strength, a focus on character over large scale special effects, could be its commercial weakness. Standard fans of sci-fi might be disappointed by the use of models and limited effects, although they have been used convincingly. Instead the movie is aimed at art-house patrons, and will hopefully garner a cult following. A character piece, Moon remains a sweet and much needed deviation from the genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Approaching the end of his three-year shift, his isolation is exacerbated by technical problems hitting the link to his earthly wife and child.

Trapped... In The Moon,"Duncan Jones's 'Moon' is perhaps THE most underrated movie of 2009. Not that I consider these film awards highly credible but how can an obviously remarkable movie like this one get overlooked? Jones's film pays homage to many sci-fi classics but 'Moon' is very much its own film as the story is original.Made under a tight budget, Jones has used models rather than depend completely on CGI and that only gives 'Moon' a rather authentic look than the CGI world one has so often witnessed in other sci-fi films. That said, the special effects department have done a terrific job in being minimal and subtle. The score is also very subtle and highly effective. The sets are simplistic but they really capture the detachment of the atmosphere and the loneliness and sense of isolation of Sam Bell. Jones has put a lot of heart into the writing while Parker has done a great job with the screenplay.Jones specifically wrote the part of Sam Bell for Sam Rockwell and what a gift and honour it must be for an actor to have someone write a movie especially for him. It's a bit disappointing that Rockwell's tour du force performance has been criminally overlooked as it's easily one of the best (if not THE best) performances of the year (easily beats 'Hurt Locker's Jeremy Renner and maybe even 'Up In The Air's George Clooney).'Moon' certainly isn't your average science fiction film. There are no aliens or explosions or save-the-world missions. It's been a while since I had seen an original science fiction film since 'Sunshine' and then comes 'Moon' like a breath of fresh air, a movie that is exhilarating, poignant and inspiring.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Smart and interesting.,"Rockwell gives an excellent performance, which is good since he is almost the whole cast.Sam is a likable character as a man who has had no human company for 3 years and we see the effects of the isolation on him.GERTY is a nice touch, a robot that uses smileys as it's only means of expression.The pace of the film is very slow, almost dreamlike at times, and it makes it hard to get in to.The plot has several stages each with a different plot twist, some predictable and some not and you are gradually dragged into caring about what happens to Sam.The ending is consistent and very well done.A nice gentle film, and a rare intelligent sci-fi, no explosions here!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The idea was good, effects were OK but story was week","The movie is about a space man, working on the moon to harvest some sort of energy source. After his three years of serve, he finally deserves to return back to home. Right before that, he realizes things are not as they look about his life. After this short summary, let me write my humble ideas about the movie. In general, I enjoyed the movie but reading some comments on IMDb, it is ultra over-exaggerated. First of all, this is one of the most boring movie I have ever seen. It has a nice idea but a bad plot. I would prefer more action and the story could have been much more interesting. I know a lot of people will disagree with me but honestly, if you are a hard core science fiction fan like me, you expect a good idea, good plot and nice CGI. The idea was good, effects were OK but story was week. Especially end of the movie was pathetic.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A masterpiece,Years after I sat down and watched this film I am still remembering just how much of an impact it had on me. It is a masterclass in filmmaking. Everything about this film is so well done. I often talk about this film with others after watching yet another mundane green screen over hyped CGI heavy modern film. They just don't make them like this anymore. This film is intellectually stimulating and still to this day one of the best films I have seen. It's a simple concept and in reality and on paper sounds rather dull. However it completely draws you into the world and you feel incredibly isolated and alone through the pace and camera work. And the ending oh boy the ending is just beautiful.,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Modern sci-fi masterpiece,"There are very few interesting or original science fiction films made anymore, usually they production places all of its emphasis on special effects and space invaders.I had heard great reviews about this film before I originally saw it and I was not disappointed. I won't spoil the plot but the themes are interesting and emotive. There is a depressing almost hopeless theme throughout about loss, Insignificance and identity and that is conveyed by Sam Rockwell's stunning performance. Spacey who voices the initially sinister seeming AI character is adds to the unsettling and claustrophobic atmosphere in a similar way to HAL in 2001 where you can't help draw comparisons. Clint Mansell's soundtrack is beautiful and fits perfectly. It's a more accessible film to 2001 and Solaris but equally powerful. You won't need to be a sci-fi fan to appreciate this, one of the best films of recent years.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"MOON (Duncan Jones, 2009) ***","The first thing that needs to be said (and which might not be readily apparent to the uninformed) is that director Duncan Jones is David Bowie's son i.e. he who was formerly known as Zowie Bowie. MOON is a quietly impressive directorial debut that was deservedly much acclaimed and most of its success hinges on a tour-de-force central performance from Sam Rockwell – playing triple roles in what is virtually a one-man-show. The plot-line would initially seem to be reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968) – the interaction between astronaut and the human-voiced computer (dispassionately provided here by Kevin Spacey) – and Douglas Trumbull's SILENT RUNNING (1972) – the isolation of the astronaut on an ecological mission; however, the twist revelation in the middle swerves it admirably into the realm of Andrei Tarkovsky's SOLARIS (1972)...not to mention any number of clones/replicants/surrogates scenarios we have seen in the last 30 years! This is certainly not to say that MOON is simply a rehash of past sci-fi fare but merely to highlight the fact that the film-makers know their stuff and, consequently, have managed to make something equally worthwhile despite the thematic echoes. Two further assets to the production that bear mentioning are Clint Mansell's evocative score (with, I might add, no use of Bowie Snr.'s epochal ""Space Oddity"" anywhere) and the predominant whites in the production design.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great sci-fi movie. Immersive and moving.,"For a sci-fi fun, as i am, this was, behind Avatar, the best sci-fi of the 2009 (i should say one of the best the latest years or also i could say one between the best of all time).There are not great effects or cgi in here, it didn't need any. But the ones used match perfectly the place and the needs.I liked everything of this movie, the plot, the direction, the superb acting of Sam Rockwell, the atmosphere, also the music was so great (i grabbed the Clint Mansell main theme immediately). It was exceptional as a single actor entertained the whole movie, and let me felt in his same shoes.Not less i was deeply moved about the story. This can be called sci-fi but it's also almost a far future possible situation.From this movie on I wrote down the name of the emerging director Duncan Jones and waited his next movie. He did ""Source Code"" then, that was not good as this one but another very well made sci-fi movie anyway. So I'm looking ahead for his next opera.This is a moving, mystery drama overall. A mature one. Perfectly done in every aspect. A masterpiece, and not just in its own genre, to me.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Cerebrally Beguiling Lunar Confection,"Moon is a fascinating, ingenious, and original sci-fi/fantasy film by first-time (full-length) director, Duncan Jones.It is another small, sly, well-made sci-fi flick like Primer; but it is more stylish and polished like the equally-brainy Gattaca.Sam Rockwell (Charlie's Angels, Matchstick Men, Iron Man 2) delivers a commanding performance as the lone astronaut-miner on the moon -- he is excellent here and was easily one of the better of 2009 (ahem, way to look the other way Academy!!). Kevin Spacey (American Beauty, Se7en, The Usual Suspects) is soothing as the voice of GERTY (Moon's HAL 9000).Moon is nearly perfect with what it sets out to achieve.

Great matinée movie for us ponderers,"Nicely pulled off by all concerned though I kind of missed a more mindful treatment of our moon's low gravity.I once asked an official from NASA why we hadn't set up a listening station on the far side of the moon. He mentioned in his answer that psychologically it would be extremely difficult. This movie seems to explore that notion though it's unclear to me whether it's actually supposed to take place on the far side or not.I would have rented the movie if I'd heard it was some long unrelenting saga of psychological deterioration (which I need like a hole in the head). And, though it definitely spends some time on that, it also delves into much more entertaining stuff: Things like questions of identity and what is permissible in our mindless pursuit of profit.I'd have to admit, however, that my wife was bored.

Surprisingly effective low-budget sci-fi,"Moon was a surprisingly effective low-budget science fiction film. It's the story of Sam Bell, a lone astronaut assigned to duty on the moon where he mines the helium that will supply the Earth's energy needs. Sam's sole companion is Gerty, a computer that invokes memories of Hal from 2001. Sam has almost completed his tour and is looking forward to returning to his home on Earth when he starts to have strange visions of other people.Upon hearing the above scenario, I expected a sort of sci-fi psychological thriller where things weren't what they appeared and the purpose of the movie would be to uncover the truth. Well, all I'll say to that notion is that Moon took a path that I wasn't expecting, but one which I found to be unique and refreshing. And that uniqueness is really the film's biggest strength.Moon is a bit different from your typical sci-fi flick. It's light on special effects and space isn't quite the last frontier or intergalactic playground presented in other sci-fi films. Here, it's more like a empty void that separates us from the ones we love.This is a character-driven movie where the focus is on the characters and how they react to a highly unusual situation. The pacing is slow, even leisurely at times. As the story plays out, thought-provoking questions are raised around the topics of ethics, isolation, home, identity and even the purpose of one's life.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

But then an accident occurs that sets off a spiral of events that changes everything on this moon base and the whole direction of the film. It is a very clever film that will keep your attention and together with the superb acting from Rockwell, the genius voice part from Spacey and the tremendous soundtrack I had to give this film a ten out of ten. It may not be the best film I ever see but it cannot be faulted in its execution and that is why I give it a ten rating.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best Science-Fiction films ever made,"I can definitely say that Moon is the film that resembles 2001: A Space Odyssey the most. Since I saw 2001 around two years ago, I have declared it the best film ever made. While I doubt any film will ever take that spot, no other film made me feel the way 2001 did besides Moon.Moon's plot revolves around one astronaut, Sam Bell (played by Sam Rockwell), who works in Lunar Industries and is waiting until the day he sees his family again. However, after a hallucination causes serious implications, his whole plan changes. I do not want to give more away, because I think the less you know about the film before you see it the better. Moon has a solitary and somber tone to it, one that haunted me and amazed me. This is Duncan Jones' first project, and he proved he is a director to watch. The beautiful look of the moon and the cinematography were captivating. The colors supported the film's tone, and as did the great music score by Clint Mansell. While it is true this film owes a lot to other films, particularly 2001, it stands on it's own. Whereas 2001 was more about human evolution and technology, Moon is about the loneliness and despair of one man. It is a much more character-driven film than 2001. Sam Rockwell is brilliant. He plays his character with different depths and feelings, and I thought he was the perfect choice. Kevn Spacey voiced GERTY (the similar character to HALL 2000) with the perfect amount of emotion, or sometimes lack of emotion. The film was unpredictable, and as it went along you realize more and more about what the industries are about, and learn more about Sam Bell.Moon was a compelling debut from Jones, and I found it hard to believe that the budget was just $5 Million. Definitely one of my favorite sci-fi films, and probably the decade's best, along with Donnie Darko (if you can call that sci-fi). A beautiful and exhilarating film, the best yet of 2009.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"The Dark Side of ""Moon""","If Roman Polanski ever considered bringing his trademark obsessions (isolation, paranoia, delusion, hallucination) to the science fiction arena, the result would probably be close to what Duncan Jones achieves with ""Moon,"" a deliberately off-kilter study of an astronaut's descent into neuroses and existential delerium. Sam Rockwell (in the first truly outstanding performance I've seen from him) plays Sam Bell, who mans a corporate-owned space station on the moon (its function? to divert environment-sustaining elemental capsules to Earth); in the final 3 weeks of his 3-year commitment to the job, his grip on sanity begins to erode. An automated robot named Gerty 3000 (voiced with chilling lack of emotion by Kevin Spacey) is his sole ""companion"" (whose only ""expressions"" are confined to creepy Emoticons). The strength of Rockwell's performance is amplified by how convincingly Jones conceives the barren surface of the moon--there are long shots that carry a hauntingly chilling emptiness, and only underline the inner frailty of his protagonist. While ""Moon"" certainly isn't for all tastes (its deliberate pace and design seems destined for cult status), adventurous fans of cerebral cinema will find much to like.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lost in the shuffle but a MUST see,I first encountered the extraordinarily unique actor Mr. Sam Rockwell holding his own and almost stealing every scene of Galaxy Quest. From that moment on he joined a very short list of actors of mine where I don't need to know a single thing about the movie because if Sam Rockwell is in it; I'll watch it.Sam Rockwell gives yet another commanding performance telling the story of an astronaut solely responsible for maintaining a facility on the Moon and sending energy materials back to Earth. Mid way through the movie there is a turn of events and Rockwell masters his role and to subtly encourage a very relevant and necessary debate. His interaction with GERTY and video calling from the Moon is haunting and you feel his aching solitude through the screen and become to empathise and support the lone crusader living to selflessly serve humanity.You may have missed this one as it slipped under the radar but once you've watched it you'll appreciate it.,8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An interesting concept that lacks substance,"I had heard a lot of talk about Duncan Jones' Moon before viewing, with many critics toting is as a ""sci-fi masterpiece"" and comparing it to the genre's best. While I do think that Moon has an interesting concept, it ultimately lacks substance. Moon tries to be something out-of-this-world but simply cannot make anything interesting happen with its ideas.The idea of isolation in space is nothing original, but if done correctly, can create an intensely immersive and rich environment to get lost in, as well as give us a chance to connect with the human character(s). Despite the low budget and limited set designs, Moon does manage to create a somewhat immersive environment (even though it does kind of look the same as every other movie sharing the same concept). The set design is alright for the most part.Now the characters are really what drive the force of this movie and this aspect was probably the best the movie had to offer. Kevin Spacey's icy and relaxed mannerism in delivering lines was perfect for Gertie and Sam Rockwell gave an excellent performance interacting with both Gertie and himself. The character interaction was by far the most entertaining part of the film. The script was tightly written and the story was interesting enough. Although many questions are left unanswered, I didn't find it worth the time to try to figure them out.Moon has a massive flaw though, which is the reason why I think it is only slightly above average in terms of sci-fi. The film severely lacks any substance and mostly feels like filler. And don't get me wrong, I am a patient person when it comes to movies and I enjoy a slow-burner, but Moon failed to hold my attention during the first act, which led to a bad first impression of the film. There is just simply not enough going on to make me really care about what i'm watching. And the ""big reveal"" I saw from miles away, and from then on, the movie doesn't really progress much.In total, I don't think Moon is a completely awful movie. It is competently made and well acted and looks decent for it's low budget. It just never really kicks off and it left me with an empty feeling afterwards. I wrote this review only a day after I saw Moon and there is honestly not a single scene or piece of dialogue that I think I will remember after a few days.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Remember the 6th day with Arnie?,"This movie is utterly amazing and speaks of the greed and corporate control of individuals in such an abominable way.

He is tasked with maintaining the many huge helium machines roaming the moon surface and he is to collect the helium and shoot it to earth for its energy needs. Then a major accident happens and things go totally haywire and when he wakes up he's all good to go in the infirmary until he tricks the computer (think of Hal in 2001 a space odyssey) so he can go back on the surface of the moon and check out the accident site only to discover something that will blow your mind. You'll have to see this movie to figure it out and it is definitely worth it. Nothing questionable, some rear male nudity, some foul language, some sex scenes are shown but nothing graphic.

A tense and disturbing thriller,"Thrillers work best when they are allowed to slowly go from a simmer to a boil. It's a pity that Hollywood doesn't realize this, and panders to the ADD-afflicted masses, which is why we get a ton of garbage like ""Transformers"" and less movies like ""Moon."" Duncan Jones' debut film is no masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. But it does generate a good amount of tension and a pervasive sense of unease.In the near future, most of the world's power is being harvested from rock on the moon. The base is occupied by one person at a time for a three year contract. This time around, it's by Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), and he's only got three weeks left. But the isolation is really beginning to take its toll on him, and he senses that his mental state is quickly beginning to unravel.I don't want to give anything away, but the film can be confusing. ""Moon"" is a sci-fi/mystery, so naturally the tension revolves around the answers to unknown questions. But good thrillers of this ilk leave viewers hungry for answers. I was left confused and somewhat irritated by the film for much of the running time. Much of that has to do with Jones' handling of the material.However, the film looks great. For a film with a mere 5 million dollar budget, ""Moon"" looks like it was made with a budget 50 times that. I felt like I had been on the moon for three years, and that kind of claustrophobic tension is the film's greatest success.This is a one-character show (well, two, if you count GERTY, a robot who is voiced by Kevin Spacey). A bad performance could tank the project, but fortunately the film's central character is being played by up-and-coming character actor Sam Rockwell, who continues to impress with one terrific performance after another. Rockwell is terrific as a man on the edge, and his desperation is actually rather heartbreaking. Kevin Spacey is brilliant as the helpful GERTY. I haven't heard a voice this soothing since Goran Visnjic in ""Close Your Eyes."" There are many laudable qualities to this film, but the amount of time I spent confused was too much for me to give more than a weak recommendation. Still, this is a film where the trailer gives almost nothing about the plot (for once). Not that that has anything to do with the quality of the film...My rating: PG-13 for language.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"""I want to go home""","Calling a film ""the antithesis to Transformers 2"" may not seem the most obvious complimentary statement, yet that has, comically enough, been the most common plaudit bestowed on director Duncan Jones' Moon. Most critics have heralded the film as a welcome bout of intelligence in a summer where science fiction is generally synonymous with explosions. Which is entirely true, and would be an unremarkable compliment, were it not for the fact that to distill Moon to simply being an intelligent film released in a season where thoughtfulness is a rare quality in mainstream cinema would be a notable instance of short- sightedness, for Jones' film is a rather remarkable concoction, and one well worth seeing regardless of the season or year.While the science fiction genre is known for examining the future, Moon, while set 15 years from present time, clearly has its eye on the past. With a wonderfully nostalgic lo-fi veneer, complete with chunky lunar buggies and medical style white walled space station, Jones picks his influences well, paying homage to the wealth of slow burning, existential science fiction ruminations of the 1960s and 1970s (most obviously Kubrik's 2001), both visually and thematically without ever drifting into over the top excessively cheeky referencing. And yet, Moon proves an appealing contradiction, as, despite its lofty, challenging ideas, they are presented in a format far more accessible, unpretentious and easy to follow than most of the past efforts it emulates, as if determined to meld a mainstream template with a more elaborate, art cinema aesthetic. The hybridity works, making Moon far more than a mere throwback film, and a far more beguiling and intriguing take on content both familiar and new.The word of choice is sparse, as Jones captures the cold isolation of solitary employment on a space station with particularly chilling efficiency, using expansive yet claustrophobia inducing sets to deftly craft a sense of continual unease and discontent, exceptionally amplified by Clint Mansell's minimalist piano score. But what makes Jones' film stand out amongst countless other science fiction efforts with coldly pristine visuals ruminating on the essence and meaning of humanity are its welcome moments of warmth and humour. From the blinking smiley face of robotic companion GERTY (superbly voiced by a monotone Kevin Spacey) to protagonist Sam Bell's teary fondling the screen while playing a tape of his daughter back on earth, seldom do such films dare to engage with the heart as much as the brain - less detached and far more engrossing through its emotional resonance.Above all else, it is the exceptional performance of Sam Rockwell which anchors the film. Stuck with essentially a solitary show in a static location, Rockwell delivers a triumphant character study without unnecessary showboating, compellingly portraying Bell's intense loneliness, boredom and gradual mental instability through perfectly calculated frantic bursts between manic energy and subdued pain. Never anything less than riveting while quietly unassuming, the always wonderful Rockwell has rarely been better, and his work here proves concrete testament of his star calibre charisma and presence.Thought provoking yet accessible, slow burning yet consistently engaging, Moon proves the ideal reprocessing of the science fiction of old, blending familiar visuals and themes with recent ones into something fundamentally new. While it may not quite be profound or innovative enough to mark a new staple in the genre, Moon marks a large step for the contemporary relevance of science fiction, being easily worth examining for those seeking out intelligent life in the dark recesses of modern cinema.-8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Ground control to director Jones. Can you hear me? You've made a good 'un.,"Moon quite wonderfully captures the sheer vastness of science fiction and yet works as equally well, if not better as, a stripped down and simplistic study of the human condition. Moon is a project all about the sorts of themes, ideas and emotions that have been, and will always be, acquitted with humankind; whatever the year and wherever the locale. On this occasion, the emotions and thematic elements of isolation and loneliness are explored under the watchful eye of the science-fiction genre and unravel on Planet Earth's sole Moon. And then there's the word 'Moon', merely four letters long but used to describe something so big; so exciting; so mysterious and so seemingly far away. Jupier get something ridiculous like sixty of the damn things, we only get the one.Here, the titular satellite orbiting our planet is used as a backdrop for some rather humbling scenes revolving around raw human emotion; some confusion and ambiguity as the lines between drama and horror are blurred as well as a scathing attack on the working commercial world in which we live and work. ""Where are we now?"" asks the voice in the opening scene, a montage of the vast technological developments of our time. Where indeed are we now? Going by both Moon's content and overall study, the developments over time in regards to modernity have aided those big, evil corporations by expanding into space and putting people through the proverbial sausage factory without them even realising. Without spoiling anything too greatly: ""Where are we now?"" – technology and the ability to travel into space and set up on the Moon has advanced in the world of this film, but the same old humankind ideologies of working for a set period; doing your time; outliving your usefulness and then being 'replaced' seem to have stuck.You get that feeling writer/director Duncan Jones identifies his setting as a wide, eye-opening and somewhat beautiful place if you looked at it right, and yet deliberately keeps everything restricted; locked down and focused on those within the small space centre in which most of the events unfold. Jones' ability to cover so much ground and yet essentially keep his characters within the parameters of half a dozen rooms is extraordinary, yet again acting as an example that sees people and characters journey long and far within their minds and yet only ever really cover a physical distance of a few dozen feet – let's say half a mile when they're outside on the Moon's surface.Moon sees a certain American astronaut by the name of Sam (Rockwell) suffer, struggle and eventually come to limp his way through what can only really be described as some sort of tour of duty, on the Moon, working for a large company called Lunar Industries - the word 'luna', of which, is Spanish for 'Moon'. His role sees him wake up; do whatever he needs to initially do; talk to the base's on board computer, named GERTY (Spacey), about this and that before spending not-all-that-much-time extracting 'Helium-3' from the Moon's soil so that it may be used back on Earth for certain purposes. For all the technology; for all the awe of supposedly travelling to the Moon and being situated on the Moon for 'x' number of months, the job boils down to that of a farmer, or that of a bean counter trained to push a few buttons and shift incoming 'goods'. This changes, however, a while into the film when a crash in a vehicle outside on the surface kicks off some rather strange events.It is again to Jones' great credit that he keeps the momentum and the intensity going throughout the build up to a rather dramatic unveiling later on. I think it's fair to say at this point that a second Sam turns up for whatever reason, but the film draws us into the first Sam's mindset so much that interpretation and guess-work will still play a part on the viewer's behalf when sitting down to watch it. Sam comes across as weak, soft-bodied even, in his mannerisms and general behaviour when hallucinations of women sitting in chairs and eerie images of himself decked out in full astronaut gear reaching up from the bottom of a bed become apparent. He watches video messages from back home; they glitch and skip a beat - is something up? Is he going mad? Is the machinery wearing out, or is HE beginning to wear out to some degree. Moon draws on inspiration from some pretty far reaching and understandably heavy weight science fiction films from decades gone by; drawing on inspiration from and paying homage to, but never feeling like trying to go higher than. Jones knows the level he's at here, and with this as his rather accomplished debut, anticipating his next venture will be a joy.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Not the next big thing, but a great movie nevertheless","With only three weeks left in his three year contract, Sam Bell is getting anxious to finally return to Earth. He is the only occupant of a Moon-based manufacturing facility along with his computer and assistant, GERTY. The long period of time alone however has resulted in him talking to himself for the most part, or to his plants. Direct communication with Earth is not possible due to a long-standing communication malfunction but he does get an occasional message from his wife Tess. When he has an accident however, he wakens to find that he is not alone. He also comes to realize that his world is not what he thought it was...Moon is a very interesting and promising debut from director Duncan Jones.This independent film has been extremely talked about and acclaimed by most critics and everyone in general.Many comparisons have been made and obviously,Sam's companion, Gerty, the computer voiced by Kevin Spacey, is a clear reminder of Hal from ""2001,A Space Odyssey"" but the comparisons should end there.They are completely different films and Moon,although being a very refreshing piece of work that stands on his own doesn't have what it takes to become such an all-time classic as 2001.Moon raises some very interesting questions when it comes to existentialism, and the circle of life and it is thought-provoking but Kubrik's film is a surreal journey that goes from the very beginning of the human kind to the space age,it's a roller coaster of emotions and the film was way before its time therefor it can't be compared to Moon.And don't get me wrong, Moon is a very good film with a great screenplay and feels like a breath of fresh air,however, it's not the ""next big thing"" as it has been dubbed by some. I have to say that Sam Rockwell's performance is amazing,after all this is basically a one man show and he nailed it, he carries the film on his back and at the same time the film relies on him immensely which makes his performance the central piece of Moon.In conclusion,Moon is great watch and a must see for Sci Fi fans.7.5/10",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Outstanding, one of the best sci-fi","It is a movie that has great elements. Maybe this is Sam Rockwell's best acting, filled with passion in scenes that get interesting as the story develops, in a very entertaining sequence of scenes that kept me attached to watching it since the early minutes. Although most of these scenes tried (successfully) to picture quite complex drama from the beautiful story, but Rockwell added his own touch to most of these scenes, mostly due to (maybe) his own natural personality, his facial expressions, his voice, .. those many little things that a professional actor uses to make you forget for a moment that this is a sci-fi movie. Moon has many of such moments in fact.I didn't believe at first that this is the first real cinema movie made by the director Duncan Jones. It was a very solid cornerstone, and there is no surprise that it was followed by a series of great movies, Source Code (2011), and Warcraft (2016).The movie is perfect. I liked it a lot.

Well-crafted,"For its first feature, the English Duncan Jones delivers a solid, almost completely behind closed doors movie that puts the emphasis on Sam Rockwell, very well directed and whose excellent performance truly illuminates the film by its accuracy. The plot is relatively simple but executed to perfection and not too long — it only lasts an 1h30 which becomes increasingly rare these days. The script suggests interesting questions about ethics, and a well thought-out critic of capitalism and what it could bring in a more or less near future.An interesting point regarding Moon is its budget: 5 million dollars. It is very low for a sci-fi movie like that, therefore Jones logically opted for old school FX for most of the illusions. The end result is good, even though one has to admit some shots look really fake. The cinematography on the whole is good but some editing choices are a bit questionable with some bizarrely unnecessary shots or abrupt linking between scenes.Nevertheless, Moon remains a well-crafted movie even though it misses a little something extra, maybe a bit more tension and suspense, which certainly would have made the experience even better.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Even if you're not into Sci-fi ... this is a great film about humanity.,"I just wanted to add another positive comment here for this film as I just watched it and thoroughly enjoyed it.There are many elements to the movie but it's real bullseye is the space/moon location with it's loneliness and isolation, as you watch you get sucked into a world that, although far from anyone's reality, you kind of feel inside that one day people could be living lives like this. I even found myself wondering just if I would be able to cope with such a life. Probably not! My reference to this film saying a lot about humanity...you will have to watch and go through the experience, to understand my comment there.It's hard to comment on much of the film without giving anything away so I'll just say that the acting was really good, superb.

A very emotional and surprisingly profound sci-fi movie,"How often do you see a science fiction films that don't focus or tell a story of intergalactic travel or space survival, but rather on the isolation - the loneliness in space? Not so much I'll assume. Moon is such film that is unique in its own genre, telling the story of one astronaut who is working on moon mining with the three years contract, and must be separated from his family. When his contact almost comes to an end, his health starts to deteriorate. In the meantime, he discovers another exact version of his self on the moon. He must solve this mystery before coming down to the earth. Just from the title, it explains a lot by itself. ""Moon"" is, in my opinion, a metaphor of isolation and loneliness. When we see the moon, it is up there alone close to the earth, but it will never come close to each other. Similar to the main character, he is up there on the moon alone, and he knows where his family is, but is impossible to make contact with them. He has to deal with this isolation and learn to live alone. Sam Rockwell's performance is wonderful. He has to convey the
message and express the feeling of his character all by himself without a real person to interact with. The voice performance by Kevin Spacey is excellent as well.The production is well designed. The set design is giving the sense of loneliness. It isn't the best space station set, but given the fact that this is a small budget film from Sony Picture Classic, it does fantastically in its situation. The CGl is good, but not great. However, if we compare it to many other big-budget blockbuster films, it's much better and it looks timeless. The musical score is pleasing to the ears and compliments the scenes well.All in all, Moon is a very emotional sci-fi film. It is unique and different from other films in this genre.

An absorbing psychological sci-fi drama...,"I had accepted I wouldn't be able to see this, as it was on limited release, but luckily, I found out a cinema about 45 mins away by bus way but it had only one showing at 8:30pm so I decided to go.The film begins with a ad showing a montage of children, space and how power from the moon can be used, I think. Then the film begins proper with Sam's solitary mission on the planet itself.Acting: Rockwell is convincing and believable as this lone astronaut. He single-handedly makes the film compelling as it is he we watch over the majority of the running time, which is no easy feat. A small cameo from Scodelario (Skins' Effy) who speaks with a very dodgy American accent pulled me slightly out of the spell the film had put me under, but her acting in that brief scene was fine. I only had problems with the accent.Plot: Obviously inspired from 70s sci-fi such as Alien, Silent Running et al so it's probably not doing anything original but in a year where sci-fi hasn't been that cerebral, it's nice to see a film that resembles the more old school sci-fi, made on a low budget.The main twist in it could split audiences down the middle, though. Personally, I thought it better to do it the way they did as the other way to do it has been done to death. I'm being as vague as possible so as not to give anything away, as I know from experience that spoilers that aren't warned from the outset are very unfair on unknowing people.Cinematography and SFX: For a low budget film, this certainly in my eyes has a polished look about it that doesn't betray it's modest budget. The sets, costumes, dust falling in the air etc don't look out of place to a more expensive film, to my untrained eyes. The shots look beautiful and I'd love to own a framed still of the surface of the moon from this film.I especially liked the emoticon faced robot voiced by Spacey. He seemed to nail the disembodied, somewhat emotionless voice needed for such a machine.Score: Mansell, whose Lux Aerterna from Requiem For A Dream has been so overused over the past decade to make sure the royalties he's got to be receiving will almost certainly keep his many future generations rich or at least comfortable makes a haunting, piano-led with strings(in some tracks) minimalist score that fits the film like a glove.Overall: I couldn't take my eyes off the big screen when I saw this. With an acting masterclass from Rockwell, this promising debut shows what sci-fi used to do before directors saw it as an excuse to showcase the newest advances in CGI.Shall be getting it on DVD/BD to watch it an infinite number of times to pick up things I missed, as this is one that needs numerous watches to fully understand and appreciate.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Moon""","Helium-3 provides something like seventy percent of the Earth's energy, and Lunar Industries has a corner on the market. Their profit margins must be huge too, since overseeing the mining operation on the moon's surface is apparently a one man job. That man is Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), who's coming into the home stretch of a three-year haul when he starts to feel physically and mentally unwell. His condition is only compounded when he discovers the body of a man bearing him more than considerable resemblance outside the station.""Moon"" is an earnest, almost postmodern science fiction film with good intentions and some great ideas. Director Duncan Jones' story is thoughtful but not dense, and though he occasionally stumbles in translating his ideas to the screen, he's crafted a compelling anti- blockbuster worth the price of admission.The world of ""Moon"" is largely homage, lovingly cobbled together from shards of sci-fi greats. GERTY, Bell's robot assistant (voiced by Kevin Spacey in an uncommonly quiet performance), is HAL 9000 by way of emoticons. Bell's hallucinations recall Tarkovsky's ""Solaris,"" and the sets fall somewhere between ""Star Wars"" and Ridley Scott's ""Alien."" Everything has an appropriate matte sheen to it that pleasingly disregards the recent SFX trend to over-shine. Though there are a few effects shots in the film, including one that almost perfectly recreates Dave's psychedelic voyage at the end of Kubrick's ""Space Odyssey,"" the exterior moon sequences were shot using models, and the film's aesthetic feels all the more consistent for it.The greatest flaw of ""Moon"" is not necessarily its early plot twist, but rather the way it knowingly strings the audience along in another direction beforehand. The film travels the comfortable path cut by so many established science fiction films that when it swerves off- road, the viewer is uncomfortably jarred. Jones is a little dishonest in depicting Sam's plight, and so the moment of revelation is met with distrust instead of the desired, ""Ah ha!"" It's only a brief detour, however, and once the cards are on the table and the plot continues to unfold, all is more or less forgiven.That's really the worst of it, suffice it to say ""Moon"" is never particularly challenging. It might be because the film deals in so many degrees of familiarity, or because the Bells' scenario, when revealed, plays out relatively without incident. It's a subtle shade of good, though doesn't take us where truly great science fiction does: where no man has gone before. Jones has a lot going for him, and Rockwell easily carries the film, playing his part(s?) expertly. The cinematography is fluid and unobtrusive, and yet ""Moon"" is somehow less than excellent.""Moon"" sounds incredible on the page, and occasionally is on screen, but mostly settles for offbeat and interesting, which is still a welcome alternative to pseudo sci-fi garbage like ""Terminator: Salvation"" or ""Transformers 2."" It's an interesting companion piece to ""Star Trek,"" which was equally successful on the other end of the action spectrum, if a bit riskier in concept for a mainstream popcorn movie. Jones' film is an enjoyable but ultimately safe take on the genre that pays off to an extent, but will leave those hoping for mind-expanding science fiction revelry wanting.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The lonely man on the moon,"Sam Bell works on the far side of the moon. He is near the end of a three-year stint manning a mining outpost from which helium-3, a source of clean energy, is sent down to Earth. Sam is all alone. His only companion of sorts is his robot assistant GERTY. Communications problems make live contact with Earth impossible, meaning he and his wife can only send recorded messages back and forth to each other. This is a man who can't wait to get home. It's been three long, lonely years. But just when the finish line is in sight there's an accident. And here things take a very strange turn. Sam is going to have to ask himself some very serious questions as he tries to come to grips with the shocking truth with which he is confronted. What exactly is going on here on the far side of the moon?This is a movie which requires you to tiptoe around the plot as you attempt to review it. Best to let viewers discover the movie's secrets themselves. What can be said is that Sam Rockwell turns in a rather astounding performance in the role of Sam Bell. It's somewhat clichéd to say an actor has to carry a movie himself but in this case it's absolutely true. When we meet him Sam Bell is all alone, giving Rockwell nobody to play off of other than the computerized voice of Kevin Spacey as GERTY. It's a great challenge for Rockwell. And then comes the movie's big twist and all of a sudden Rockwell's challenge grows much, much greater. It's a performance which you probably can't fully appreciate until you've seen the whole film. Only then can you stop, look back, and understand how difficult this must have been for Rockwell. You'll also have an appreciation for director Duncan Jones who, with a rather meager budget, produced some rather astounding visuals. The effects in this film are very subtle, you don't even really think about or notice them when the movie is playing itself out. Then afterwards you think about it and realize that in this movie filming something as simple as a game of ping-pong is a masterful technical achievement.If there can be any complaint at all it would be that the story of the lonely man does make for somewhat of a lonely movie. It's a one-man show and as that one man Rockwell is terrific. But with nobody else around there are times where there is really nothing for Sam Bell to do. The film struggles for momentum at times, especially in the beginning. But the story is compelling and very well thought-out. Once it really gets going it will definitely hold your attention. It's not a big, flashy sci-fi movie. It's a personal story, Sam Bell's story. And that's a story you'll find yourself emotionally invested in. This story definitely has a lot of heart to it. It's compelling and more than a little surprising. The direction this movie goes in is certainly not what anyone would have been expecting when we first meet Sam Bell. It's a very unique tale, one performed wonderfully by Rockwell. Give director Jones credit for the very interesting story. And for the impressive visuals. The effects, the moon base set, everything in the movie looks wonderful. Jones created a great little world for Sam Bell but it was going to take a great actor to pull off what the movie required of him. And Sam Rockwell was up to the task. It's Rockwell's movie all the way through and it his brilliance which makes the movie work.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It can get lonely in space...,"Sam Rockwell is an actor who I really admire. His performances in The Green Mile and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri are nothing short of astounding and Moon further showcased his talent.Moon follows Sam Bell, an astronaut who is nearing the end of his three year job on the moon. Towards the end of his contract, he encounters someone special.That's all I'm going to reveal about the film's story as I was fairly surprised by this film by not knowing much and I want other people to have the exact same feeling whilst watching Moon. Sci-fi films tend to have a lot of action and chaos but this film takes on a more sombre approach to the genre. With Moon, director Duncan Jones uses the limited resources to his advantage and makes a sci-fi that explores the human psyche whilst being far away from the world you live in. Much like the recent Ad Astra, Moon tackles the idea of loneliness and does it in a subtle and unique way.The man who conveys this loneliness in a magnificent performance is Sam Rockwell. He is really the only character you're following during the entire film and he completely owns the role. The quiet atmosphere and lack of characters helped push the theme of loneliness. As the film went on, I really identified with the character of Sam Bell and felt the isolation he was feeling as well.It also impressed me how well made the movie was. Despite its very low budget, some of the shots of space looked absolutely beautiful and the sets and environments looked great. However, there were some moments of CGI which clearly didn't age well and at times I felt the pacing was way too slow for my liking but thankfully these issues didn't detract from my overall viewing experience of the film.Moon was a very interesting sci-fi experience.

"Impressive, intimate science fiction","""Moon"", for all the comparisons to cerebral SF films of the past, boils down to essential human drama, albeit with a neat twist. The feature debuts of director Duncan Jones and cinematographer Gary Shaw aren't always impressive, as what initially seems to be a deliberately grungy look is proved by awful use of slow-motion and some very clumsy transitions to be the result of inexperienced direction, while Shaw's work is consistently dull and plain. The effects work (model miniatures used) is not too impressive either, even considering the low budget for the film. However, the screenplay by Nathan Parker is absolutely excellent, with superb story development, dialogue, and characterization, and some very good ideas which are, contrary to what many critical reviews say, pretty well-explored (and subtly, too). Sam Rockwell's performance is sublime, and while the aesthetic does let the screenplay and performance down a bit, Jones does succeed at creating a great, suspenseful atmosphere and deserves credit for Rockwell's performance as well, surely, and the film is very nicely-paced. Very good score by Clint Mansell and voice work by Kevin Spacey help the film succeed. A minor gem.",,Anonymous,Mystery

"Moon Review: There are many sides to the Moon, which side are you on?","I love actors, no really I do. They have this quality about them that I like. Some might call it an intangible quality, but it's very easily explainable. As a writer, it's my job to create a character's motivations. To know them inside and out so that I know how they would react in just about every possible situation imaginable. An actor has to find a way to understand those motivations and bring out the emotions they cause. The way I see it, writers and actors go hand in hand. When I see an actor take on a difficult role, it gets very exciting.This was the case with Ryan Gosling in Lars and the Real Girl, Ryan Reynolds in Buried, and most recently Sam Rockwell in Moon. Another film in my long list of movies that I always meant to see but never got around to until now and again things are interesting. Where Moon is different from the previously mentioned films is that it used a visual effect to tell a major part of the story. Mainly that Sam Rockwell played several (two specifically) distinct versions of his character to play off of. This technique is one that is used often these days when dealing with characters who are twins or multiple characters.The first time I remember this occurring is in The Nutty Professor with Eddie Murphy playing his character's entire family with various prosthetic, but since then it has been used in movies like The Matrix, The Social Network, as well as TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Smallville and the recently cancelled Ringer. This can be a really effective technique if used in the right way. It can also go horribly wrong if not done properly. Unfortunately I have seen both in the multitude of films and television that I watch. When it comes to Moon, I think that it is used properly. Through most of the film I had my concerns, but as things progressed I was able to understand why they did it.And that's true of things not limited to the use of the doubling visual effect when it comes to this movie. The story centres around the character of Sam Bell (played by Sam Rockwell), a man on a three year contract to harvest the moon's resources for clean energy that can be used on Earth. One of the main things that bugged me about the film is the idea of a single person on a moon base. If you're going to put a mining camp on the moon why have only one person running it? This, along with most of my questions about the film, gets answered by the end and I am left generally satisfied with the story as a whole.What really hits home for me more than anything though is the performance of Rockwell. He manages to make two versions of himself very much distinct in their mannerisms and approaches to the situations they face that you might almost believe they were entirely different people despite their obvious similarities. The only other character to play off is the full on robotic helper droid GERTY, played through voice work by the great Kevin Spacey. And even there Mr. Spacey is able to bring a certain amount of nuance to an inanimate object that has you questioning the robot's motives much in the way that you did in 2001: A Space Odyssey.This movie is a perfect example of how acting can make or break a film.

Brings back memories,"Somewhat reminiscent of the old science fictions from 30-40 years ago, Moon will bring back memories of such movies as 2001 or Outland. And although special effects are a big part for movies like these, they rely far more on the story and performances of the actors than a lot of other films from this genre. Sam Rockwell adequately pulls off his role despite the closet thing he had to co-stars was himself and Kevin Spacey in a box. While the plot kind of peaks towards the middle, it still holds interest beyond that point and is something you'll want to watch till the end.There is one unfortunate downfall however. For some reason the makers seemed to intentionally shoot for an R rating when writing the script, as F-bombs are delivered in sorties of three or more every five minutes, likely making it the most common word in the entire film. Why they found this necessary is beyond me, since it adds nothing to the overall movie and could have easily been done differently without losing anything. So what could have been something that I might watch with my kids or even my folks, gets relegated to late night viewing when no one else is around.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Moon: no place on earth for this movie,"Are you dying to see a movie that looks like it could have been done in your garage? Well, you have struck gold with Moon - or better yet, moon dust.With Kevin Spacey sounding like Lex Luthor doing HAL 9000 and Sam Rockwell sounding like Sam Rockwell, who could ask for more? Welllll, if you're stuck on the moon, you may be satisfied. I was not on the moon and so I stayed because it was my choice. It ended up being one of the worst decisions I ever made.I was asking more questions about the sensibility of this story than I was asking about the characters and their purposes. The movie is advertised as Mystery, Sci-Fi and Thriller. IMO, there was never any thriller; the mystery died quickly when Rockwell's presence on the moon became nonsensical; Sci-Fi was not so Sci-Fi after all, but more of a delivery of Sociological Fiction. The scenery was one dimensional which, with a better story, may have been OK as a Twilight Zone episode. And, actually, it came across as a bad Twilight Zone rip-off.Spacey and Rockwell performed fine but I found it hard to appreciate their performances because the story was so bland. The intermittent jabs at humor were lost in the Moon's atmosphere.I went because I thought it was going to involve a good science fiction story. This is not good sci-fi. This is not good entertainment 2 out of 10",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Original, scary and claustrophobic.","What are the chances of making a sci-fi film with a low budget, with virtually non existent CGI, with just one actor playing out most of the plot? Furthermore, what are the chances of that film doing exceptionally well at the Sundance Film Festival after having been filmed by a rookie director?Co-written by Duncan Jones in his directional debut, this is one such film that goes on to prove that expensive budgets and mind numbing effects are not always a sure fire guarantee in the sci-fi genre. What works for Jones is the simplest yet best formula there is in cinema story telling, which in this case happens to be a well written script matched only by the actor it is written for. And that actor is Sam Rockwell, perfectly cast as the only human on the surface of the moon. Due to the current energy crisis on planet Earth, Sam Bell is an implant on the moon with the sole purpose of mining lunar soil for harvesting helium-3, a clean energy source he sends back to Earth. Assisting him in this solitary project is an artificial intelligence controlled robot called GERTY aptly voiced by Kevin Spacey. GERTY is also Sam's only companion, programmed to monitor his tasks while vigilantly watching over his health and daily supplies. Nearing the end of a three year contract, Sam is eagerly anticipating his return to Earth, more to reunite with his wife who was heavily pregnant on his departure, than to get away from this isolated existence. But due to a communications satellite failure, live video conferencing between home and the moon are limited to recorded messages sent both ways, but only occasionally. Now with just two weeks left for his return, GERTY does not recommend fixing the satellite relay, but maintains priority in extracting energy. It is at this point when Sam's health starts to fail with unexplained hallucinations. On a routine mining trip, he sees a young girl in his direction and crashes the rover in distraction. Awakening in the infirmary, Sam overhears a live communication feed between GERTY and headquarters on Earth, arousing his suspicion that all is not as it seems. Worse, Sam arrives at a startling conclusion that he may have never been alone all along.For a sci-fi thriller that lacks any of the grand splendors we have grown to expect from the likes of ""Star-Trek"" and ""Star Wars"", Jones adopts a technique most active directors would easily avoid only for its retro feel. Although 2009 has left its mark as the year of the sequels (was it Star Trek 6?), Jones has the definitive edge in terms of originality of content and fluidity of context. Having said that, Stanley Kubrick fans are in for a nostalgic trip down memory lane with certain similarities to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". GERTY, eerily voiced by Kevin Spacey more than pays homage to HAL 9000. Then there is the disorientation and hallucination associated with solitude as last seen in Steven Soderbergh's ""Solaris"". But Jones isn't done yet, in fact by the time we start to unravel his diabolical twist towards the end, he has only just begun to narrate how unique we as humans really are. And by the time he's done, there awaits a shocking lesson in corporate ethics versus human identity; homework if you will, for us to mull over long after the credits go up. This again, is masterfully penned into Nathan Parker's screenplay, adapting from Jones' original story. Two other aspects seamlessly blending in are Clint Mansell's score and Gary Shaw's believable cinematography. Remember, CGI is at a bare minimum, yet that sinister feeling of being the only person living on the moon is well rendered. Ironically, sometimes you even feel Sam's claustrophobia when there is everywhere to run, but no where to hide. And this is when Mansell's score heightens that alarming sensation.For a film that starts slow, it sure packs a stinger of a blind-sided punch in the end, one that will have viewers reeling in thought and drooling for more. Good thing then, that Jones is already planning a prequel and a sequel, thus broadening this narrative into his own sci-fi trilogy. If he stays on course as he does here, I'm betting hands down that the sci-fi genre is about to witness another colossal battle; Duncan Jones as David versus J. J. Abrams as Goliath.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Gripping from the starting.""","This in no way looks to be a debut film of the director. The amount of professionalism displayed in the film is highly praising. The story is set entirely on the moon. It tells you a story of a time when humans are using the resources present on the moon. The station for harvesting the resources on moon is highly equipped and is self-operating. However there is need of just one man. Sam is stuck there. Although there are an abundant number of things for him to do, among which he finds joy in going out of the station on the moon. He is missing human touch for most of his time. The story seems to be little confusing in the starting but when the film is nearing finish, you will adore the story. The film is not to be missed.PROS:You have an astonishing performance by Sam as Sam in the film. The beautiful part of the film is that it relies entirely on art direction, acting by just the one person, and the cinematography. What makes it respectable to me is the use of minimum resources. At some times it will give you the feeling of Home Sickness. The guy is stuck at the place without the contact with humans for 3 years. There is a moment when in the view we have the blue planet (Earth.). And we hear the cry of the character, where he just wants to go home. That feeling was too intensified by the way earth was shown to us with a slow zoom. How the world crumbles around you when you find out that your whole life is a lie. The feeling when you find out that your existence doesn't matter. That unbelievable truth is an integral part of your life. These are some of the ideas explored nicely in the film. The ending is full of twists. It is a science fiction film presented with such awesomeness that you rarely get out of that atmosphere.MESSAGE: ""Learn to live with some unbelievable truths.""VERDICT: ""Most recommended.""",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not My Flavor of Sci Fi but Decent Movie,"I just found out about Moon recently and decided to rent it and check it out. I am a big sci fi fan. I love Star Trek, Star Wars, and pretty much anything fact or fiction that has to do with outer space. Moon definitely looked like a great movie. Sadly I was somewhat disappointed by this movie. First off, the pluses. The acting is great. Sam Rockwell puts on a convincing, solid performance, and I know of him from Galaxy Quest. Kevin Spacey's voice is creepy and spooky for the robot and it fits the movie well. Although some set designs were overused, the set was very nice. Cool space station looking rooms with nice space fonts, computer screens, and slick space uniforms. Lastly, the sound mix for this movie is pretty good, nice deep bass sound effects, Moon is a great home theater movie.Now to the downsides. The CGI. The CGI is budget. Some scenes look great with the moon, space, and the planets, but then other scenes, the giant rovers look like toy plastic cars with too much lighting in some scenes and not enough in others. The storyline and movie in general are very boring at times. Parts of the movie I felt like I wanted to quit watching because they were boring (and some scenes showing blood being vomited were disgusting as well). Other parts of the story don't make sense or are completely uninteresting. The whole movie revolves around similar rooms and sets which gets boring with one actor throughout the whole movie. Also, GERTY was really corny. A futuristic A.I. robot with a smiley face screen? I thought that was really stupid and killed the movie. If GERTY was more serious in design, or even had legs and eyes, maybe I would find him more interesting. Lastly, the piano style music theme in the movie was really overused. There was hardly ever a change in pace or music throughout this movie.Moon is a teeter totter movie. Some parts are very well executed and catchy and then the next scene of the movie will either be boring, silly, or downright confusing. Either way, I think it's worth a watch from any sci fi fans. Many people here found this to be a 10/10 movie, I kind of disagree. I think regular movie goers should pass. Personally, I think the best sci fi movie made in the past few years is the 2008 flick ""Sunshine"", about a ship with multiple astronauts trying to save the Sun from burning out. Much better thriller and sci fi movie for me. If anyone needs a good sci fi film, I recommend Sunshine over Moon, but if you think this movie is your style of movie, then check it out!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A Stellar, Smart Science Fiction Film","Reviews Of Unusual Size!Re: Astronaut Sam Bell, who has spent the last few years on a solitary assignment on the moon, watchdogging a mining conglomeration of machines, is nearing the end of his shift. He's fallen into a decent, if claustrophobic routine, sculpting a small village, checking the machines, chatting with his computerized nanny, GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey). But he starts to have some problems. Spiralling deeper into what may be insanity, Sam starts to question almost everything, including his very existence.Outstanding: This movie was fantastic. Rockwell is amazing and funny and tragic, sometimes all in the same scene and GERTY, with it's animated emoticon screen and deadpan voice is pitch-perfect.Unacceptable: The only thing that I think is unacceptable about this movie is that I can't watch it every night.Summary: Jones directs this with a calm hand, swooping through the abandoned base smoothly, giving the entire movie a bit of an alien feel and Rockwell,, who I like in a lot of things gives one of his best performances. I'm not normally a huge Sci-Fi fan, but movies like this really hook me.

Solid movie,"Moon (2009) is a solid film. It's well-crafted (especially with the low budget), well-acted, but honestly, it's a tad predictable for my taste.

A rare Jewel in modern Sci-Fi drama. One of the best film of the decade.,"This movie is one of the best Sci-Fi movies I've seen the last decade. I can't help but feel that the movies in the genre hasn't been to good this decade. Honestly there has been so few good Sci-Fi films lately I have only been able to enjoy the classics. But ""Moon"" proves that the genre isn't dead at all. This movie will definitely be considered a Sci-Fi classic in the future and won't be forgotten.Also this movie had a very low budget, but it doesn't show at all. Also you'll eventually realize there are very few actor in it. Which also makes the movie impressive if you think about it. i was also very impressed when I realized that this movie has very little CGI. All the scenes with the moon base or the lunar rovers, are in fact models. It's great to see the good old ways in a modern film. it also proves that models can be better than CGI if handled properly.And of course Sam Rockwell and Kevin Spacey as Gerdy is just amazing. And what a great start for Duncan Jones who apparently is new in the director business.I won't spoil the story, the IMDb synopsis speak for itself. But honestly don't read it, just watch the movie, its great.This is among the best movies of the decade, it has a classic feel to it, and is still modern.

One Man and his Moon,"The debut feature of Duncan Jones, Moon is extraordinary. Small in scope, but beautifully formed, framed, designed and executed, it is a constant delight. Despite dealing with the very nature of existence, it is never heavy-handed, never hectoring or dry, always intriguing and interesting. And all this with essentially only one character, Sam (Sam Rockwell), a character whom throughout the film we actually learn very little about. We are given glimpses, snapshots of his life before the moon-base, but he remains for the majority of the film a cipher, a sketch of a character. But this is an incredibly complex sketch, and one which retains it's subtlety throughout the film.Moon is very aware of its sources, but it draws upon the best of the genre: 2001, Silent Running and Solaris. The plot is not original, but moves in an altogether unexpected direction, while continuing to explore similar themes to its influences. The nature of existence, identity, loneliness and the manifestation and corruptibility of memory are all tackled here, with the deciding vote being left at the discretion of us all. Jones does not patronise us with coherent answers or polemics, he provides the vehicle for the discussion and keeps us engrossed in the trials of the central character.Moon is a very humanistic film, quite unlike 2001 in terms of the behaviour of the characters. We have no men developing machine traits, and no machines becoming more human. The humanity of the piece is best encapsulated by Sam's single urge - to return home to Earth. He is no happy spaceman, he has lost all pioneer spirit by the time we are invited into his story. His exploration is limited to minor forays out onto the surface of the Moon in armoured vehicles, and he does not identify himself as anything out of the ordinary, despite his location. He displays little ambition, other than to return home at the end of his contract with his sanity intact, but this allows us to have a clear mind concerning his travails, without the usual distractions and smoke and mirrors. Every emotion which is betrayed has a thematic purpose, and this is of great credit to the director and writer.I feel that Moon will reward repeat viewings. This is an intricate work and one with depth, a picture which is unafraid to trade in philosophy and ethics, a picture which eschews broad strokes for delicate handling. This is not Star Wars and all the better for it.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Refreshing and New...,"Forget the sci-fi aspect, this movie is a just does a great concept of bizarre reality. All told in a very neat and tidy storyline, it flows well. Without giving too much away, it really portrays a sense of isolation and of how important memories shape our feelings.The movie wasn't adapted from a book, but actual science concepts about moon mining and clean energy researched by Duncan Jones and developed into a storyline by both he and Nathan Parker. The fact that it is done in a style of 70s science fiction deliberately avoiding CGI gives it unique style in this day and age. An independent production filmed on a small budget, Sam Rockwell, as Sam Bell the moon engineer, carries the film all the way through as he slowly learns his fate or fates, with GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey) as a companion, a computer that controls the station.I was going to give this movie a 9/10 because I wanted to be mean.

Worth your time and thought,"You can see Kubrick's Space Odyssey influence all over this movie, it is certainly a piece of art in line with Kubrick's visual symphonies and deep, thought provoking messages.

The subjects it tackles in answering the questions are certainly worth the thought. Sam Rockwell rocks in this one! He brings the serious, the humane and the humorous all at the same time.All this is delivered in the tidy, near perfect, frames and sharp visuals and the theme score is brilliant!

"Brilliant, borrows from other space movie themes, but the final product is gold.","This is a movie with basically one set, and one main actor with the voice of Kevin Spacey as a computer that will remind anyone that saw 2001 a Space Odyssey of a sane version of HAL. The moon is now used to harvest Helium 3, it's mainly automated, with one man overseeing the operation with the assistance of the base computer/robot. Themes you will notice borrowed come from Outland, Blade Runner, 2001, but they manage to put a spin on the plot that is unique and that keeps it interesting.This is a psychological drama, it is not an action movie, it is not a date movie, this is the sort of movie you probably will get the most out of if you watch it in the dark by yourself without interruptions. The mood needs to build in order to get the full effect of the script. Suffice it to say that all is not what it seems on base, and our main character starts to feel a bit stranded on the moon, wondering what will become of him. He gets help from the most unexpected of places, but is it too late?

Moon,"Sam Rockwell is really good here as the sole occupant of a lunar base. Coming to the end of his three year stint, ""Sam"" is beginning to suffer from the effects of his loneliness. With only his automated pal ""GERTY"" (Kevin Spacey) for company, he longs to get home to his wife and daughter and to some semblance of a normal life. His job is to harvest the clean energy giving ""Helium-3"" and send it back to Earth and it's an accident on one of the harvesters that sees him wake up in the infirmary. ""GERTY"" assures him that everything is OK, but when he gets back on his feet, he becomes uneasy about the truth. How did he get back? What did happen? Despite the protestations of his carer, he returns to the silo and makes quite a startling discovery. Is he losing the plot? This interaction causes him to question everything about himself, about his mission and about, most importantly, his future. Does he have one? Does he even have a past? Rockwell really does capture strongly the sense of encroaching, almost claustrophobic, isolation married with an increasing sense of confusion and exasperation. He starts to feel fear - but what of? It's the increasing lack of the tangible - mental or physical that gives this story a potency and the supposed caring voice that emanates from the walls ostensibly looking out for him, becomes more menacing as the story rattles along.

Daring sci-fi observation on mankind and isolation....,"I'm sure that the more observant can find certain precedents to this film in other movies.

Not long left till he leaves (or so he thinks) and then some drastic revelations throw the whole thing into a spin and leaves our central character with a shocking dilemma.Won't give much away, as the movie revolves a moral issue which is extracted to give the viewer some big to chew on. Sam Rockwell is fine and a very sympathetic actor in the lead role, whilst Kevin Spacey lends his hypnotic voice to the voice.The only issue is that it was not going to be easy to put an ending to this film for the writers.

Renews the audiences' belief that GOOD sci-fi films are still alive...,"Sci-fi is alive...and kicking! Watching Duncan Jones' surprisingly good sci-fi film ""Moon"", I can now confirm that Hollywood can still produce a profound and moving sci-fi story, and that it takes the work of a true creative crew to produce it. In an era where sci-fi films are an excuse to attack audiences with a long and uninvolving demonstration of special effects, Jones attempts to revive the genre and add an involving story and well-developed characters to it, proving that special effects aren't everything, and that the old days of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Solaris"" still have an effect. Like a famous critic said, truly good sci-fi films aren't dead, they're just hiding.""Moon"" introduces us to a near future, where humans have found an important source of energy called Helium-3, which comes from the moon and is trapped in lunar rocks; these rocks can be shipped to Earth and can be harvested to release a potent and natural power source which helps over 70% of the planet in an ecologically-benefit way. On the moon, there's a space station that controls the machines' harvesting of Helium-3 rocks, and this space station is manned by a single man called Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell, in a surprisingly effective performance). Sam is completely alone in the station, and he supervises the harvesting and the well-being of the station, fixing the problems which seldom take place, making sure it all goes according to plan and sending periodical reports to Lunar Industries on Earth, updating them on the situation on the moon. The only company Sam has are the casual recorded messages he receives from Earth, and the ever-present Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey), the station's computer, a sort of Hal 2000.Sam is incredibly lonely, of course. He's spent three years living by himself at the moon station, talking to computers. The film is effective and troubling at showing us the critical mental state of this man, who's practically isolated from human contact, and who confirms, day by day, the meaninglessness of his personality; he's desensitized and goes about his daily routine monotonously, sadly, the wear being most apparent in his face. There's a moment early in the film where we see him get a recorded message from his wife and his young daughter; the amount of emotion and heart-break in this scene is the work of a genius, and we just KNOW that this is more than just a sci-fi story, but a true exploration into human emotion.On one of his outings supervising the harvesting machines, Sam sees something strange against the luminosity of the sun's rays, and he crashes his lunar vehicle against the harvesting machine. He loses consciousness, and then he wakes up in the recovery room at the space station...but here's where the story takes a weird and disturbing twist: how did he get to the recovery room from the place of the accident? Why is he suddenly feeling so strange? And why does he get the sensation that he's NOT alone in this space station? That's all I can say without disclosing any spoilers. Suffice it to say that from the moment he awakes at the recovery room, the film takes a steep and disturbing dive into tension, and challenges Sam's sanity to an unspeakable degree. The suspense of the plot mixes with Sam's uncertainty and the terrible toll it's taking on his mind to deliver a veritable tour-de-force to the viewer. Duncan Jones (who, by the way, is David Bowie's son) makes an excellent directorial debut in this film which challenges conventional storytelling and feels as fresh and as intriguing as anything you've seen before.The story is involving (I mean it), and it doesn't rely on your typical plot twists to gain its tension. It delivers the facts straight to the viewer, hiding nothing, but in the truth it conveys it forces upon our minds countless questions that we just can't wait to have answered. Rockwell is simply fantastic in his portrayal, and it is his performance, more than anything, which drives our attention. Spacey, with his coldly sweet voice, gives Gerty an ominous presence which we can't overlook, and we sympathize with the ship's computer and fear it at the same time. More than a sci-fi story, this is an exploration into the characters' mind, which poses questions dealing with the importance of human relations, human importance and the meaning of life.The only conceivable downfall of the film is the fact that it deals with such deep and intriguing topics, but after a moment in the film, it ceases to probe deeper and focuses on the plot instead. This is good, don't get me wrong, but it could have been done better. Nevertheless, as Jones' directorial debut, I believe he has fared much, much better than other débutant directors.The cinematography is very good, giving us wide-range shots which absorb the nothingness and the solitary expanse of the space station, forcing the feeling of loneliness and claustrophobia on the viewer; Clint Mansell's score is muted but effective, and this is good because it doesn't force itself on the viewer or the story, but it crawls beneath Sam's character, to a point where it becomes one with his personality. The editing is at a bit of a flaw, though; it tries to enhance the emotion by focusing too much on certain objects, but it fails at times (for example, there are way too many focuses of an animated smiley which appears on Gerty's screen, and this doesn't even come close to the tension we experienced by, say, the lingering shots of Hal 2000's red eye in ""2001"").Still, the small flaws the film might carry don't overshadow the overall power and depth it conveys. It's truly satisfactory, and like I said before, it renews our faith in the existence of GOOD sci-fi films. I thoroughly recommend it! Rating: 3 stars out of 4!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Space Odyssey meets The Truman Show!,This film is one of the best I have seen in a very long time and you don't have to be a fan of Sci-Fi to appreciate it's depth and quality.

There's no point going into great detail about the plot - just watch it for yourself. It is such a captivating and interesting film to watch and see how things unfold and it definitely succeeds in playing with your emotions. It stimulated every one of my emotions from humour to sadness and fear. This must be seen in Blu-Ray to fully appreciate the films visuals and compliment the top-notch acting and direction. I'm always very critical of films but this is getting 10 stars from me because it's just utterly fantastic and it's such a relief and a breath of fresh air to see that people can still make good movies these days.Just watch it and enjoy it.

The Lunar Labour Pool,"In ""Moon"", a nifty little science-fiction movie, Sam is the only human inhabitant of a lunar mining facility where all the work is done by machines. The facility is run by a computer named Gerty. Sam is there to perform work that Gerty, due to its physical limitations, cannot manage. In a very real sense, Gerty's the boss. Gerty even has real-time meetings with its superiors on Earth, which Sam doesn't know about. Sam is not in the loop. Gerty is more than just boss. He's the resident cook, doctor, psychiatrist, and...priest? I don't want to give any of the story away, but certain other duties fall within Gerty's purview.Sam is on the facility for a three-year tour of duty, after which he will head home to his beautiful wife and little girl - and that is in a matter of weeks. But the solitude has taken its toll on him. He seems to be cracking up, and he's become somewhat derelict. He just waits and dreams the same dreams that we all do. And then, that wonderful inevitability that happens in movies. Something occurs that's not supposed to, and things get really interesting. Director Duncan Jones has, in a sense, let the story tell itself. The pace is leisurely by today's standards, and he has not succumbed to any temptation he might have had to jack up the thriller elements or sci-fi voodoo. Best of all, Actor Sam Rockwell has been given all the room he needs to do his thing and he delivers a compelling performance. Rockwell's Everyman not only has something for each of us, individually, to latch onto, but also provides fodder for the discussion of this film as a whole. Sam (the character) is pushed to question nothing less than his entire existence.It appears that very little CGI was used in the making of this film and that the moon's surface was a model set. It's obvious that a lot of love and care went into the making of ""Moon"". It's a quiet, engaging little surprise.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Concept with potential, poorly executed and implausible","The concept had potential, though I guess any movie of a person isolated for three years on the Moon has potential. But this just seems boring, not well written, with major plot points glossed over.Let's start with GERDY, the computer that runs the outpost. At first it seems to be a malevolent entity with the goal of keeping Sam deceived about himself and his family. And yet GERDY seems to have a marshmallow for a heart, revealing thing it was certainly not supposed to reveal. That wasn't believable (and it's a major plot point). Nor was GERDY expressing emotions with changing ""Happy Face"" displays. Really?!When Sam is told that there must be another hidden area where (not to reveal spoilers) significant things are going on, he swears he knows every inch of the structure. Turns out there's an entire half he's unaware of.Sam arrived and, as a hobby, continued wood carving a town he's apparently familiar with. It doesn't occur to him that whoever carved the original structures had the same knowledge of the town and its buildings that he does.When a new ""Sam"" appears, our Sam doesn't question how he got there or why he appears exactly the same as our Sam.There was real potential near the end when our Sam is able to establish a direct communications link to his daughter and her father. But that peters out. We do find out what happened to her mother (which wasn't an issue through the movie and I'm not sure why it was handled the way it was here) but there was great potential, totally blown, to show dad.The lack of a direct communications link between the Moon and Earth--for three years--was implausible. We did that 55 years ago with the first Moon landing. If the need had been to deceive Sam, then we already have ""Deep Fake"" technology that would have allowed Sam to communicate in real time with ""people"" on Earth. On the other hand, we have a ""ticking clock""--the rescue crew--and we know to the second when it's going to arrive. Couldn't Sam recognize these inconsistencies?Those problems only scratch the surface of the film's issues. At every turn, it's either clunky (as with GERDY) or missing opportunities. And it's built on a totally implausible structure. A handful of minor changes and edits could have made this an engrossing, entertaining film. But time after time, the movie goes for implausibility. Too bad.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Nutshell Review: Moon,"Written and directed by Duncan Jones, Moon is strangely unique because while it contained a series of familiar clichés, it still managed to string itself together in an engaging manner, also in a large part thanks to Sam Rockwell's stellar one-man show, acting against himself with the occasional banter with a computer voiced by Kevin Spacey and represented by a smiley emoticon interface.In the future, Man has found that we can power our planet harnessing the H3 gas found in abundance in our moon. As such, Lunar Industries had begun sending astronaut contractors to the moon in order to oversee the harnessing of the vital resource. Each contract lasts 3 years, and we are soon introduced to Sam Bell (Rockwell), who has 2 weeks more to the end of contract, and just cannot wait to get out of his career isolation, where the live communications link has been severed, and his contact with the outside world relies heavily on pre-recorded messages being sent to and fro.To say anything more would be to spoil the story, since a major turn of events happen very early, and from then on it's the posing of questions ranging from existentialism, to the circle of life. The plot elements in Jones' story are nothing new, and in fact quite overused in contemporary science fiction films of late, though the advantage here is that its quiet, soundless environment provides plenty of room for thought as opposed to loud action films. It allows its ideas to sink in, while at the same time, thanks to Rockwell's tour de force performance, allowed you to buy into his plight, and experience the same level of despair and disbelief of the truth, and that degree of loneliness should you happen to be in his shoes.The production sets and miniatures used are intricately designed, which will provide space junkies a field day in just gawking at the level of detail, which is quite impressive given that it's shot on a relatively shoestring budget. And who can fail to mention the magic of Clint Mansell's score which once again provides an additional dimension with its extremely memorable theme that would set the entire mood and tone for the film, which hypnotically guides you through the story and move you.Moon has plenty of positives going for it, especially if you prefer a thinking man's science fiction film with great acting against beautiful sets accentuated with a wonderful musical score, and despite some familiar themes, you'd find yourself appreciating this simple work of art.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Movie really shows the Moon as it is not as we see it.,"The movie starts out slow, with a great view of the Moon. The Moon & Space is so beautiful, I immediately envied Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell). Sam Bell is a Prospector on the moon, harvesting Helium-3 with massive Harvesters accompanied by Gerty the robot. Gerty is friendly and helpful and again I envied Sam Bell. I would love to work on the Moon, though during the movie I found it less and less appealing. You will too. (not the movie, but the prospect of being a moon prospector)Not a movie for pre-teens or young teens, they would likely not find it exciting enough. Nor is it a party movie, but still it is a very thought provoking story. I really liked it and you will too, just make sure to watch it with people who can enjoy the boring, the agonizing and the heart breaking parts without killing the vibe, because it pays off. After rain comes the sunshine, but it'll take a while to get dry and warm up.Have fun.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Me, myself and I.","This movie is right up my alley. I like these type of movies. The science-fiction type of movies that lean more toward the science rather than the fiction. The kind of science-fiction movie that takes a more realistic approach to things and don't feature any aliens, lasers, far off places, or anything of that sort. Movies that make you think, like for instance similar sort of movies like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Solyaris"" also do.No, I not saying this movie is being like a modern day ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" or ""Solyaris"" but its being a movie that more or less picks a same sort of approach, with as a big difference though that ""Moon"" is also being a very entertaining and even somewhat lighthearted movie to watch, despite of its story and its settings.The entire movie is being set on a base on the moon. As a matter of fact, the movie only features really one character. It has Sam Rockwell and than it has a robot as well in it, who is being voiced by Kevin Spacey. Doesn't sounds like the most exciting thing to most perhaps but let me tell you that the movie also really didn't needed more characters (there are still more in it though). I have always liked Sam Rockwell in basically everything that he has ever done and he also carries this movie, basically entirely by his own, without any problem.The movie has a nice story, that is never being made too complicated. You constantly question what is real and what is being imagined in this movie, when the main character is seemingly slowly starting to loose it more and more due to the loneliness and isolation, till you figure out what is going on but the movie does this in a mostly lighthearted way. I still don't really know how they managed all this, since its not really a movie with any comedy in it and like I said, is a movie with for most part just two characters in it. You have to give lots of credit to Sam Rockwell but also really to the writers and the director Duncan Jones.This really is a movie that deserves to be seen by more!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A semi-dark side of the Moon,"Duncan Jones's directorial debut ""Moon"" is a science fiction film set on, you guessed it, the Moon. Sam Rockwell plays a Moon-based employee of a mining operation. To try to explain (spoiler-free) what happens to him is difficult so let's just say that he faces challenges as a result of his long isolation from other human beings.The film is practically a one man show for Sam Rockwell. I've liked him since ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" and here he gives another solid performance. Kevin Spacey as the voice of GERTY (the lunar station's robotic assistant) is about the only other actor worth mentioning.The story may not appeal to everyone, though. Personally, I liked the direction that the film was going in early on but then it turned into a different beast altogether. There's not really anything wrong with the story; it just utilizes a theme that I don't particularly care for.Jones's capable direction keeps things under control while the film's look harks back to the likes of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". I found the score a bit overwhelming at times but maybe that's just me.I'm surprised to see the film rated so highly but apparently I've just underestimated the appeal of science fiction to the general movie-going public. That being said, I don't think that you'd necessarily need to be a science fiction fan in order to appreciate the story. Ultimately, critical consensus seems to be pretty positive for this one so perhaps I'm in the minority here.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Welcome to Lunar Industries.  Enjoy your stay.,"Science Fiction used to be just that: fictional storytelling that has an underlying, relatable theme set in a fantastic environment pseudo- grounded within the realities of science. Authors like Heinlein, Bradbury and Dick understood and thrived in this medium, setting the tempo for the imaginations of the next generation; their film adaptations, for the most part, were not as spectacular. That next generation, however, seemed to forget the thematic elements of such stories and focused instead on the spectacle of fiction. MOON has the pleasure of recapturing that feel and the message of those tales from a by-gone era.MOON is, essentially, a one-man play admirably performed by the Oscar- overlooked Sam Rockwell, playing Sam Bell, a miner overseeing a solo three-year operation on the moon. Bell spends his time focusing on his work, staving off boredom and interacting with the station's HAL-esque computer system, the Spielbergian-named GERTY, perfectly-voiced by a cold, or is that cool, Kevin Spacey. An accident out on the lunar surface gets Bell's attention that, surprise-surprise, things are not all well with Lunar Industries and that his indentured slavery to the corporation might be a greater price than imagined.Directed by Duncan Jones, whose father knows a thing or two about the oddities of space, MOON absorbs the viewer into Bell's tight living space. The film's lo-fi F/X work to its benefit amplifying that classic sf-movie feel giving proper attention to the story, not the visuals. But as such, the look is starting real as is the permeable paranoia that also exists on the station, a paranoia that is enhanced by Clint Mansell's simple yet haunting orchestration, a paranoia that leads to a quest for escape. But who can escape the reaches of a corporation?With MOON, Jones crafts a mystery around Bell's service, his life, and his destiny. He also brings into question how much of our souls are willingly sold to corporations and the almighty, intergalactic dollar as well as if we have what it would take to escape.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

With a personal rating of 8/10 and an overwhelming love for this film, I couldn't help but be drawn into its world. The acting, particularly Sam Rockwell's incredible performance, is a tour de force, making me feel the isolation and emotional complexity of his character. The film's editing is sharp and precise, keeping me engaged throughout, while its strength lies in its ability to explore existential questions about identity and loneliness in space.

Moon,"Let me start by saying that I expected a bit more. However, this movie has brilliant characteristics, especially concerning the factor of isolationism. The main character is somewhat confused, yet self-confident and seems to portray the general aspect of just-trying-to-survive perfectly. When the character realizes that there is something wrong, he made me feel like I had to go with him to explore the mystery. Another interesting aspect, is the relationship between a human and the AI. The relationship actually involves a lot around emotions - something that seems to be very underestimated in the real world concerning the relationship between man and AI. I expected a bit more from this movie in the sense that the director could have contributed more to the horror aspect. While the strong isolationist feeling is very well done, I expected that there would be stronger emphasis on the influence of derangement concerning individual psychological factors. Yet, a very well done movie that is recommended for fans of sci-fi drama and mystery.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Fresh Take on the Sci-fi Genre,"Moon has been labeled an ""indie-sci-fi film"". And with a directorial debut from Duncan Jones, very little CGI, and a budget of 5 million dollars, it is just that. If you were like me and don't quite know what to expect from this film, you should be pleasantly surprised. Yes, Moon is a sci-fi film, but its focus is 100 percent on character and psychology. In a way, it is reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey (without question the greatest science fiction tale ever put to film). There is spectacle in both films, but it takes a back seat to some very original, human ideas.Moon is set sometime in the future, although we are never given a specific year. Fossil fuels and common sources of energy on earth have been completely used up. Luckily, the moon's surface is rich with some kind of helium, which can be used to make energy through nuclear fusion. The company in charge of this mining process, Lunar Industries, employs Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) to supervise all the mining equipment on the moon. Sam is under a three-year contract; in his solitude he watches television, grows plants, and receives video messages from his wife and newborn daughter. His only companion is the computer GERTY (appropriately voiced by Kevin Spacey) who too closely resembles HAL from 2001. The film begins with the final weeks of Sam's contract. It would be difficult to continue explaining the film's plot without ruining it, so I won't even attempt to do so.Within 30 minutes, the film rejects traditional sci-fi elements and turns into something you would never expect it to be. It also requires some close attention; some twists are explained so quickly that you may be scratching your head by the end of the film. Pay attention to the last lines of the movie. It raises some ethical Blade Runner-esquire questions while setting the film up for a sequel (which Duncan Jones has already confirmed).The most important thing about a film like Moon is the performance. There's a lot of chatter within the internet community about Sam Rockwell's performance and a possible Academy Award nomination. Rockwell (who forever will be ""Wild Bill"" from The Green Mile to me) is a very solid supporting actor, but doesn't have the type of screen presence to carry an entire film. Don't get me wrong, he gets the job done. In a one-man show like Moon, Rockwell has a lot of masks to wear. However, an Oscar-worthy performance should keep the viewer transfixed, and by the end of the film, I just wasn't quite sold.Although it has its flaws, Moon is unique, enjoyable, and a must see for viewers looking for something fresh in the sci-fi genre.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

One Of The Rarest Gems & Most Under-appreciated Works Of 21st Century Cinema,"Movies don't get anymore underrated than Duncan Jones' feature film debut. An incredibly polished, downright original & thoroughly engrossing effort that's brought to life with remarkable care, brims with endless passion & stays firmly grounded throughout its runtime, Moon is a masterwork of science-fiction filmmaking that presents the first-time filmmaker in complete control of his craft, is deftly scripted from start to finish, and is all the more boosted by Sam Rockwell's heartbreaking performance & Clint Mansell's sensational score.Set in the near future, the story of Moon presents a world in which Earth's power crisis has been solved by Lunar Industries through mining an alternative fuel from lunar rocks. Stationed at their almost entirely automated lunar facility is Sam Bell whose 3-year work contract requires him to maintain operations and his only companion all this time has been an artificial intelligence named GERTY who assists with base's automation. Things are set in motion when Bell encounters something personal towards the end of his stint.Co-written & directed by Duncan Jones, Moon is crafted with confidence and the director's creativity shines above all as he manages to give his project a very sophisticated look & feel despite its modest budget. The story taps on our familiarity with the genre yet puts greater emphasis on its plot & characters instead of revelling in its futuristic sci-fi elements. In short, Jones has done an amazing job in transitioning this story on the film canvas, maintains a fine control over every single aspect, and paces it with such finesse that everyone will be able to get on board with it.From the technical standpoint, this is a film that isn't affected by budget constraints and successfully manages to come up with creative ways to realise its envisioned tale on the film canvas in its entirety. Production design team deserves kudos, for their expertly designed & meticulously detailed set pieces add an authentic vibe to the film's settings. Cinematography is another highlight, as the fluid camera-work, apt colour tones & clever lighting provide an added intensity to its images while Editing makes sure that each scene is relevant to the plot and unfolds it all in a streamlined fashion.Coming to the performances, Sam Rockwell is an absolute revelation in the role of Sam Bell, and delivers a neat, suave & wonderfully balanced input that still remains his best work to date. It was a bold move from the director to let the fate of this film be decided by a single performance but Rockwell plays his part so well that it's difficult to imagine someone else in the given role. Adding more flavours to this key aspect is Kevin Spacey whose calm demeanour & relaxed voice gives GERTY a soul of its own. And last but not the least, Clint Mansell's emotionally-stirring score elevates the experience to a whole new level, and is one of his finest compositions.On an overall scale, Moon remains one of the rarest gems & most under-appreciated works of 21st century cinema that not only ranks as one of the best films of its year but also deserves a place amongst the finest examples of its genre. A smart, slick & promising start to Duncan Jones' directional career, scoring high on both scientific realism & storytelling aspects, and overflowing with existential themes that paint a heartfelt portrait of what it means to be human, Moon is science-fiction in its purest form, that discards the usual distractions & focuses entirely on the emotional journey of its character. Outstandingly directed, deftly written, gorgeously photographed, tightly edited, beautifully scored & brilliantly performed, Moon comes strongly recommended. Don't miss it.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Moon is not what you're expecting,"I entered into moon expecting another standard sci fi movie about mining Helium 3. I expected commentary on global warming, renewable energy, and maybe something on corporate greed. While those ideas are present in Moon what we get is so much better than what I expected. It has been many years since I have seen a sci film that presented so many excellent science fiction ideas to its audience. Any one of the concepts in this film can spawn conversation that last for hours and cumulatively you can talk about Moon for days.

By the time we do put a station on the moon, we would not stick a robot that looked like a mobile compactor. If it was a straight man we put on the moon, the android would be female and have all the moves and parts that the dude would need. Or to save some money they would just stick a gay dude up there and build an android with male parts. Which would be the less expensive option probably.

Cerebral exercise with a twist,"Stylistically, MOON owes a great debt to the likes of SOLARIS, SILENT RUNNING and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, all films exploring astronauts trapped in a self-made prison in space and suffering the extremes of loneliness. The difference is, while those films were new and thought-provoking at the time, MOON fails to offer much in the way of originality for the modern age.Critics lauded it, praising a film which eschews action and incident in favour of deep-rooted themes and an exploration of the human condition. However, I just found it boring. The storyline is unengaging and the material is spread way too thinly over the running time. There just isn't enough substance, enough to make me care about the central character's plight or the twists that are gradually unveiled.I've never been a fan of Sam Rockwell, and his performance here hasn't changed that.

Indy Scifi for Adults...You Will Enjoy It !,"I love an Indy Scifi that tries so hard to be believable. In a time of big budget bombs aimed at 12 year old's it is refreshing to see something aimed at the adults.The special effects were great for a low budget movie. This movie had the look and feel of a real moon base with just about everything you would expect. It looked better and was more realistic than many modern space movies.The script and the acting were great. I would have added a few lines of dialog to make things more clear but overall it was well done. I think the characters should have been a little more sleuth like in their endeavors and their questions, but perhaps that's just me. Given the short time frame to ""take it all in"" perhaps I wouldn't have done much better.The pace of the movie was pretty good, but did have a few slow spots. I know this was just to expand on the characters but I think it could have been sped up a bit and a little more action or sleuthing thrown in.Truly, it should have been a PG-13, not R rated. I guess it is OK to see people get blown to smithereens or vaporized but not to say the F word. The language wasn't even that bad in this movie. The R rating is a little silly here and shows that you can't trust the rating system at all. And as long as it was going to be R, the director should have gone all out and made it even more adult.Originality could be seen as a bit troublesome here. You could say this movie borrowed from many Scifi movies (Replicates in Bladerunner, HAL in 2001 Space Odyssey). But the story here is different and has a more claustrophobic feel to it. I applaud their use of ideas from other scripts. If it works then why not? My only gripe is they didn't expand on the character GERTY to show that it wasn't HAL in disguise.Overall, I have to give this movie a 8/10. Perhaps it isn't perfect but it was well worth the time and money. I am going to have to watch the Indy house near me for other cool Scifi movies.

While it isn't quite as satisfying to rewatch as you'd expect - though it is as entertaining as it is the first time around, this is a confident and competent piece that uses what it has to bring its vision to life, playing with themes and concepts that far outreach its budget but doing it with crafty poise. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"catchy, moody, expensive....","Saw lot's of trailers and posters for this, and have been looking forward to seeing it. I'm a big fan of odyssey, and think solaris is a great trip.This film starts out comparing itself with odyssey (greatest film period) and solaris (very odyssey inspired), then calling it ""one of those rare space gems"". They've made a great soundtrack, spend millions on props and actors. And then....nothing...No, seriously, absolutely nothing.One actor (except when there's two or three of him), the weakest story and plot ever (a five-year-old could think of this). NOT in any way clever or inventive, just tedious and dumb.I suppose some people think ""aah.. a sophisticated scifi experience, maybe even space-opera like, we can discuss seriously, while smoking cigars and sipping whine"" - I can only say: AAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH you've been had!Sorry Hollywood, you can't just steal all the props and ideas from other movies, without adding something yourselves. Throw away that ""random story generator"" and THINK for a change.My 1 star vote is for Clint Mansell's soundtrack ONLY...and not for this pathetic excuse for a movie",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great (almost) one actor movie,"This is a very well crafted, intriguing, sf space thriller and it's acted amazingly well by Sam Rockwell who is almost the one single character in the movie, except the voice for AI Gertie and a bit of scenes from his wife calling from Earth. Other than that Rockwell carries the movie by himself and does a great job doing it.This movie is never boring, it's calm and even slow, nothing dramatic or packed with action, but it's still not boring and that's a serious skill. The story is smart and leads you slowly into the center and core of it. It also shows very interesting and original perspective on the specific theme, which I don't want to spoil.And not to forget, soundtrack is great and follows the movie perfectly. I recommend it, and I can watch it multiple times.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Like Solaris, only a lot less absorbed and more absorbing","I am reluctant to label this film as ""sci-fi"". It is a film about loneliness, loss and identity which uses space as a convenient metaphor.The basic plot is very quickly summed up, and does show many similarities with Solaris: man is working alone on a commercial mining expedition to the moon. He is about to be sent back to earth after completing his three year contract for a Korean energy company. His job appears to be basic maintenance of automated mining equipment, and he spends his days carving wooden figurines, growing plants and talking to the computer that helps him with everyday tasks. He is clearly a very lonely man, and comforts himself with dreams and pictures of his wife and daughter back on earth.Shortly before his return to earth, strange things start happening, and this is where the story really starts. The initial assumption, much like in Solaris, is that he is losing his mind. Unlike Solaris however, Moon offers a real, gripping storyline full of unexpected twists from this point on. It has a very similar focus on the inner life of the main protagonist, but explores this both more broadly and more clearly.The central concern of the film is asking firstly what makes us human, and secondly what makes us ourselves. While it does have a satisfying (if cheesy) answer to the first question, it has no answer to the second. It explores the potential human and moral issues involved in exploiting new technology, and asks what we actually value in life - if we don't know who we are, or why we exist, why do we still care?Possible criticisms are that some elements of the plot are never fully explained, and I found the heavy handed socialist theme of the ""evil corporation"" a bit tediously predictable.Overall, it is an emotionally touching film that nevertheless has a very tight plot and pacing that keeps the suspense up almost to the last scene.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Hey, oldschool scifi fans... CHECK IT OUT.","I'm just going to rattle off some titles, and if you like most of them, chances are you'll really enjoy ""Moon"". If, on the other hand, you think these movies are boring, then there's no need for you to read further; skip this movie.OutlandBlade RunnerStar Trek the Motion PictureTHX-1138Soylent Green20012010Space: 1999Kin-Dza-Dza (an obscure Russian flick, but I'll throw it in there anyway)All of these productions share something in common: the attitude that mood & theme are more important than special effects or even plot. These are all films that make you think on a level much deeper than the action on screen. Special effects are (in most cases) minimalistic and pacing is slow and heavy. No, this definitely ain't Star Wars.More than a scifi flick, ""Moon"" is a psychological thriller that unfolds slowly and cryptically, with many surprises thrown at you. When I say 'surprises' I don't mean monsters jumping out of the dark, but rather surprises in the way characters behave and resolve matters.Adding more twists to the joyride, director uses familiar elements from older scifi to make us think certain things, but this is a clever way of fooling the audience. So don't be put off by the fact that certain elements may seem like they're stolen from other films. In the DVD commentary, the director tells us that these elements are intended as both an homage and a storytelling device. And that's precisely what makes it interesting to old school scifi fans. The same way Steve Martin's ""Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid"" is a pastiche of 40s film noir with a new spin, ""Moon"" does a similar thing with 70s scifi.I won't say a thing about the plot since it's best that you experience it yourself. I'll just say that it touches on psychology, sociology, genetics, ethics, industrialism, stem cell research and a whole host of topics that are relevant today, let alone for future generations. This is very much a thinker's flick, so if you're the kind of person who bores easily, I'd say stay away.I'll mention one other thing that you should keep in mind when watching this movie. It had an overall budget of a measly $5 million, but it looks every bit as believable, if not more, than today's movies that cost 25x as much (Star Wars III had a budget of $120 million). The director accomplished this feat by going back to the old ways of doing special effects in the 70s: models & miniatures, not computer generated cartoons. A full set was built for the moon base, and everything was filmed within those rooms, no cheating. This gives the film a degree of authenticity that you can't get any other way. Yes, there was some cgi added in post-production, but with very few exceptions I couldn't spot it.I highly recommend you watch this movie and also watch the extras on the DVD which will give you a greater appreciation for how this production came together, not to mention how much work & discipline went into the performance by Sam Rockwell.If nothing else, this film is a breath of fresh air in space. It's a return to days of 70s science fiction where the emphasis is on 'science' and the abstract themes that arise from it. I rate it 8 out of 10. I only took off points because I would've liked it to be twice as long so it could've explored some of the compelling themes even deeper. But as the director says on the DVD, they kept it mainstream enough that everyone can enjoy it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
an excellent indie film,This was one of those movies that I kept thinking about for days after watching it.Where moon succeeds so spectacularly is in creating an understated but very believable environment which the story grows out of. Its a little slow starting off but in some ways this actually adds to the realism as you can appreciate just how bored this guy must be being up on the moon all by himself.The cinematography is a real highlight. The filmmakers manage to capture something of the sheer grandeur and awe that being on the final frontier must feel like. There are lots of shots pulled far away and above the action that give the viewer a real sense of wide open space and context. What a treat this movie would be to see at the IMAX and if it had been in 3D.Sam Rockwell delivers an undeniably excellent performance. He really caries the film. From watching the making of documentary it was his performance that sold Kevin Spacey to get involved in the project and become the voice of Gurty. Kevin Spacey as Gurty is also perfectly cast because Kevin has that always even keeled detached quality to his voice that is perfect for representing an Artificial Intelligence.Nothing in this movie is in your face. Even the plot twists aren't designed to shock you so much as make you think. Its more of a slow burner that is best watched when you aren't looking for some cheap entertainment and have the time and patience to discover this guys world. Obviously since I gave it 10 stars I think its worth it.,10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Like a great Twilight Zone or Outer Limits extra-long episode,"Moon is a contemplative psychological mystery sci-fi movie like we rarely see anymore. An astronaut lives at a base on the far side of the moon at a mining base, collecting and sending canisters of a precious isotope back to Earth. He has a 3 year-contract and in that time he lives totally isolated except for a robot companion and recorded messages from his wife. You see his life has become pretty much routine, until a certain accident... where he will meet someone looking very much like him... (not a spoiler : seen in the trailer).What would you do if you met someone like yourself when you thought you were unique ? That's not only food for thought but also a disturbing mystery. ""Moon"" is slow to start but soon turns more and more intriguing. The strength here is in the storyline more than in the somewhat eighties-looking special effects. The effects are quite acceptable by the way and seamless when 2 particular characters are together. The night skies seemed a bit fake though. The biggest flaw I noticed was the reaction, or lack thereof, of the 2 main characters when they meet. That didn't seem real to me. Interrogations regarding their respective nature do occur but a tad too late.Other than that, Sam Rockwell did an amazing acting job and he keeps our interest high even when not much is happening. He also manages to convey the few dramatic moments quite well. Beyond the acting, it's the mysteries that keeps us watching, not only the big obvious one but also the mysteries of the human (and non-human) reactions to such unexpected circumstances. The robot companion is rather low-tech with his static smiley faces but with the soothing voice of Kevin Spacey and some surprising actions becomes quite a memorable character. The minimal soundtrack comprised mostly of simple piano is very good. Despite being outwardly sci-fi and seemingly cold like its namesake, Moon is a very intimate and human experience that deserves to be watched except for those who absolutely need lots of action.Rating : 7.5 out of 10 (very good)",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good Sci-Fi,"Sam Bell (Rockwell) is the man on the moon in the last 2-weeks of a 3-yr contract, monitoring mining operations for a mineral that earth needs to solve its energy problems. He is alone except for Gerty (voice of Spacey) a computer that monitors Sam's health, the mining operation and the base station. Suddenly he gets sick and this almost causes a fatal accident outside the station. Then he realizes he is no longer alone.At first I thought, ""well, here we go again with imaginary friends"" and ""let the ripoff continue.""But, it's not that. The other person is a spitting image of himself and Sam doesn't know what to make of this. And, he gets no help from Gerty who will not answer his questions. But, since the other Sam doesn't seem to be a threat, Original Sam goes about his business and eventually confronts the ""other Sam.""This is good Sci-Fi, but there are some holes. Why would the company that Sam works for only allow one man to monitor the mining operation? Maybe the thinking is that Gerty would be enough. Hmmm. Big clue concerns Sam's sickness, and a 3-yr contract. Can you figure it out?Original Sam does have some hallucinations: he sees a woman, not his wife, sitting in a chair. The woman hallucination is never explained. And, the accident is caused by his having another hallucination of the same woman outside the station. Again, never explained. Maybe hallucinations don't need to be explained and they are what they are. And, one more thing. A computer is not supposed to show emotion, but there are a few instances whereby Spacey got too involved and we hear some emotion in his voice.Not really a hole, but the computer's name of Gerty is never explained. Well, the name of HAL in 2001 was never explained until later on. The closest I can come is that Gerty is based upon a Jewish mother's name: Gertrude Goldberg (from the Goldbergs TV show back in the day) or was that Molly and not Gertrude? I give up, but it's the closest I can come. The Jewish mother reference is about someone who takes care of everything, like Gerty does. Get it? Tough room.All in all a very good Sci Fi movie and I would have nominated Sam Rockwell for an Oscar (yes, I'm still handing them out).Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, a lot in the early part of the movie",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Moon,"It is hard to write a review without giving away too much as to not spoil your surprise or enjoyment, but just watch the trailer and you will get the basic premise of the film but luckily it doesn't show you everything that will ruin the overall pleasure.The film starts us off with stock footage telling us that the Earths natural resources are pretty much used up and more environmentally friendly sources of energy can be found on the moon. This is where majority of the film takes place.Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell), is nearing his 3 year stint on the moon with only Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey) as his reliable and only companion, he is most certainly looking forward to going home, but not everything goes according to plan. After 3 years of isolation and no contact with the outside world (he only receives delayed video transmission from Earth via satellite link) he begins to see things (an unknown woman on the base) and notices minor glitches in video playback and archive footage of himself he doesn't remember recording. When one of the mining vehicles stalls, Sam goes out to investigate only to find his hallucination reappearing on the surface of the moon which causes him to crash.When he wakes up in the infirmary, he has no recollection of the crash. This is when the real mystery and marvel of the film begins The recovered Sam notices that the mining vehicle is still not in proper working order but Gerty denies him access to go outside. When Sam manages to convince Gerty to let him check it out, he comes across an abandoned lunar vehicle next to one of the mining vehicle and finds an unconscious body. ""His"" unconscious body....This film is outstanding and the performance by Sam Rockwell is superb (he was criminally denied a nod for best actor). The main driving force in the film, is that Sam is able to portray himself as two different characters and the amount of sadness and loneliness he displays when he is alone is a complete contrast to the anger, frustration and confusion that he shows as the 2nd Sam Bell. The supporting vocals from Kevin Spacey also provides the film more of the feeling of isolation and alienation. Its all done very monotonous way but he does convey human emotions via emoticon.Little touches within the film are marvellous and subtle. The use of Chesney Hawkes ""The One and Only"" is so ironic and apt used that it is the probably only time I would ever tolerate his music. The score as well is very haunting and very effective. Clint Mansell (Requiem For a Dream) once again creates the perfect ambient and mood.We see the influences worn clearly on its sleeve. The sets and designs are very in keeping with other sci-fi classic. White minimalistic interiors (2001, Alien) and a computer called Gerty who is very HAL-like (also 2001) and vast emptiness of space. It's very much a throwback to old 70s and early 80s sci-fi films. Scenes are reminiscent of films like Silent Running and Outlands. Films like these are not always about alien invasions and this is one that questions, why are we here and who are we really....The general themes on what makes us humans and what is humanity are very apparent and asks you questions on what really makes us who we are. Is it our ability to dream, think, desire and to feel... The portrayal of these human qualities by Sam Rockwell gives the film its heart and soul. We are all rooting for him to make it home because of the suffering and desire to see ""his"" loved ones is so overwhelming. We start off with a man waiting to go home only for it to turn out to be a film about identity.It is an intelligent and very thoughtful piece of science fiction with a deeply affecting performance from Sam Rockwell. With no other major actor (bar Kevin Spaceys voice and video footage via satellite) it is a wonderful and mesmerising display of skill and nuances from Sam Rockwell that even if you don't enjoy sci-fi movies you have to tip your hat in acknowledgement of his ""one"" man show.if you like my review please visit my blog http://fsfilm.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Different and realistic premise for a sci-fi,"The overall premise is great, and I think they delivered up to about 70% of its potential. There were some understandable budget constraints, some questionable technology and the split screen acting could have been better. Kevin Spacey's voice is also jarringly normal, although I do like Kevin Spacey very much, I think he or the director could have made him a bit more surreal. If you look at the credits you will be impressed just how few were in it, and after all it is just one guy pretty much in a room and that is tough to do for 2 hours. So I give a lot of credit to that alone.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best sci-fi ever,"Contrary to popular belief that it's impossible to make a good sci-fi movie without good cash aid, Duncan Jones creates his extraordinary story having only 5 million in his pocket. While Hollywood tries to show something technically advanced to surprise people, Duncan Jones just made a true masterpiece, without any reinvent the wheel, by using tricks that peculiar to the real masters of movie creating. Tactically omitted attempts to impress spectator by dint of bright and expensive special effects, creators switched on the viewer on the other significant aspects of that film, such as an atmosphere and the script.First and foremost I'd like to take a glance at the script. The plot has been madden looking over Stanislav Lem's (famouse Polish sci-fi writer) shoulder. If you ever red The Star Diaries and Memoirs of a Space Traveller, you'll certainly like the script in the ''Moon''. The story is about lonely miner Sam who has got a three year business contract on Moon. Towards the end of the contract, strange things start to occur on the station, and only elaborate Sam's investigation may shed the light on the truth. After figuring out of the situating Sam faced a conspiracy. What kind of conspiracy he deals with I won't tell just to not ruin your impressions about the plot.Now let's talk about atmosphere. A lot of small diversions showing Sam's way of life, greatly detailed and neat mining station, beautifully illustrated Moon landscapes and competently chosen music in the post-rock genre, creates an accurate picture which is ideally fits to the spectator's stare. Absence of other people except Sam makes to feel lonely too, and plot tensions in the second half permanently sustain deep empathy feeling for the main character. Though in the middle of the film I already had couple of assumptions about the plot clue, I didn't know exactly what the punch line till the end is. That's what I just call amazing.In additional I should notice eccentric acting of Sam Rockwell, he's one of my favorite actor cos of his person's variety. He's capable to play almost everyone, remember ''The Choke'', ''The Green Mile'', ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' and dozens more works! Every role he had is completely opposite to each other. Pity that this actor and his potential seriously underestimated by Hollywood. And he quite rarely gets the main roles in outstanding movies.The result obtained here was great, I have no doubt that director reached desirable goal. And the only one reason I'm claiming that because of perfect combination of every element in the film. I just don't know what could be added here more. I hope further Duncan Jones's works will have the same charm. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
2010: A Moon Odyssey,"ooh... here is the new century's equivalent and homage to 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY but only 90minutes in length. Clearly inspired from the 1968 Kubrick film, MOON allows Gen X and Y to have their own look alike complete with ambiguous themes, clunky white/grey sets, and calls to home. I was actually really pleased to see MOON especially with the completely magnetic Sam Rockwell and the overall effect of the film which is to challenge and entertain with some space paradox ideas and melancholy. Kevin Spacey as Gertie - or PAL or even KPAX the talking robot - was a good touch and the eerie and tense atmosphere, especially once the 3 year life of the job is revealed was both compelling and effective. However you must see MOON on a huge screen... to see this Cinerama sized drama in cinema 10 in some shoebox-plex is not doing yourself, your cash or the film any favors. Seek the biggest screen, sit alone, and go on a journey.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Ambitious ""Moon"" lands short of exciting","No matter the premise, a film puts itself at a disadvantage when it calls for a one man show. Sam Rockwell, as talented as he is, cannot generate enough interesting conflict with nothing at his disposal but the skin-tingling monotone voice of Kevin Spacey. In other words, films like ""Moon"" have to work twice as hard to keep our attention and more importantly, capture our imagination. Creator Duncan Jones' first feature-length film makes an ambitious attempt to pull off this challenge, but it doesn't fully get there.The echoing theme in outer space movies is the silence, loneliness and its consequent madness. With only Sam Rockwell as astronaut Sam Bell, the expectation is ""Moon"" will repeat those themes and the hope is it will shed new light on them. There are a few snippets where it does get us to begin contemplating existence in a new way, but it doesn't meditate on these ideas enough, doesn't let them cook.Sam Bell is a space worker on the dark side of the moon in the near future when Earth is harvesting moon rocks for Helium 3, a new fuel/energy alternative. Bell is contracted for three years to oversee four rock-harvesting machines. At the time of the story, he's nearly completed his three years and eagerly awaits going home to his wife and daughter when an accident happens leading to a startling discovery.I've always been a fan of Sam Rockwell. He's done a great job balancing comedy and drama in numerous films such as ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" and most recently ""Frost/Nixon."" He brings the same talents to a quiet ""Moon."" However, ""Moon"" doesn't give him a lot of opportunity to stretch his dramatic talents despite being the only role in the film; his character is thinly developed, his motivations never clearly spelled out.""Moon"" has an opportunity to paint a beautiful but tortured picture of life in outer space, but little of Jones' visual imagery really sticks in our minds. A film with so few roles should really be advanced in the way of visual storytelling, should pry deep into the soul of its main character through image, but that's a lot to ask from a novice filmmaker. Instead, he's busy fighting the audience's assumption that the Spacey-voiced computer assistant, GERTY, will inevitably turn evil. You can't spend all your efforts trying not to be too much like ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and not identify another force of antagonism. Jones also struggles a lot in the beginning editing scenes together, trying to keep the film's pace up until the discovery.There is quite an inspiring idea behind ""Moon,"" once the true nature of Bell's situation is revealed, but it never hits us the way Jones wants it to. There's simply not enough conflict despite Rockwell's best efforts to keep our attention and the space visuals are not as awe- striking as they need to be to counter that disadvantage as well. ""Moon"" is a unique movie, but it's a very long and lonely hour and a half.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Great Indie Science Fiction,"Moon is great sci-fi flick and will be put in my section of indie sci-fi. Solaris, Silent Running, Soylent Green, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Sphere have found their place there. Moon does a good job confusing you at the beginning and makes you ask some good questions about what it means to maintain perspective on life. Watching Sam Rockwell in the science fiction realm playing a dual role like in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was fun. The scenes where he plays ping pong with himself were very well done. In the scenes where he talks to himself it seems more stressful than necessary, but the fleeting madness of loneliness which turn out to be fleeting moments of clarity was brilliant. I especially had fun looking for the signs of age amidst all the sterility and white decor like the coffee stains, stick-em notes, permanent marking on walls and the oddly placed arm chair were nice touches.

Great story to the movie with a not that predictable twist. Despite the small budget the film was made of there can be no complaints regarding the visuals, the locations look stunning from the first minute to the last and you really get the feel of that out of space loneliness. Clint Mansell does it again as always. In fact I would go as far to say that this is his best work up to date.

A different kind of sci-fi story.,"I haven't seen a new, cerebral sci-fi movie in a while, but Moon scratches that itch quit well. It's somber, engrossing, and almost heartbreaking at times.The plot is fairly simple. There's a clean energy source on the moon, and a company has built a permanent base there, to harvest it. The base is occupied only by a man (who stays there for three years at a time, before going back to earth and being replaced) and a robot that serves as a universal helper to the human. From there, a story of loneliness, love, and the very essence of humanity, unwinds.I really dug the direction the story took. It never felt limited by the small number of characters, and the plot developments succeed in keeping the movie interesting, without becoming disorienting or boring. I recommend Moon to anyone who likes a good, personal drama, regardless of whether or not they are a general fan of science fiction.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

How does a man on the moon get his haircut? Eclipse it.,"I'd heard very good things about Moon from friends and critics alike and had been markedly disappointed by its limited cinema release. Thus I was very excited when I finally got round to watching it.To think this film was made on a relatively puny budget of £5m is staggering. The story is excellent told by the clearly very talented director, Duncan Jones; beautifully shot and styled through the cinematography, set design, modelling and effects; and brilliantly acted by Sam Rockwell, the most underrated actor in Hollywood. I've been a fan of Rockwell since Lawn Dogs but his performance here really is masterful. Kevin Spacey's vocal performance as Gerty is also delivered perfectly.A funny, dramatic, upsetting, thought-provoking, beautiful film that deserves vastly more recognition than it's had. I've given it nine stars because it doesn't quite do enough to knock my all time favourites of their pedestal but it's definitely the best I've seen in a long while. A natural, more understated cousin of Sunshine and Solaris (done on a sliver of their budgets) this is a must for everyone, not just sci-fi fans. Put it on your list now.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Proper science fiction,"'Moon' is a sci-fi thriller that makes a very obvious acknowledgement of it debt to that definitive movie, '2001': it ponders (among other matters) the nature of artificial intelligence and the infinite loneliness and isolation of a life in space, while serving us with an aesthetic of sterile gleaming white, and digital communications devices that might have represented 1970's vision of the future but which already seem decades out of date. The film also addresses another sci-fi staple (though not one mentioned in Kubrick's work), namely the identity of clones, and actually does so with some skill, using its futuristic setting to explore questions of identity that have emotional impact in their own right, as well as thematic resonance in our own world. For sci-fi, this is a relatively low-budget movie: no explosions, an effective cast of one, and a set that at times looks as if it was made of Lego; yet it's sparse, haunting, and effective, and also less pretentious than its illustrious forebear.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Thank you, Moon!","Moon is one of the most refreshing films I have ever seen. Since it was made in 2009, it was a complete joy to see a film that respected what the science fiction genre was all about. It's not often that we get a sci-fi taking place outside of earth that doesn't rely on aliens and explosions to be considered within it's genre. It's a smart, slow building psychological thriller that puts in the effort to include mind-bending elements into its innovative storyline. Yet another thing I found refreshing is how GERTY, the artificial intelligence of the film, was presented (besides the character being played by Kevin Spacey). What impressed me is that the movie didn't call for it's viewers to be emotionally involved with the robotic character, which makes some modern movies fail. Because of all this, the film reminded me of 2001: A Space Odyssey, which is way before my time. Luckily for my generation, Moon is not.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Beautiful, full of humor, top science fiction","This is an example of how a science fiction film should be made. The story is believable, the character(s?) are played very well.

That was very well made too, but it lacked the cleverness of ""Moon"", that story was totally unbelievable. I think that for this director a big budget is not a guarantee for a good movie.

It's a good little sci-fi film,"This is a good film, but my problem with reviewing it is that I saw it when it was released fourteen years ago. Even though I didn't remember a lot of this, it doesn't play as well a second time when you know all of its twists and surprises. It also doesn't help to have to listen to Kevin Spacey throughout in 2023 as the voice of a robot, the only physical presence other than Sam Rockwell. What was once a great speaking voice now sounds silky and slimy. Rockwell, underrated for years, though no more, does well in this as a guy alone in a mining camp on the moon. Any further plot details will only give away much of the rest. Interestingly, while I don't remember him, Rockwell plays a character by the same name 9 years later for the director, Duncan Jones, in Mute, a film I also liked.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Brilliant and unique sci-fi movie for a long time,"Very unique science fiction movie for a long time.Total isolation in the moon, getting weirder all along the movie, really felt isolated while watching this in the evening.I felt like Space Odyssey 2001 and HAL most of the time, also Alien3 came to mind, it was fascinating. Great performance from actors, mostly Sam Rockwell who made this actually believable.For a low budget movie I'd say this was brilliant, script and all. Directing was also very good and made me wonder what would they have done with bigger budget.Best sci-fi movie for a long time, really. If you enjoy sci-fi and very confusing plot I recommend this, it makes your brain tickle. This wasn't even too long or anything, just long enough to make it whole.

Brilliant,"This is definitely one of those special films that comes out very rarely, you might only get one a year (if you're lucky). Low key, subtle, not at all over the top in effects, action, dialogue, romance, anything. Just a damn good watch and a movie that tells an interesting, multifaceted story. Certainly not a blockbuster that keeps you on the edge of your seat, nor would it claim to be that type of film, but nonetheless one of the most riveting films I've seen in a while.I've always liked Sam Rockwell in everything he's been in, he's got a certain intangible quality that I find accessible in an actor, even as the truly evil William Wharton in The Green Mile. He's the main reason I was so interested in seeing this, and here, in his biggest role yet, he's definitely at his best. For this film to work, the person who played the main character was the most important decision to make, and they couldn't have picked anyone better. Sam Rockwell's just so believable.A fantastic directorial debut, and considering who the director's dad is, boy is there some talent in that family.Highly enjoyable, even more highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Review of ""Moon""","UK Director Duncan Jones makes his debut with ""Moon"", the story of a man who experiences a personal crisis as he nears the end of a three-year solitary stint mining helium-3 on the far side of the Earth's moon. That's about all I can say about the plot without spoiling anything, other than the fact that it is very interesting, original, and, even at times, emotional. Sam Rockwell gives a very affecting performance as Sam Bell, the troubled astronaut minor, and Kevin Spacey gives a very memorable performance as the voice of Bell's robot companion GERTY. In terms of the script, I felt that it was fairly well written - The dialogue was engaging and realistic. The special effects are very impressive, considering that this movie only had a 5 million dollar budget. Another aspect that I found to be fairly unique was the soundtrack. At the climax of this film I found myself whistling the movie's main theme song - something that is hard to get me to do. In the end, I feel that ""Moon"" is a worthy addition into the ""Hard Sci-Fi"" genre. It kept me interested throughout the film and even forced me ponder it's many convoluted ideas after it was over.

An Outstanding Achievement,"Moon is an outstanding achievement. Coming from an unknown director and an actor that isn't known for starring roles, I never imagined I would be totally mesmerized and amazed by Moon. It's difficult to explain this confusing story without being spoiled, so I won't try. Talk about being lazy, huh? The first forty minutes of Moon, which is about half-way through the movie, is confusing. Not confusing like 'The Usual Suspects', but more along the confusion of 'Donnie Darko'. It makes you think hard until you feel silly for thinking it was confusing, because it truly is a simple plot. There are two main actors, Sam Rockwell and Kevin Spacey. Kevin gives a fun voice-over and Sam is simply outstanding. You will forget that Sam is acting for two characters in the movie, meaning he gives one helluva performance. He should receive an Oscar-nomination. The director is promising as he shows the Moon in a cinematic -but simple- way throughout and uses great camera-work to make the movie, well, work. Moon is simply an amazing sci-fi like no other and is one of the best movies to come out in 2009. Sometimes simplicity is a great thing.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Rockwell plays a very lonely astronaut whose wife and daughter are on earth. He is at the end of his three year mission contract when an accident happens. Surprise to say this film is per gravity but with paranoia and obvious isolation. The film asks more questions than answers about The two Sams and Gerty's role up there. Lunar industries has another agenda but I don't know what it is. The filming is spectacular and believable about the moon and its harsh conditions of life.

Drivel,"I am a fan of SciFi but this dog leaves me stunned that other reviews give it a fair to good rating. I missed it in the local cinema but bought the DVD - which turned out to be a disappointment quite apart from the film itself. (It first of all just played ""snow"" and the special features refuse to run. Shame that - they might have thrown some light on the plot....) Obviously a low budget movie, the constant jump cuts, shonky outfits and wobbly computers could be forgiven if the story warranted it. I don't think I am particularly thick, but the long, drawn out sequences of a moon rover approaching various stations, the haphazard editing and the way the scenes are manipulated so as to get the same actor in the one shot made it a real effort to keep watching.The final straw for me is the really terrible diction of the various Sams - the mumbling delivery meant I could not follow much of the dialogue. That certainly didn't help understanding what the hell was going on - not that it mattered, since I lost interest halfway through.Oscars?

a return of the smart sci fi,"Moon's style seems to have borrowed somewhat heavily from the early 70's film Silent Running and to a lesser extent other classics such as 2001 and Alien, however its strong subject matter and a smart story pull this low budget sci-fi up to the level of those it pays homage to and presents a contemporary and viable story of its own.Without revealing too much plot, there is one actor, the underrated Sam Rockwell (think Gary oldman without the ticks) and an ambiguous genre-defying computer voiced by Kevin Spacey named Gerty. They spend their days lolling around a moon station mining the films Mc guffin ""Helium -3"". After the initial set up things get a little difficult for our protagonist as he struggles to comprehend the events that are evolving around him. The film keeps you engaged for the entire running time and ends with a few head scratches that will keep you awake for that ""penny dropping"" moment when the whole film makes perfect sense. Its main themes are as interesting as the story itself and it explores quite a few, mainly human isolation and compassion, consumerism and corporatization mixed with strong overtones of environmental deprecation at the expense of industry and commerce.Duncan Jones who has obviously inherited his dad's interest in all things space proves in control of his subject matter and willing to let us think for ourselves, which is rare in this day and age. Some tasteful modern cues adorn the film; a few orchestral winks to scores past keep us entertained whilst not detracting from the films overall tone. The sound design keeps the artificial environment alive and humming and adds to the claustrophobia and distance one would feel in that environment. You'll believe there is a real moon space mining operation out there. All in all this movie gives low budget films a boost and possibly signals the beginning of studios funding the ""smart"" sci-fi film rather than some of the bloated messes we see in the cinema these days.

"""Sam, get some sleep. You're very tired.""","I have to confess, I'm a little underwhelmed / disappointed that I'm afraid of all the critical praise this film receives. But that doesn't mean that this film is a failure in any way, it's actually quite the opposite. Let's start with the positive ones. First of all, Sam Rockwell can act, he's playing Sam Bell (TOO MANY SAMS), an astronaut who holds harvesters on the moon, giving the earth energy back. His performance plays out like an absolute fever dream, particularly as the deteriorating version of himself. It's excellent pretty damn it. This film's score is stunning. Combining a dark tune of the piano with the mysteries scattered in the film. Cold, simple, yet cold.What I think is capitalizing on the film's own color scheme, black and white. GERTY, played by Kevin Spacey, is a great help (perhaps a great deal of support, as I will explain later). The layout of the cinematography and the stage is on par. Yet Moon has lots of wafer-thin plot devices that weigh it down unfortunately. Through his perspective, the emotional connection between Sam and his daughter is absolutely appalling, but through the eyes of the audience I feel as though Duncan Jones could have done more visually to interpret his mental breakdown as a clone. While enigmatic, the dramatic elements of this movie are sadly largely unincidental.Yeah, there's a' big reveal' somewhat, but it's purchased by how it's described. A robotic GERTY present. Sam's condition could have been illustrated a little more, there are some gross indicators of his body whiting away at himself, but psychologically I feel like instead of perhaps using an analogy that is also grounded in reality, Duncan Jones could have used the idea of' perception vs reality' hinted at around the time when Sam pours hot water on himself. Moon is unfortunately not the ice chilling movie it might have been in what might have been a fever dream of uncertainty.There are some great moments of brokenness, but the motivation and reaction of the character to the thinly advertised essential twist of the entire film is done very poorly. Nevertheless, Moon isn't a tragedy, and atmospherically it's very well made. It's just all else is a little meh in an attempt to make up for the lack of ideas to do with the harshness of isolation, especially in a cruel environment like space.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Great sci-fi debut from a promising director,"Sam Rockwell is the sole human caretaker of a clean energy mining base on the moon, due to go home in two weeks, when strange images start to haunt him. Is he just a little homesick, or is something strange happening? A simple premise, and in the hands of amateurs this $5m budget sci-fi indie flick could have turned into a predictable series of space clichés, but the inspired acting of Sam Rockwell and the creative force of Duncan Jones (formerly Zowie Bowie, and a near-ringer for his dad) turn it into a compelling, thoughtful film dealing with issues of technology, corporatism, loneliness, human identity, and long-distance love. I saw this tonight at a British Film Institute screening in London, which included a Q&A with Duncan Jones. He explained some of the challenges and solutions of creating low-budget, meaningful science-fiction films in a world populated by Transformers and a powerful but largely safe mainstream sci-fi industry. His obvious devotion and keen knowledge of science fiction shows through in the film's homages to classics of 1970s/1980s sci-fi, retaining the darker feel of those times while bringing the story right into the 21st century. This is a must-see.

Terrifyingly Real.,"Moon (2009).Chipper F. Xavier, Esq.Sam Bell (Rockwell) is a one-person mine operator employed by The Company on the far side of the moon in the year 2035. With a mission plan of three years, Sam is scheduled to return to earth in two weeks. As the time for his departure nears, Sam suffers a catastrophic accident which reveals a deeper, more sinister plan by The Company to keep Sam from ever returning to 
earth.Writer-director Duncan Jones (Source Code, Warcraft: The Beginning) with writer Nathan Parker craft a terrifying tale which is set, directed and acted like a major motion picture event. Surprisingly, the sole actor to appear onscreen is Sam Rockwell, and the film is even more stunning because of it.All of the set pieces when taken together deliver an effective seventies feel, and the robotic assistant GERTY, voiced by Kevin Spacey, has a quaint and realistic appearance. Despite its modest budget of 5 million dollars, Moon comes off as a much more expensive film.The real surprise of Moon is not Sam Rockwell's skill in carrying the movie on his sizable shoulders, nor is it in the effective way dialog is utilized. Moon's greatest achievement is in normalizing dehumanizing behavior by corporations, and in so doing it forces the audience to bear witness to the atrocity.What does it mean to be alive? What responsibilities does mankind have in safeguarding living creatures? Who, or what do we classify as a human being? Moon's answers may shock you, but in our examination of the human condition, life can never be taken for granted.For these reasons, Moon is a cinematic masterpiece: With just a handful of actors, Duncan Jones manages to capture the hidden meaning of our existence - and all we have to do is watch, reflect and learn.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Interesting but very frustrating,"Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is near the end of a 3-year job on the Moon when some issues begin to arise. He's become pretty lonely and maybe a bit crazy from the prolonged isolation but finally he'll get to go home in a couple of weeks. This movie starts out very interesting and engaging. But soon enough, it becomes another vague thriller that's more about making us feel a certain way than earning those feelings through detailed and polished story-telling.Some thoughts. If he's the only man on the Moon, doing this important job, how much is he getting paid? The company is clearly making millions or even billions. Clearly he should be earning heaps if he's not completely naive. And is he the only one that could do this job? Why would they only put one person on the Moon, is that really safe and reliable? What if he gets sick or hurt? Why would he agree to it? It would make more sense to have rotations, regular visits to Earth to keep the mind and body healthy. It's not like they don't have the energy resources.Naturally, he has a wife and young daughter back on Earth. That maximises the emotional resonance of his loneliness - brilliant, right? I guess they couldn't have picked another candidate with less attachments... And conveniently, the communication is severely limited. How sad for him! All this energy and even artificial gravity but no reception! None of this is explained or explored. We know very little about him, his life, his interests, memories, hopes or regrets. That might not matter if the movie was full of things happening. But it's really just him. We need to know him.The movie got especially annoying towards the middle. It became confusing and ambiguous. Plot points would eventually clear up but then I'd wonder why they didn't just make it clear from the start. This is what happens in bad horror movies. The characters get upset or frustrated and do stupid things. They don't think. They make things worse for themselves. They fight with each-other. They lie and make assumptions. They investigate a little bit but then give up. They are stupid and you want them to die.The problem is that Moon has a perfectly logical and interesting plot but haphazardly reveals it while you sit there confused. I predicted several things and waited for them to awkwardly be revealed over time. Moon is padded out with artificial moments and plot devices.There are similarities to 2001: A Space Odyssey but they're more off-putting than inspired. 2001 is a separate movie, why not let it be? It's nice when a great new movie pays homage to the classics of the past. But Moon pales in comparison to 2001 so the ""homage"" is distracting - I end up wishing I was watching 2001 instead. Guardians of the Galaxy brought humour and silliness. Moon doesn't push any boundaries. I was also reminded of Interstellar and the fact that it blew me away and was far more ambitious and original.I think Sam Rockwell is a good actor but maybe he just ends up playing too many similar roles. He always seems edgy, sort of halfway between likable and a jerk. I think a more stable and upbeat personality would have worked better here, to contrast with the desolate environment and confronting plot developments. Someone we believe is good so we care when we see their difficult choices and possible corruption.There also could have been a fair bit of humour without taking anything away from the plot. Moon is a bit dull and serious in tone. People in isolation would develop more of a dark sense of humour to cope. The film-makers didn't think about it that much it seems. In fact, there's very little to show that he's actually been there for 3 years. Very few details. All he has to show for that period of time is a small town model that he's carved. Why not anything more fun or colourful? Movies or music or games or sports? Why does space invariably have to be so depressing and plain and white and clean?The special effects are very good. They're seamless and don't draw unnecessary attention to themselves. It simply looks like you're on the Moon. It's very cool. And it's refreshing to see beautiful sights you wouldn't normally see. The table tennis scene was slightly impressive but unnecessary. It *did* draw attention to the special effects (which is bad).Moon is a movie with a good idea and a good actor. It touches on thought-provoking themes and has some very interesting plot ideas that could be discussed a fair bit. It's technically well-made but the script is just too weak and flawed. It's the way the emotions are handled and the artificial unfolding of the plot that ruins it. I have to still give it a 7 because in spite of its flaws, it's interesting and pretty original. The deep frustration stems from its wasted potential. It could have been a really great film but instead it's an interesting sci-fi plot bogged down by typical melodrama and countless plot holes.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Hardly dull watching Sam and Sam again - Sam Rockwell rocks in Duncan Jones' intriguing debut film ""Moon"" masterfully done","Sam Rockwell assuredly delivered all the variations and range of an astronaut Sam Bell in director Duncan Jones' debut film ""Moon"". Yes, it is a space sci-fi based on a story by Jones. The storyline seems to deal with some sort of version control. Could it be a renewed (or rewind) version of the same previous rendition that gets repeated (as programmed)?There is Gerty (calmly voiced by Kevin Spacey). It is much more friendlier than ""HAL"" of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Gerty the computer-brain is quite clear in what he is supposed to do as instructed. He is to help Sam. He is to do what Sam asks him to do. Come to think of it, Gerty probably needs a friend (someone to talk to, play chess with) since he and Sam are the only two working 'units' at the space station (a rather conveniently clever 'techno-arrangement'?)Rockwell is ever so interesting since I first saw him playing opposite John Turturro in Tom DiCillo's ""Box of Moon Light"" (1996). Sam Bell is rather lonely being the sole space worker human on the spaceship three years hence. It's getting into a mindless rut of routines, with occasional delight in reminiscing of family members from home on earth and viewing their video messages. Is ground control becoming callous and neglectful of him?Is Sam truly human in the flesh? It sure seems that way on screen, whether he's inside the ship or outside exploring the moonscape. God forbid he's an android in plurality. No programmed robots are expected to have feelings, let alone 'think' for himself. A computer unit like Gerty may momentarily display a certain degree of 'fondness' - though Gerty masks it by saying he's only doing his job in taking care of and carrying out Sam's requests and needs. Perhaps some scientific 'techno-breakthrough' in cost-saving solutions in optimizing cloning? Not dull at all.""Moon"" is absorbing and definitely thought-provoking sci-fi. You may say it is a bold follow up to Stanley Kubrick's sublime ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" which was very much ahead of its time in 1968 and still rings true today. So Duncan Jones' 1995 bachelor of philosophy's independent study thesis titled, ""How to Kill Your Computer Friend: An Investigation of the Mind/Body Problem and How It Relates to the Hypothetical Creation of a Thinking Machine"" - how coincidental that ""Moon"" contains elements and queries suggestive from the title! There's possible influence from Jones' father, David Bowie, with his famous 'Space Oddity' song lyrics of ""Ground control to Major Tom"". The film does remind me of Douglas Trumbull's ""Silent Running"" (1972) where Bruce Dern is also playing solo in space.

""Isolation"" has been the key element of this brilliant film.","Duncan Jones' directorial debut ""Moon"" is an example of film that came out of nowhere but then hit you by surprise.

""Moon"" offers so much and its being considered one of the best debuts of recent times (BAFTA and Sitges) really proves that it's awesome.In conclusion, one spectacular story with an adequate amount of CG.

Best Sci-fi movie of the year (and in years),"One of the best sci-fi (drama) movies I've seen in a long time. A small-scale movie with a brilliant concept is presented really well by Jones. It is a dialogue movie which just gets better and better as the full scale of the intriguing plot emerges.Sam Rockwell gives his career best performance, and I sincerely hope, come awards season, his efforts are recognized (he could well be a dark horse for the best actor Oscar as well). Other than the great story and acting, the music supports the movie really well also.Overall, this may not be a movie for everyone (especially non Sci-fi fans) but it is definitely worth giving a shot. The story will get you thinking about the movie after you view it, and Rockwell fans (those who felt he deserved a break-out movie) are in for a treat.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Loony,"'Moon' provides a lower budgeted treat for sci-fi fans by giving a new twist to long established interesting sci-fi and fantasy themes. There is a very good performance, or performances, from Sam Rockwell and a hot-chocolatety voice role from Kevin Spacey who is very appropriately named for roles in sci-fi thrillers.The film has a definite visual style, harmonised by the production design and cinematography and this low key but personal aesthetic is continued by the sound design and score. To anyone who has seen excellent TV sci-fi the professional and effective, but cheap, production designs will be instantly familiar and yet nicely distinctive thanks to touches like the Gerty computer and the kitchen area set design.Isolation, loneliness, separation, time dislocation, extreme distances and solitude are standard sci-fi personal themes for Sam Rockwell's character. Touching onto issues of memory, orientation, belief, personhood and sanity. Added to this are issues of human and AI relations and automation and artificial environments; plus secretive and self-interested corporate employers and the ""expendability"" of the working man. There is also an idea that there is safety in numbers and that loneliness equals vulnerability.'Moon' has an immediacy and personal tone thanks to it's performance from Sam Rockwell, and it's well judged voice turn from Kevin Spacey, which mixes with the austere but distinctive visuals, and production design, to make an impression on the viewer. Indeed Spacey provides a wonderful counterpoint to Sam Rockwell's performance which deepens the depressive effect for the protagonist by offering a stylistically opposite performance.In its narrative form 'Moon' delivers a sense of intrigue, mystery, suspense, threat and jeopardy which is complemented by the direction and editing.I rate at 7.5/10 and I recommend to all fans of sci-fi thrillers and ""thinkers"". Fans of the two principal performers will also be very satisfied.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Average sci-fi flick,"Based on reviews and overall rating, I was expecting another Kubrick's Odyssey. In this context, the movie is a letdown.The environment is very well done, although there are some unexplained simplifications, like different levels of gravity inside and outside of the lunar base. Sam Rockwell does a very good job, especially toward the ending of the movie. The movie has a very good main idea, but the screenplay does not capitalize on it. All the ""twists"" and surprises can be seen from miles away, and it fails completely in building any suspense at all. It is one of those movies where you know what could be better immediately after watching it.But it is a decent sci-fi flick, worth watching once, if you like the genre.

Anyway,Soundtrack: A+Plot: A, simple and interestingActing: A, fine work, fellasCGI: A, simple and unassuming. should hold up for quite a few yearsAll in all, this movie is like incense.

Worth Spreading Via Word of Mouth,"As other posts have noted, it difficult to discuss much of the film without giving away some juicy and crucial surprises.

The movie will definitely provide something to think about even after it ends.Well, there were times when I wanted it to end prematurely. Yes, the silence and stillness contributes to the atmosphere a lot, but can very quickly get boring. Yes, the sterile setting helps you immerse, but also raises a lot of questions. Some questions don't need answers, but some do and there were times when I wondered just what is going on. Maybe I wasn't supposed to know the things I wanted?I loved a few scenes with heart-touching moments.

Bills Short Reviews For Short Attention Spans,"There are a lot of themes & subplots going on in Moon, but they're wrapped up in a nice tranquil little package. Sam Rockwell gives a great performance in this film that touches on things from the dangers of corporate America, trust in the future of A.I., all the way down to how we deal with loneliness and leaning to come to terms with ourselves. There are a couple little twists and turns along the way to keep everyone interested, and it's a good straight forward story as well. It can play as either a mild mood piece, or a more complicated take on the themes mentioned above, depending on how deep you feel like diving. It is more of a one watch film, but it is very worth your time to do so.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A wonderfully suspenseful film throughout.,"Pros: This film, being the directorial debut for Duncan Jones, is pretty solid. The film explores the theme of solitude, as well as life. What kind of life is important? Are clones considered human beings? Or are they considered property? Experiments? Are their lives important? Sam Rockwell does a great job at making his character interesting and at making us care about his character and the situation/dilemma he's in. The film also makes a great job at being suspenseful; the film's suspenseful throughout its entirety. Sam's smiley-faced robot companion, and only companion on the Moon, GERTY (the acronym isn't explained in the film), voiced by the amazing Kevin Spacey, is very suspicious. However, what robot isn't suspicious in any science-fiction film? I'm glad Duncan Jones didn't make GERTY into a cliché robot persona.Cons: Some may find the movie completely boring and stupid. It all depends on how you view the film. I like the suspense, and one-man-show, and the eerie setting. The film is long for having just one actor on screen the entire time, but the suspense made the length of the film not a problem to me.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great idea with less complications,"The general idea of the movie is good and creative.Even with one character only in the movie, it is entertaining and always makes you excited for what will happen.

An incredible statement of our potential future,"I don't think I've ever given a 10 rating to ANY movie on IMDb, and I'm a zero or 10 rating kinda guy. I've watched Moon about 3-5 times now, and I'm still blown away by Sam Rockwell's performance.I am still not convinced that this is a sci-fi movie, and more-so I'm convinced it's someone's statement as to a drama on what it would be like to deal with the worst existential crisis imaginable. As I watch this movie, I've often moved back to several points in the time line to observe what's happening and reanalyze what is happening. I do not remember this occurring with any movie I've seen in the last 5 or more years.What happens in this movie is not so much sci-fi as much as it is self-analytical and worthy of comparison to the psychological comparison to the first version of Solaris by the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky. Where sci-fi leaves off, the mind picks up and I'm sure that this movie provides a much more complete picture of the unimaginable of the depths and heights of humanity than this movie has previously presented.I'm not saying this movie is perfect, but I'm saying it's very, very, very near perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Completely unexpected,"Sam Bell is a contract worker who, for three years, has been mining the moon for helium-3, the solution to Earth's energy crisis. He is nearing the end of his contracted time, and excited about getting home; for so long his only company has been that of video messages from his family, his photographs, and the on-board computer. Upon visiting one of the mining stations, Sam has an accident and finds himself waking at base, under the care of said computer, named Gerty.What then unfolds is something not very easily described without spoiling what makes the film so good, but it is fair to say that on more than one occasion, due to a lot of seemingly familiar tropes, you may believe you know where the film is going. You almost definitely don't. It is refreshing to see this sort of film take more than one turn along the way and become something you really are not expecting.Sam Rockwell has become one of many people's favourite actors now, a man who seems able to manifest physical transformation from one role to the next without the aid of effects. Put Rockwell from 'Frost/Nixon', 'Iron Man 2', and this film alongside each other, and you could almost believe they are different men! In 'Moon' he really does, perhaps more so than anywhere else, illustrate just how complex a performance he can give, and despite the other things about the film that I love, it is ultimately Rockwell on whom the film's success hinges. This is the performance at which, in time to come, people will likely look and wonder how it was that he didn't receive an Oscar nomination. Even Gerty was only voiced by Kevin Spacey after the man himself saw a rough cut, and was so impressed by the actor that he wanted to be part of the project. The great reception 'Moon' received was not only testament to the quality of Rockwell, of course, but also to that of first time film maker Duncan Jones (yes, ""Zowie Bowie""), who would go on to make 'Source Code', and is now pretty much finished with the daring project 'Warcraft'.'Moon' is a fascinating, independently produced sci-fi which, unlike most entries in the genre, features no hi-tech, big-budget effects, monsters, or fancy trickery; it is just a good idea, great film making, one of Clint Mansell's most impressive scores, and a superb performance as its beating heart.Catch 'Moon' and it may well become one of your favourite movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
wow,"This is one of the greatest films of the sci fi genre I've ever seen. Sam Rockwell deserves an Oscar nomination for his subtle beautiful and extremely challenging performance. Apparently the film had a budget of only about 5 million which is nothing for a sci fi, but when you see it, it is as good as any 50 million dollar picture. They used real models combined with digital effects which gave it a wonderful feel and it was so refreshing to see that. The script is fantastic and presents us with a film that stays with us long after it is over. Duncan Jones put his heart in the right place with this film and I'm sure we'll be seeing much more from him in the future. The problem is, he set the bar so high with this film I don't know how he will ever top it.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good SF drama, with romantic AI","As this is an existential and psychological SF drama, rather then CGI packed blockbuster, i'd expect a little more depth and logic in the whole story. The biggest problem for me is the AI of the assistant computer/robot. If it was built and programmed by the employers, it definitely wouldn't allow some of things to happen as they did. There are certain points where the whole mission could be in great jeopardy and that's when mission priorities would be definitely more important then the well being of the employee. Besides this bothering moment for me, the rest is quite OK. The camera and the atmosphere are of course inspired by Kubrick and well executed, the acting was very good and realism of the whole setting too. Nice way to spend an evening.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Alone on the Moon,"Moon is a movie from Duncan Jones from 2009. He is the son of the great director David Bowie. Duncan also acts his role as Sam Rockwell, a lonely guy on the moon station, spoken by Kevin Spacey. Moon is a science-fiction drama. Sam has to work alone on the moon. He works on a mine every day but than he has a crash and finds out a bad secret. I really like the animations because it really looks like the movie was filmed on the moon and there are nice light effects and other things. I think Duncan Jones is a good actor and did his roll very good. The plot is OK but sometimes a kind of boring and difficult to understand because some things happen again and again. Also one time something happen and later on you understand what happened. The costumes and the design are very nice. I like the music of ""Moon"", it assists the tension of some scenes really good. If you like science-fiction movies and don't't need much action, I recommend you to watch this. But ""Moon"" hasn't the strongest plot and you have to pay attention to understand everything.

"""I am the one and only... nobody I'd rather be.""","Hadn't heard that song in quite a while! Not sure I'd want to wake up to that every day. Every now and then, in that vast sea of super hero movies, remakes, and sequels, we have an intelligent film get made. And this on is science/fiction. A double bonus! Moon is the story of an isolated man nearing the end of a 3 year gig at a mining operation on (you guessed it) the moon. And he is really looking like he's been there that long and can't wait to get back to Earth. Sam Rockwell plays astronaut Sam Bell who seems so bored he cannot wait to do menial tasks like jump into a surface rover and retrieve a cannister of mineral from one of the enormous terrestrial harvesters outside. Communications malfunctions are keeping him from any real time contact with his wife and daughter back home. At least that's one of the things he's meant to believe....Anyone isolated from regular human contact for that long is bound to start experiencing odd phenomena after a while. And Sam is no different. He begins to see brief visions of women where no woman should be. One of these visions leads to an accident with a surface rover. Sam wakes up from it on a slab in the infirmary, and that's where things start getting weird. (SPOILERS TO FOLLOW) The first odd thing we notice is that Sam Appears to have no visible injuries, even though we saw him take a pretty nasty shot to the head during the accident. Next, the helpful computer/robot voiced by Kevin Spacey instructs Sam he is not to go outside until help arrived from Earth to clean up the accident. Considering who/what Sam is, you'd think he would simply obey this directive. For Sam is just a clone. A clone of some long dead astronaut from years past. Every three years his physical form wears out, and a new one is created from a storage space below the facility. Sam makes it outside and finds the crash site. And soon, there is more than one Sam haunting the facility! Further plot details I urge you to experience for yourself.Director Duncan Jones and his crew create an aesthetically appealing moon surface and machines and equipment that look impressive. The acting, pretty much all by Sam Rockwell, is terrific. Rockwell has always been a valued performer not afraid of challenging roles in fringe projects. He clearly has the stuff to be a A-lister, but he sticks to more challenging roles. Kevin Spacey does a good enough HAL impression with a kind-sounding voice hiding all kinds of secrets and probably an agenda all his own. But this time, the computer seems to be helping the astronauts instead of hindering their plight. The film also gets props for not stringing us along with cryptic clues that will lead to a shocking revelation at the conclusion. We learn Sam's circumstances as he learns them, and that helps us identify with him. Even though he is clearly nothing like us, after all. The film loses points for falling back on that age-old cliché of having a huge and faceless corporation act as the bad guy. Just like in Alien and so many others. Also, the properties of gravity in this environment are not properly spelled out even though they must be somewhat different that those on Earth. Gravity seems to be just the same within this mining facility, and it doubtfully would be. Still, a wonderful effort and fine finished product. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Trying my best not to spoil this,"Give credit to Moon: instead of hoarding its dramatic twist for the final reel, as a more hackish filmmaker would do with this premise, it lets you know what's going on fairly early on and lets the implications of that percolate. If this makes the back half of the movie somewhat perfunctory, it does show its commitment to big, classical sci-fi ideas, which the 2001 nods are only a part of.Moon is based off of a series of fantastical conceits, but it's grounded in the world we live in more than many contemporary movies: it's a world of work, exploitation, and crises of identity. The drudgery of life may happen in space now, but it's drudgery nonetheless (here I'm reminded of Alien, another sci-fi classic). It also suggests that we need certain familiar fictions to keep that exploitation going: the loving family waiting at home, the supportive work environment, whatever drops of leisure we can get...Slickly produced, with a great claustrophobic aesthetic, Moon is a great think-piece film, especially for everyone who's been waiting years for a good science fiction movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Duncan Jones has attempted to revive the genre with his directorial debut, Moon. Unfortunately, this attempted reinvigoration quickly devolves into nothing more than a regurgitation of nearly every sci-fi movie since 1968.I can only assume Duncan Jones' original outline to his producer read something like: ""Start with 2001, add a half cup Silent Running, a pint WallE, and a pinch of Alien. Whisk until The Sixth Day starts to take form then just keep pouring in Solaris until you hit the 90 minute mark.

From his role in 'Confessions of a Dangerous MInd', I've been following Sam like lost puppy, and he never seems to disappoint. He single handedly made Iron Man 2 a pretty good sequel, somehow made 'Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy' watchable, and stamps approval on just about everything he touches. Conviction, his latest, is very good.His performance here is nearing Oscar material.'Moon' defies the detractors with it's subtle but powerful storyline, and uses some fantastic editing, music, and acting to weave one of the better films of the year.

Better Than Its Progenitor,"Have you ever bought the store or generic version of a name brand product? Usually this process ends with you telling yourself, ""Oh, that's why I buy the name brand. The knock-off sucks!"" However, sometimes you stumble upon a generic version that's as good as or even better than the more-accepted brand. Good news! This picture is better!!At first, this movie seems strikingly analogous to the Sci-Fi Classic, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Both pictures share a lunar connection, although this one (Moon) takes place entirely on...well...the moon. The eerie, melancholic voice of an AI (Artificial Intelligence) seems to be the only break in what can almost be described as a maddening tranquility. Yet, GERTY is very different from HAL 9000; the sine qua non lies in its programming, and in its unique relationship(s) to Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell).Aside from lunar scenery and computer sentience, this cinematic wonder offers up some unique perspectives on death and dying, friendships and family, Jungian Archetypes (with the grand conclusion of the Individuation process - e.g., the making of the model town), and even Dissociative Identity Disorder (multiple personality disorder). And, all of that fits comfortably within the realm of cloning and psychosomatic auditory and visual hallucinations.I guess what I'm saying is that this movie rocks. It might be a bit too slow for the average moviegoer, but the serious watcher will surely enjoy it. And, yes, I'm serious... and don't call me Shirley.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It is by no means a game changer in the sci-fi genre but it accomplishes everything it intends to commendably.Sam Rockwell gives out an excellent performance as the lead Sam Bell, a lunar astronaut stationed on the far side of the moon to mine Helium. He is accompanied by an AI named GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey) who reminds the viewer of HAL in Space Odyssey. The story revolves around the emotions of a man yearning to return home after years of service and the crushing feeling that he just might not.The cinematography is excellent and the director manages to hide its low budget brilliantly.

In a small claustrophobic film such as this where he is the focal point of everything that goes on he is sublime.

"Tense, atmospheric film-making.","Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) works for a company called Lunar Industries, which is harvesting an energy source, called Helium-3, from the surface of the moon. He operates the mining station on his own, with only an intelligent robot named Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey) to keep him company and tend to his daily needs. Sam's contract is for three years and he's only two weeks away from returning home to his wife and young daughter. When Sam accidentally crashes one of the station's all-terrain vehicles, he wakes up in the station's infirmary. Gerty's evasive answers to his questions about the accident lead him to investigate further - and he makes a disturbing discovery. Directed by the son of David Bowie, Duncan Jones, this claustrophobic, slow-burning thriller builds in tension as secrets are revealed. At its core is a rather simple idea, and it's executed with finesse. The mining station's isolation becomes increasingly heavy and is the perfect backdrop for the intriguing drama that ensues. Sam Rockwell, as always, is brilliant to watch and Kevin Spacey's polite, genial Gerty is unsettling. Jones' minimalistic approach is crucial and perfectly delivered, allowing the gripping mystery to unravel. The sets feel intensely real and special effects are used seamlessly and sparingly. Moon has the palpable qualities of a film from the 70s and is filled the visceral nuances. Moon is ultimately a chilling film that maintains its vision until the final credits. It asks some important questions about our future and an impending desperation for natural resources. It's a very impressive feature debut from Jones. The DVD release has a comprehensive set of special features. There are three audio commentaries, a short film by Jones called Whistle, making-of and special effects featurettes, and footage of live Q&A sessions.

Why does the this annoying idiot have to talk so loud..oh yeh and of course he had to mention football and being laid because that's what ALL American men do ..don't you know!..I just fast forwarded the whole movie after 15 minutes of this excruciatingly annoying actor and grey plot.

The Man On The Moon,"Moon was a really pleasant surprise to me, as I watched the movie in the cinema without knowing anything at all about the movie but that is sci-fi and got something to do with the moon...The twist is not that surprising but the dense ""tone"" or atmosphere of the movie is carried and refined by the great performance of Sam Rockwell. The story itself is interesting enough and we get here and there some obeisances (story-wise) to some classic sci-fi movies like Silent Running etc.Good.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Absolutely Fantastic,"This movie is all-around great. Easily my favorite Sam Rockwell performance, with him pulling off every emotion needed in a very convincing way. He really seems like he's been alone on the moon for 3 years. When compared to something like Matt Damon in The Martian, the difference is staggering. Spacey as GERTY is also a nice bonus.The plot is very interesting and complex but not convoluted. Clint Mansell's score is one of my favorites in recent memory and fits the movie perfectly, and the special effects are well executed. Most importantly, the movie is so emotional with some deep and interesting themes.I highly recommend to anyone, especially if you're into thought-provoking sci-fi.10/10, and easily in my all-time top 25",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I don't have a fab title for my review,"This film is right in the bailiwick of anyone who loves SF 1968-1976. Like all the best SF, it's about emotions and people, not special effects. Like all the best SF movies, it's done with models, cheating, and cheeky tricks. Sam Rockwell can read the Yellow Pages for all all care (if that still existed), and Spacey's mellow tones make the robot muy simpatico.

Sci-fi with humour and heart.,"It's a year of the future in which mankind actually draws an energy source from the moon. Currently they have a person stationed alone on the lunar surface: astronaut Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell). His companion is a robotic intelligence named ""Gerty"", voiced by Kevin Spacey. He tries his best to keep his sanity, while his three year tour is just about over. One day, a vehicular accident leads Sam to make some stunning discoveries. He's not really so alone.""Moon"" marks an interesting, and emotionally involving, filmmaking effort for story author / director Duncan Jones (the son of music legend David Bowie), screenwriter Nathan Parker, and others. It tells a small scale story, and a rather intimate one, with Rockwell often the only human performer seen on screen. It's quiet, and thoughtful; it doesn't indulge in action set pieces or anything to do with aliens. It deals with issues of paranoia, human identity, loneliness, and an individuals' right to exist. Overall, it's quite satisfying, with top notch visuals functioning as icing on the cake. The music score by Clint Mansell is quite wonderful. Without spoiling too much, this viewer will say that he greatly appreciated the various twists in the plot.Rockwell remains a very watchable and valuable actor, and he is one of the greatest assets that this film can boast. If you're going to have your story basically focus on one person, you need an actor who can fully engage the audiences' sympathies, and Rockwell succeeds admirably.If you're a sci-fi fan, and want to see something that doesn't involve alien invasions or space battles or the like, this one comes highly recommended.Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Boring beyond belief.,"I have no idea what people watched, but no way was this a 10 out of 10. I couldn't help getting distracted doing other things cause I just couldn't constantly watch it. The movie is as grey and boring as the interior. Even though he is expressing emotions he looks bored too. Sitting watching cars go by is 10 times more interesting than this.

An incredible feat in the under-appreciated genre of sci fi!,"First time director, Duncan Jones, makes a movie that is reminiscent of many other sci fi gems but takes what worked in all of them and combined them to create one of 2009's best movies. Set on the Moon, in a future where we harvest our energy from the chemicals in the Moons soil, Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) lives in a station by himself. He makes sure that all goes well and fixes any problems that happen on the Moon. Shifts of 3 years, these over-watcher's have the duty to just to make sure all is well. Without delving too much more into the plot, the plot takes an interesting turn when something unexpected happens outside of the base. Duncan Jones creates a near masterpiece when it comes to storytelling but there is one thing that I have yet to mention. Sam Rockwell's performance is one for the books. His performance elevates this film from being lost in the sea of sci fi movies to one of pure genius. Lets just say that, Rockwell really shines in the second half of the film. Moon provides a movie experience like no other and should be looked back on 20 years from now as a standard of how sci fi movies should aspire to be.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Superb!...just like the excellent sci-fi from the 70's,"claustrophobic, intentionally slow paced scenes which I felt was right as it helps promote the feeling of isolation. Every time I thought there was a plot hole or something didn't make sense it would give the right explanation. I can see the influences from 70's movies such as Solaris, Saturn 3, Demon Seed, and the great Silent Running. The acting and choice of actors was perfect. The science behind the Moonbase is all plausible. I feel I could watch this movie again. I thought the technology used was appropriate to how it would be; no Buck Rogers 'Twikis' in this. I thought, maybe the wrong choice of words, but it was a 'very down to Earth' movie except it's on the moon. Don't watch if you want a migraine of a movie like Transformers 2.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Moon by Duncan Jones: lunar solitude and philosophical reflections,"""Moon"" by Duncan Jones, released in 2009, is a science fiction film that offers a unique and reflective vision of the future, far from the special effects and spectacular explosions typical of the genre. Set on a lunar base, the film follows the story of Sam Bell, masterfully played by Sam Rockwell, who is nearing the end of his three-year contract with Lunar Industries. Sam is the only inhabitant of the base, assisted only by an artificial intelligence named GERTY, voiced by Kevin Spacey. His solitude and forced isolation create an atmosphere of tension and introspection that permeates the entire film. Despite its intriguing premise, ""Moon"" suffers from some issues that limit its overall impact. The narrative, though interesting, becomes predictable at several points. Genre enthusiasts might find some plot twists familiar and unsurprising. The screenplay, written by Jones himself along with Nathan Parker, heavily relies on building a melancholic and eerie atmosphere, but at times it seems to drag, lacking the gripping pace that could have made the story more compelling. Duncan Jones' direction is certainly one of the film's strengths. With a limited budget, Jones manages to create a believable and detailed environment, using minimal sets and a futuristic design reminiscent of science fiction classics from the '70s and '80s. Gary Shaw's cinematography helps create a claustrophobic and alienating atmosphere, accentuated by the clever use of light and shadow. However, this stylistic choice might be detrimental for some viewers, who might find the film visually monotonous and lacking moments of real visual impact. Another critical element is the characterization of the protagonist. Sam Rockwell delivers an extraordinary performance, managing to convey the despair, loneliness, and growing madness of his character. However, the film relies almost entirely on his acting abilities, without providing adequate development of the themes and moral questions raised by the plot. The character of GERTY, though interesting, remains in the background and is not sufficiently explored, leaving untapped narrative potential. The soundtrack, composed by Clint Mansell, is one of the film's highlights. Its evocative and minimal melodies perfectly accompany the images, enhancing the protagonist's sense of loneliness and alienation. However, one could also criticize a certain repetitiveness in the musical choices, which risks further weighing down the already bleak atmosphere of the film. ""Moon"" is a film that invites reflection and contemplation, exploring themes such as identity, solitude, and the ethics of cloning. However, its slow narrative and predictability of some plot developments can be frustrating for the viewer. Despite these flaws, the film is worth watching for its ability to evoke deep emotions and for Sam Rockwell's extraordinary performance. ""Moon"" represents an interesting addition to the science fiction genre, offering a visual and emotional experience that, while not perfect, leaves a lasting impression.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Dissappointing,"I am stunned at the high ratings this movie received. Bot not surprised it was compared to 2001 a space odyssey because that movie, for me was also a major disappointment. Spectacularly made but a major bore. Moon is exactly the same. This moviie did not absorb my attention in any way. It was extremely slow, obviously low budget with lego like models. One gets the vauge impression that the film maker is attempting to make some great metaphysical statement here, Maybe it did but that did not alter the fact that this was a really poor movie. I was able to watch it for about 30 minutes then I bailed. Don't bother.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Wonderful and so underrated,"What a great movie, what a great work of art from Sam Rockwell and first timer Duncan Jones as well! It's a must-see at least once a year for me.

Moon Is An Impressive Sci-Fi Drama,"Moon is an impressive sci-fi drama with thriller elements from writer/director Duncan Jones whose admirable in making this movie that has a compelling story and equally impressive special effects which help bring the film to life. Sam Rockwell is very effective as the lead. He's the only major character and Rockwell carries the movie well. Sam continues to show his talent as an actor with this one. Kevin Spacey provides his voice for Sam's loyal robot Gert. The rest of the cast including the actress who played Sam's wife are okay in their cameo roles. Moon impressed me with how good this movie was and how the special effects really helped make you feel the isolation of being alone on the moon. With a running time of 97 minutes the film moves at a steady pace so it doesn't drag on forever. The character Sam plays in the movie is well developed because you care about him and his struggle. There are a few twists one of them is revealed a little early but it worked none the less. Overall this film was better then I thought it would be and it's sure to please any die hard science fiction fan. Moon has character development, drama, a little humor, and an exceptional performance by Sam Rockwell who makes it worth the time to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Thought provoking sci-fi,"When you need a sci-fi flick that addresses ethics and leaves you discussing the morality of the protagonist's plight, MOON is it. It really a one man story. The other actors appear only on video or are robotic voices.Rockwell rules this simply story of a lonely helium-3 mining contractor on the moon completing his three year contract. It takes a turn though when he meets his replacement.As there is not much action - except when the character leaves the habitat or explores within his habitat - some people will get bored quickly. But for those who look for great sci-fi writing and dialogue, you can't go wrong with this movie. Two enthusiastic thumbs up!",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
In-validity in cloning,"Cloning is a rising phenomenon in modern society. From a microscopic level using bacteria to macroscopic ranges where entire mammals are fully cloned. Often the biological implications of these experiments are closely monitored, but not the actual psychological effects.With the hopes of returning to your family after a three-year hardship of not only laborious work, but also isolation, two weeks until returning home is a journey that seems like a lifetime. Although what if that return never happened? If it was all a complete lie? It is haunting to implant memories and experiences into a person's mind and then restrict them from all tangible parts of that life.It is slavery. An act that no one deserves to endure.Moon delves into the concept of autonomy and essential rights, and offers a unique perspective on an otherwise untouched subject. Cloning happens everyday and it's only time until it reaches one of us. Once that day comes, there is no difference between the clone and ""original""; we are one.Whether cognizant or not, onus for equality and morality lies on those that do.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I just couldn't like it am sorry, even If the characters had been played by A Listers it was just so monotonous and boring.

"A good film, brilliantly acted.","I've giving it a solid 8/10, as personally I enjoyed it far more than I had anticipated. I'd be given this as a gift a couple of years ago and only just got around to watching it. What a great movie, the story is simple but well woven, the limited use of effects, possibly due to the smaller budget is welcome as it allows more time for Sam Rockwell to do his thing. He is the movie in so many ways, makes it enjoyable, sad, exciting and infuriating all at the same time. Great acting.One thing that stood out for me was the use of engineering, Sam actually WORKS on the station, he's not just sitting about on his backside all day. You get a sense of his routine, his intimate knowledge of the station he's been at for years, whilst being pulled along on his own personal story of discovery.Great film, I would highly recommend watching it.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sam Rockwell Soars Over the MOON,"Sam Bell (Sam Roackwell) works on the moon for a company called Lunar Industries. In the distant future, the Earth's natural resources are all used up. Lunar Industries has decided to farm the dark side of the moon for He3 which is then sent back to Earth to use to run the planet. Sam Bell's job is to make sure all the equipment is running well. At the beginning of the movie we join Sam, who has 2 weeks left on a 3 year stint. The only source of camaraderie that Sam has, is his robot GERTY (voiced perfectly by Kevin Spacey), who seems to be a distant relative of HAL from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. The only way Sam can communicate with his family, wife Tess (Dominique McElligott) is through video postcards.during one of Sam's ride in his moon rover, he gets in to an accident. After blacking out we are taken to a few days later when Sam wakes up in sick bay. Sam doesn't remember what happened or why he is in sick bay. GERTY tells Sam that his bosses have said for him to rest and they are sending a rescue ship to fix rover and collection vehicle that Sam crashed into. After a few days, Sam is able to talk GERTY into letting him outside, and he visits the crash site. Upon looking in the rover, he finds a body there. Sam brings the body back to home base, and the person he finds is, Sam Bell. The viewer doesn't know if one of the other is a clone, or a figment of Sam's imagination, or a dream.Duncan Jones (who also directed and is the son of rock legend David Bowie) and Nathan Parker co-wrote an amazing piece of cinema that makes the viewer think. You're not sure if everything you've seen is real, and that's the way it should be. You can see that Jones and Parker have been influenced heavily by 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, from GERTY, to having classical music playing when Sam goes out to walk or drive around on the moon, to the lonely worker.Sam Rockwell does an amazing job of acting only against Kevin Spacey's voice and himself. This is essentially an actors movie. If you are looking to see how to be a great actor, Rockwell's performance is one to be seen. It's a real shame that this movie was released in the summer, during the time of the blockbuster, because this is certainly a movie that should be seen by everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Interesting and excellent,"I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Very well shot with an eerie atmosphere assisted by one of Clint Mansell's more simple, yet effective soundtracks that brings this unique film to life. The acting started off a bit rough, but greatly improved along the way. Kevin Spacey's voice is a perfect homage to the classic HAL of 2001: A Space Odyssey fame. The movie is relatively low budget for a sci-fi flick, but it certainly doesn't show. The effects and sets are believable (for the most part), and, for once, not really important.What really is important is the human story told here, one that is never predictable or flat. There are countless ""twists"" that keep the momentum moving without seeming forced or artificial like a cheap thriller. The moral dilemmas brought up by this film are interesting, but surprisingly not dwelled upon very much. I feel like these could be addressed a little bit more as opposed to just being given in passing, but it's not much of a detractor.I highly recommend this to sci-fi fans who don't just want explosions and lasers. If you like Blade Runner, chances are you'll like this one too.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Superb,"Sam Rockwell does an outstanding job in this character-driven movie that gets in hooks in you from scene one, word one, and never lets go. With the unsettling, subtle suspense of a Hitchcock flick, Moon opens as effortlessly as Alien: an every-day guy in space doing his job. Rockwell has an amazing talent to visually communicate his emotional isolation, boredom and deprivation of human contact while also conveying a full-fledged, completely fleshed out, easy-going character that any of us would be happy to know. What comes next is as bizarre as it is believable. The dialog, pacing, premise and acting are all top notch. Don't miss this gem. Moon is destined to be a true sci-fi classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Science Fiction Gem,"It's great when a filmmaker comes along that realizes science fiction doesn't necessarily need to revolve around alien invasions, giant CG spectacles, or flashy lightsaber battles (sorry). The best science fiction poses questions about the future of mankind and the decisions we as a species may be confronted with. It gives us cause to examine our path and where it might lead us. First-time feature director Duncan Jones (son of the legendary David Bowie) has done just that with MOON. The story begins in a not-too-distant future where mankind has begun harvesting helium-3 from the surface of the moon as a potent, clean energy source. Seeing as how most of the operation is automated, the lunar base has a single man on staff: Sam Bell. With the satellite uplink to Earth non-operational, Sam's only form of personal contact is with the station A.I., GERTY. As Sam is approaching the end of his three-year contract and his chance to return home, there is an accident and Sam is injured when colliding with a harvester. He awakens in the midst of some strange goings-on that I'm going to do my best not to spoil here.I really love this movie. It's so rare that a film can inspire as much thought as MOON anymore. The film presents questions of individuality and human rights in regards to how they apply to cloning. It's an intriguing topic that can make for some excellent post-movie discussion. Duncan Jones has brought us an excellent science fiction film in rare form. The trailers for this film might mislead some who go into this movie expecting a thriller. The ads for the film give it a SIXTH SENSE feel with hints of the supernatural, but there is nothing of the sort. The big reveal comes less than halfway through the movie, so it doesn't keep you guessing throughout to find some big answer. It presents you with the situation early on so that the audience is given ample time to understand what exactly it is Sam Bell is going through. I admit GERTY gives off a bit of a HAL-9000 vibe, but this is not just another in a long line of films about technology gone wrong. It's an insightful glimpse into a future where humans will need to carefully consider their options in biogenetics. In other words, this movie is not going to be for everyone.After finally talking some of my friends in watching the movie, one of the biggest complaints I got throughout was how incredibly slow the movie moved. I can't argue with that. This is a very slow, deliberately paced movie. At only an hour and a half, it feels much longer. That's fine. I can deal with that. It's a great story so I don't mind if it takes it's time establishing itself. I'm sure the movie never would've worked as well if they hadn't casted it so well. MOON is the film that officially established Sam Rockwell as one of my favorite modern actors. Keep in mind, Rockwell is the only actor on screen throughout the course of the movie. He has no one to play off except himself and GERTY (voiced in a haunting monotone by Kevin Spacey). I love these sorts of films and I think it says a lot about an actor when they are the sole character for a feature length film and pull it off. Sam Rockwell's fantastic performance, slick production design, and an engaging, thought-provoking story: MOON is an excellent piece of independent work and it has established Duncan Jones as a director to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

So very difficult to fault,"Every now and then a film comes along where everything that it does, it does superbly and Moon is one of those films. The story is interesting and never loses its footing. The acting/ actor is brilliant, Sam Rockwell continues to amaze and the direction is spot-on. While I do not give the film a 10, anyone should check this out sometime, it is not essential but it is worth watching.The story is difficult to describe without spoiling anything but if you have seen the trailer, then you will know what the film is about. Yet despite a simple premise, the film feels very emotional; you think about how you would cope under the conditions that the character is in and therefore you sympathise with him.Assisting in making this a fantastic film is the soundtrack. Composed by Clint Mansell who quickly becoming 'that guy who makes epic music' does a great job in making a peaceful soundtrack that reflects the films story. Other impressive features include the cinematography and the special effects. All scenes that take place outside on the surface of the moon have a unique style that while it does not look photo-realistic, is impressive and the crew should be recognised in being able to make a sci-fi film on a limited budget.Duncan Jones rightfully won his BAFTA but it is still a shame that the film did not receive more recognition. While the film could have been longer, what it has is more than enough in order to make this a film well worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

When in reality the viewer is being placed in the middle of a dark and secret situation that is more to the viewing eye. Sam Rockwell has always been a top favorite actor of mine, but after watching Moon, my respect for him is at a high. Sam Rockwell gives us a variety of emotions as well as personalities in this unique story, since he is literally talking to himself throughout the movie when each personality is an absolute different point of view and approach to the storyline. Overall, this movie is a great film to watch if you are ready to sit down and watch something that will keep you glued to the screen.

An unoriginal and tedious sci-fi story that thinks it's really clever,"This movie thinks it's really clever and interesting. Here's the problem: it's not. It's based off a somewhat intriguing concept that's been done better a million times before. The reveal of this concept is something you will probably see coming within 15 minutes, and even if you don't see it coming, you won't feel anything other than ""oh, okay, so that's what this movie is about"" when it happens.The dialog throughout is absolute rubbish. Every line feels like it's written to be eccentric and clever, but it just comes off as confusing and tedious. The behavior of the robot is nonsensical and has no consistency to it, which results in you losing all suspension of disbelief since the robot is basically just a plot device for the writers to do whatever they want with. Worst of all, the entire plot of the movie doesn't make a shred of sense and shoves a generic societal view down your throat that is never elaborated on beyond ""_____ are bad""Everything about this movie is trying so hard to be clever, and it all just fails. Even the soundtrack can't simply be your typical effective eerie space music – it's random, unfitting classical bits thrown at you as if to say ""look! We're doing just what 2001 did! You all like that movie, so like this one too!""Only reason I give it a 2/10 instead of a 1 is because the lead actor gives a great performance, especially given the terrible dialog and (lack of) character development the script gives him. It's really the only thing that prevented me from turning this movie off halfway through.This movie is complete rubbish and sadly has been given great reviews by all the pretentious ""yay a sci-fi movie with no explosions or aliens"" people.

It's like The Bourne Identity set in space,"In an age of elaborate lanky blue folk who talk the talk, fly the fly and speak Na'vi or else giant prawns with their impressive 'Independence Day' ship looming in the background and an appetite for cat food, its sometimes understandably hard to forget there's such a thing as a ostentatious visuals that isn't fiction or OTT enough to mascara a rather plain plot.Moon (that giant grey blob in the sky) isn't at all deprived from beauty, especially in 1080p, however that doesn't make it like other sci-fi's these days. Its small budget, has few characters, has plenty of Sam Rockwell, and to top it all is a very thought provoking debut from a director who happens to be David Bowie's son: Duncan. Pretty different right? But it's the foremost point where Moon is almost entirely contrary that makes it a fundamental but essential independent movie.Sam (played by Sam) is just finishing his three contract of supplying energy from the moon to earth, to be reunited with his wife and child. He gets some nasty Shutter Island form of hallucinations before he severely crashes his moon truck-thingy and soon after, quiet literally meets his match. I won't give away anything more than the trailer because well no-one likes a spoil sport and for such a rare heart wrenching solely driven performance by Sam, I find it hard not to justify credit even if you have or haven't seen it with your own eyes.Kevin Spacey also stars, however he will be in a box shape form with a yellow face. Shouldn't be hard to spot; especially if you have seen a certain Stanley Kubrick film recently. But as previously mentioned a great story, unreliant on its look that has given Rockwell the chance to prosper with a lead role, easily puts the likes of Hollywood's multi-million extravaganza's to shame.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Sci Fi Drama, Rockwell was brilliant","This is a Sci-Fi Drama...yes they exist. Many of the good Sci-Fi movies have a element of drama, to make you identify with the character. This movie engulfs you in the life of a single person living/working on the moon. The only real company he has is the main computer called GERTY. The movie has resonances of Space Oddessey 2001 combined with a twilight zone episode. Every time I hear a computer voice say ""I'm sorry"" I feel the chill through my spine from ""I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that"" that HAL utters in 2001, to this day one of the all time bad guys. I have liked watching Sam Rockwell in his many roles, and I give him props for this movie. Rockwell basically is doing a one man show and must transform emotionally and physically during the movie. He deserves an Oscar for this performance. Sadly most people now days do not have the patience or appreciation for one man dramas. The movie is a reasonable 90 something minutes but because of the small cast feels longer. I will say the story could have moved a little bit quicker. I thought the set production and cinematography were outstanding making you think he was in a large space station and traveling on the moon surface. Worth Renting just make sure you are not expecting lots of explosions or lasers.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Amazing,"Amazing movie that presents a take on psychology and capitalism and how it affects individuals. It has a great plot (slow pacing) that reveals everything when it has to. Sam is an incredibly talented actor portraying many facets to his character and gives a sense of wonder to the environment as you learn things with him and not as an omnipresent entity. GERTY is a perfect comedic relief and great support character, as it seems to be as real as you can expect it to be. The concept art and sets are amazing and, although you can tell it was a limited budget the practical effects look great and fit the atmosphere accordingly. There seems to be a truth behind the motivation for everyone and the scy-fi situation in which it is represented.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Bridges classic and modern ways of filmmaking.,"I've been trying to see this little film for awhile now. Now that I've actually seen it I can say that it did not disappoint. The one problem going into it though, I already knew the ""surprise"" that was in it. Although I can say that I was surprised it came at the end of act 1.Moon has many themes playing around. Long distance relationship, big business corporations taking advantage of the little guy, discovery about one's self, etc. Moon was able to jam pack so many things in a little run time and it never felt like it dragged on. In fact I was surprised that it was near the end of the film, it feels incredibly short because of how involved I was with such a minimalist story.Rockwell does a tremendous job in dual roles. He plays the one part in a cocky, self assurance way, while the second feels more characterized and on edge. Two varied performances from one person in one film. He carries the entire film on his back and he did a great job. It's hard not to compare GERTY to Hal, they share so many similar things, yet they effectively made it different enough to be slightly original. The machine is voiced by Kevin Spacey, it a warm, yet still cold and machine like calmness.The use of both miniatures and CGI was a wise choice. You can notice that they are miniatures, but it works for this type of film because that it what they drew their inspiration from. Films in the sci/fi genre that used miniatures, and it works well here. The film bridges both old school and modern ways of filmmaking.Duncan Jones is a filmmaker to look out for, I expect great things in his career and look forward to his third film.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Truly Astonishing in ALL Aspects,"I was intrigued to watch this film for a while, predominantly due to the fact that one of my favourite (and undoubtedly underrated) actors, Sam Rockwell, stars in it. Furthermore, the film is directed by Duncan Jones; who has previously impressed me with 'Source Code' and has since left me wanting to explore more of his work. Essentially, I went into this film with high expectations, and oh boy, were they exceeded.'Moon' takes place on the moon, surprisingly, and explores the isolated character of Sam Bell (played by Sam Rockwell) nearing the end of his three-year stint on the moon, whilst working alongside his friendly computer GERTY (voiced by Kevin Spacey). I'm not going to give away any more details of the plot, as with all films, it's best to go in blind or with as little information as possible in order to simply 'experience' the story unfold. This film most definitely deserves that approach, it captures isolation and human emotion on a genuinely profound level, and Rockwell's riveting performance is undoubtedly an Oscar-worthy one. Even Spacey's voice acting as GERTY is strangely satisfying to me; evoking this calming yet intriguing tone throughout the film which additionally helped to stabilise the drama, combined with Sam Rockwell's truly magnificent acting preventing this film from falling into a feeble melodrama.Everything works perfectly here: the cleverly written script, the visually pleasing set design and even the slightly slow pacing which I didn't see as a flaw whatsoever. The pacing was perfect in this film; it made it feel all the more real and thus enticing, along with a captivating soundtrack to create an utterly fascinating atmosphere throughout. This film is without a doubt, truly astonishing in all aspects, and certainly exceeded my already high expectations. Duncan Jones' direction and Sam Rockwell's amazing performance (he absolutely deserves all of the praise) combined with a compelling plot result in a masterpiece of a film that doesn't shy away from exploring human emotion and struggles on a deeper level, whilst delving into two of the trickiest genres to pull off. I highly recommend this film to anyone who appreciates good cinema, not just the fans of Sci-Fi.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
High quality,"A number of familiar science-fiction tropes - space out-station, lone astronaut, smooth-voiced robot, suspect employer with an apparently green agenda - might lull you into thinking you know where this movie is heading, but the story and the excellent screenplay wriggle around enough to shake you up. What confirms MOON as high-quality entertainment is that it holds up very well even when you know the plot, as I discovered watching it again on DVD last night.Budgetary considerations probably determined the choice of miniatures for most of the exterior scenes. They seem to me to be the only weak spot of the film. Although they are well executed, their artificiality is in stark contrast to the believable interiors. There's compensation, though, in the form of other photographic effects which are extremely impressive.The heart of the film is an astonishing, virtuoso turn by Sam Rockwell, who deserved every award going but who had to be content with admiring reviews. If you're unacquainted with the work of this superb actor, then MOON is a great place to start. If you're a fan, you'll have seen it already, but never mind - see it again!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One Way Ticket to the Moon,"Director Duncan Jones's first feature length makes you keep guessing. It is a film that requires a lot from the keen viewer and at ninety three minutes, it isn't asking for much.Existential delusions the loneliness of space and time and darkness make this film one of the best science-fictions out there; a shoe-string film that surprised everyone.Thirty minutes into the film and I had lost sense of time. The film is woven with care, the models crafted with much trouble. Having said that, the quantity of character(s) in the film – at times – holds you back. From what I read it was a financial thing. However, Jones and Rockwell pull it off pretty nicely.There is also a robot (Kubrick's HAL 9000 has become an integral part of our subconscious) named GERTY voiced by Kevin Spacey. I also happened to finish 'Se7en (1995)' a couple of hours back and the guy is invisible yet, the guy is all over the place.Of genre-trapping, there had to be some, only if to come to terms with a plot this thoughtful. The script written by Jones and Nathan Parker becomes retro yet very real when the finished goods are for taking.The moon-landscape is lifeless and dreary even though the 'moon-surface' images are full color and taken from the Japanese lunar orbiter, SELENE, they still appear to be monochrome, lifeless & in stark contrast to culture and romance; things that make us human.Sam Rockwell does a pretty decent job for a character this complex. He plays the decaying astronaut with skill and rhythm. The ending, I feel, is being overrated by people calling it 'a major confrontation' and 'grand'.The film and everything about it is an idea, an unbalanced idea, a film that does not have an end or even a beginning for that matter. It leaves you questioning your beliefs and conditioning; the memories, who do they really belong to? Does it make a difference to the immortal clockwork when we are being sent back to Earth?Heavy fuel, I know; I loved watching Rockwell's undaunted performance, which added to the film's success. He is a fine one.The film also gives homage to films like THX 1138 (1971), Solaris (1972), Alien (1979) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) among other genre- bending ventures into space. An eccentric, poignant and a thoughtful watch that asks how long will you live for?'250,000 miles from home, the hardest thing to face...is yourself''; tag-line for 'Moon'",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Might be one of the best exording-direction movies,"I just cannot not give this a 10/10 rating.This Science Fiction goes in the ""slow/Philosophical"" category, and is really one of the best in that category as well.Story is well made, has just a few, minor leaks, but the whole atmosphere touches you in a way I wasn't expecting. This atmosphere is to be thanked to Sam Rockwell, the well- designed base, kevin spacey and the great direction, not forgetting the music. I don't even remember the composer's name, but despite some strange tunes, it's definitely the best movie for this atmosphere; when you get to know that this movie has been written by Duncan Jones only because he wanted to collaborate with sam rockwell at all costs, you see how great-talented this director seems until now.Slowness could be an issue to many, but I strongly think that this movie gives it all anyways. Also the last minutes drive together a bunch of coincidences that make feel excited even if you know exactly what happens next, and that's something to keep in mind.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
