Funny and moving film with one of Johnny Depp's best performances,"A man created by an inventor is taken from the solitude of his home to live with a suburban family.The plot uses elements of Frankenstein and Beauty and the Beast to great effect in a story that very much about the human condition. Tim Burton may not have intended to satirise suburban types as much as he did, but ridiculed they feel with the gossipy, trouble making housewives and bored gardening, golf playing husbands. Cars all leave for work at the same time, great pride is taken in gardens and most (save a few) ultimately see Edward as either a 'freak' or a 'cripple'. We see the real freak show does not lie in the decaying old Gothic mansion on the hill, but in the normal residential neighbourhood below.Edward Scissorhands has a style that shows Burton at his quirky, gothic best. The colour of everything in the suburbia is some variant of pastel, and is contrasts brilliantly with Edward's black suit and ghostly white face. This fits perfectly with the themes of acceptance, isolation and fitting into social structures when you are quite different.The protagonist family are all sympathetic, played likably by Dianne Wiest, Alan Arkin, Robert Oliveri and in particular Winona Ryder. Edward's interaction with them is both hilariously funny and beautifully moving in a number of scenes.There are also some strong supporting characters. Joyce, the lustful neighbour who talks in perpetual innuendo. Her scene of orgasmic joy on receipt of a new haircut is wonderfully funny. Jim the spoilt jock boyfriend sneers and lashes out every line with utter contempt. Vincent Price in a heart breaking cameo as the inventor is an excellent touch.As the title character, Johnny Depp's performance is modern take on Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. He says very little, but his eyes and facial expressions tell us everything we need to know. When he does speak it is the voice of a frightened and confused child. I feel so much sympathy that it pains me to watch.It has a haunting soundtrack that stays with you after the final credits. Every time I think of falling snow, particularly when melancholy I think of that music.What prompted me to give this one a higher rating than I had originally planned was watching it with my three and a half year old daughter. It held her from start to finish, which is a rare thing for a non-animated feature length movie.For me it's an 8.5/10, but I round upwards.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A dark fairy tale about a man who only wanted to fit in,"I have watched Edward Scissorhands ever since I was a little girl, this movie has always held a very special place in my heart. I think because I could relate to Edward no, I don't have scissors for hands, but what I mean is that this is a fairytale story, but this is a simple story of a man who just wants to fit into a society of ""norms"". This is completely Tim Burton's creation and story, he's a very criticized director, he's either loved or hated. Some consider his stories to be too dark and strange, but when you get inside his head, you realize this is a man who is pure genius. He thinks completely outside the box and doesn't just resort to what Hollywood wants, he knows his audience and doesn't insult their intelligence, he brings us a charming story about Edward Scissorhands.An elderly woman tells a story to her granddaughter of a man with scissors for hands named Edward, the creation of an inventor. He raised Edward as his son and tutored him in various subjects, but died while in the act of offering a pair of hands to Edward. Many years later, local Avon saleswoman Peg Boggs, after failing to make profits in her suburban neighborhood, visits a Gothic mansion on a hill. There, she finds Edward, and convinces him to have her take him in. Edward befriends Peg's young son, Kevin and her teenage daughter Kim. Peg's neighbors become curious and thrilled at Edward's masterful skills at hedge clipping and haircutting. However Kim's jock boyfriend Jim dislikes Edward immediately. Edward's innocence becomes an easy target for everyone to take advantage of him as often as they can. Wither it's destroying his reputation or putting him in danger, Edward was never prepared for this harsh world when he was given the kindest heart.From the acting, Johnny Depp's first real leading role in a movie, he's so young and so incredibly talented. He plays Edward with perfect sympathy not over or under acting it, to be honest I'm a little surprised he wasn't nominated for an Oscar, but it's such a bizarre role, I think it was very over looked. He makes Edward into a charming beautiful character that you fall in love with. Dianne Wiest, one of my favorite actress as the Avon lady, Peg, who takes Edward home with her, the reason I love her so much is she brings so much class into whatever role she is playing. She seems like the most lovely woman you could meet and makes Peg into a delightful woman who just wanted to help this man and didn't realize the world she brought him into. Winona Ryder, who was dating Depp at the time, had great chemistry and was absolutely beautiful. To the sets, which this world was just bizarre and stands out against so many other movies, like a strange Leave it to Beaver nightmare, all the houses in the suburbia are different pastel colors to this one hill with a dark castle. To the outstanding make up effects, can only imagine the pain it took to get in and out of that costume for Edward. Edward Scissorhands is truly a masterpiece and in my opinion will always remain a treasured classic, because all in all this is one of the most beautiful movies of all time.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"If Tim Burton never did anything else, this film would be enough to call his life worthwhile","There is absolutely no way I can view this film in even a remotely objective manner, so I won't even try.  Like eveything I've seen by Tim Burton, this film is at one and the same time, warm and frightening, tender and heart-wrenchingly evil, uplifting and dark.  The good and bad in humanity are shown in stark relief quite clearly for everyone to see.  But in the final analysis, the most important message the film has to offer is this: Love truly does make the world go 'round and redemption and just living to see another day is a kind of victory.  There will always be bullies, just as there will always be kind souls who actively try to make things better (and who sometimes make things worse through their efforts).  The most important thing is to be true to yourself, treat others as you wish to be treated and that if the bad guys win, we all lose-including the bad guys.  Excellent cast, fine script and just overall a worthy effort not to be missed.  One of Vincent Price's last performances, if not the last.  I love this film!  Most highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Burton's Best -- and Most Emotionally Touching.,"Tim Burton is a brilliant visual director but with Edward Scissorhands he managed to combine these talents with pure, classic storytelling  Scissorhands is his best overall film, abandoning the slight characterizations and special effects-driven spectacle of the (albeit hugely enjoyable) Batman and serving up a convincingly detailed left-of-center fairytale romance.The story is fairly basic, being the standard Frankenstein-esque tale of alienation and the empowerment of love. Edward (Johnny Depp) is a lonely man with scissors for hands, crafted by an eccentric inventor (magnificently played by Vincent Price in flashbacks) prior to his death. After Edward witnesses the death of his creator he stays locked away inside his mansion all day, which is located atop the otherwise cheerfully picture-perfect local neighborhood community.Then one day a nosy neighbor decides to investigate, and ends up bringing Edward to reality. He falls in love with a local girl (Winona Ryder), and is witness first-hand to the joys of life, until accidentally injuring a young boy and becoming the enemy of the overzealous town. Soon everyone is out to get him for no good reason  the climax is beautifully done and, because Burton has allowed his characters to expand so much, it's also very touching.The movie is decidedly odd but in a good way  the only problem is that it is occasionally quite thin when it comes to actual depth. Burton's never been as good at telling believable stories as he has mythical, exciting fables (see Sleepy Hollow for a similar example). Even Burton's Big Fish  arguably his most story-oriented film of his career  was somewhat shady. The mix of screwball dark comedy, horror, drama, romance and elements and familiar happenings of other genres results in a very different combination. You can literally ""feel"" the vibe of this picture, its heart pulsing black blood.The movie was a childhood project of Burton, who drew sketches of Edward as a boy and used to alienate himself from his hostile surroundings by taking refuge in fictional stories involving the scissor-handed hero. As a result Burton's true affinity for the subject is evident  it's clear that he takes this entire project very seriously.The acting is marvelous  Depp's performance is one of his finest and, arguably, one of the most convincing and fun of all-time. Depp has formed a Scorsese/De Niro-like companionship with Burton over the years, teaming up for various pictures (including Sleepy Hollow and the upcoming Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). He's always had fun relishing his over-the-top and absurdly dark roles, such as Ichabod Crane in particular. In Scissorhands he gives the equivalent of a Travis Bickle  a man who feels shunned by society, only to open his heart and have it feel crushed again. This is possibly one of the reasons the film is able to affect its audience so well to this very day. The tale does not grow old because the values are timeless.Edward Scissorhands, despite its occasional flaws, finally gave Burton the chance to unleash his talents as a visual filmmaker along with a pretty solid story mold  the result being a sublimely dark rom-com-drama that never conforms to the typical genre clichés and becomes quite a unique film in its own little world.4.5/5",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
An uncommonly gentle man.,"BIG SPOILERS.""Give it to my loved ones?"" - Edward Scissorhands.Created by an inventor who dies before finishing his creation, and so leaving him with razor-sharp shears as hands - Edward Scissorhands (JOHNNY DEPP) isn't like other people.When kindly Avon lady Peg Boggs (DIANE WIEST) finds him one day, hidden away in a Gothic mansion on top of a hill, she takes him under her wing and decides to take him back to the suburbs to live with her.When we see Edward in this pastel paradise for the first time, it is apparent that he doesn't belong: his wild, dark and frightening appearance contrasting against the immaculate, sweetly colored people and homes of the suburbs. It's an ironic contrast too, as both of these 'worlds' reflect feelings and thoughts that should not associated with them - as Edward is a good-hearted person, whereas the people of the suburbs are unkind and intolerant.When Edward arrives there he is welcomed and loved, due to the way in which he can sculpt hedges, dogs and hair into amazing works of art. But eventually, due to human trickery and greed, and Edward's want of acceptance and love, Edward is painted by the townspeople as a monster when he is told to rob a house by the boyfriend of Peg's daughter, Kim (WINONA RYDER), and he is ostracized by the town.Throughout the course of the movie, Edward falls in love with Kim. Originally treating him as an outcast, she falls in love with him too, realizing what a kind and remarkable being he is. In the end, she is the only one who accepts him, when the entire town turns against him. Kim's boyfriend, Jim, enraged by jealousy of Edward, tries to kill him. In defense of Kim and himself, Edward plunges his scissor-hands into Jim's chest and kills him. Realising both that by what he has done they can never see each other again for his safety they share a final kiss and part ways, Edward remaining in his mansion and Kim returning to the shocked town below. The ending of this movie is one of the most wonderful I've seen. Poignant and bittersweet, it is hard to forget quickly.Johnny Depp is outstanding as Edward Scissorhands, showing a kind of curious and bemused innocence within in the character, but at the same time a restrained passion. Every expression on his face is full of raw emotion: every cautious smile, and every time of hurt and confusion. Johhny Depp is Edward Scissorhands.This is a wonderful fable from the brilliant imagination of Tim Burton. It's a twisted and sophisticated Gothic fairytale with a dose of comedy, and a good helping of morality, too. While a family movie, it's not really for kids - some things in there even shocked me.This movie is amazing, and I was entranced by it the very first time I watched it. I'm not usually one for ridiculous hyperbole about movies, but there is very little wrong with this one. I love this movie.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Hauntingly Poetic,"I really cannot add too much more to the wealth of praise directed toward this film...much of it very deserved.  Tim Burton really shows us his ability to transcend mere comedic situations(Pee Wee and Beetlejuice) and tell a story of humour love, pity, conformity, and so on in an eerie and entertaining way.  The way this film is constructed is amazing...the sets are wonderful as they depict something so real and yet so far away.  Burton takes us into a kind of fairy land of Suburbia...with a haunting, empty castle at the end of the block that just happens to house a man with scissors for hands.  The music in this film helps create a great deal of atmosphere and really lends to character development;  I particularly enjoyed his use of the music of Tom Jones.  The acting in the film is superb on all accounts.  Burton got a subtle and effective performance from Johhny Depp, whose talents cease to amaze me.  A nice Burton touch was the use of Vincent Price in one of his final roles.  Although only in three scenes, seeing Vincent again was a real joy.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Equal Parts Fairy Tale and Satire,"One of my favorite aspects of a Tim Burton film is his penchant for oddness, and Edward Scissorhands does it well. I frequently laugh at the look on a character's face, the comedic positioning of a shot, or the ""art"" wrought by the eponymous character's hands, erm, scissors. What sets this movie apart from other Burton creations, however, is that it is just as much satire as it is fairy tale. Whether it's the gossipy neighbors, the desperate housewife, the controlling boyfriend, the tactless father, or the cookie-cutter homes, suburban clichés abound. These absurd caricatures often drive the plot and act as a humorous foil for Edward. Importantly, the hyper-realistic suburbia comes across as excessively tacky in contrast to Edward's genuine innocence.Danny Elfman's score is, in my opinion, the best of his career. Saccharine and melodic, the music breathes innocence and fantasy into Edward Scissorhands. Without it, the movie wouldn't work half as well as it does.Edward Scissorhands is classic Tim Burton - gothic themes, imaginative characters, zany acting, and a sort of German Expressionist-like aesthetic. I definitely recommend giving it a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Enchanting!,"I would have to say that Edward Scissorhands is by far one of the best films done by Tim Burton. It is a very beautiful story. They couldn't have chosen a better cast for this movie. Johnny Depp is phenomenal as Edward. He brings the characters in his movies to life so well that it is hard to believe that he is acting. It seems as if when he learns about the movie and goes over the scripts that he transforms in the character. This film is definitely one of them. This movie is nothing short of enchanting. This movie was the reason that I fell in love with Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. If you like movies that leave you bug eyed, make you think, and leave you wanting more then this is the film for you. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good fairy tale.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"disappointing, I really wanted to like this movie","I really thought I would like this movie, I usually like interesting stories about alienated characters, but this was just too sentimental.The movie's number one problem: the characters are too cliché. I know they wanted to go for a fairytale style story, but that doesn't mean the characters have to be 100% artificial. Couldn't they have done a bit more to minimize the feeling that we're watching mindless, one-dimensional caricatures simply existing for the sake of the movie? The characters have almost no depth at all. For example, why did Kim ever fall in love with Scissorhands? She never had a reason to, and the explanation given was not good enough. She went from almost being disgusted of him to... LOVING him? Not just being his friend, not finally accepting him for who he is, or even just his best friend, but loving him...romantically. That's completely absurd. She was initially disgusted by him, but it's after seeing him on TV and finding out that he would ""do anything for her"" that she begins loving him, I feel silly just typing that. I'll tell you why she fell in love, it's because the plot called for it.In the end when Ed saves the kid from being hit by the van, that felt like a convenient scene to throw in to show Ed as a hero and to draw empathy, but it makes no sense at all. Why would The Dead Zone's Anthony Michael Hall keep driving full speed after seeing the boy in the street? Even if he was drunk he would've made some attempt to swerve after seeing his girlfriend's brother about to be hit, and you can't tell me he didn't see him. I honestly wanted to like this movie, it's sweet and lighthearted, but ultimately failed because there was too much in this movie that was contrived.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
One of the most beautiful films about the right to be different,"This film shows us Edward, a humanoid created by a scientist who died before he could finish his creation. Because of this, Edward has big scissors instead of fingers and a strange looking, almost industrial. But he ends up being found amid the ruins of the mansion where he was born and taken to a suburban neighborhood, where life is always the same, made of perfection appearances. Directed by Tim Burton, has a screenplay by Caroline Thompson and counts on the participation of Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder.This film is a modern Christmas tale and, for a decade, was very broadcast on televisions around this time of year. The story is very beautiful and touching, and makes us think about issues such as the right to be different from others, the difference between being and seeming, the exaggerated importance we give to appearances and the little importance we give to what is genuine, and how our society corrupts what is naturally good (Rousseau revisited?). Despite it usually have a parental rating accessible to children, this film seems to have been designed for public since the age of ten. The cast is reasonable but not surprising, except for Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder, actors who had, in this movie, the first major opportunity to shine, and where Depp inaugurated a long and fruitful partnership with Burton, which lasts until today. The photography and the visual effects are very good. The sets and costumes are interesting, helping to get the message proposed in the film, and the soundtrack is marked by the main theme, composed by Danny Elfman. This piece remained in the memory of the audience for its beauty and magic, becoming one of the most beautiful musical pieces made for film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"A simple, but dark and poignant film, that is definitely Burton's best!","Other films that are genuinely moving are The Elephant Man, Fearless and Camille. Edward Scissorhands is a film of darkness and beauty, that makes it such a wonderful and unique film to see. One thing that I really liked about Edward Scissorhands was the music score by Danny Elfman, which was very beautiful, sensitive and mysterious. A good example is in the beginning credits, with the angelic choir accompanying the Christmas-like images on screen. The cinematography was gorgeous, with bright imaginative close-ups contrasted with genuinely Gothic scenes, like when we first meet Edward in the dark house. The script, while not the strongest category of the film, was still very touching, and added to the charm and suspense that was already ensured in the film. The direction by Tim Burton had all his trademarks, very dark and suspenseful, evident in films like Batman and Sleepy Hollow, if a little odd at times, which is fairly typical of Burton. While there were one or two funny moments, the film is genuinely poignant, with a heart-rending ending. I will say I was most impressed with the acting, topped by Johnny Depp's tragic and poignant portrayal of the title character, and then Winona Ryder as Kim, while not quite as convincing is still very sensitive. I was shocked that Depp didn't get an Oscar for his performance, he doesn't say much, but his facial expressions fully justify. There was also sterling support from Dianne West, Kathy Baker et al, while Vincent Price in a minor role as the inventor also impresses, such a shame he died three years later, he was a brilliant actor, if you see him as the truly Machiavellian villain in Great Mouse Detective, or the sadistic Matthew Hopkins in Witchfinder General, you'll know what I mean. As I have already said, the ending is so heart-rending, that I will confess I got through half'a box of tissues. Overall, a remarkably beautiful and poignant film that had me speechless. My advice to anyone who hasn't seen it, and is planning to, have a box of tissues at the ready, it is that sad. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
One of the greatest fable of the 90s.,"Tim Burton all time favorite artist of all time. Not just one of the greatest directors of all time, not just one of the greatest imaginative writers of all time, not just versatile camera works ever put to film, but a versatile genius of art. That's how I think of Tim Burton. Edward Scissorhands is his personal film that he ever put to film by his heart. When I saw this film for the first time, my heart burst of love. I was always in love with his films, I don't start loving Batman because of him, nightmare before Christmas is my all-time favorite holiday film, Ed wood, Big fish, big eyes, Beetlejuice, Sweeney Todd the Demon Barber of Fleet Street, all of them. But only one that is true to his heart and that is Edward Scissorhands. Edward Scissorhands is a versatile work of art ever put film, with darkness and colors combined together to make into a perfect rainbow is Edward Scissorhands.

Captivating and attractive fairytale with a very charming character well played by Johnny Depp,"Good film revolving around Johnny Depp who plays a young man living at a spooky hilltop castle and created by a weird scientist, Vincent Price, being left by his inventor without completate, wielding long scissor blades for hands.

As hapless Edward arrives in a new neighbourhood and he fights with being lonely and diferent in a cardboard
cut-out wold . As Edward's hands get him into problem, creating peculiar haircuts,
horrendous gardens, and brighter, better poodles. Along way he fallls in love for a beautiful girl, Winona Rider, but he has to confront with her ex-boyfriend, Anthony Michael Hall.Visually competent film with plenty of colourful images, splash, thrills and emotion .Edward role is very sensitive and agreeable, however, with scissors in place of hands, he has more trouble and complication fitting into suburbia than would most new kids on the block. Johhny Depp is terrific as the ingenuous, rare boy get into problem, Depp is every inch the pitiable being at the mercy of how his dead creator has left him . Support cast is frankly fine, including long or short appearances from notorious secondaries as Dianne West, Alan Arkin, Anthony Michael Hall, Kathy Baker, Conchata Farrell, Caroline Aaron and special intervention by Vincent Price as the strange scientific and creator in his last feature.It packs a briiliant cinematography full of light and colour by Stefan Czapsky .

"A Truly Magical Movie For All Ages, Burton's Finest","This is one of Tim Burton's most powerful movies. Though the title-character seems strange he represents the goodness in the world and what can happen when society just doesn't accept difference. The Gothic look of the castle, combined with the glorious colour of suburbia creates a strong contrast and shows things may not be as they seem. Edward comes from the dark and scary castle but is gentle, kind and loving, the place he wants to be accepted into is the colourful suburbia, which is backstabbing, vicious and evil. This story shows the betrayal of a person who desperately wants to help and to love but does not realise he is being used. The only people that seem to understand him are the wonderful Peg Boggs (played brilliantly by Dianne Wiest) and the beautiful Kim (played superbly by Winona Ryder). Tim Burton has created yet another beautiful fairy tale to captivate adults and children alike. Johnny Depp shows his great talent as an actor and Danny Elfman's music for the movie is some of the most beautiful you're ever likely to hear. A great movie for Christmas and all year round, and while it is a classic story it also deals with the prejudices of society, friendship, family and love and I advise anyone who hasn't seen it to see it, it is an experience well worth it and a movie you'll never forget.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
An emotional charismatic and off the wall Dramatic Movie!,"This film hit me with two main feelings. One, of an overwhelming feeling of sadness for Edward as his position is one that is just impossible to bear. To know that you are in love with a person to that degree and finding out they love you in the same way but knowing that you cant give that person what they seek, because of your hands. This was summed up in the scene where Kim asks Edward to hold her, but he just says, 'I can't'. Packed with emotion this film got to me with the acting particularly of Johnny Depp and the music. Very Cleverly written and accented, this added to the movie greatly. 10-10, this is a film i'm gonna keep for a long time, and most importantly, watch again!

OK for five-year-old pajama-boys,"A shambles of a medieval castle atop a small but craggy mountain, both of which happen to be chock-a-block adjacent to a faceless 1960s tract-home subdivision -- in which, by the way, all of the homes are uniformly painted in a pink, blue, green, or blue pastel color. And for me, that is where the film's interest begins to wane. Simply put, ""Edward Scissorhands"" is yet another Spielberg-like tear-jerker, from the oh-so-sensitive (but cardboard) characters on down to the treacly, chorus-tinged music score.

The director's cut,"Tim Burton's whimsical fable is a visually exotic parody of small town values, exploring themes such as loneliness and conformity; a very unusual horror film; and a simple tragedy to boot.  With minimal plot but coherent vision and child-like wonder, Burton has made a film whose view of the world resembles few others.  What he has not done is made a masterpiece.Some films build fantasy elements into the real world, and explore what might happen if such a thing came true: 'The Truman Show', and 'Being John Malkovich', are two obvious examples of this genre.  But Tim Burton does not make films like that.  Even his most realistic work (e.g. Ed Wood) takes place in a world that at times appears to be wholly imaginative. This is not necessarily good.  It means that one cannot look for ordinary human motivations and actions in his stories: in this film, for example, a small American town lies in the shadow of a Gothic castle which not one of its inhabitants has ever visited until a cosmetics saleswoman dares to make a call; and at many subsequent turns, the actions of the characters just don't square with what anyone real would actually do if confronted with a boy with scissors for hands.  At one level, this complaint is petty: the story is, after all, a mere fairy tale.  But this is precisely the point.  Though visually highly original, the film's comments about modern society can only be in a morally obvious fashion: the behaviour of the protagonists too stylised and contrived to allow for anything more subtle.  Which leaves you at moments the feeling you are watching little more than a live action version of Wallace and Grommit (with fewer jokes to boot; though the film is quite effective in spinning out its only real gag).All Burton's films place style (albeit in quite a deep sense) over substance; the creation of a form over what goes on inside.  The strength of Edward Scissorhands lies in its simplicity; and in the bewilderment in Johnny Depp's eyes (even if he does resemble Malcolm McLaren!). Without pretence, it eventually draws you into its beautiful, but two-dimensional, world.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Best Movie of all time,"This is a beautiful movie, and most people I know have never seen it. If you haven't, Make sure to see it! The ending is really sad and beautiful, and it leaves you with a happy/sad feeling. Also, the music just grabs you. There is a boy's choir that sings throughout the movie, and they just capture the emotion you are trying to let out, but don't know how. You should really see it, if you've never have. The movie 'Simon Birch' reminds me a bit of this 'Edward'. This is the perfect casting. Johnny Depp just seems so innocent, and untouched, and Winona Ryder is a snobby little girl who learns to look beyond a handsome face. I've never seen such a heartwarming movie- I don't think I ever will.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Truly bizarre film, but good.","The writers of this film, Tim Burton and Caroline Thompson, have quite a strange imagination.  But, I guess strange imaginations usually yield the best films.  This film is not a masterpiece in my opinion, but it was very fun to watch and had a lot of good stuff in it.  The story is nothing but bizarre from start to finish.  There are a few things in the film that aren't really explained to you, so I guess you just have to fill in the gaps with your own explanations.  For instance, I was unsure if Edward was a human put together from other human parts (like Frankenstein) or if he was a machine/android.  There were other aspects, like this, that weren't really explained, but that didn't hinder my enjoying of the film.The cast was very good.  I could not believe that Edward was played by Johnny Depp.  They did a fantastic job with his make-up, his wardrobe, and of course the scissorhands.  Johnny was fantastic as Edward.  Winona Ryder was great as well, she looks very different as a blonde, but I'm not complaining, she looked great!  Dianne Wiest was also great in the film. Anthony Michael Hall was quite a surprise to see in the film, and plays quite a different role than his well known 1980's films (""The Breakfast Club"", ""Sixteen Candles"", ""Weird Science"").  He really pulled off the role rather well.  Alan Arkin was a perfect choice for Kim's (Winona Ryder) father.  I have always liked his acting, and he didn't let me down in this film.  Another notable cast-member is The Inventor, played by Vincent Price. I don't know much about him other than I know he is well known for his roles in horror films.  He was a perfect choice for the role of the inventor in this film, and did a great job.  The rest of the cast was very good as well.The music in this film, composed by Danny Elfman (as you can expect from a Tim Burton film) was excellent.  Elfman's work is quite funny to me because you can tell immediately that it is his work.  His music is so distinctive. I couldn't help but think of the first ""Batman"" film when I heard the score in this film.  I really liked the score quite a bit and if you like Elfman's other work, then you'll more than likely like his score in this film as well.Like I said above, I wouldn't call this film a masterpiece, but it was definitely worth my time to watch it.  The film really is quite interesting, fun to watch, and quite touching at times.  This film has a lot to say about human nature and accepting outsiders and what not.  I'm not usually one for ""deeper meanings"", but at least that's what I got from the film.

Unique vision of Tim Burton,"Peg (Dianne Wiest) discovers a lone boy Edward (Johnny Depp) in the hill top mansion. He's been left alone after the death of his creator (Vincent Price). He has massive scissors for hands. Peg takes Edward into her own home. He later becomes infatuated with Peg's teen daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). At first, the neighbors are mostly fascinated by him with the exception of Esmeralda (O-Lan Jones) and Kim's boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall).Tim Burton is an original. His vision is like no others. Johnny Depp is once again a great enigmatic lead just like 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' 3 years later. He is truly adorably damaged. It also speaks to the conformity of the suburbs and our acceptance of the outsider. It is a movie with heart and wonder. There is no movie like it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Tim Burton, in his best","Edward Scissorhands achieves the nearly impossible feat of capturing the delicate flavor of a fable or fairy tale in a live-action movie. The story follows a young man named Edward (Johnny Depp), who was created by an inventor (Vincent Price, in one of his last roles) who died before he could give the poor creature a pair of human hands. Edward lives alone in a ruined Gothic castle that just happens to be perched above a pastel-colored suburb inhabited by bread winning husbands and frustrated housewives straight out of the 1950s. One day, Peg (Dianne Wiest), the local Avon lady, comes calling. Finding Edward alone, she kindly invites him to come home with her, where she hopes to help him with his pasty complexion and those nasty nicks he's given himself with his razor-sharp fingers. Soon Edward's skill with topiary sculpture and hair design make him popular in the neighborhood--but the mood turns just as swiftly against the outsider when he starts to feel his own desires, particularly for Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). Most of director Tim Burton's movies (such as Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, Batman) are visual spectacles with elements of fantasy, but Edward Scissorhands is more tender and personal than the others. Edward's wild black hair is much like Burton's, suggesting that the character represents the director's own feelings of estrangement and co-option. Johnny Depp, making his first successful leap from TV to film, captures Edward's childlike vulnerability even while his physical posture evokes horror icons like the vampire in Nosferatu and the sleepwalker in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. Classic horror films, at their heart, feel a deep sympathy for the monsters they portray; simply and affectingly, Edward Scissorhands lays that heart bare.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
'Wonderful' is the word that best describes it!!!,"Burton's films are usually set in a world of its own and in that regard Edward Scissorhands isn't much different. However, here he shows us two different worlds. One is that of Edward's house and the other is that of the neighborhood. While the neighborhood is inhabited by 'normal' people, Burton uses his imagination with the colourful houses and the people who are sort of from the 60s or 70s era. It's a typical suburban neighborhood where men drive to work and women gossip. Edward's mansion is more coloured in black and white (sort of reflects on the idea that he's an 'unfinished' experiment) and his garden is richer in green. The background score contributes well to the screenplay and cinematography is fine.The story is simple but sublimely told. It's a little Frankensteinish, Edward (Johnny Depp) is created by his inventor, a scientist, who dies before giving him hands(he has scissor-hands). After the death of his creator, he stays locked inside the mansion until a kind lady Peg (Dianne Wiest) decides to take care of him. She takes him home. This arouses curiosity from the neighbors. Edward tries to adjust himself to this new world and falls in love with Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). While the neighbors accept him (because of their own benefits), it does not take long for them to turn their backs against him. Edward mows their garden, cuts their trees in marvelous shapes of animals and humans, cuts their hair among so many other things that attract the neighbors, but soon he faces difficult obstacles where these people turn against him and things only get so much worse that even Peg's and Kim's efforts to save him hardly seem to succeed...Burton tells this wonderful story beautifully. The characters are indeed very well-written and the climax is moving. The film is a little weird, especially with the combination of the dark humour, romance, drama and action set in the 'real' world but it works well. The film is said to be inspired by a fictional childhood hero of Burton who had scissor-hands. Clearly he's put a lot of heart into it. I just saw the film recently and it clearly has stood the test of time and one movie that will stay for a long time.Depp in the title role is wonderfully outstanding. I can't imagine anyone else play the part. It was made for him as he did full justice to the character and immortalized it. Wiest is completely different from her other roles and only proves what a versatile actress she is. Ryder is charming and adequate.To conclude, this is a simple, yet beautiful story of an outsider who is initially accepted by all, just to be shunned. While the people accept him for their own benefit they refuse to see his wonderful heart and eventually smash it. I know I'm using the world wonderful too often but that's the adjective that best describes 'Edward Scissorhands'.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Overhyped bizarre film which makes no sense,"I don't get it. I have heard so many good things about this movie, but after watching it I don't get all the hype. What is the point? Bad acting and plotholes abound.Edward has been living in the house all these years and no one has noticed? How does he put clothes on? Does he eat? If he doesn't eat, why is he eating dinner with the family? If he does eat, how does he eat since he has so much trouble picking up food? How does he make sculptures that are so much talker than him without a ladder? Where did he get all the ice from for the sculptures? How does Winona Ryder's character fall in love with him despite him saying about ten lines in the entire movie?I guess the message is that we need to be more inclusive and love one another despite our differences. Good sentiment, but the movie does a really bad job of conveying that.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Burton's Magnum Opus,"Here we go, Edward Scissorhands. Tim Burton himself has gone on record saying that this is the work he is most proud of, for it captures the very nature of what his films are all about. Whatever his perspective is on the film, this masterpiece is certainly my favorite of his filmography and for various reasons. For one, it was the first collaboration between Burton and Johnny Depp, and this relationship still lasts to this very day. Depp has been the main player in many of Burton's flicks and it's hard to imagine some of the movies without him. Second, it marked the swan song for one of my all time favorite actors, the master of macabre Vincent Price, who Tim Burton had idolized since youth. He even made a short film about Vincent Price in 1982, fittingly entitled Vincent. Third, the film hearkens back to the 1931 Frankenstein film and makes the mad scientist's creation sympathetic and pitiful. Fourth, the main character of Edward is such a whacky yet contemporary character that I can't help but relate to him at times. Then again, I think we can all relate to Edward Scissorhands from time to time.The film constantly shifts atmospheres, but it works greatly in this flick. One minute, it can be a dark, Gothic horror related atmosphere, the next, it's the bright, sunny and upbeat suburban neighborhood. The film also has one of the all time greatest film scores, performed brilliantly by Danny Elfman, who's Ice Dance score fills me with butterflies every time I set my ears to it. One time, when I was younger, a saw snow falling outside on a cold winter's night, but the darkness didn't stop me from seeing each individual snowflake. I immediately thought of the Ice Dance theme. It's the very epitome of a beautiful tune. In fact, all the film's compositions are great, especially the theme that plays in the opening credits of the movie where we see a montage of the old inventor's lab equipment. Perhaps my favorite scene out of the entire movie is the scene where Edward sees a can opener and has a flashback of the inventor's cookie making machine. The inventor, played by Vincent Price walks in, marvels at his contraption, takes a heart shaped cookie and holds it up to the chest of the lettuce slicing robot that would later be transformed into Edward himself. It's a very touching moment and shows just how great ideas can be born from great minds.The acting in the film is also something worth writing a book or two about. Johnny Depp's debut in a Burton film is probably his best. Even if he has little dialogue, Depp makes up his performance through his body language and movements. Depp based the movements of Edward off of Charlie Chaplin and it really shows, for several scenes show Edward waddling about and making facial expressions the Tramp himself would make. My favorite line of his from the film is after the neighbor Joyce (played by Kathy Baker) tries to seduce him in the beauty salon and he meets up with the Boggs family in a nearby restaurant. When asked by the father (played by Alan Arkin) on how his day went at the beauty salon, Edward tells him that Joyce lead him into the back room where she ""took all of her clothes off"". The delivery and the way Depp says the line makes it not only the most humorous line out of the film, but also the most perfectly time line out of the film. The other players are also grandiose with Anthony Michael Hall taking a break from playing the nerdy wise guy in John Hughes films and instead playing the dirtbag jock who torments Edward throughout most of the film. Winona Ryder, straight from Burton's Beetlejuice is also the apple of Edward's eye and comes off as the pretty girl many boys her age would love to date.But one of the main reasons why I love this film to pieces is that it was Vincent Price's last and arguably his best performance in a motion picture. He plays the role of the inventor as a kind hearted, noble fellow who was on the verge of creating a creation like no other. Unlike Dr. Frankenstein, he's not an insane fellow obsessed with his work, he's just a kind gentleman with a passion to build things and enjoy the very things he constructs. The scene where he passes is a heartbreaking scene, for he was about to give Edward normal hands, ridding him of the sharp scissorhands he was bound too for so long. Still, Price is a child at heart in this film and his performance sums up his entire career in the Gothic horror/macabre genre. The scene in which he teaches etiquette to Edward is a memorable scene that will have you laughing and tearing up all at once.What more can I say about the movie, it's magnificent. Sure, some may question where Edward got the ice for the ice sculptures at the very end, but that's a glaring issue. Edward Scissorhands brings us the best humor, the best imaginative elements and the best performances out of any other Burton film. Some think of it as a retelling of Shelley's Frankenstein, others say it's ET, I consider it a collage of many things, both from the horror and fantasy genres as well as the works of 19th century authors and their tales of weird beings and creatures of the night. And like I said earlier, I relate a lot to Edward, for he was a outcast, like I am an outcast, like we are all outcasts in certain times of our lives.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Tim burtons best.,"Truly a masterpiece and easily Tim burtons best. Firstly this movie objectively is very flawed, the plot is extremely cheesy and makes no sense when putting any logic to it, the dialogue can be cheesy at times and other aspects are very cheesy. That being said it is easy to look past for many reasons. Firstly, the story is phenomenal it is a story about society with lots of hidden and clever allegories for it. The movie perfectly shows how fake people can be, how easy people find it to use someone for their advantage and how quick people's opinion can change. The story is phenomenal and the ending almost made me cry with how perfectly it sums things up and leaves things. Secondly the cinematography is just as amazing. The colours of both the mansion and the neighbourhood are an amazing juxtaposition. The art of Edward is also equally good and the cinematography perfectly shows that beauty while also showing the darkness and fear that comes with Edward. Finally this movie is consistently funny and the protagonist characters are some of the most likeable and heartwarming characters in film history, and the antagonists are some of the most annoying and horrid in film history. This movie has such a great balance of goth, beauty, comedy, tragedy and storytelling and it is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Typical Burton/Depp Film, Which Means Good & Bad","With a Tim Burton-directed film, you get a lot of ""once again."" statementsOnce again, we get a terrific visual film with wild colors and scenes you'll rarely see elsewhere. Once again, Johnny Depp plays the lead role and plays a very strange guy - maybe the strangest he's ever played. Once again, the story is kind of bizarre, some cool and sometimes stupid and entertaining all at once. And - guess what? - once again, the meanest person in the film a Christian. In this movie, it's the Christian lady next door! Hello! Here we go with more Hollywood religious bias. It's unbelievable how many times they have gotten away with this hatred for all things Biblical.....but no things in Far Eastern or New Age religion or Indian mystical religion.In this movie, we get the stereotypical wild-eyed, hysterical religious crackpot. She's the next door neighbor who rants and raves that Edward is the spawn of the devil. Real subtle, eh? Filmmakers in the modern-era, since the morals code was abolished, have never been too shy about portraying Christians in a negative light every opportunity they see, even if isn't needed in the film. The Gothic-minded Burton just can't resist inserting his bias bias in almost every film he directs. It's like a Stephen King story.Anyway, for classic movie fans, it was nice to see Vincent Price again. He fits into this quirky tale quite well. Depp usually plays very likable weirdos, and that's the case here, too. Speaking of weirdos, Winona Ryder, who was Depp's real-life girlfriend during this time, is the only one who truly understands poor ""Edward"" in this wacky New Age-preachy film. What a pair Depp and Ryder must have made.Nonetheless, I will always remember this film for the incredible landscaping as only ""Edward Scissorhands"" could produce.

"All Burton, no substance","Edward Scissorhands is one of those I'll never see what all the fuss is about.Frankly, you can't hide a tired plot with a bizarre style. Burton has an eye for imagery here but is not so successful in creating a satisfying story. The film manages to introduce a fairly interesting character, Edward (Johnny Depp), a young man invented by a crazy scientist who dies before he can give Ed real hands. The set up is wasted on a very by-the-numbers plot and opportunity was greatly missed in creating something truly profound. Instead, the film relies on a ridiculous but at the same time, blindingly obvious love story involving the teenage girl Kim (Winona Ryder) and her a-hole boyfriend who shuns him. Edward manages to find kind of a living for himself when he his brought into this strange suburban neighbourhood, giving the residents bushes, hair and dogs a trim with his scissor hands. However, one must wonder why he never accepts the number of offers of medical help, and its never explained. The ostracising continues until the very contrived ending in which someone dies, a complete and utter cop-out but amazingly, nobody seems to mind too much. Its also way out of tone with the rest of the film. Then Elfman's score oohs and ahhs to remind us that what we're watching is mysterious and haunting when in fact, it's just weird. It all amounts to general annoyance, despite it being visually stunning.This is one I can really only recommend to Tim Burton fans, which is rather redundant considering that they've probably seen it already.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Awkward little film,"What goes through that man's mind? Tim Burton is a very imaginative director. Johnny Depp does a wonderful in playing the socially inept Edward Scissorhands. Burton shows us the duality of the world in which Edward finds himself. Edward lives in the dark, damp, and unkempt castle and the rest of the world in the contrasting bright, sunny, and pastel-like community in the valley. This is, however, a love story: a love which can never be, two people drawn to each other, who can never be together because society won't let it happen.In this film, the Avon lady (played by Dianne Wiest) takes it upon herself to have Edward move in with her and her family. Of course, it's the recipe for a shear disaster waiting to happen. Enter Winona Ryder (love interest) and the tension mounts. Edward spends most of time now clipping hair and improving the look of the neighborhood. And what's up with Anthony Michael Hall playing the tough guy? Sorry, too much baggage to see him other than the nerd he is. Between him and the nosy neighbors, they push Edward to the brink.I could not help but think of another Burton film (Frankenweenie) while watching this movie. Frankenstein came to mind a few times. Particularly, the scene where Edward is running from the police and the angry townsfolk are hot on his heels. It was very reminiscent of those two films.If you like Tim Burton and his odd sense of vision, you'll love this film. It's a love story, but not in the conventional sense. Burton does a delightful job in presenting the story. Although I do not give this one a high rating, I still recommend you give it a chance and decide for yourself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

""" He's a highly imaginative character"".","I first heard of this movie when I was 3. And then, I heard of many times and I wanted to know what it was about.It was a terribly sad movie which could bring tears to anyone's eyes.Kim (Winona Ryder), Edward's (Johnny Depp) girlfriend told the story to her grandchild as a bed time story saying Edward was left incomplete when his beloved creator (Vincent Price)died from old age. Edward was left all alone in the mansion on the hill above the neighborhood.Soon, a lipstick seller named Peg (Dianne Wiest) approached the mansion to see if she could sell any lipsticks. That mansion looked like the house from the film ""Taled Of The Crypt"". When she entered, she saw the front yards bushes were shaped like animals.BEAUTIFUL! And the mansion was very well maintained.Inside the house, Peg wondered about and when she entered the attic, she discovered timid Edward. She was shocked to see that he had scissors for hands. And then, she decided to take him home with her to her so 50s suburban home. E.g.- All the husbands all left for work in the mornings at the same time and houses looked identical.Edward was amazed to see what went on in the world which lived below him e.g- the people, the houses, mirrors and especially, Peg's daughter Kim. There was such a funny scene when Edward went into Kim's room and he accidentally popped the water bed. And when he was trying out his new clothes. He SURE did struggle to put on his clothes.Suddenly, all the people of the neighborhood were interested to know who Joyce brought home. There was such a radical scene when Peg's son, Kevin (Robert Oliveri) took Edward to school with him for show and tell and when Kevin gave Edward a piece of paper, as quick as a flash; a long row of little boys and girls were made. AMAZING! Edward soon learned from Joyce's husband, Bill (Alan Arkin). He created a T-Rex out of a bush followed by the shape of Peg's family. And from here, Edward had flash backs when he was still living with inventor/creator. There was such an amazing scene with the machines working. They looked like people working together.One day, all the people of the neighborhood came over to Peg's social at her house and Everyone was SO delighted to meet Edward. THEY LOVED HIM! E.g.- All the women wanted Edward to try their foods. And there were also some sad moments when Edward was battling to use scissor hands. For example, hard for him to use his cutlery at the dinner table, picking up glasses of lemonade, etc.Edward was so delighted to meet Kim for real and he fainted. It was SO funny! And also when Joyce (Kathy Baker) asked Edward if he would like a glass of lemonade. Edward soon started to do the suburb proud. He also did fur cuts for dogs and he also became a hairdresser for women who wanted new hair styles. And all the women believed Edward did a good job on their hairs. And he also could unlock doors, e.g.- when Kim and her boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall) were locked outside the house, Edward came along, put one of his scissor fingers in the key hole and 'click'. The unlock was unlocked.There was another funny scene: when Joyce tried to make love to Edward, the both fell off the chair they were both on with Edward's legs up in the air. And then, Edward quickly got up and took off. OOH! That woman's nails looked like Count Orlock's nails painted RED! And later on in the film, Jim locked Edward up in his safe in his home, the alarm went off, and the police rocked up. The police thought Edward committed a crime! When in fact Jim put Edward up to it! SAME ON YOU, JIM!!! And then, Kim told the brute to go!! You go, Kim!!! On Christmas eve, Edward did something interesting. he created a huge angel out of ice. WOW!!! With great detail of the angel's robe and wings!!!! There was another sad flash back: it was when the Inventor bought Edward a pair of plastic hands as a gift and when Edward reached out to hug his inventor, the Inventor died. Just like that! There was one huge moment of love turning into hate, it was when Jim tried to beat Edward up and Edward cut Jim across the arm. Edward certainly nailed the bastard there! And suddenly, the whole neighborhood heads toward the mansion on the hill. And then, in the mansion, in the attic, Jim struck back! But he lost again when Edward pushed him out the window. WAY TO GO, EDWARD!!!!!! And then, Kim went outside to the people of the suburb to say Edward was dead and she showed them all one of Edward's scissor hand's. Kim saved her lover's butt from those maniacs!And coming to the end of the film, as Kim spoke when she told her grand daughter the story of Edward Scissor Hands. Back in the attic of the mansion; Edward was making ice sculptures. The never snowed on that so 50s town until Edward began to make ice sculptures.Like what my old Drama teacher, Mrs. Roux would say:""What a stunning film!""",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Genius Masterpiece,"First off I have to say that the setting of the film was brilliant. The brightly coloured house gave an odd, strange feeling to the film. It felt different and unique. The mysterious music slotted right in with the setting of the film. The pacing was very good and each of the characters has their own separate personalities. The main character Edward was brilliantly written, it really showcased the innocence of the character. The plot was simple, yet effective. I have to applaud the make up artist, and costume designer, they both did an amazing job. There was also some humour involved, that have me a good chuckle. Subtle, but effective like a lot of the movie. There are not much downsides. The acting from Johnny Depp was stunning, as well as the ending, which was unique but fitted with the wonderful message I do the movie. Part of the message for me is that the innocent and talented must be protected from the harsh world or they could be shaped into the just a normal average person. Truly a beautiful film, with a beautiful message.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"uneven, but hits the right notes...","""Edward Scissorhands"" is an affecting, minimalist fairy tale and one of Tim Burton's better cinematic outings. It chronicles the story of an artificial 'boy' named Edward (an understated Johnny Depp) with shears for hands, as he tries to fit in with the denizens of a 1950s pastel vision of suburbia; the townsfolk embrace the outcast, who carves out immense topiary and gives lonely canines and housewives haircuts; the weak conflict comes in the form of Anthony Michael Hall, as a single-dimensioned goon who clings to the object of Edward's affection (virginal suburban daughter Winona Ryder). The unusual setting and the laid-back attitudes of the characters provides its share of unexpected laughs, but the core of the film comes in moments of quiet beauty, when Burton's cinematic eye, Danny Elfman's beautiful score, and the unspoken emotions of the characters truly hit home. ""Edward Scissorhands"" is a film as touching as its lead character, and rife with passages of sheer, poetic wonder and beauty.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Pivotal Burton-Depp collaboration,"A film like this can be difficult to review, as it's both an artists' favorite, as well as a well worn crowd pleaser. It's not a perfect movie, but it features excellent performances from its leads, and the role that launched Depp into superstardom. When an old inventor dies before finishing his finest creation - an android man - Edward is left with scissors for hands, alone, until a kindly Avon lady discovers, and brings Edward into society. While initially the entire wants to meet and know this outsider, things begin to change as they realize they he too has feelings. Largely a treatise on human kindness and acceptance, Burton makes his most personal statement, in his typical grand, artistic fashion.

Amazing,"I love this film because of how beautiful it is. It has a whole range of amazing sequences that look like real art. The snow scene is my favourite, when Edward carves a figure of an angel with Kim's face from a block of ice, while she dances in the snow below. However it is also capable of being very funny at times (for example, Edward's ignorance of words which mean something different from what you would think. ""Esmerelda: Have you sheep strayed so far from the flock? Edward: We're not sheep."") Johnny Depp's acting is incredibly passionate. He was the perfect choice for the role. I honestly cannot think of anyone who could have played it better. The bitter sweet storyline is enough to touch anybody (I still get misty eyed at the end), and I think this may be the single most beautiful film ever. Watch it, and who knows?

A Creative And Frankenstein Like Story,"Edward Scissorhands is a film that benefits from Tim Burton's creative mind. People always make jokes about how Burtons films can be similar and contain extremely similar themes or even music, but I would say that this film makes it work. It's a Frankenstein-esque story that has a great fairytale feeling.I think my favorite thing about this movie is it's visual style. I love the way the neighborhood looks and feels. It's like some strange mix of fantasy, 50's and late 80's. Very unique and fun. The was Edward is designed and how he works he's unique look into the look of the neighborhood is great too. He creates art work out of hedges and gives the women and dogs haircuts. It all feels very weird and surreal.Johnny Depp is pretty interesting as Edward. He plays him almost innocent, like a little boy, and it's fun to see. Lots of humour is infused in the film, but it also has many darker or sad moments. It feels like a kids movie but also has adult content, so it's more like an adult fairytale. Winona Ryder isn't the best actress in this, but I feel like she kind of visually fits the role, and she gets the job done.This is a very unique movie, and I think based on that alone it's worth a watch.

Edward Scissorhands,"Edward Scissorhands was released after director Tim Burton had a monster hit with Batman. I never warmed to the film when it was released and should had revisited after the release of Batman Returns.You can see how this influenced Burton's twisted wintery fairy tale of the Batman sequel. Especially with all the leftover snow from this movie.After getting acquainted with the world of Dr Seuss with my children. I can see more into this film after seeing it again almost 30 years later.This 1960s era suburbia is straight out of Dr Seuss with the colourful houses and costumes. It was the kind of town parodied in Joe Dante's The Burbs.Peg Boggs (Dianne Wiest) is the Avon saleswoman who discovers young Edward (Johnny Depp) in a Gothic castle at the top of the town.He had been created by his elderly inventor (Vincent Price) who died before giving him his arms. So Edward is left with scissors for hands and he is also an emotionally stunted teenager.Peg brings Edward to her home and he initially wows everyone with his pruning skills. When Peg's teenage daughter Kim (Winona Ryder) returns home after a break. She is initially repulsed but then falls for him. However her jock boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall) detests Edward and sets him up for a fall.Eventually the other neighbours turn on Edward as well. He has no option but flee.Edward Scissorhands is Frankenstein reworked as a dark fairytale. Someone strange and different who was always going io be regarded as an outcast. It was noticeable that the black cop let Edward leave knowing the town wanted their ounce of flesh.I still thinks there was a lot wrong with the narrative. No one can see through the bullying Jim and his antics. It was shocking at the time to see the nerdy Anthony Michael Hall had really beefed up. That must have been some exercise regime, he must have got his vitamins off Hulk Hogan.For Depp here was a role where less was more, he underplayed Edward as softly spoken vulnerable young innocent.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
The Gentle Frankenstein,"In case no one has noticed it actor Johnny Depp and director Tim Burton have collaborated on six joint projects, certainly enough to qualify them as a screen team like Wayne and Ford and DeNiro and Scorsese. But in my humble opinion they have not topped Edward Scissorhands their first and best work together.I think the part of Edward Scissorhands, the gentle Frankenstein like creation of Vincent Price, was Johnny Depp's real breakout role. Around this time Depp was at a real critical point in his career. He was a teenage idol due to his role on 21 Jump Street, but he had it in his head he could do some really serious work. It would have been easy to go with the flow and stayed with the series a few more years and make a pile of money. Sad to say though once teenage idols lose their vehicles very few have careers of the first rank, no matter how talented they are.Instead Johnny Depp remained true to himself and confident in his abilities and it paid off. This role was so unlike what he had done before and his is a career that keeps reinventing itself with every film. This was his first reinvention and it remains my favorite film of his.Edward Scissorhands is a fable like a modern Grimm fairy tale with nods of acknowledgment to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Peter Sellers character in Being There. Edward is a creation like the Frankenstein monster, but it's no criminal brain that's commanding his body. He's as innocent as a babe, a real live boy, but with a pair of hands made from garden clippers, sharp as a razor. His inventor Vincent Price died before giving him human hands leaving an innocent with what could be deadly weapons.His innocence is preserved when Dianne Weist the Avon Lady from the neighborhood goes to the Gothic house that looms over her neat suburban pastel neighborhood. I've got to hand it to Tim Burton for those pastel suburban sets showing the stultifying conformity, contrasting to Vincent Price's place. The shots of the ordinary suburban types doing their daily thing say more than 100 pages of dialog.Weist takes him home, Depp has survived in the place, God only knows how. She seeks to integrate him into life. Those scissorhands prove to be quite popular as he sculpts designs in the suburban hedges, and then goes into hairdressing where he works at a fantastic pace.Depp's as innocent as Peter Sellers let out into the real world in being there. But said to say it all works out like it did for Boris Karloff in Frankenstein.Besides those I've already mentioned, pay note to the performances of Winona Ryder as Weist's daughter, Anthony Michael Hall as her jock boyfriend whose jealousy starts Edward's world unraveling and Kathy Baker who stepped out of Desperate Housewives for her role.This was Vincent Price's farewell performance on the big screen. He did one more made for television film and then after he died a cartoon version of Arabian Nights which was shelved for 20 years was released. In the Citadel Film series book, The Films of Vincent Price, Johnny Depp paid a fine tribute to Price saying he was a wonderful man to work with and a real inspiration. Price also gave him some good financial advice. Buy art as the best hedge against inflation in hard times. And Vincent Price certainly knew his art.With all these fine people in it, the film is owned body and soul by Johnny Depp. His performance in which his dialog is kept to a minimum due to the character is an object lesson of how much emotion one can convey with both lack of dialog and heavy makeup. Speaking of which the only Oscar this film was nominated for was in the Makeup category and it lost to Warren Beatty's Dick Tracy. How Johnny Depp didn't get a nomination at least is a disgrace.You watch Edward Scissorhands and I recommend you watch it as a triple feature with Frankenstein and Being There and it will blow you away.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Edward Scissorhands,"Vincent Price has spent his life working on a labour of love - a ""son"", an artificially constructed person that lacks only hands - for which he temporarily has two pairs of scissors. Sadly, the creator dies before he can rectify this and so young ""Edward"" (Johnny Depp) is left alone in his lofty castle. Alone, that is until a kindly Dianne Wiest (""Peg"") takes him under her wing, introduces him to her many friends - including an on-form Winona Ryder (""Kim"") - and they all discover he has a remarkable ability for topiary (and hairdressing!). Soon he is all the rage, the talk of the town - but always the misfit, and of course when a mishap - in this case a robbery for which he is framed - occurs, his fickle friends turn on him readily. It's a touching tale of innocence and humanity; Depp plays his role skilfully and with delicacy and humour, and the last half hour is quite a damning indictment of thoughtlessness and selfishness that still resonates today. Like many ""fairy"" tales, it has it's root in decent morals and Tim Burton is ahead of the game in delivering a nuanced and enjoyable modern day parable that makes you laugh, smile and wince with shame in equal measure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Sad disappointment,"What a sad disappointment this movie was.  I had heard good things, and Tim Burton is good director.  But, it was all for naught.  What starts interesting(scissors for hands, cool)eventually becomes just another movie, with a horribly generic Hollywood ending. Another problem stems from the fact that Edward isn't really all that unique.  Every character is a strange caricature themselves, so everybody is weird, not just Edward with his strange hands.  So, instead of this strong contrast with Edward to everyone else, we instead are greeted by a parade of weirdos, and focus is lost. And then there's the ending.  All I'll say is, very bad, very stupid.  But, at that point, I was just glad it was over. To be fair, the set design was nice, and Johnny Depp was good. But overall, a sad waste. Someone told me that if I had seen it when I was younger, I might have liked it more. Ah, to be young, stupid, and have no standards.",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

A movie with heart,"Edward Scissorhands, directed by Tim Burton, is a charming and utterly original fable showcasing Burton's mastery in creating a visually unique world. The story revolves around a haunted mansion atop a nearby mountain, once home to an eccentric inventor (Vincent Price) who built Edward, a human with scissors for hands, before passing away and leaving him alone. The plot unfolds when Avon sales representative Peg Boggs (Dianne Wiest) discovers Edward in the sinister castle and brings him to live with her family.Edward, portrayed by Johnny Depp, is both delightful, curious, and likable. Depp delivers a moving and memorable performance, conveying emotion and humanity through a character who physically cannot touch others. Despite his peculiar appearance, the townsfolk do not see him as a brute; instead, they adapt his abnormalities for various roles like gardener or pet and human hairdresser.The love story develops with Kim Boggs (Winona Ryder), Peg's teenage daughter, who initially finds Edward monstrous but eventually develops special feelings for him. However, Edward also faces seduction from the neighbor Joyce (Kathy Baker). The film explores Edward's relationship with middle-class suburban society, where he is the innocent and understanding one, while society reveals its potentially malevolent nature.A plot twist occurs when Jim, Kim's brutish boyfriend, manipulates Edward into participating in a burglary, leading to Edward being ostracized by the community. Only the Boggs family, particularly Peg and her husband Bill, stand by him. The film concludes with Kim returning Edward to his castle for his safety, marking a melancholic ending that critiques human nature and conformity.Edward Scissorhands tackles profound themes of acceptance, love, difference, and the cruelty of social norms, using Edward as a metaphor for those who are different. Visually appealing and easy to appreciate, the movie does not delve deeply into its storyline but its style and message make it memorable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"""Edward Scissorhands""","No matter what you may think of him, there's no question of director Tim Burton's gift for imagination, invention, and his mastery of storytelling. He also specializes in freaks (or more pleasantly, misunderstood outsiders); if you've seen ""Beetlejuice"" (1988), ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" (1985), ""Batman"" (1989) and his critical masterpiece ""Edward Scissorhands"" (1990), then you realize it's the truth. ""Edward Scissorhands,"" often cited as Burton's most personal work, transcends its fairy-tale origins to become something far greater, like a mature cinematic masterpiece. Only true Burton devotees know why the film is so celebrated today, 15 years after it was released. Though Burton has made two better critical efforts since this one (1994's ""Ed Wood"" and 2003's ""Big Fish""), it is ""Edward Scissorhands"" that stands as his most delicate and greatest masterwork. The film takes place in some quaint, unnamed suburb (that looks like something straight out of a '50s supermarket real estate guide), where local Avon lady Peg (Dianne Wiest), desperate for a sale, stumbles up to the dark castle located on the hill looming over her neighborhood. On her way up to the door, she finds the garden and the magnificent artistic creations housed in it. Once inside, she finds the remains of a factory and its sole occupant, Edward (Johnny Depp). The greatest, yet unfinished creation of his late scientific inventor (the late Vincent Price, in one of his last roles), Edward is a sort of Frankenstein monster, only he's not built from human body parts and he is not an object of horror but more of sympathy: The Inventor died before he could give Edward real hands, so he's stuck forever with these ""scissor-hands."" Peg invites him to live with her family down in the 'burbs, but she is in no way put off by his ""hands,"" which are comprised of razor-sharp knives and blades. I guess I shouldn't say it takes a while for Edward to grow accustomed to his new surroundings, but the locals are quite welcoming and warm to him (he even takes on the tasks of pet grooming, sheering, and eventually, salon styling). Why, he approaches adorability in this sweet, conformist society! There are others, however, like the native Christ-nut, sees foreboding in Edward's arrival, and Jim (Anthony Michael Hall), who is the rich, selfish and arrogant son of a local businessman, and who also happens to be the boyfriend of Peg's pretty teenage daughter Kim (Winona Ryder), sees menace in innocence. Edward is kind and benevolent but he's also human (somewhat), and is capable of anger and rage and it isn't long before various misunderstandings allow this dark side of his character to surface. Long before he was Jack Sparrow, Depp was Edward Scissorhands in one of the most recognizable roles of his career; who could have seen him becoming the top-notch performer he is today? As the harmless Edward, his face is scarred by the many scratches of his scissor-hands, making him incapable of touching anything or anyone for fear of destroying it. He has minimal lines but delivers his performance through calculated mannerisms and facial expressions. It's probably one of his first great roles. As for director Burton, he indulges in his usual cinematic weirdness (is there any other kind?), but it's given a strong emotional and human touch with a light dose of comic fare, which manages to separate it from earlier substance works like ""Beetlejuice"" or ""Batman."" He focuses mainly on the characters, and their reaction to the misunderstood outsider, and his reluctant acceptance, more or less, into their world. ""Batman"" remains my favorite Burton piece, but ""Edward Scissorhands"" is probably the best film he's made so far (from a fan's perspective). ""Edward Scissorhands"" is a dark, comic fable come to life, and lives forever and ever, long after the lights in the theater come back on.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
I feel so manipulated...,"I just don't get it. Here I am, rapidly approaching my late twenties, perpetually a heartless misanthrope, and yet this dang movie gets me every time. It's such a simple movie, with characterisations that are barely more than cookie-cutter ciphers, but it makes me well up every time. What's up with that? I've been fortunate enough, over the years, to see most of the movies in Tim Burton's oeuvre, but I think that it's this one above all that characterise him as one of the most idiosyncratic and imaginative directors around. Everything about this film gets me; the contrasts between light and dark, pastels and charcoal, symmetry and asymmetry... then, on the non-visual level, the mixture of satire, dark fantasy, occasionally moving drama and 50's pastiche... I think this is Burton's masterpiece, I really do.There's the old accusation that this piece is rather mean spirited and encapsulates a deep antipathy towards suburbia, and that its whole purpose was to exorcise the demons of Burton's 'outsider' adolescence, but if that's what it takes to make something so beautiful, then what the hey. And true, it's not as profound as Kant or as mould-breaking as Kubrick, but neither of those chaps ever did fairy stories.Anyway, my advice is this: don't watch it if you're drunk and remember that it used to make you cry as a kid.

A modern classic of a timeless theme: an outsider's quest for love,"This dream-like fantasy tells the story of an artificial teen boy whose scissors-like hands are capable of terrible injury and enduring beauty, but most of all set him apart from ""real"" people. Director Tim Burton used the Edward Scissorhands character to reprise his personal sensitivity and the social isolation of his teen years. Played with affecting understatement by Johnny Depp, who wept when he read the script, this film will resonate with every kid whose gifts are used against him or her by inferior peers. Such nerds and outliers, Burton is telling us, are capable of creating beauty and engendering love. The price of such a life is loneliness, but when the person is true to who they are, they are spared the desolation of the banal.Ironically, considering how much death is involved, this is a life-affirming movie, with a little something for everyone. The fantasy genre is extremely tricky to pull off but this one works, thanks to Burton's central idea, and its realization as a screenplay by Caroline Thompson. Thompson's treatment was sufficiently compelling to populate the cast with A-listers, and for all of them making this film was a labor of love.With directing prowess beyond his years, Burton coaxes his players to come up with, simultaneously, a retelling of Frankenstein, a gentle satire of suburbia, a teen love story, and in a more general sense, a portrait of America from the perspective of an outsider - someone who loves it, is repelled by it, and can never fully be a part of it.The film's majestic leap from the suburbs to timeless love in an enchanted garden is brought home with almost overwhelming intensity by the lush choral work and orchestration of Danny Elfman. As counterpoint to his wonderful choir, Elfman gives us the bell-like celesta, an instrument from the 1890s, first used by Tchaikovsky in ""The Nutcracker Suite.""I have never seen such a diversity of opinions about this film's worth by the top critics of its time - 1990. As he is prone to do, Roger Ebert misses the point completely and pans the film. The respected Globe and Mail calls it ""a classic."" But it was famously contrarian Pauline Kael's description of the film as ""kitsch . . . Cheesy plot-centered melodrama . . ."" that confirmed the rightness of my opinion when I first saw the film 22 years ago and upon seeing it again recently . . . Edward Scissorhand awakened a part of me I had long given up as gone with childhood: the capacity to be spellbound.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Artifice, art, and Edward.","Film students often point out that Tim Burton's work usually contains an autobiographical edge.  I don't know very much about Mr. Burton, but it does seem that his most successful films usually involve several key elements -- the somber protagonist more often than not clad in black, at odds with the world around him, in love with an unattainable woman, and passionately devoted to a particular craft.  ""Batman""'s Michael Keaton, Johnny Depp's Ichabod Crane, and Depp's Edward Scissorhands all share these qualities, but Scissorhands seems to come the closest in not only exploring the psychoses of the main character, but also exploring the line between the artist, his craft, and its audience.Into the happy world of domesticity comes Edward, a man clad in black leather, with scissors for hands.  Standing out amidst the monotony of suburbia, his presence immediately causes a stir among the local townspeople.  When Edward begins trimming the gardens, then the hair of the dogs, and finally the hair of the women in town, he goes from certified mystery man/freak to local celebrity, on the basis of a gift he himself does not seem all that impressed with.  (He expresses a desire to have normal hands.)  His joy comes not from creating, but from seeing the joy creating gives to others.  All Edward wants to be is accepted, especially by Kim (Winona Ryder).  His art is a means to an end.  Through a series of tragedies however, Edward moves from celebrity to has-been to criminal. Eventually forced to flee domestic life, he wreaks havoc on the local townspeople, destroying the work he created and thereby inciting the town to riot.  At the end of the film, he is left alone, creating in solitude, designing ice sculptures to the one woman he has loved, and yet can never have.The film's theme of a misunderstood genius who only wants to be loved is certainly unoriginal.  What is interesting is that it is imbibed with meaning by a filmmaker whose own life mirrors that of its protagonist. Burton's quirky early work (""Frankenweenie,"" ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"", ""Beetlejuice"") became art-house successes that led to commercial success and paved the way for 1989's ""Batman,"" a critical and commercial blockbuster. Burton never sought the kind of commercial success that ""Batman"" afforded him, going on record in interviews stating that he preferred more personal statements as opposed to the big franchise success a ""Batman"" film would give him -- artifice as opposed to art.  There was obviously an audience primed and ready for Burton's take on the world, however -- both his Batman films, ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and even ""Edward Scissorhands"" were critical and commercial successes.  But, like Edward in the film, it is only a period of time before a misunderstood genius becomes just that -- misunderstood.  Thus both Burton's next two films -- ""Ed Wood,"" an homage to the brilliant (or brilliantly insane, take your pick) director, and ""Mars Attacks!"" -- were commercial duds, the second resoundingly so.  The artist had apparently fallen out of favor with the public, refusing to do a third ""Batman"" film or simply grind out ""hits"".  With ""Sleepy Hollow,"" Burton seems to have regained a measure of the audience's approval without sacrificing his values.The fear of any filmmaker, or any artist, is the audience's approval, or lack thereof.  Any artist who creates for a mass audience relies on that audience to keep him funded, particularly in the film industry, where you are only as good as your last film's box office receipts.  Sooner or later, if your films lose money for the studios, you will find yourself without the opportunity to create, and although you could shoot on Super-8 for your family, if you have the drive to express yourself through film, you want people to be exposed to your work.  The audience however is frequently blown by opposing and contradictory winds -- what is popular this month is next month's old news.  The audience for Edward's work in ""Scissorhands"" is initially intrigued by his eccentric designs, then turned off by them as new fads come along (Edward asks Meg's brother Kevin to play ""rocks scissors paper,"" to which Kevin replies, ""It's boring!"").  When a filmmaker dares to put across a piece of personal work, the rejection of the audience is even harder to take -- in the film, Edward cannot detach himself from his hands, they are a part of him -- thus when the townspeople reject his work and begin to regard him as a freak, it is incredibly personal, especially for someone who has only sought approval.Yet even in this, the film offers hope.  As the townspeople begin to turn from Edward, Kim begins to see Edward as more than a freak.  She begins to see his heart -- and slowly but steadily falls in love with him.  The most tender moment in the film is when she asks him to hold her, and (in a scene that would be comical in any other film, but here plays as tragically as Romeo losing his Juliet) Edward holds up his ""hands"" and says, ""I can't."" In a moment of trust, she steps past the hands that people once loved but now revere, and puts her arms around him.  What matters is no longer the superficial appreciation of an audience that was never meant to appreciate the work (all they cared about was what it could do for them -- it becomes a sign of status to have hair cut by Edward), but the sincere appreciation of someone who has come behind the work, and loved the man as he is.If the film is a highly personal statement by Mr. Burton about the art and craft of filmmaking, vs. the business and artifice it can breed, it is a powerful one by a director who (at that time) was a top box-office draw of hope that filmmaking could be personal first and foremost, rather than being just a homogenized piece of entertainment.  (The continued success of razzle-dazzle franchises and slam-bang action films must disappoint him.) One however doesn't need to psychoanalyze the film or its director in order to appreciate ""Edward Scissorhands"" as a sweet, aching, poetic look at love, from the perspective of a young man who, despite his handicap, only wants to be loved the same way as everyone else is.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A highlight of Burton's early career,"I'm not a huge fan of director Tim Burton although I seem to have seen all of his movies over the years aside from his early shorts and his most recent couple of offerings. I saw EDWARD SCISSORHANDS years ago and liked it for the fairy tale ambiance and allegoric story about being an outsider and the search for acceptance into society.Watching it nowadays, I'm pleased to report that EDWARD SCISSORHANDS holds up a lot more than Burton's contemporary work like BEETLEJUICE. It's a film which is sentimental without ever being sickening, and oddly heart-warming in places. It's not a perfect film because I found the depiction of suburban America to be too derivative and over the top to work (and it's been done far better in the likes of THE STEPFORD WIVES and even DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES). The supporting performances are over the top and the less I saw of Winona Ryder's supposedly sweet love interest the better.Still, there's good stuff here too. Johnny Depp is good, there's no denying it; he's hidden inside his character and playing it quite subdued without any of the annoying attention-seeking that would come to blight his career. The cameo from old-timer Vincent Price is heart-warming and oddly upsetting given how close to death he was at the time of filming. I enjoyed the darkness and tragedy inherent in the storyline and the ending is particularly strong. Watch out for former geek Anthony Michael Hall, now unrecognisable playing a jock - what a change!",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
The Most Cathartic Cinematic Experience (Maybe) Ever,"Tim Burton appreciation month, starting with this jewel. This film hides in my brain as a very far and out of focus memory; a nostalgic, comfortable memory. Of course, I did not remember anything from my first watch, if not just a frame. I honestly didn't expect to love this film so much as I apparently did; Tim Burton and I never seemed to get along, though I always appreciated and admired his creativity and the messages and themes he deals with his films.I didn't expect to cry this much. This was a really introspective and nostalgic watch, maybe, and I'm not exaggerating, the most cathartic cinematic experience I've ever had. I understood things and details and themes that I couldn't understand, realizing and realizing and realizing, remembering, through the feelings and situations represented on the screen, the hurdles of Edward, the things I was going through as a kid and still am going through. I reckon this as the best Depp performance. I saw myself in the character, in the smirks, in his eyes. It's films like this that remind me of the power of cinema, an experience so strong that I still feel the tears on my cheeks (the score made the tears fall, remember!)
Lost it in the final ten minutes. An ending where every feeling you can possibly feel haunts you and drives you crazy; where everything seems to go wrong for Edward and there's no turning back anymore, where the last thing you can do is finally express your true feelings for the person standing right in front of you but you can't even do that because you're tired of being misunderstood, so there's silence and your voice doesn't seem to come out... but all of a sudden you realize that there's no time left... and you kiss her.Everything's magical and nostalgic and strangely normal in Tim Burton's neighbourhood, where prejudice doesn't seem to prevail when you accidentally see a man whose hands are scissors.

Didn't like it as much as I used to,Not sure why but this was probably my third watch of this movie since it's release in 1990. I remember when it first came out this was a mind blowing crazy good and a little sad movie.I think Burton's cheese factor is appealing and I get it but for some reason this movie felt dated when I watched it. It wasn't because of graphics or bad acting or anything. It's very possible I just was in the wrong frame of mind when watching it.The idea of a guy with scissors for hands seems pretty out there.

Pretty good.,"The performances are great, I'm sure the cast have done everything Tim Burton asked of them and it was easy enough.Edward Scissorhands is a beautiful fairytale, for sure. And it should be viewed upon as such. But at times this film gets a lot more corny than it should be (imho ofcourse). All the scenes where Edward does his ""magic"" with bushes, neighbors' hairstyles and dogs look exactly like that - him moving his hands around while leaves, hair and flakes of fur fly around him in enormous amounts. Makes you feel almost as if it's a kids movie or even a cartoon, which it isn't, I don't think (?). Otherwise, stylistically it is not bad at all.I remember when I first saw this film (at the age of about 6) I cried myself to sleep because of how tragic Edward's fate was. Rewatching it now, as an adult, I didn't feel but rather acknowledged the tragedy. Which isn't necessarily Edward's fault, sometimes throught the film Johnny Depp makes you feel genuine compassion for him. But mostly it's just a fun character to observe.One thing I like about this movie is how Burton made it pretty easy for the viewer to connect with Edward, who we know nothing about and might not even be human, but, nevertheless, is adorable. And how Burton made it even easier to despise the villagers, who marginalize Edward any way they possibly could. Something Woody Allen also does great I think, the director has a lot of characters throughout different films who are so easy to hate. Imo it take a lot of cleverness from both the director and the actors to achieve this effect.Edward Scissorhands could've been a masterpiece, but unfortunately it's not.

He is a visual genius who can create unique images and weave a great story into all of it.The story follows Edward Scissorhands. He was created by an inventor who lives in a castle, but was never given hands because the inventor died before he could finish him. He was uncompleted, but had scissors as hands(hence the name ""Edward Scissorhands""). One day, a local woman finds him and brings him home. She tries to teach Edward the normal ways of their suburban life, but he has a hard time fitting in. He discovers a talent for trimming hedges into shapes, and later he discovers a talent for grooming. Despite being useful for these types of things, he isn't looked at in a positive light by the local neighbors. Edward tries and tries, but finds it very hard to fit in with the everyone else.This is a great film. One can easily look at the cover and think it's a weird film, but you have to really look beyond the oddness and realize the great message and great story that is being told.The cast is great, with an exceptional performance by Johnny Depp. Anthony Michael Hall makes a different turn with his acting and image. In Weird Science and The Breakfast club, he plays the nerdy character. In this, he plays the tough guy character who is more of a nerd torturer.There are a lot of moving moments in this movie. There is also an underlying love story, and there's a great message about looking beyond someone's surface and looking deep inside to realize what they are really like.Like Tim Burton's other films, this is a visual treat to look at. Every shot is like magic, the way everything looks is fantastic. Every moment in this film is great, and many of the moments are very moving.The film is dark, like Tim Burton's other films, but at the same time, it is a beautifully told story, and it even has some underlying humor.This is easily one of Tim Burton's best films. If you want to see more great films by Tim Burton, I recommend Beatle Juice, Batman, and The Nightmare Before Christmas.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Pure Beauty.,"This movie is just beautiful. I grew up thinking that I was always different, so I really started to care for Edward from the beginning. Understanding every feeling he was feeling and just wanting to be ""normal"" like everybody else. This movie has amazing acting, but Johnny Depp really stood out. He barely says anything but you can tell so much from just looking in to his eyes. That is great acting right there. Tim Burton's style of making movies is very interesting and fun to watch, and that is one of the reasons for this movie to be as great as it was. The message from this movie is just beautiful and it really made me cry. I am defiantly showing this movie for my future kids, so they can take part of this extraordinary cinematic experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Tim Burtons film- Edward Scissorhands,"I have just seen this film, for the very first time, and would like to say that it is a truly amazing film. I loved, it made me cry and laugh. Tim Burton is one of the most talented directors i have ever come across, i have loved all his films that i have seen, and this one was not an exception. I like the way how it is about a boy who is trying to fit in, and wants to fit in, but no matter how hard he tries to try and put his differences aside he can't, it relates to anyone who has ever felt left out at school or anywhere else. I would recommend this film to anyone, because without a doubt you will also love it too. I hope you have found this comment useful, and next time you come across this film in a video shop or for sale pick it up and buy it, you won't regret it!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Visually wonderful but emotionally a little hollow,"On her rounds in suburbia, Avon lady Peg Boggs spots the old castle at the end of the street that she has never sold to.  Upon inspection she meets a young man who lives alone in the castle since the death of his creator.  He is a normal boy with the exception that his creator never finished him and in place of hands he has scissors.  Peg brings Edward to live with them. Suburbia greets him with curiosity at first then open arms when Edward's scissors turn out to be a gift when it comes to cutting hedges or hair.  As Edward begins to fall for Peg's daughter Kim, the community slowly begin to revert to fear of the different.Considering recently that he failed to really bring any spark of imagination or wonder to Plant of the Apes, it is worth remembering the impact that directors including Burton had and what they did.  Burton brought his own brand of weirdness to the mainstream cinema and must be given some credit for it's continued place in the cinema.  Of course I do not say he was a trailblazer but his style is quite unique in some respects.  Here he owes a nod of respect to David Lynch as it is he who's suburban picture Burton seems to have modelled his own town, although Burton gives his a much more surreal twist and fairytale naivety.  The community seems to be standalone as opposed to part of a large city and a castle stands at one end of the street  supposedly unnoticed!  The visual design of the film and the unique feel are the main reason to watch this film  it is full of invention as well as well staged cliché.  It's hard to describe but the suburbia-hell design are at once instantly recognisable but also inspired, visually everything has a wonderful `other-worldly' feel to it while still being very real.The plot is pure twisted fairy tale and is really a tale of the odd-one-out teenager if you pare it down to it's bones.  It allows for much in the way of strange humour and strange happenings but it doesn't totally succeed to bring enough emotion out of the plot.  It has the odd moment here and there which is touching but really Edward is too weird for us to totally get behind  I found myself supporting him but still with a edge of not really getting him.  Because so much is made of his appearance and his hands I didn't know much about him and therefore couldn't really feel a lot with him.Depp is good but is partly to blame for keeping Edward as a thin character, although not many other actors would have even tried to do it so fair play. He is amusing and few people can do weird like he does.  Ryder is good as the all-American cheerleader but the real wealth is in the support cast. The support is made up of a list of suburbia stereotypes all exaggerated for humour.  Wiest is strong in her role and I found Arkin to be absolutely hilarious in everything he did!Overall the film looks fantastic and this is enough to justify watching it. It is quite funny and is also weird enough to sustain the interest.  Only where it needs real emotion or a strong heart does the film feel a little hollow and incomplete  just like Edward himself.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

"Burton's unrefined, unmatched masterwork","Tim Burton has an easy time creating sets and atmospheres that spring right from the bowels of his imagination, but he often has a more difficult time humanizing the eccentricities of his specific creations. With Edward Scissorhands that problem doesn't exist. Burton has successfully created his most personal story yet, combining true human emotion with characters that at first seem to be basic parodies of themselves. This kind of approach could've been fluffy and condescending, but Burton and screenwriter Caroline Thompson's maturity prevails over all.The film tells the story of Edward (Johnny Depp), a young boy who lives in a mountaintop Gothic mansion with the man who invented him. However, because the inventor died before giving Edward a pair of hands, Edward has hands that are long, metal, and sharp, rendering him as forever incomplete or unfinished. Far below the mountaintop is pure-whitebread surburbia, where everything is plain and colorful. It's a miraculous look in the way of set-design and architecture. One day, a local Avon representative named Peg Boggs (Dianne Wiest) is traveling through the neighborhood and ventures up the mountaintop to solicit to whoever is living there. When she finds Edward, shy, pale, and lonesome, she takes him home to live with her husband and two children so that he can have the feeling of a real family.Edward is clearly an outcast in this suburban wonderland, until he discovers that he has a talent for hedge-trimming and yardwork thanks to his scissor-hands. He makes something of a hobby going around the neighborhood and cutting everyone's hedges into a beautiful sculpture. But when Edward finally meets Peg's beautiful daughter Kim (Winona Ryder), he begins to have feelings far beyond any he has ever had before. It's unfortunate, however, that Kim is dating Jim (Anthony Michael Hall), a narcissistic and hopelessly arrogant man who belittles Edward despite his charm and kind-spirits.Johnny Depp is likely the only person who could play Edward Scissorhands to the full extent, without channeling self-parody or unnecessary childishness. Depp is one of the only actors working today who chooses many ""one of a kind"" roles, meaning he can't go back to older films to see how another person played a character. And if even he could, like with Burton's later film Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, he still infuses so much creativity and personal-preference into the character that any shred of a carbon-copy is unrecognizable. Depp gives Edward enough leverage emotionally and personally to make him likable and a worthy protagonist.Winona Ryder works extremely well in the picture as well, working far beyond any pretty-girl notion that one would suspect from someone like her. There is a masterful scene in the film where Edward is sculpting a giant statue out of ice, shredding it at rapid speed, causing light flaky-snow to fall down. It is the first time the suburban neighborhood has seen snow or anything like it and right below Edward is Kim, basking in the falling snow as majestically as a teen girl could. The scene is warm and presents one of the nicest films in any film Burton has done.But ultimately, the themes of discovery, isolation, conformity, and ignorance take full presence in Edward Scissorhands. The character of Edward is a perfect one, indeed, and the setting for the story - a plastic suburban village - is perfect as well for a story like this to be told. Suburban areas are often conducted in a certain fashion, where everything is done a specific, orderly way and no questions are asked. There's little room for difference mainly because the elements of predictability and control are so heavily capitalized. The character of Edward shows an initial suburban area's reaction to a harmless, but different character, who proudly refuses conformity and a melting-pot lifestyle simply by getting by with what he has. While stories emphasizing originality and uniqueness aren't uncommon in movies, it's stunning to see a story like this portrayed in mainstream cinema so boldly, emotionally, and effectively. The case of conformism and being your own person is amplified so differently here just by the choice of character and supporting characters that it creates an astonishingly working blend of craft.Edward Scissorhands is, in fact, Burton's masterwork, clearly personal, richly detailed, and aesthetically beautiful in many regards.Starring: Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Dianne Weist, and Anthony Michael Hall. Directed by: Tim Burton.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A sweet film even with dark style,"Rating-9/10Edward Scissorhands, a Tim Burton movie boasting heart, humour and Gothic design, not exactly one film that isn't unique. This is the kind of film that really tugs on the heart but in a way that isn't really sad, Edward is just so sweet(even though he looks kind of dangerous), but the whole point here is that we shouldn't judge based on what someone looks like, a nice message and one I feel Burton gets across well.The story actually doesn't move that fast, and although things happen, the location is pretty much just one street all the way through. I found Edward to be the person who makes this funny, his new surroundings gives him such a playground of fun, it makes for great scenes. I think really when it comes to the plot it's hard to talk about it in length as mentioned, this really doesn't move much, although definitely fun though.Johnny Depp is Edward and he portrays him well, at times he can seem shaky but that is the thing, Edward is meant to seem awkward and very scared looking, so Depp get's him off to a tee. With the others in this movie none shine more than Depp which works well as he is the star, the acting isn't all top notch but the cast such as Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, and Alan Arkin give it a good go and all work together well with Depp and the awkward personality he gives off.Tim Burton is truly the man behind this and near all the credit for this needs to go to him, he writes it well but directs it even better, he seems to know exactly what he needs to do and his eye on this is perfect. I think the trademark style of Gothic design coupled with the just overly dark/light juxtapositions make for an interesting watch, it's the kind of movie that is fairly interesting to look at, it should make most enjoy it, but if not, at least engaged.The emotion that flows through this is very high, I mean Edward isn't exactly the sweetest character ever but it is hard not to like him and he is an extremely intriguing creation too. Again Burton seems to mix that sweet centre with a beautifully dark humour/story, it of course is a film that the family can all watch, but it still contains those more dark themes in the comedy even, but never to the extreme.Yet again another thing that makes this just awesome is the score, the ever on form Danny Elfman creates a fantastic piece of music and really shows his credentials off well. The way in which the story moves also works well with Elfman's creation, the parts where very little happens but there is a lot of comedy, the score only goes to make this not only more fun, but also create a more emotional experience.All in all this has to rank as one of Burton's best if not right at the top, this is done oh so well and created in a fashion where you just know, this is top quality. It's not in my opinion hard to dislike though, I think many will feel the style is not to there liking and the story for some may be a slight bit dull but in my opinion, they are neither and this finishes with a unique storyline to boot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Confusion towards ""Edward Scissorhands""","NO SPOILERS!!!!Can someone please explain to me how the movie got an overall rating so high on both IMDb (8.0/10.0) and Netflix (3.8/5.0)? I just can't fathom it. The birds eye view at the beginning was very noticeably a mini model set, the make-up was noticeably make up instead of ""real"" looking, the dialog was on the nose (but not over the top, making it now work. It worked in ""The Truman Show"", but here, it failed), and the entire story- line, although timeless, didn't bring out the TRUE mood and spirit of snow. Unlike what Cameron does with classic tales and what Burton usually does nowadays to tales, I felt NO new eye to this tale at all. I felt that on the contrary it was turned on its head when brought forward.Can someone please share with me something I'm missing, and don't bring up the ""It was meant to be fake"" card, because if ""The Truman Show"" can be purposely fake AND brilliant in doing so, I'm sure Burton could have too.Hope I'm not angering anyone. I'm just VERY confused and disappointed. :/",4.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Unbelievable,"I watched this movie long time ago, not long after it was filmed, when I had about 10 years, and I loved it. But of course at that time I liked many movies and cartoons, that I don't like anymore at all. So recently I decided to watch this movie again, even though I was expecting disappointment. But it didn't happen. This is one of the rare movies that I liked then, and I still love now - I only have forgotten how good it really was - to me maybe even better now then it was before. It's just a beautiful story. Some people said that this is totally unrealistic film. Of course it is! What did you expect? It's not supposed to be realistic. Why should it be explained how exactly was he created? Does The lord of the rings explain where exactly is middle earth supposed to be? It's also not supposed to be a comedy or horror, it is just supposed to be a story, a story so touching that my eyes got wet many times in the film. It's also a moral film that teaches you shouldn't judge others by the way they look. But most of all it is a love story - pure and innocent love that happens so rarely. He couldn't even touch her, but he would do anything for her - even let her go... When Edward says that he knew it was Bill's house all along and then Kim asked; ""so why did you do it then?"" and he answers: ""because you said so"". This part of movie really blew me away.

Typical Strangeness From Tim Burton.,"Johnny Depp is brought to an odd town after being discovered by cosmetic salesperson Dianne Wiest in this whacked film that could only be made by Tim Burton. Depp is really a robot who looks human except for his scissorhands. The typical mean-spirited direction and self-indulgence takes place by Burton as once again he turns an interesting idea into a trivial cinematic experience. A good cast which includes Winona Ryder, Alan Arkin, Anthony Michael Hall and Vincent Price get lost in the mess. 2 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
It was OK,"This was fine. I'm not sure why It's considered a classic though.
I mean, there are better movies with the same story (It's basically the same as Pinnoccio or any one of a dozen Frankenstein versions).
There are better movies with a similar visual style (Nightmare Before Christmas and others).
All in all, not bad, but there are better things to watch during movie night, including better things similar to this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Burton's untouchable.,"Some movies will never have an equal, some just shine above the rest untouched by everything else. Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands is one of those. The cast is great with Johnny Depp as Edward Scissorhands and Vincent Price as his creator (and also in his last role ever). Edward is an artificial human who was perfect in almost every way, left unfinished by the untimely death of his creator, only known as The Inventor, with scissors for hands. After living by himself for awhile, Edward is discovered and taken home to experience a world outside of The Inventor's lab and thus begins his adventures. Edward's fable is told like a children's story, starting off with a child lying in bed and the grandma telling her about where the snow comes from. Tim Burton shows his imagination at its best here. While The Nightmare Before Christmas was really good, Edward Scissorhands still stands as his strongest film. If any of Burton's movies are to go down as classics this will be the one. Brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Edward Scissorhands,"This was such an excellent movie. I'd say one of Tim Burton's best, actually. It kept you interested throughout the whole film. One of Johnny Depp's best performances. Throughout the whole movie, I kept thinking, ""I feel really bad for Edward. I feel really bad for what he gets into and all that."" All and all, I really think that this is one of the best films I have ever seen. I've seen what kind of movies Tim Burton makes and this is just one of them. It's funny, it's creepy, it's sort of Gothic in a way, but what I mean is, it really sums up what the movie should be like. Burton's personality fits the film perfectly. Also, Johnny Depp's acting style. I think this is a good role for Johnny. He makes Edward look so innocent and caring, when the character actually already is. It's really great acting. Johnny just portrays the character so well. It's perfect, really.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Far From Tim's Best,"Tim Burton's work was a bit of a rite of passage for me as a kid. Discovering his work was like being set free after years of feeling like a complete outcast that nobody ever understood. Tim, it felt like at the time, knew me, and his films gave me what I needed to get through my earlier years.Edward Scissorhands, however, slipped through the cracks. It wasn't because it wasn't accessible - anyone who's been alive in the last 20+ years knows that it's been on TV intermittently since the day it came out on video - but rather, something within me just never really felt the desire to watch it.Today, I sat myself down and I watched Edward Scissorhands. Once and for all. To see how it held up.Yikes.Danny Elfman did the music, and he's once again at the top of his game with his film. He has a high quality filter on his work, and only the best gets out into the public and his work on this film is certainly no exception. The score is easily a highlight.
A lot of the jokes in this film land as well, making this a genuinely laugh-out-loud funny movie when it wants to be.
Also, this is a beautiful film in terms of the camera work. In the HD restoration, the colors absolutely pop and everything comes through beautifully vibrant and appealing. Although my upcoming thoughts may not be so flattering, through it all I couldn't help but watch the screen as a direct result of the camera work done on the film. I'm watching the Disney+ HD master.Now, this is a movie I had more issues with than I could possibly adequately put into words. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Edward Scissorhands is awkward and uncomfortable at best and, although it's probably the intention, he's actually annoyingly awkward. It took me out of the movie multiple times because Depp tries way too hard to be the awkward youth adapting to life in the real world. It wasn't a bad performance in a lot of moments but, when it took a turn, it went down real quick.
There's also no chemistry between him and Winona Ryder, another actor who I have great admiration for. She came in more as an afterthought than anything else, coming in around the halfway point, and it's not until toward the end of the film that we get any kind of the iconic love-story scenes that have become iconic from the film. It felt like they needed some images for promotion and they added those moments because the film was just too lame to support any sufficient advertising material.
This was also a wildly uncomfortable film to watch. The fact that we had grown women getting haircuts by a youth with scissors for hands and getting a very obvious sexual thrill from it was nothing short of disgusting, and the notion of an adult woman forcing herself on a younger man, only to turn around and spin a story of having been raped by said man, will never be remotely funny or entertaining in the slightest.
Also, without spoilers, the ending of this movie is probably the lowest point of the movie. It spends its time building up to something, only to have that thing happen and it just be over, just like that. It's hard to tell if it was because that was what Tim Burton intended or if it was a budget reason, but the film feels very sloppy in the story-telling.The old saying goes that the early work you do isn't going to be all that great, but that you improve as time goes on, but for Tim, it seems to not quite be the case. Beetlejuice came out in 1988, which was the closest to perfection we'll ever get on film (starring Winona Ryder in a much stronger, more charismatic and interesting role), then this movie was a major dip in quality, and he would rebound to make some of the most beloved films of all time following this. Edward Scissorhands is a definite skip in my opinion.Some people have drawn similarities between this film and the controversial Powder (1995), blaming director Victor Salva of having ripped off Edward Scissorhands. I disagree. While some elements may have been seemingly lifted from this film (particularly toward the beginning), Powder is a much more entertaining, engaging, sympathetic and emotional film, and one I highly recommend over this one.Skip Edward Scissorhands.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Beautiful but rough life!,"I would consider this one of the best Tim Burton's movies ever! Why? It has a little bit of everything. People may think, after hearing the name of Tim Burton, that his movies are too much filled with fantasy and things that has nothing to do with life. That all of them are quite alike because almost in every Burton's movie you can see Johnny Depp's face. But you know what I would say to those people? - Have you seen more than too Burton's movies? And I wouldn't be surprised to hear answer - no! Because if you have seen many Burton's movies you can agree with me at this - each and every movie, keeping it's fantasies level still is different from each other in a great way. Even though you see Depp's appearance in many movies, they're still not the same. And it's the same with this movie - Edward Scissorhands. The small town, where the movie takes place, is so colorful, so not real kind of stylish and that's maybe the thing that makes us think - what the hell are we watching? But at the moment when you see Edward, everything changes. From the looks of him, you would think he is rough, ugly and bad, bad character. But after few moments you understand that he is the innocent, sweet, mild and sensitive thing! All his life has been outsiders life. Living up on the hill, all by himself. Spending each day like the other. When he's brought down to the little town, he actually realizes the beauty of the outer world. But still not understanding how rough can it be. How it can judge you, not even knowing you. I think this movie shows us better than the others, how rough the life is. How senseless people can be. The true feelings about this film isn't writable.

One of Burton's best,"Very entertaining modern fairy tale about a beautiful but not quite human young man--he looks like a glam rock star as drawn by Edward Gory--cursed with scissors (giant shears, rather) for hands, who wants to fit with ordinary people but ultimately can't. The suburban setting is almost as strange as Edward himself: Burton takes its familiar kitsch and exaggerates just enough so the banal becomes surreal, and charming. The most entertaining sequences are those with Edward interacting with the neighbourhood housewives who make a sort of pet of him when he shows just how skillful his hands can be by trimming first their topiary,then their hair into exotic shapes (is there some kind of erotic subtext going on here about the unfulfilled longings of desperate housewives? Edward is definitely sexier than any of their husbands, and one of the women, a Peg Bundy lookalike, does blatantly attempt to seduce him). But inevitably Edward accidentally harms someone with these same scissorhands, the neighbourhood quickly turns against him, and Edward ends up back in hiding at the old Hollywood style haunted castle whence he came.The only element of the movie that doesn't really work is Winona Ryder who plays Edward's dream girl and is supposed to be magic. Ryder has been magic in other movies such as Beetlejuice and Great Balls of Fire, but she looks miscast here in a cheerleader's uniform and brassy blonde wig. (She is somewhat amusing in the opening scene where she's aged about by fifty years and reading a fairytale to her granddaughter).All in all, worth adding to a permanent collection of DVDs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Review of Edward Scissorhands,"I first seen this film when I was 4 or 5 years old and loved it ever since. I have watched it many times and it never gets old. Easily one of Johnny Depp's best films and definitely Tim Burton's best. One of the things that makes this movie so great is the feeling you get about Edward that we all have from time to time of being left out or not feeling comfortable around others because we are different, and also it has great acting and a very sad ending. Winona Ryder's character also plays a brilliant role as the girl that wants Edward and vice versa, but she can't have him because of her mean and hateful boyfriend who does not like Edward at all. A great masterpiece! I highly recommend this movie! 10/10 stars!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
What Could I Say About Edward Scissorhands?,"This movie is a Christmas favorite. It probably is more Halloweenish, but it's a good go between. This is probably one of Depp's best and most well known characters. It's a really sweet and fun film. It has a happy family tone, and does a terrific job all the way through.The movie is about a machine/man born with scissors for hands. His creator dies, and a makeup salesman finds him in the mansion years and years later. She brings him to the real world, and he falls in love with her daughter. He becomes the toast of the town, but the jealous people end up isolating him once again. He retreats back to his mansion alone at the end.It's a great film for the reasons mentioned above. It has a gloomy atmosphere to it, but it doesn't get creepy. The normal town is also very fun to watch. You feel like you want to be a part of it. It's a great film worth watching during the holiday season.7 stars",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Tim Burton's finest,"Edward Scissorhands is an emotional and often hysterical fable that captures our need to feel accepted and loved by the society we live in.The plot depicts Edward, a creation who, with scissors in the place of hands, is isolated from the town of Suburbia, until a kind and generous Avon lady befriends him and welcomes into their neighbourhood and home. However as Edward's time in the town continues, his individuality creates both triumph and tragedy for him and his new family.The acting in Edward Scissorhands is superb. Without much dialogue, Johnny Depp provides a career-defining performance as honest and vulnerable outsider trying to belong, while Vincent Price, Dianne Wiest and Kathy Baker offer tremendous support.The romance between Edward and Kim (a slightly disappointing Winona Ryder) is extremely genuine, powerful and appreciated by varying members of society.This leads to the powerful and beautifully created ending is one that is tear-inducing yet heart-warming.The final piece to the perfect and poignant puzzle is the complex art that is the direction of genius Tim Burton, and his vision that is carefully portrayed in the chilling score, attractive set and realistic screenplay of this one-of-a-kind feature.Sad one moment and hysterical the next, Edward Scissorhands is an emotional, colourful and enjoyable storybook-like film that pleases it's audience over and over again.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Fantastic Story,I liked it but in the first part was not much going on. The second part was so emotional and sentimental that I had nearly tears in my eyes. Johnny Depp did a very good job and the soundtrack is wonderful.Worth watching for the whole family for Christmas time. My wife and I give 6.5/10. Perhaps a little bit overrated on IMDb.,6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Typical Tim Burton,"You have a cool premise, a colorful presentation and great music, but everything else - especially the writing and characters - sucks.So Edward is a sweet, lone Frankenstein's monster who lives in a castle. He gets ""adopted"" by an unrealistically trustworthy and caring woman who lives on the most colorful street where the most bland, generic, horny housewives also live.Her daughter is a an annoying teenage girl who treats Edward badly and gets him into trouble constantly, yet in the end her cartoonishly antagonistic boyfriend is the one turned into a cringeworthy villain who must be ""dealt with"".She enabled all the bad things her boyfriend did and treated Edward badly but of course, somehow she's all good in the end, and as expected from the first scene Edward sees a picture of her - becomes his love interest.None of this makes any sense, has any comedic or romantic value or is even remotely well written. Like I said, aside from the cool main character idea, visual presentation and great music, the plot itself, and the characters even more so are terrible.",1.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
I'll never look at scissors the same again,"This movie utterly changed my life. It was just so beautiful, the scenery, the make up, the writing, the music, everything. The acting too, especially Johnny, Winona, and Diane were the best. Johnny only had a few lines but he let his eyes say everything. Winona was perfect for this suburban school girl role. Diane nailed her caring suburban mom part perfectly. Also, the neighbors were chosen perfectly for their parts. This movie inspired so much emotion and you'll find yourself getting an emotion attachment to it. I was depressed and bawling about that bittersweet ending, I found myself adoring Edward like I would an old friend, and I relate to so many of the characters and some of the situations they were in. For the first time it made me genuinely grateful for my hands. I can honestly say that this movie changed my life, and my outlook on it. Its changed my perception on how I see other people and how I judge character. You'll never understand what I mean until you see the movie. If you are a girl or a sensitive guy you'll probably be bawling like a baby afterwords. We need more people like Edward in the world.

A GRAND FAIRY TALE,"Tim Burton (Batman, Ed Wood) Does a marvelous job at telling a tale of such haunting beauty. The film Is called ""Edward Scissorhands"" The title alone should tell you what you're about to embark on. The story is a modern fairy tale about a character, Edward (Johnny Depp) who was made from the heart of a cookie by  the inventor played by non other then the legendary Vincent Price. He starts out by making Edward out of a cutting machine. The Inventor never finished which left Edward alone and with scissors for hands. I'm guessing the story takes place maybe 20 to 30 years from that point, and we find an Avon lady, Mrs. Boggs (Diane Wiest), unsuccesfully trying to sell her make up. She works up the courage to try and sell to an old abandon mansion that no one ever goes to.This is where we meet Edward. This is when the story gets interesting. The genius of Burton's direction that he does with Johnny and the score that his pal Danny Elfman draws out is fascinating. You get a gothic sense of beauty. You can learn so many things from this story. One paticular lesson I took to heart was from the town people and how they took Edward in and used him and threw him away. He wasn't treated like a person. As a result, he was taken advantage of. In the end the person who didn't accept him in the beginning will be the one that finally excepts him in the end. I recommend this movie to everyone 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Sad, Strong, Unsteady","Edward is a rare kind of movie.  But then, it's been said that Tim Burton is a rare kind of director, and I'm happy to say it's the truth.  From the glaring pastels and stripes of Suburbia to the dark, melancholy grounds of The Master's castle, we get to see a story of contrasts and comparisons, a look at the human in the monster and the monster in all of us.  There's a serious moral here.  And that, in the end, is a problem I have with this movie--it's very heavy-handed and allegorical.  As the movie concludes, the viewer is smacked by hatred and coincidences that turn the world against the 'monster' that is Edward; you watch as even with all the love in the world, things simply don't always work out.  The closing is possibly one of the saddest things I've ever seen in my life, and I've seen a lot.  Johnny Depp pulls in a startling performance as Ed, and there's cameos by the Master Of The Macabre, the late Vincent Price.  Not a bad flick, no, but nothing I long to see repeatedly.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
BEST TIM BURTON FILM,"Johnny Depp is known to be an exceptional actor depicted in Tim Burton films. Hence, this is by far the best one of all. Though he plays his character in Sleepy Hollow fairly well, the Edward character comes together because of Johnny. Had it been any other actor, my perspective would have been significantly altered. Alongside the character, Kim embodies Winona. She does an exceptional job at getting her character's message across. Tim burton is just a genius in general but this film really does prove it. Edwards's character is extremely creative and the way they transform Johnny into a man with full-on scissors as hands is amazing. Ten out of ten film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Poor Edward.,"Johnny Depp is superb as Edward Scissorhands, an orphaned creation of a kindly inventor(Vincent Price, wonderful)who died before he could fit hands onto Edward, who has continued to live on alone in a castle on top of a hill until an Avon lady finds him, and takes him home to her bewildered family(Husband played by Alan Arkin, and daughter played by Winona Ryder) At first, the neighbors are fascinated by Edward, who performs various tasks(like hairdressing and shrub-pruning) until an arrogant bully(played by Anthony Michael Hall) starts to make trouble, and soon almost everyone turns against Edward, who must flee...Well-directed(by Tim Burton) fable about social acceptance vs. social alienation, based mostly on appearances and what's considered ""normal"" is endearing and clever, though dramatically uneven, and at times(intentionally?) tacky. Still, hard to dislike such a good-hearted film with a moving finale.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Beautiful tragic story,"This movie is gorgeous, one of the best looking tim burton movies. Johnny depp is killing it in this role, and the whole film has an almost fairytale mythic feel. There is a lot of fun gags with the scissors, and this movie blends its seriousness and its comedy very well. There is kind of an underlying theme about handicap people and how society treats then which I dodnt catch on previous viewings but that's probably because I was to young. Great movie I would recommend to anyone.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Edward Scissorhands (1990) Dark and comical,"Edward Scissorhands presents us with an excellent story of the rise and fall of an individual who has never received so much attention. Edward (Johnny Depp) is different from the rest of that superficial neighborhood, with superficial architecture and superficial lives. The character appears as a change in the lives of all those people. Now the neighborhood comes to life, a pleasant and special look. In fact, this is how Edward is seen by most residents, a special boy. However, he is also seen with eyes of interest by everyone around him. He is seen as a commodity by some and as a sexual figure by others. For those who hate him, he is a joke or sent by the devil to destroy people's lives. When Edward experiences his rise, everyone treats him like an angel, a celebrity and a blessing. However, when a series of disastrous events occur, Edward is seen as an evil figure. Society makes him feel special and then lets go of his hand without understanding what actually happened. Society only accepts each person's differences if, in some way, that person brings them some benefit.The novel has a wonderful development that happens little by little. Each scene shown parallel to his past makes us realize that Edward has a genuine love for humanity, the same one that caused his downfall. Love doesn't just exist between two characters. Love exists from Edward to the world.Edward Scissorhands is one of my favorite films of all time. The magic that each scene and each musical note manages to convey is simply perfect. It's a film that is often comical and fun, but other times it becomes sad and dark. He who one day came out of the darkness and received looks he never received before tends to return to the darkness again, because society does not accept differences if they do not help it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
absolutely brilliant,this film is my all time favourite every time i watch it it puts a lump in my throat. It is so touching just the way that Edward (Johnny Depp) acts and how lonely he is i would recommend you see this film i almost cried at the end when she told him she loved him and that was all he needed to hear oh by the way Johnny Depp is brilliant in it. Also the music is great it really makes you feel sad it goes very well with what is happening in the film. Johnny Depp is great he really gets to know his character he really is a great actor. you should definitely see this film!,,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
One of the most beautiful stories ever told.,"OK first things first, though this film did move me to tears, it must be said that I am known for films doing this to me. However without Edward Scissorhands I do not believe this would be the case. This film opened me up to the emotions in film and allowed me to be affected in a totally different way than I had ever been before.As a Burtonite I know all of his films well but I consider this to be his masterpiece. This is firstly because many of his films are based around former premises and stories, whereas Scissorhands is all his own work and therefore a real look into the mind of the genius, and secondly because the film is just so good. Incorporating a story that will warm the coldest hearts of any age or gender with a subtle underlying commentary on the prejudiced world in which we live, Burton delivers the film in such a way that anyone from the casual film-goer to the knowledgeable filmbuff can appreciate the film.Johnny Depp's performance is masterful, using very little speech (apparently he only says 169 words in the entire film) he relies mainly on mannerisms and his obvious feel for the character. Without Johnny Depp there would be no Edward Scissorhands, he makes the character almost iconic, also without Edward Scissorhands there would probably be no Johnny Depp, seeing as this film catapulted him into near superstar status. Also worth a mention, the performances of other actors such as Dianne Wiest are well played and engaging and although you may have to suspend your disbelief on various occasions during the film i.e. in the ending sequence with the ice in the attic this is not the case with any of the acting.Finally, the sets in the film that represent a stereotypical American suburb are beautiful as a comparison to Edward's Gothic retreat, and even though they are colourfully painted, Burtons darkness still shines through as they seem ominous and almost carnival like. Edward Scissorhands is a timeless classic which will be enjoyed for generations to come and personally I can't see a single fault in it.*****/*****",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Wildly overrated, but good premise and audiovisual art","This is Burton already in full swing, despite the terrible flaws of the movie that so many people seem to condone.The theme of being different in a conformist society is on point, and the critique to the shallow communities so biting. The visuals are outstanding, as always with Burton, despite a weird heavy usage of green screen. The score is marvelous too, as always with Elfman, which contributes immensely to a total immersion in the movie up to two thirds. Then the final act messes up big time. Absurd behavior and forced events to advance the plot, ending with a murder that nobody seems to care about. Just like poor Edward, the emotions that the movie manages to elicit are left unfinished, without any payoff for the love or retribution for the hate.Great concept, good execution, poor finishing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Just another overrated Burton movie.,"First of all, let me remember that this is the person who directed Planet of the Apes.This is the first collaborations between Johnny Depp and Tim Burton and the start of a long friendship. The intro was very cinematic, but the rest of the movie sadly wasn't.The movie really didn't have a story, it just went on to show how Ed works around a new environment. It has a good but overused moral: Everyone has a special gift, every ""disability"" becomes an advantage and bla bla bla... we've seen that many times.I hated the fact that everyone in town was a douchebag except for the family that adopted Ed. The town made the family look like saints. It was really unrealistic. Like where did he get the giant ice blocks? But the stupidest part of the movie was that the cop in his car couldn't catch Edward running.It started out good, but it ended in clichés.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

"""No matter what, Edward will always be special.""","It's tough now, to look back and imagine a time when Tim Burton was a gothic indie darling and Johnny Depp an enigmatic underexposed young actor, but indeed once they were - and Edward Scissorhands is probably the apex of that time in both their careers. Having not seen it for quite a while, a recent one night cinema showing gave me the opportunity to reappraise it as the jaded adult that I am now.Peggy Boggs (Dianne Wiest) decides to visit the grim dilapidated mansion that towers over the American suburban estate where she resides, as part of her Avon cosmetics round. There she discovers Edward (Depp), a creation of the inventor who previously owned the mansion, who passed away before he could provide Edward with the human hands to replace the scissors that make up his current appendages. Though Edward is initially popular in the suburbs, misunderstanding and prejudice soon start to raise their heads, particularly around Peggy's teenage daughter (Winona Ryder).The film really in unmistakably Tim Burton. The decision to use practical sets and models rather than CGI was a good choice, as the film still looks great. Maybe the aging prosthetics on Ryder in the opening and closing wrap around scenes doesn't look that impressive, given what CG can do there - but that's the exception rather than the rule. There's an unreal fantasy aspect to the town and its looming impossibly stylised mountain range that is beautiful and memorable. The costume and hair design is brilliant too. Danny Elfman's score too is another iconic collaboration with Burton, though he chooses a more orchestral and sweeping pieces here, over the ""Plinky Plonky"" themes he was often providing at the time.The story is a little undercooked, a variation on both ""Frankenstein"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" it could have done with another couple of moments to heighten the believability of the love story, and the way that the town turns on Edward, once he rejects the advances of Kathy Baker's bored housewife. The script though is good and often laugh out loud funny. Alan Arkin steals a lot of the film as Peg's husband, entirely nonplussed about the events going on around him. Vincent Price too, with his glorious cadence is great in his scenes.Sad both in terms of the actual plot and when viewed against the triumvirate of misfires Burton would direct, the lost years of Winona Ryder's career and the eventual overexposure of Depp; ""Edward Scissorhands"" is imperfect but beautiful. Timeless but evocative of that period in Burton's career. Artificial yet genuine and you should definitely see it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Gentle lovechild of Frankenstein's monster and Freddy Krueger,"""Edward Scissorhands"" is a romantic drama about a lonely young man with scissors instead of fingers, who leaves the isolation of the Gothic castle in which he spent his whole life and comes into town among people. The story of isolation, socialization, human hypocrisy, stupidity and fear of everything that is different, but also about sincere friendship, love, and sacrifice. Edward is obviously inspired by Frankenstein's monster, with which he has a lot in common, although this is not a horror, but a warm and sad fairytale, and therefore Edward is also much milder ""monster"". Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder have excellent chemistry, which is understandable considering they were a couple during the shooting of this movie. Besides their love, on the set of this movie the friendship between Depp and Burton was born, and Depp has become a frequent occurrence in Barton's films. Burton rotates the same handful of actors through all his movies, but why would he change a winning combination. Barton's signature is obvious in both the story and the visuals - the film is magical, surreal and a feast for eyes. If you're even remotely sympathetic to Barton's style, ""Edward Scissorhands"" will keep your attention from the beginning to the end and leave you overwhelmed with emotions.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"A Frankenstien-esquire expression of human cruelty, and ultimately love.","One of the most touching films I've seen. Tim Burton did his best work in this Frankenstien-esquire expression of human cruelty, and ultimately love. To bear silent witness to pain, Edward's in this case, is a horrible mistreatment. Edward Scissorhands is a modern Frankestien, misunderstood, and unjustly feared. His only crime was a wish for acceptance, and that simple, simple thing was denied him, as it has been denied to so many others. Through Edward, Tim Burton shows just how cruel and judgmental people can be; but also how a little love, which costs nothing, can make the biggest difference. but forgive me, I get sentimental. Edward Scissorhands is a truly wonderfully movie, and through it, Tim Burton shows that at the end of the day, we can all make a difference.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Strange...But With Heart,"The best thing that ""Edward Scissorhands"" has going for it is that it was directed by Tim Burton, perhaps the only man who could make this story move us. Unfortunately, Burton is also this film's biggest downfall by intermixing his cinematic and stereotype gobbledegook into the overall plot.For a basic plot summary, this film sees a boy named Edward (Johnny Depp), who has scissors instead of normal hands, brought down from his lonely, deserted castle to live in suburbia. After all the appropriate hijinks such a situation perpetuates, Edward falls in love with his new family's daughter Kim (played by Winona Ryder), which only further complicates matters.The reason this isn't an ""instant classic"" despite the never-before-seen concept and compelling visuals? For almost three quarters of the movie, director Burton (as is his style) mishmashes all sorts of stereotypical human themes and doesn't make sense of any of them. It is all just a jumble & mess. It's kind of like ""Being John Malkovich"", in a sense, where the concepts and visuals are the movie, not the actual plot itself.How can I enjoy this movie, then? Because, in the end, it truly is about love and having a big heart. For me, when everything else falls aside and the focus is squarely on Edward & Kim is where this film will move you. Ryder is able to perfectly capture the essence of youthful beauty, while Edward is a character for whom sympathy is a must. Their moments on screen together (combined with a wonderful score from Danny Elfman) are spectacular and worth the viewing time alone.Overall, this is a decent film that will always be remember for its unique concept and title character. Don't try to understand all its message, but instead focus on the human elements: love, family, & hope. If you can do that, you will care about what happens in the end.",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Unique,"So there are lots of good film makers out there. Stars in each genre. Action, drama, romcom, gross out..... Just one simple question What category is Edward Scissorhands in? Tim Burton and his team created something unique. The story at one level is a romance of a girl with an outcast. It is the story of the power of the esoteric over the mundane. It is a parody of the shallowness of 50s America. It shows the surreptitious power of wives over wage slave husbands. It has elements of fairy tale. It has elements of comedy. It has elements of tragedy. They all combine to make a unique, enchanting, stunning, unmissable film. Without a doubt this is top ten movie magic - the man shows his genius here.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Edward Scissorhands-An Endless Classic,"Edward Scissorhands, from Tim Burton, feels like a fairy tale, or a fable, or a dream of some sort. Even today, after 30+ years, it elegantly combines Edward's cold, dark background with lighter elements like love, discovery, family, and self fulfillment. It balances the scary aspects of being lonely for years with the warm relief of finding your place. It has a very mature tone to it as Edward's mind and personality evolve, making him very much relatable today.Edward Scissorhands is more than a movie-it's pure Tim Burton poetry! It's all about a humanoid robot developing a heart that's bigger than him!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
So precious.,"This was one of the most endearing films,
I think,
that has ever been made.The preformances by Johnny Depp and Winona Rider are some of my favorites from both of them.Tim Burton's Gothic style and contrasting was epic.Set in the 1970, it has this incredible ability to make you feel like your transporting back and forth to whole different realms.The castle and suburban area he created made me think of a modern take on the old royals.And as a hairstylist myself, the haircuts and styles were out of this world and absolutely unique. Unlike any other.The story was spell-bounding and heartbreaking.I have watched it countless times, especially around Christmas.His clever reason on why it began to snow was touching.

Bittersweet is the best kind of movie.,"When I was little girl of four, a wonderful movie premiered on the big screen. That movie was called ""Edward Scissorhands"". Having once watched ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" (still as a little four year old) in the dark of night with my parents, the idea of Scissorhands just didn't appeal to me. So for the next fourteen years, I avoided and shied away from every golden opportunity to see the film. I ALWAYS thought it was a horror flick. But one day, as a high school graduate of eighteen, I decided to watch a little bit of it with my mother before heading to work. I fell in love immediately! That little bit I saw was the funniest thing I had viewed in a very long time. I hadn't laughed so hard since I still can't remember when.So during my lunch, I rented the DVD. When I got home late that night, I popped it in right away. And although I still laughed hysterically at my favorite parts (waterbed scene...all-time favorite!), I was almost moved to tears by the end of the film. With the combination of Tim Burton's excellent directing skills and Danny Elfman's heart-wrenching movie score this movie has become one of my very favorites. Because if a movie has a happy ending, I'm upset by it's cliché qualities, and if it has a sad ending, I don't ever want to watch it again, but when a movie has a bittersweet ending, the good and bad emotions I feel are so jumbled that I can't help loving the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Cutting Edge: Brilliant acting Conchata $$$$,"Edward Scissorhands was a beautiful masterpiece.  Never has one felt so connected to Johnny Depp.  His character was very charismatic, and the film was very warm and gave me a sense of security and well-being.But that's enough about Johnny. The true star of this film was Conchata Ferrell by far. Her role as Helen was brilliantly portrayed and ever so realistic. Of course my theory is that Teen Angel is really the high point of her career.  I believe that an actress like Conchata is definitely more suited to roles like Pam on Teen Angel, but before that, this was truly a magnificent early role for her.By the end of this film, I felt more in touch with myself and my feelings for others.  I learnt to understand that cruelty to people is terrible and that when one is shunned by society as I myself am, it helps to see films like this and realise that these movie producers care about more than profits.Edward Scissorhands was, after American Beauty, the best film I have ever seen in my life.  Good work Tim and keep making more films like this one!A 10 out of 10 for this one!!",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A strange sense of wonder,"It took me quite a while to appreciate this film - mostly because I wasn't familiar with Burton's fabulous, overblown proportions and great vision. ""Edward Scissorhands"" was just too weird for me. I am happy to say that it has grown on me - though being far from Burton's later work, such as ""Ed Wood"" or ""Sleepy Hollow"", it is still strikingly original and is a very interesting experience.The tidy, perfect and very unreal suburb in contrast to the dracula-style castle that has somehow been left standing right in the middle of it is just the sort of dreamy juxtaposition that one could expect from Burton. It is a treat to be surprised by it and it feels very novel. The nosy, in-your-face housewives who center their absurd lives around what's going on in the neighborhood are a vital part of this juxtaposition. It makes you wonder which part of this weird place is for real and which isn't. And Edward himself, a bizarre freak whose life is turned upside down by kind and unkind (and just plain dumb) suburban dwellers - Edward must be one of the most haunting and sad characters I have ever seen, and Depp is absolutely perfect for the part.In many respects the characters are pretty normal - they have been tweaked somewhat to allow for their extravagant behavior and their calculating meanness, but other than that, they are just people. But put in these awful, cheerily colorful surroundings, they seem even more twisted than they already are. And Edward, apart from his appearance, is more normal than any of them. A film full of wonders. It's inspiring to think that Tim Burton thought this movie up as a kid.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Good film,"Good film The characters are indeed very well-written and the climax is moving. The film is a little weird, especially with the combination of the dark humour, romance, drama and action set in the 'real' world but it works well. The film is said to be inspired by a fictional childhood hero of Burton who had scissor-hands. Clearly he's put a lot of heart into it. I just saw the film recently and it clearly has stood the test of time and one movie that will stay for a long time.Depp in the title role is wonderfully outstanding. I can't imagine anyone else play the part. It was made for him as he did full justice to the character and immortalized it. Wiest is completely different from her other roles and only proves what a versatile actress she is. Ryder is charming and adequate.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Not One of My Favorites,"Usually I like grotesque and absurd movies a lot, but somehow I never liked Edward Scissorhands much. The cast is not to blame, also not the production or directing, but somewhat the whole story just leaves me indifferent and slightly bored - the story is just put together by pieces of many well known, maybe too well known stories: Phantom of the Opera, Frankenstein comes quick to mind. A few days again I put the movie again on my menu, but had to use the forward button rather freely. Edward Scissorhands is not a bad film or a total failure, but it is certainly one of my least favorite movies of Mr. Burton's oeuvre.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Edward Scissorhands,"After waiting at least 10 days to watch this movie, I finally watched it on MPLEX. Thank god. The movie was wonderful! It was so enchanting,beautiful. And sometimes, even funny!(The pea on his scissorhand, for one example) Edward was a gentle man, living his life in the haunted mansion on the hill in a pastel paradise called Suburbia.He was there alone, because his Inventor had died before he was finished.But one day, a nice Avon lady came inside and discovered Edward, taking him home with her... I do not want to spoil the whole movie of course.So I will end it there!If you haven't heard or watched this movie before, you need to rent it or buy it, and WATCH IT!I just wished it wouldn't had ended so soon..at least I have the movie so I can watch it again..and again..and again!""Did he have a name?""

The Strange World of Tim Burton,"I'll start this off by saying I am not a die-hard Tim Burton fan. I don't love ""Big Fish"", I hate ""Batman Returns"", and I can't say I have ever watched ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" all the way through. That said I want it known that I am devoted to ""Batman"", I can't help but love ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""The Corpse Bride"", and ""Sleepy Hollow"" is one of my guiltiest pleasures. Even though Tim Burton doesn't always deeply impress me I do know that he is easily one of the most interesting contemporary filmmakers. And I can say without reservation that ""Edward Scissorhands"" is one of the most touching and enchanting films I've ever seen. After reading a very negative review of this beautiful film, from legendary critic Roger Ebert, I decided that it was necessary to comment on the only true masterpiece to be issued entirely by Tim Burton's imagination.Lets start with the premise of the movie. A young man with scissors for hands is taken in by a suburban family and falls in love. Can any idea be any further away from Hollywood formula? The very fact that this film was made is a testimony to Burton's power in Hollywood in the early 90s (post-Batman he could do anything I guess).Ebert's remarks seem to center on how Burton has great ideas but he simply lacks the ability to tell a story well. Nothing could be further from the truth. The plot, aside from the scissors for hands part, is rather clichéd. We've all seen this plot a dozen times. ""Troubled youth is adopted by a kind family and tries to fit into a new community."" Hell, if you removed Edward from the script and slapped in a stock troubled teen you would instantly have a so-so teen angst picture. Get Rob Reiner to direct it and we have a ready-made sequel to ""Stand by Me"". Really the only reason Edward Scissorhands is remarkable is because, before ""Planet of the Apes"" mind you, Tim Burton was probably the most original director making big-budget films in America. His unique visual style and artistry made this film great, just like they did Ed Wood and ""Beetlejuice"". Even ""Batman"" (a film I will always love) is nowhere near the caliber of this film. And what especially attracts me to this film is that Burton here, more than any other film he's made, is very obviously pointing out how formulaic and conformist all other studio films have become (notice this in his depiction of suburbia and compare). He's also just plane making fun of the suburban lifestyle, and as a kid from the suburbs I have to laugh, because he's absolutely accurate in his vision.It's rare to find a movie with a remarkably distinct visual style, a wonderful narrative, and actual social commentary to boot. Somehow Burton managed to have it all in the most unlikely of stories. This film proves that movies which defy standards and accounting practices are the only ones which can be adored, and I will always remember it as Tim Burton's biggest success. Also it ended Vincent Prices' contribution to films while simultaneously launching Johnny Depp's career. In retrospect it really should have won an Oscar for something.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Hard as rock, sharp as scissors, soft as paper - 'Edward Scissorhands'","Being director Tim Burton's picture 'edward Scissorhands' combines a sense of dreamy storytelling with great special effects.  The film tells the story of edward, a young, mysterious man with a different appearance but a kind human heart.Edward lives alone in the town's notorious 'house on top of the hill' until the day an Avon lady calls and takes him home to live with her in their town...unfortunately not realising the potential consequences.As always the director (Sleepy Hollow, Beetlejuice, Batman) works visual magic and with a top screenplay by Caroline Thompson the film captivates with a slight twist on good and evil.  With spectacular sets, Tim Burton, uses a fantastic, surreal mixture of dark, haunting sets and bright planned 60's streets.  These sets are stunningly visual and vibrant colours play off each other and contrast to edward's dark yet beautiful home)Starring a then trapped TV drama heart-throb, Johnny Depp (edward) gives a performance of a lifetime without really having to speak.  His heart-warming performance enables you to sympathise with this character and his habits, such as extravagant topiary and makes you also sympathise with how difficult people are to get on with in life.  Johnny Depp is among a fine cast including Winona Ryder, Diane Wiest and Vincent Price as the inventor.The other characters, mainly the family and the neighbours start to annoy you with their precise lives but soon it becomes apparent that this is the danger for the harmless edward.  As in a lot of Tim Burton films the characters are obviously greatly worked into and can sometimes seem a derivate on stereotypes or to the extreme.  Whatever your view, this works in 'edward Scissorhands' and adds to the tragedy that affects anyone who isn't 'normal'.Some people may find the start a little slow but that does not hinder the fascination throughout the film and I find this also shows the quick descent into sad chaos as the characters begin to realise the consequences of trying to change things. `Sometimes you just can't change things.' The film doesn't really have a set time period because with love it doesn't matter.The story is original and gently funny, with a slight touch of danger. This film, to me, also represents the narrow mindedness of our societies and touches upon the notion of racism and discrimination and the sad consequences of the extremes of this.  It is shown through the family's neighbour's reception to edward.  Above all though the film is about true love and works under the children's question 'where does snow come from?' - The film answers the question, you will have to see it to find out.For me 'edward Scissorhands' is the best visual journey ever told.  With make-up from Stan Winston and music by Danny Elfman, the whole film takes you into a spectacular surreal world.  'edward Scissorhands' is an incredible love story, visually a treat and one that will remain in your heart forever.Star rating - five out of five",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
edward scissorhands,"Edward Scissorhands is one of better Burton films but it still has some noticable flaws in it,lets start with good staff first,i think that this is depp best performance,well at least is on par with his ed wood performance and he showed in that two films that he can be great actor,Winona Ryder was great here to and she had very good chemistry with Depp,story was also very original even if it had some frankenstein vibes in it ,but to me such a story with a fairy tale feeling was a great mix,score in a film was also very powerful and i liked it a lot,rest of cast was fine but they felt disposable and they didnt have a big purpose to be in a film,also some scenes when Edward is cutting bushes and dogs were little unrealistic and cartoonish,our asshole boyfriend villain was also little to over the top and his acting was off in some moments,Edward Scissorhands was a good film but like many Burton film it lacks supstance to become great or brilliant one",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

The whole movie scene puts together all society sins: false news, preconception, lies, harness, greed, cruel intentions towards good intentions.

Boasting great performances from Dianne Wiest, Anthony Michael Hall, Winona Ryder, and the incomparable Johnny Depp it shows both the best and worst of human nature and does it beautifully. Tim Burton creates a setting that draws you into another world, all the time seeming like complete reality. It's a story about a man who was invented and is one day taken to suburbia by a kind Avon lady. Combining classic fairy tale elements with brutal reality it becomes a story about acceptance and love.

"short thoughts, and some cute scenes!","Okay, first here is my collection of short thoughts of this movie.I thought it was so unique how they gave Edward scissors instead of human hands. I also thought it was lovely how Edward was so quiet, but he didn't need to talk to share his thoughts. He was a quiet guy, but had many facial expressions and SOMETIMES he said a sentence or two. But that was rare.Cute scenes time!Cute scene # 1: When Kim says ""I Love You"" to Edward and they hug! It was sooo cute! (Kim was the teenage girl's name, right? I dunno.) Cute scene # 2: When that lady was trying to make out with him in that store place, he got freaked out and ran away. The lady chased after him and she was like, 'EDWARD?!?! Come back this instant!' That was classic. Cute scene # 3: When Kim came home and started to get undressed in her bedroom, she saw that Edward is laying there and starts screaming! But then it's cute because later in the movie Edward develops a crush on her. Cute scene # 4: When Edward gives haircuts!! I want a haircut from Edward!So that's my review, any questions?",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Enjoyable Fun watch!,"This movie originally made in 1990 is another staple in Tim Burton's timeline of enjoyable, fun, and environmentally original pieces of work. Though the story is bogged down by cliche conflicts and sometimes annoying plot devices this movie is still a great work of art and a prime example on how Burton's style flows though a movie. But Burton's style though bright and fun sometimes lacks on the story side of the coin. Characters seems sometimes come off flat and have unclear motives. The movie focuses on one neighborhood and how the residents come to see and accept this very different person into their lives. This is an interesting idea for a movie but it not totally original or done well in some areas.
 
Overall, Burton's sometimes boiled down, cliche story can bring down the movie but his patented Burton style still helps it rise it above others in its genre. A joyful ride with good performances all around.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Absurdity vs Normality,"Edward Scissorhands is a deeply peculiar and philosophical story that questions the peculiarity of life. It is a story that challenges people's ideas as to what is considered strange versus what is considered normal, and how by calling something strange or normal is really just a prejudice that identifies itself with the other side. In other words, what one person calls normal is what another may call strange. People typically use the word ""strange"" to alienate themselves from that which they don't understand, or are afraid of. The truth of the matter is that everything and everyone is strange; which is to say, everyone and everything is not completely understood, each of us being quintessentially unique. We have to familiarize ourselves with the strange and welcome it with open arms in order to understand ourselves, others and life in general better. The story of Edward Scissorhands is no different.Edward is a part machine part man whose creator dies before his completion, leaving him with scissors for hands. He lives life as a social outcast within the vacant walls of a lonely, deserted castle, and is one day invited to live a ""normal"" lifestyle amongst a neighborhood of gossipy Suburban folk. He timidly accepts the offer, descends from his gloomy abode and enters a world that is not entirely familiar to him. He gawks inquisitively out car windows, jolts when telephones ring, pokes the mirror to examine the reflection he sees, struggles to eat food like everyone else, and overall lives in this new world like a foreign yet wondrous traveler. As the Avon lady who gave him this invitation concludes, ""It'll take some time to getting used to Edward before you start feeling at home."" Profound are these words. They seem to strike at the very core of the pilgrim within us all; traveling like foreigners on an unfamiliar planet as we try and familiarize ourselves and search for the cure to our divine homesickness.That which we typically familiarize ourselves with to a great degree we call ""home"", or comfort. Conveniently for us we have quickly grown accustom to our home since birth. Earth is our home, and it is a place that has become familiar to us through repetition and time. For an individual like Edward, howeverone whom many of us would view as alien because of his differenceshe, to the contrary views our home as alien, and if you really stop to think about it, he's right.The film's objective correlative seems to argue that it's OK to view life as absurd. Life is absurd. Life's absurdity will hopefully motivate us to learn more about what we are a part of, and to make that which was once considered absurd seem more reasonable. This only happens by descending, like Edward, from our homes of comfort and discovering the beauty that lies within the unknown. I believe we all bask in our own private wonderlands that at times make sense, and other times make nonsense. We're all still so naïve about who we are, where we came from, why we're here and where we're going, that to call something strange, I think, would be an indirect compliment to the God who created us all. It just means that we haven't explored enough. With time and repetition, however, things will become more familiar until we reach the status of feeling like we've finally arrivedfinally made it home.Edward Scissorhands is truly a wonderful story that reminds all of us not to lose our child-like ingenuities, but to embrace fear with loving hands and a confident smile.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Still a great movie...,"I have indeed watched the 1990 movie ""Edward Scissorhands"" several times over the years, and needed no persuasion to sit down and revisit it here in 2024, just to brush up on it.The storyline in the movie is a well-written and entertaining story. Writers Tim Burton and Caroline Thompson put together a unique, memorable and outstanding script and storyline to be sure. And it definitely is something that you would expect to come from the mind of Tim Burton. I enjoy the story told in the movie, as it is a wonderful fantasy tale mixed with some light comedy, a touch of Frankenstein, dark romance, and of course the archetypical Tim Burton touch.Of course the acting performances in the movie are good. And why wouldn't it be? With the likes of Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Kathy Baker, Conchata Ferrell, Alan Arkin and none other than Vincent Price. The cast was great for this movie, and somehow the symbiosis of a Tim Burton movie with Johnny Depp in a leading role is something that just goes hand-in-hand.The movie is not without its flaws and issues, though. I have to admit that I am a bit perplexed with the bush situation in the neighborhood. Because in order for Edward to sculpt such huge sculptures from people's bushes in their yards means that people have had some pretty huge bushes growing in their yards, and they must have been quite some eyesores. And I don't recall seeing bushes that big in the neighborhood when Peg was running her Avon rounds. And that old, crumbling ruin of a manor at the end of the street stood out like a sore thumb, very much a dark and bleak contrast to the pastel colors of the sunny neighborhood, but again it just didn't make much of any sense for a neighborhood to be placed directly up against such a looming ruin. Not to mention how Edward would get food in the time passing since the inventor died. But hey, it is just a movie.Visually, I will say that the movie is definitely a classic Tim Burton movie, complete with the dark, gothic and over-the-edge style of imagery that he is known for, be it in animated movies or live action movies. Edward was definitely an interesting character in design and appearance, and the special effects team definitely made the scissors look real.If you haven't already seen this 1990 Tim Burton movie, then I would definitely recommend that you should do so, if you get the chance. It really is an enjoyable and entertaining movie, not to mention a memorable storyline. I will actually say that ""Edward Scissorhands"" ranks up there as one of Tim Burton's best movies.My rating of director Tim Burton's 1990 movie ""Edward Scissorhands"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Edward Scissorhands,"I hadn't purposely made the decision to neglect the works of Tim Burton, yet I found myself in 2017, despite being a huge cinema fan, without ever seeing a Tim Burton feature before in my life. It was time to rectify this oversight and settle in for Edward Scissorhands. The 1990 film starring Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder exploring the life of an abandoned invention turned man left alone when his inventor passes away before he is finished. Burton had a lot to say in Edward Scissorhands, very obviously, criticizing suburban culture and the social constructs of what constitutes as ""normal"". His message is clear and nearly overtakes the narrative coming off as an after-school special. Nevertheless, it was time to finally ""meet"" Tim Burton.On the edge of the most picturesque suburban town, there is a castle that no one visits, and the neighbors know nothing about. Inside the castle, there lived an inventor (Vincent Price) responsible for elaborate designs taking over the entire castle. His most prized invention is that of Edward (Johnny Depp). He built a man, called Edward, a person made from parts, complete except for that of his hands. His hands were left as scissors before the inventor passed away. Since his inventor's passing, he lived alone in the castle secluded from the world and left to fend for himself. Trying to see Avon products, a kind neighbor named Peg (Dianne Wiest) happened upon the castle, finding Edward. At first, Peg is frightened by Edward and his scissor hands, but she eventually understands that he is a gentle soul yearning for some human interaction. Peg decides that she can't bear to leave Edward behind, so she invites him into her family's home. Initially, her family and neighbors are taken aback at the sight of the pale, scarred, man with scissors for hands. Eventually, though, Peg's friends and family come around, and once they get to know Edward, they realize he is sweet and unique and has talents appreciated by all. After such acceptance, however, things start to go wrong and the easiest person to blame is the different outsider.Tim Burton obviously hates suburbia, the entirety of Edward Scissorhands is his diatribe of all the problems of suburbia. He was so overt with his message that suburbia traps people, keeping them confined and limited. Burton also clearly illustrates how much being different is looked down upon, to an almost nauseating intensity. The camera angles Burton chose to use, while they were effective in creating the claustrophobic atmosphere he was going for, were uncomfortable to watch. The ratio created with the camera work he chose seemed too manipulative to appreciate. Johnny Depp was overkill with his expressions, taking one out of the film by being so distracting. The standout was the score/sound design, in an otherwise after-school special-like film far too overt with its message and seeming to make color/camera angle decisions for the director's own pleasure rather than for the audience.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Stay away from pushy Avon sellers!,"Edwards Scissorhands is definitively not your average Christmas movie, but your average Tim Burton movie, so it evens out. It is an exploration of a bizarre world where creativity and imagination overflow, an invitation to accept and celebrate each other's differences, but also a metacommentary on everyday life in the good ol' American suburbs. The ending can leave a bad taste in your mouth if you are looking for a typical happy-ending Christmas flick to watch with your family, but I do not think it takes away anything from the film.As with other Tim Burton movies, we can appreciate the contrast between light and darkness; on the one hand, we have the colorful neighborhood where Peg (Dianne Wiest) and her family live, while on the other, we have the somber castle where Edward spends his days by himself; we see it too with the neighbors, willing to accept Edward as one of their own, while also being quick to judge him when things go south.The highlight of the film is Johnny Depp's outstanding performance as Edward, portraying a man-made human being with a heart of gold does not seem something easy to pull off, but Johnny Depp passed with flying colors.

One of the best films ever.,"When Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have worked together on a film, its never a disappointment. I cried during this film, it's so beautiful yet so quirky and dark. Johnny does and incredible job (as usual). He always puts his heart and soul into every character, what a special actor. Edward's character is so amazing,he's so lovable and innocent. I absolutely love Winona Ryder as Kim, brilliant actor too. Soundtrack to this film is also wonderful. 'Ice Dance' & 'Farewell' are the most beautiful pieces. The ending to this film is also very lovely. Acting 10/10, story line 10/10 and soundtrack 10/10. My second favourite Depp & Burton collaboration, after Sweeney Todd.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
pretty much the best film ever,"I could watch this film again and again (and I have).It's the epitome of Tim Burton- magical and moving, whilst at the same time having a dark, Gothic edge. It's visually beautiful, powerfully contrasting bright toy-town colours with gloomy greys and blacks. Absolutely everything, from the colours of the houses to the clothes the characters wear, has been carefully thought out so that you have the impression of watching not a film, but a moving painting.The storyline is lovely, and it will make you laugh and cry, often simultaneously. It's a perfect twist on the fairy story genre.One of my favourite things about this movie is the score- composed by Danny Elfman. It fits the atmosphere of the movie perfectly, with its sweeping violin melodies and ghostly female choir. Tender, yet strange.Johnny Depp is, of course, fantastic and in my opinion this is one of his best roles. He barely has any lines but his characterisation remains very strong, meaning that you pretty much fall in love with Edward from the get-go.Just watch this film. You won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A beautifully crafted film,"Edward Scissorhands is a film I have been meaning to watch since being influenced by the fairytale storytelling of 'Big Fish'. Tim Burton has yet ceased to impress me (despite the fact that I have not seen many of his films) and I have always recognised Johnny Depp as being an actor who can make any character his own, so I was pleased when the viewing opportunity arose.I have to say that I was not disappointed. The unique aspects of contrast between the bright town and its residents and the dark castle like place where Edward is created is wonderful. The script is well crafted,  sometimes funny and very touching. Burton creates a misunderstood character, much like the famous Frankenstein monster. I believe it near impossible not to feel for Edward when he states lines such as ""I'm not finished."" Johnny Depp is superb and you cannot help responding to his naive, childlike smile.Although when you read the full story aspects of it may seem slightly ridicules, the overall picture is a wonderful film that has now become a favourite of mine.9.5/10",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Very Cool Movie,"This was a very cool movie. The colors were really interesting, each house being a different solid color. Each car being a different solid color but not matching the house color of it's owner.I really cared about Edward.

This is an accurate depiction of the ignorance of people.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
One of the best movies of all time but not for everyone.,"I'd have to say right now... not everyone will enjoy this movie. Edward Scissorhands is about knowing you should fit in, you want to fit in, but no matter what, you can't. I'd have to say the people that don't like it just don't understand what the message of the story is and/or they can't identify with it. My parents actually had to persuade me to rent it because i was reluctant but...WOW. In the very beginning how the old Kim said that Edward was left ""incomplete and all alone"", my heart jolted. Edward Scissorhands was so wonderful! It was beautifully done with all the acting (johnny depp, Dianne Wiest, ANthony Michael Hall, Wynona Rider, etc), of course you can't forget Tim Burton and Danny Elfman! This movie isn't just a comedy or love story, it's so many things... one second it's hilarious the next heart-wrenching. Johnny Depp's Edward Scissorhands character just makes you want to say ""Aaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww"" lol. After seeing it for the first time, after it ended i actually cried and instantly fell in love with it. I often just watch it once a day because it never gets old. I'd have to say that from watching this movie you'd never know it was made in 1990, it looks like it could have been made in 2003.

It's such a sweet little tale, full of magic and fantasy, with a little bit of love thrown in.This is a movie I will definitely want to see again because even if it's quite an old film, it still manages to warm our hearts.I applaud Johnny Depp for his fine acting.

And So Depp and Burton Begins,"If you had to name the most famous director-actor collaborations working in Hollywood today, I would bet Johnny Depp and Tim Burton are among the first you would name. Edward Scissorhands was the first film they collaborated on and is probably considered by most to be their best. For me I think the film is a bit overrated. It wants us to believe that this is a man we should all feel sorry for, which we do, but it also tries to convince us that his wrongdoings aren't his fault. While I believe this 'man' deserves to be treated like a human, but I don't think mixing him with other humans and not thinking chaos would eventually happen was the right move.Depp is great as the title role. In fact it's hard to believe anybody else really playing this role. For once he actually gave a tremendous amount of subtly to this strange role and he also gave it a lot of heart. But the problem is that I don't think the supporting characters were developed enough. Not only that, but I don't think any of them actually seem like people who would live in a real world. Perhaps that's the point. Winona Ryder's character has a far too sudden change of mind half way through the film, and her boyfriend is the most clichéd ex boyfriend ever. But I did enjoy watching Depp play this character. And I think his 'mother' had some really great scenes with him as well.So the problem isn't so much the actual story but rather the execution. There are few Burton movies that I thoroughly enjoy so perhaps my problem is more so with him than the rest of the crew. His films tend to be split down the middle with audiences so I think this may be one that I have to sit on and re-watch for further appreciation.+Depp's subtly emotional performance+Dianne West-clichéd characters-Style over substance6.0/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A cut above,"Edward (Johnny Depp) lives a lonely existence and is isolated in a house set away from the rest of the community. Edward is an outcast because he has had to live his life with scissors for hands after his inventor died before he can finish his creator. Edward is taken in and cared for by a kind woman and falls for her pretty daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). However, things prove tough for Edward as he has to try and deal with disapproving neighbours and Kim's rather aggressive boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall).Burton's primary objective here was to tell the story of a man who may be a bit scary and weird on the outside, but ultimately show that underneath his rather scary exterior is a man who is kind and gentle. Yes it's a little clichéd and mushy perhaps, but I think it's something that writers can get away with if a film has a certain charm and warmth to it and that's where a film like Edward Scissorhands really succeeds.Another interesting facet with this film is that it acts as a satire/social commentary on suburban life; I must admit that I found it amusing to watch these shallow and dull 'suburban housewives' all chatting on the phone about Edward's arrival and to here them gossiping about their neighbours and so on. It's a spot on critique about modern suburban life that was both clever and funny.Edward Scissorhands is awash with beautiful colours and wonderful cinematography; not only does this film have oodles of charm and heart, but it's also quite pretty to look at as well (and it's not just the cinematography that's pretty - Winona Ryder scrubs up quite well too).As far as performances go then this is Depp's film hands down; he captures both the innocence and naivety of Edward in such a way that it's almost impossible not to care about him as a character. Anthony Michael Hall was surprisingly effective in his role as a thug (I've only seen him play the geek before and must admit that I think he's better playing a geek than a thug, but he was still good here).If I'm being critical then there are one or two weaknesses with this picture; firstly I felt that this film could have benefited from a little more character development (the suburban housewives were quite funny at first, but I do believe that they out stayed their welcome and towards the end they were becoming more annoying than funny). I felt that Burton could have perhaps developed Edward's character a bit more as I couldn't help but feel that he only scratched the surface with his original and impressive creation.To be honest though when a film has this much charm, this much warmth and this much likability it's hard to really put it down. It's pretty to look at, it has a nice story and it contains some fine acting performances. It's a very difficult film not to like so just sit back and enjoy!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Only the first half is good,"I'd cut this movie into two parts, the first half and the second half. The first half is a solid 9 or even 10 but the second half is 2 at best.After the mid part of the movie it drags on and on and on, piling on more and more unnecessary drama and unnecessary tension, one thing after another goes wrong, one thing leads to another and the whole magic of the movie and the main character are gone and you can't wait for the movie to end so that the poor guy's misery is over.Tim Burton is great at making half-movies but he's not that great at coming up with a good ending. His stories always drag on too much and the endings are never satisfying. The only thing satisfying about this movie's ending is that it finally ended and the suffering is over.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

"An Impressive, Excellent Movie by Tim Burton","Edward Scissorhands is an excellent movie, brilliantly conceived by Tim Burton and Caroline Thompson. Everything from the wonderful cast, to the amazing score by Danny Elfman, to the interesting script, make for a phenomenal movie-viewing experience.The movie is about Edward (Johnny Depp), a man created by an inventor. However, before the inventor is finished with his creation, he dies, leaving Edward with razor sharp, scissor hands. Left alone, he has no contact with the outside world or other people until the local Avon lady, Peg (Dianne Wiest) decides to drive up to the old, almost deserted, mansion for one last chance to sell her products. Instead she finds Edward. She decides to take Edward away from the mansion and she brings him home to live with her family. Edward now has to learn how to survive in the real world and discover how to live with real people and their prejudices.Johnny Depp does an amazing job as Edward. What makes him so good in this role is his ability to convey so much with so few words. He is clearly showing what it is like to be an outsider and someone who does not quite fit in with the rest of the population. While his 'scissorhands' are good for making beautiful ice sculptures and trimming the neighbors bushes and trees into all sorts of creative shapes, he is not able to perform simple activities like eating a pea. He is also unable to come into direct contact with other humans. He cannot rub his eyes or wipe a hair off his face without cutting himself. Johnny Depp is excellent in portraying this man's difficult and complex life. Edward is completely innocent, yet taken advantage of by everyone simply because he is different. Also notable in the cast are Dianne Wiest, Peg, the Avon lady who brings Edward out of the mansion and Winona Ryder, who plays Peg's daughter Kim.What Tim Burton is able to do extremely well is to create movies that speak to the viewer on some level. Although none of us will ever quite know what it would be like to have scissors for hands, many of us will feel like an outsider at some point in our lives. On some level, we will be able to identify with and sympathize with Edward. Although the situations in many of Burton's movies are fantasy based, it somehow feels real. There is a familiar feeling in his movies, in Edward Scissorhands, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and even The Corpse Bride that make the viewer feel as if they are experiencing the events right alongside the characters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

And everyone who watches this film wants to visit poor Edward in his castle-I can promise, I can guarantee that. We all know now where the snow comes from. And I almost believe that story. It's a pitty there aren't so many of this kind of films out there. But Tim Burton has done a perfect job with this film.

Darkness and pastels; a bittersweet love story,"In between Batman movies, Tim Burton offered up this unassuming fairy tale, and it's entirely in his wheelhouse. Edward Scissorhands brings the old monster movie to the cookie-cutter subdivision, a place that's ripe for satire. I absolutely love Alan Arkin and Dianne Wiest in this, they don't bat an eye at this knives-wielding misfit as everyone else in town gathers up the pitchforks at the first sign of trouble. Johnny Depp is a believably overgrown child while Winona Ryder (to her credit) sells the romance.

There's a pink one and a green one and a blue one and a yellow one..,"""Edward Scissorhands"" is a variation on the Frankenstein legend, relocated from Europe to American suburbia, or perhaps I should say to an exaggerated parody of American suburbia. It is presumably set in either Florida or Southern California, as we learn that the ocean is not far away and it is the sort of place where people can walk about in shirt sleeves even at Christmas. The set designer seems to have been given a brief to produce something straight out of Malvina Reynolds' song ""Little Boxes"". This is a community whose inhabitants do indeed live in little boxes made of ticky-tacky which (apart from colour) all look just the same, and as in the song there's a pink one and a green one and a blue one and a yellow one..Dominating this otherwise flat and boring community is a hill crowned by an eerie Gothic mansion, the home of an elderly, eccentric inventor who, like Frankenstein, is working on an artificial human. Unfortunately, the old man dies before he can finish his creation, whom he has named Edward, leaving him with scissor blades instead of hands. (Why the inventor should have wanted to fit Edward with scissor blades in the first place is never explained, but fantasy is a film genre which enjoys a certain exemption from the laws of logic).The film explains what happens when Edward is discovered by an Avon lady named Peg Boggs and adopted into her family. (Did Tim Burton realise that ""bog"" is British slang for lavatory?) Although Edward has no hands as we would understand the term, his scissor blades mean that he is an expert at anything involving cutting or chopping, and he is able to earn a living as a hairdresser (catering for both the local housewives and their dogs) and as a gardener, carving hedges into elaborate topiary sculptures. He also has a sideline in ice sculpture.At first Edward is a popular figure in the neighbourhood, but then two incidents turn local opinion against him. Joyce, a middle-aged housewife, tries unsuccessfully to seduce him, and then goes about saying he tried to rape her. Edward is then arrested after Jim, the unpleasant boyfriend of Peg's daughter Kim, tricks him into taking part in a burglary. Although Edward is released, hostility eventually reaches such a point that he is forced to take refuge in his original home, the old mansion on the hill, where he is confronted by an angry mob led by Jim. (By rights Jim should be grateful to Edward, who has never revealed his part in the burglary, but he is jealous of a growing attraction between Edward and Kim).The film begins and ends with an elderly woman telling the story of Edward to her granddaughter; at the end it is revealed that the old woman is Kim Boggs, which implies that these scenes must take place around the year 2050. Burton does not, however, give them a futuristic look; indeed, they look very traditional, emphasising the fairy-tale nature of his story.This is one of my two favourite Tim Burton films, the other being ""Big Fish"" which also has a leading character named Edward. The two Edwards, however, are very different, as are the films in which they appear, even though both can be classed as fantasies. The Edward of ""Big Fish"" is much older, a jovial old extrovert, an adventurer and a teller of tall tales, a modern-day Baron Munchausen. ""Big Fish"" has a happy ending and is outward-looking in the sense that Edward's adventures take him all over the world. ""Edward Scissorhands"", by contrast, ends poignantly and is inward-looking, with all the action taking place in one small community.This was probably the film which made Johnny Depp a major star, and in my view it remains one of his best performances. He made the role so much his own that it is strange to think that he was not the first choice; that was Tom Cruise, who was not available. Gary Oldman and Tom Hanks both turned down the part; after seeing the completed film Oldman was to state that he regretted his decision. Depp's Edward, unlike his namesake in ""Big Fish"", is a shy, withdrawn young man, socially awkward and introverted. (His unkempt hair and pallid complexion suggest an affinity with the Goth movement). For all his awkwardness, however, he is good-hearted and capable of love, something which Kim instinctively recognises. (Jim has never loved anyone or anything except himself). The other notable performances come from Dianne Wiest as the kindly Peg and Vincent Price, in his last feature film appearance, as the inventor, who is seen in flashback. Depp's real-life girlfriend Winona Ryder as Kim makes a sweet heroine, although someone should have told Burton that the lovely Winona looks a lot better as a brunette than she does as a reddish blonde.""Edward Scissorhands"" deals with a number of interrelated themes- self-discovery, the search for personal identity, social conformism, disability, the nature of artistic creativity and the problems of those who are perceived as ""different"" by society, but fortunately Burton and his co-scriptwriter Caroline Thompson deal with these weighty themes in a relatively light, poetic manner and not in a heavy-handed or preachy one. There is also a fine musical score from Danny Elfman. This is one of those films you can discover more in every time you see it. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

An unsuccessful attempt to parallel a classic.....,"Edward Scissorhands, desperately trying to imitate the classic movie, Frankenstien, failed completely to capture the emotion and brilliancy displayed by the previous classic. Why someone would want to parallel such a classic like Frankenstein is beyond me.The acting was poor in some places and the characters were very much clichéd. Although, Johnny Debt did portray Edward pretty decently, for it was such a bad part to have, being that Edward was pretty much confused the entire time.

There is no word for such amazement,"If there is a movie that has pure magic in it, I would think off the top of my head of Edward Scissorhands. There is simply all innocence and imagination in this film. Burton has created a masterpiece with Caroline Thompson and Danny Elfman as his team. I see now, that while together, they created a film that has all necessitous in it. It contains comedy, crucial to keeping an audience. It contains fantasy, something that all of us have drifted into at least once in our lives. It's nice to view the imagination of another, to see how we relate, because in the end, we find that humans all-together, are not so different. It's the small things that separate us like a titanium wall. I think that was what Burton had tried to do while explaining and creating this film.

Both Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder had played an astonishing act and has led me to believe that there is such beauty in the world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"A mysterious, intriguing and uplifting Tim Burton film!","This is one film you will have to suspend reality and let your imagination run wild with. Tim Burton directs one of his most iconic films, a story about a man named Edward (Johnny Depp) who was created by a scientist who left him unfinished, leaving Edward a near-complete man with scissors for hands.Edward lives in isolation in a mysterious, dark castle on top of a mountain, which overlooks a quiet, simple, Utopia-like suburb. It's pretty intriguing having an isolated castle located near a normal community, providing a taste of mystery and suspense for the characters in the film and to those watching the movie. When Avon lady Peg (Dianne West) visits the castle in hopes of getting a sale, she instead grows interested in Edward's well-being and brings him back home. It's heart-warming that the kind Peg shows passion to a completely strange person and it's fun seeing Edward show his skills and tricks to the community, from him making grass sculptures to giving the women haircuts with his scissorhands.It is also nice seeing the chemistry between Edward and Kim (Winona Ryder), brilliantly played and uplifting, and the friction between Edward and Kim's boyfriend (Anthony Michael Hall) eventually leads to the more serious misadventures and bad doers in the movie. But, this film shows us that humanity and understanding exist in the world and kind souls do prevail over evil in some way, even though ***spoiler ahead*** not all stories end up happily ever after. I just wished some of the evil-doers got a taste of their own medicine and Edward got cut with some more slack ***spoiler ends***Overall, it's a film with great acting, great music score by Danny Elfman, great direction by Tim Burton and a well-paced story.Grade A-",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Depp Should Have Been Oscar Nominated,"Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to Edward Scissorhands (1990)The movie that started the long-running Tim Burton/Depp collaboration. This movie is not just one of my favourite Depp or Burton movies, it's one of my favourite of the decade. I LOVE it.Tim Burton was one of my new favourite directors when he made this. Thanks to Beetlejuice in 1988 and Batman the year after, I was already a fan when he made this classic. I don't think he put a foot wrong for over a decade. And it was this movie, that made me a fan of Depp.Personally, I think Depp should have been nominated for an Oscar. He is superb. In fact, I think Burton, Dianne Wiest, Danny Elfman's score and the movie itself should have been nominated. As it was, it's sole nomination was for Best Makeup.Winona Ryder (who began dating Depp during filming, and would become engaged) is fine and Conchata Ferrell is an actress I adore and Anthony Michael Hall is perfectly cast as the movies bad boy.I think the movie is so touching and moving, it's a joy. Depp himself stated that he ""cried like a baby"" when he first read the script. At the time of his casting, Depp was wanting to break out of the teen idol status which his performance in 21 Jump Street had given him. Fox executives were so worried about Edward's image, that they tried to keep pictures of Depp in full costume under wraps until the release of the film. To prepare for his role, Johnny Depp watched the films of silent movie actor Charles Chaplin to get an idea of how to emote without dialogue. This would also come in handy a few movies later.Edward Scissorhands grossed $56 million dollars at the domestic box office to end 1990 as the 20th highest grossing movie of the year.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

I thought Edward was really poor because he is apt to be misunderstood by his outward appearance.In addition, the ending is also little sad for him. I thought that there might be other ways of ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A tragically romantic tale,"I found Edward Scissorhands to be special in a personal way. The trio of Tim Burton (Director), Johnny Depp (Actor) and Danny Elfman (Music) really comes together to create such a romantic atmosphere in this movie. Depp plays his role well, by keeping the character of Edward as an outcast from humanity and yet making him seem humorous and a character you just fall in love with.Elfman's music really brings this movie to the height of emotion though. The music is often referred to in the music communities I visit and has inspired film music and music in general. The theme song is what I like to call Elf-esque, as it plays those lovely glockenspiel two-key chords, in harmony with the strings and the choir.The symbolism of this movie is superb as well, as you see all of edwards dreams and hopes dashed in his flashback to the death of Vincent Prices character, as his hands are also destroyed.I give this movie a perfect 10, because to me it just brings together all aspects of a movie that are important to me. Emotive, but not over the top music, a lovable lead character played by a good actor, and a the director and producer to pull it off. I recommend this music only to those who are willing to place themselves in a movie and just go with the flow. I'll admit that nostalgia plays a bit part in my like of this movie. But the general romantic tale of Edward Scissorhands just captures my heart in the way that I love. A truly tragically romantic tale.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A stranded creation of a lonely master.,"I found this movie a milestone in my life already at a very young age. It didn't make me cry, because it wasn't an unfamiliar world for me. It felt I lived in it. Instead it made my hands shake that someone, on the other side of the world, a stranger ( a couple of them in fact) have seen the same side of the society we live in. I recognized all the characters from real life. I recognized Peg Boggs in my mother, who also is a naive type of folks, trying to desperately and undoubtedly do good, but doesn't often think before interfering ... I recognized someone on the verge of surrendering to the equalizing, blind rules of the society, then stepping back at the last moment and following her heart in Kim. I Recognized a child who doesn't much argue, hesitate, question or alienate at all, but just acts my the current mood in Kevin. I recognized a creator, who is abandoned by all non - believers, left alone, without any help or good advice, without being kept up - to date , because the society hasn't been patient enough to follow the process of his masterwork. a lot of creators in our world work by themselves. great many fail to be understood and recognized, as is their creation, which is also left stranded, floating in a mass of misconceptions and misinterpretations. what if the creator doesn't explain... what he meant? does the creation have a life in a world where it finds himself?",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Genius!,"I saw this one in the theater when I was small, and later many times at home. I never get through it without crying. The score is lovely, never overpowering the story. Edward himself is fragile, yet he had such a desperate nobility to him, and he was so alone...he stands in marked contrast to the apes around him, normal on the outside, but cruel and flawed inside. If you look closely, the neighbors seem to embody one or more of the Seven Sins, while Edward is the tragic innocent.This movie works on so many levels, and still holds up today. Vincent Price shines in his last performance as the Inventor, a small but crucial part that no one else ever would have got right. A truly excellent film, but don't watch it without your hankies ready.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Classic Fairy Tale,"Edward Scissorhands (1990)*** (out of 4)Johnny Depp plays the title character, a nice man who suffers from having scissors for hands. An Avon lady (Diane Wiest) finds him in an abandoned castle and brings him home where he fits in at first but as time goes on he finds it harder to blend in with the normal people. There are a few problems with the screenplay and there are a few logical problems but this is a fantasy so I try to put them out of my head and just sit back and enjoy this rather bizarre film. I think Burton gets across his message about human nature without beating the viewer over the head and in the end this is certainly one of the more memorable films of the decade. Depp is terrific in his role and really brings a lot of truth and sadness to his character. Winona Ryder (whatever happened to her?) is great as well in her role and I've always believed she was one of the best actresses out there in this time frame. The supporting cast of Wiest, Kathy Baker and Anthony Michael Hall also turn in fine work. I love the way Burton used Vincent Price in this film as it turned out to be a very loving tribute to the horror legend. The film is visually striking and the music score by Danny Elfman is terrific. The ending of the film is very touching as well.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Fluffy Fantasy That Descends Into Darkness,"""Edward Scissorhands"" is another example of Tim Burton's rather quirky style of mixing humour with horror (in a Goth sort of way) and ending up with a pretty good movie when it's all put together. When I thought about this movie, one of the things that came through was how heavily influenced by the story of Frankenstein it is. Edward (very effectively played by Johnny Depp) isn't a real person, he's a creation of an unnamed scientist (played in basically a cameo role by Vincent Price.) Like Frankenstein's monster, he's basically isolated. Like the monster, when he's removed from his isolation, he ends up wreaking unintentional havoc. Maybe the most obvious comparison is when the people of the town storm the castle he lives in, much like the villagers stormed Frankenstein's castle. (Much of the action in the town actually reminded me of ""Desperate Housewives,"" with everything happening on the same street and a bunch of women being in the know about it all.)The first half of the movie is a fun, whimsical sort of fantasy as Edward tries to adjust to life outside his castle. He becomes the hit of the town (especially with the women.) Some of this is wonderfully funny. Gradually, though, the movie turns progressively darker and even violent as Edward runs into more and more trouble. The gradual shift in tone was very effectively accomplished by Burton, and pulled off well by the cast (especially Depp.) It did, however, represent a bit of a problem for me. The opening of the movie tells us that this story is a bedtime story told by Kim (played by Winona Ryder) to her granddaughter about an event long ago, to explain where snow comes from. I wouldn't think of the darker half of this movie as a good bedtime story for a young girl! That caused me a bit of trouble, as did the fact that no one ever explained why Edward had scissors for hands. I understand that The Inventor (as he was called in the credits) died before he could give him hands, but why would he have fashioned these clunky looking scissor-type hands for him in the first place? Unanswered questions aside, I throughly enjoyed watching this (although I thought the fluffy fantasy was more enjoyable than the descent into darkness) and thought that the entire cast really pulled off a collection of good performances. Overall - 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Classic modern fairy tale,A modern day fairy tale which takes you back to watching disney movies with your parents. You can't really imagine any other actor playing the role of Edward Scissorhands than Johnny Depp. It's also probably Winona Ryder's performance outside of Heathers. I suspect there's also a lot of meaning to the film since it deals with someone that doesn't fit in. His desire to fit in and other peoples reactions to him are the cornerstone of the film. In some ways this is not dissimilar to the Hunchback of Notre Damme which has a similar metaphor.,7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
The Saddest Movie Ever Made,"I saw this movie for the first time back in September and oh, God, did it make me cry. By the end, I was practically bawling! It wasn't just the ending but the events leading up to it. If you really want to see it,I recommend bringing lots of tissues because if you cry over things like lovers saying good-bye and stuff, you're going to be crying by the end of this movie. I cried for two days it was so sad! Overall, it was a heartwarming story about a guy who is like a much more friendlier version of Frankenstein. When his creator died, he lived alone in a dark castle until a nice Avon lady took him to live with her family. As well as telling how Edward is at first accepted but then rejected, it also tells of his love for the Avon lady's daughter, Kim, and how she comes to love him. Tim Burton was a genius when it came to this one. The movie was very, very sad, but it didn't make the movie clichéd as it would've been with a happy ending. This is a brilliant movie, but remember...bring lots of tissues!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Lost in Projection,"It's always a treat to see weirdos and outcasts as main characters, being a weirdo and outcast myself. But, sometimes, the self-insert on the part of writers gets a bit too strong for my liking. The interactions between Kim and Edward, while sweet, would have much more substance if she had any established interests, quirks, or personality in general, but I got the sense that I was supposed to just accept that ""he's different"" was a pivotal enough factor in Kim's life to prompt her character growth from ""girl"" to ""girl who likes Edward"". Because of this the ending struck a bit hollow to me - that being said, it did have me completely enamoured for the most part. The character designs are all distinct and memorable for a bunch of suburban folks, the details in the outrageously perfect and clean suburban neighbourhood were striking (like nearly all the cars in the laneways being complimentary colours to their corresponding pastel houses), and the whimsical score brought a lump to my throat. I only wish there'd been a bit less time spent on wacky scissor antics and more spent on establishing characters, then perhaps I'd find the ending to cut as deep as I think it was supposed to.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
An icy pall hangs over the whole thing,"Artificial boy with scissors for hands is brought out of self-imposed isolation in his hilltop castle by a somewhat-dotty Avon lady and accepted (temporarily) in suburbia. Present day Frankenstein tale from director Tim Burton and screenwriter Caroline Thompson, working from an original treatment by herself and Burton, looks terrific but it isn't satisfying storytelling. In terms of tone and content, the picture is all over the place. Obviously, Burton wanted a nostalgic sweetness to the movie with a touch of fanciful comedy, but all this is undermined in the film's second half when the kooky neighborhood residents suddenly become two-faced hypocrites and turn on timid Edward, chasing him back home. Burton knows the notes of the classics but not how to conduct them; pathos escape him, and he's puzzled on how to effectively stage character-oriented drama and star-crossed romance. Danny Elfman's wintry score sounds fantastic, and Johnny Depp is perfect in the lead (though it's a stunt part); however, the writing is so muddled that audiences came out of the picture not knowing how to feel about the damsel in distress (Winona Ryder), her parents (Alan Arkin and Dianne Wiest) or, for that matter, Edward himself.

A strange but beautiful story !,"General information about the movie:Edward Scissorhands is an American movie directed by Tim Burton, written by Caroline Thompson and produced by Denise Di Novi and Tim Burton. This film was directed in 1990, and we can find : Johnny Depp who plays Edward, Winona Ryder as Kim Boggs, Dianne Wiest as Peg Boggs, Alan Arkin as Bill Boggs, Robert Oliver as Kevin Boggs, Anthony Michael Hall as Jim and Vincent Price as the inventor. Edward Scissorhands was the fourth feature film collaboration between the director Tim Burton and composer Danny Elfman. The orchestra consisted of 79 musicians. The head of the set was Bo Welch. This movie was awarded 12 prizes, the Hugo prize, the Saturn award and many others Edward Scissorhands received critical acclaim from critics and audiences : « A fantastic family show » ; « Straight from the heart a stunning final that knocks you sideway » ; « At once modern and old fashioned, playful and melancholic and exactly right for this most sweety stirring of family shows ». This movie was very successful and in 2008, « Empire » magazine ranked it 66th on the list of 500 best movies of all time !Personal opinion :This is a Tim Burton movie, for sure. Tim Burton offers us an incredible fairy tail as only he knows how to do and we like that ! The story is simple but every detail has a meaning ! Edward is not quite a man as he was created by a inventor though he was appalling, is more human that anyone else ! Burton strongly lives up to the hype, though a conformist society and perpetual judgment. It's a poignant and naive tale yet both sad and terrible. Terrible in the accuracy of the representation of jealousy, hypocrisy and wickedness of man, this is the real message of the director in this movie. It's masterfully interpreted, all actors take ownership of their role perfectly but it's sadly funny at times. Tim Burton is a genius in the art of getting you through emotions with a beautiful set but also music that is very well chosen every time. We see some similarities between some of Tim Burton's movies, for example, the house of the hero is often isolated as in Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice and Batman.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Frankenstein meets The Cure in Tim Burton's masterpiece about the social obstacles in front of orphans with prosthetic limbs.,"SPOILERS - Diane Weiss plays Peg, a woman who one day enters a creepy hilltop mansion yelling ""Avon calling""... umm, more like ""woman intruding!"" Diane enters a room in bad need of roof repair. That's when we're introduced to Ed, a creepy looking dark dweller with black hair, white skin and scars on his face. But this guy isn't as Emo as he looks. Well, come to think of it, he actually does look kind of depressed. What I mean is, despite the scars on his face, he doesn't cut himself on purpose. Edward is an orphan who has yet to discover the aphrodisiacal quality of ambrosia salad and Diane with her motherly instincts, decides it's time to introduce Ed to mediocre middle classdom. At first, things seem hopeful. Wynona Ryder appears as a bodacious blonde after living under a black cloud in Beetlejuice and becomes Eddie's snow queen if only for a few beautiful seconds. But suburban life ultimately proves difficult for Scissorstein. Peas are less than easy peasy, lemonade is as sour as Anthony Michael Hall's jealousy and the line between happy hair cut and happy ending becomes blurred. He also wets the bed.Ed bares a slight resemblance to that other black haired, white faced man of mystery, especially if you look at the album cover of Bad. While the similarities to Michael Jackson might seem superficial, they are in fact significant for the fact that he experiences a similar plight to that of Jacko's own fall from grace. Society's reaction to Ed will go from adoration and fascination to fear and paranoia faster than you can say poodle do. After initially accepting Ed and his talents, the white bread burbies become weirded out by him. That's when Ed is faced with the question of moonwalking out of Dodge or staying and being the neighborhood hedge/dog groomer.When you sit down to watch this film and you see that it's set in cookie cutter suburbia, you might think this is a warm and fuzzy fable. Then Johnny Depp emerges from the shadows as a leathery lad with a puckery pale face and Robert Smith's hairdo. Naturally, this makes for a more complex tale. And while it may not be warm and fuzzy, it is definitely warm-hearted. Don't be fooled by the sharp fingers, Edward Scissorhands will touch your heart without cutting it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
The worst kind of garbage.,"Knowing beforehand who was in this movie and who directed it I was expecting a masterpiece of a movie, to rival the likes of Beetlejuice or Batman - instead, I had to sit and watch Johnny Depp do a reasonably good impression of a man with too many valium inside him and an over-abundance of ""mood-lighting"" and misplaced SFX.It seems that everyone on the planet who has given an opinion but me loved this flick, and I think it must be something they were putting in the food at the time it was released or something, because nearly 14 years after I first saw this film, I am still trying to find something not to hate about it.I guess this is the culprit for allowing over-produced schmaltz to become ""blockbusters"" and as such, Tim Burton should be sent immediately to Movie-Jail (without passing ""Go"" and without collecting umpty-zillion dollars so that this kind of crap can NEVER be inflicted upon the world again!) After all, if the public would swallow this crap, they'd swallow ANY garbage that has a great director, a great producer, great cast, and a script that was written by a bunch of chimpanzees on Ecstacy.For more examples of the ""Written-By-Monkeys-On-Drugs"" movies, I can highly recommend Titanic, Pearl Harbor, Cutthroat Island, and maybe Vanilla Sky or Batman & Robin ..... As an alternative to watching Edward Scissorhands or any of the other above-mentioned films, I could suggest laying in the road and letting someone beat you with a baseball bat as a better way to spend your time .... probably less painful and better for you in the long run.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Great satire,"A young man who is ""highly imaginative,"" sensitive, awkward, and very different tries to fit in to the life in the suburbs of traditional America, circa the 1960's. Burton does a fantastic job of satirizing this world of conformity, with things like the houses in pastel colors and the TV in the backyard, as well as the father figure who thinks he has all the answers. I loved the symbolism of the scissors, clearly the signs of creative genius and something that sets their owner apart, but can be woefully misunderstood. (Side note, I want some dinosaur topiary where I live!). I thought it was kind of unfortunate that the film settled in to such a mundane plot, with the old trope of the girl dating a jerk and starting to understand that he's a jerk after meeting the outsider, thus setting up the final conflict. The ending is ridiculously corny too. I wish the plot had been as creative as the visuals, but the film still holds up 31 years later as a decent enough watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Brilliant,"I'll tell you off the bat that Tim Burton is my favorite director and when I was reading up on this movie and I rented it I was skeptical because it seemed a little too weird. However this movie was yet another showcase of the brilliance of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. The atmosphere Tim Burton sets is like Sleepy Hollow and Nightmare Before Christmas in Edwards mansion and a lot like the town of Spectre in Big Fish in the town they live in. The basic synopsis of this movie is a door to door saleswoman named Peg finds a frankenstein-esquire character, Edward Scissorhands, in a mansion and takes him in. He struggles to learn and live life with other people because he has scissors for hands. This movie may sound strange but it is deep and brilliant and a modern classic.

Edward Scissorhands : American director Tim Burton has made a fairy tale for viewers of all age groups.,"In American film 'Edward Scissorhands', director Tim Burton has questioned the curious attitudes of a small section of American society. The focus is on the arrival of a young man with some 'special abilities' whose alluring charm has mesmerized everybody. His film describes some people from a small town who are not ready to accept the presence of somebody different in their midst. For 'Edward Scissorhands', a lot of creative imagination has been used especially in depicting how the lead character was created and where he has resided for a long time. As a popular entertainer which has received both critical as well as commercial acclaim, this Tim Burton film is a fairy tale for viewers of all age groups with a lot of potential to learn.

Edward Scissorhands: A Touching Story,"This movie tells a very different kind of story. It's a bit strange, but also quite lovely; Edward is a man who has scissors instead of regular hands. He lives alone in a big dark castle, but one day, a nice lady named Peg finds him and takes him home to live with her family. He has great abilities at cutting things with his scissor hands; however, he faces a challenge. Some people in the neighborhood are amazed by his talent, but on the other hand, they are afraid of him because he looks different.Edward Scissorhands is a U. S. fantasy and romance film directed by Tim Burton in 1990. Personally, I can see that the vibe of the movie, especially Edward, is related to other Burton films, an example of this can be seen in the movie's colors. While Edward and his castle are in black and gray, showing boredom, monotony, and almost no life, Peg's neighborhood is full of bright colors and life, which highlights the differences in their lifestyles. The lead was interpreted by Johnny Depp; even though it was one of his early acting roles, he did an incredible job as a lonely, gloomy, and naive young man. Throughout the whole movie, I could watch and empathize with his confusion and fear of rejection.The soundtrack made by Danny Elfman is really special because it gives the movie a feeling of a distant fairy tale. The orchestra becomes a part of the story by mixing catchy and emotional music with a bit of darkness and fantasy. It's a perfect musical representation of the strange world in which the movie takes place.In this film, you can identify ítems of loneliness, acceptance, and the idea that being different it's okay. It will make you think about what it means to be different and how kindness can make a big change in someone's life.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Although you may not get it and love it'll be very rare if the words rubbish come out of your mouth.This is an original film based on young man who was created. Okay maybe stole from Frankenstein there but hey. Anyways he was created by an old man. However the old man had died before Edward was fully created the last thing that wasn't done was his hands. Hence the name Edwars scissorhands. So he lived by himself in a lonesome castle and well it seemed obvious that he was depressed and alone. Till one day a chirpy, avon sales woman found him and took him to the peachy keen suburbs.So the film is based around that and funny and upsetting moments ensue. It is a great film. However i would suggest those who are really young don't watch just for the fact that it's an unusual film that could scare REALLY young children.

One of my favorite ten movies ever,"I saw this wonderful movie in 1990 when it first came out. I was already a Tim Burton fan of sorts, but this made me a Burton fanatic. I saw it first with my wife, and I remember thinking at the very beginning, when Danny Elfman's haunting, beautiful score was only a few notes old, that I was going to love this film. And I did. It just hit me right in the heart, in the most vulnerable, deepest part of my soul. I know that sounds pretentious, but it's the best I can do with my limited writing ability. Now understand, I was 39 years old at the time, a pipefitter/welder by trade, certainly not someone people would think of as ""sensitive"" or ""artistic"" by nature. I've been in more than my share of fistfights, ride a Harley, and love guns, power tools, and anything that explodes. But by the end of Edward Scissorhands, especially at the Ice Dance scene, I was sobbing like a little girl. My wife had to help me out of the theatre, because my eyes were so tear-swollen I could barely see. I admit I have a weakness for characters that are outsiders, or (to borrow from Heinlein) ""strangers in a strange land"", but what Tim Burton and Johnny Depp did with this scissor-handed man was nothing short of magical. I took my 16 year old daughter to see it the next day, and I started tearing up at the beginning this time, knowing what was coming. As we left the theatre, Liz was stone-faced, and I was desperately clenched against the flood of emotion I was holding back. I didn't want to look like a fool in front of her. When we got into the sunlight, we looked at each other, and I saw that she was trying as hard as me not to break down. Which is exactly what we both proceeded to do, right there in front of the theatre. We held each other and sobbed. And I felt closer to her than I had in a long time. Thank you, Tim Burton, for that moment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
a sweet film that portrays the good and bad in suburban life with originality,"Every couple of years I sit and watch Edward Scissorhands when it's on TV, just as a reminder of how much Tim Burton can do so well storytelling on a kind of universal level. As the film is much like a fairy tale like the Ugly Duckling, it can work for young and old. But it would be just a very good children's film if not for Burton's iconoclastic kind of vision, which has its form here in one of its most pure sightings (as he rarely writes his own films, this is one of the few that mark as his completely). The characters are not complicated at all, and anything standing between the two who fall for one another- Johnny Depp's Edward and Winona Ryder's Kim- is just attitudes in a small town kind of atmosphere. It's actually a film even more based on behavior than actual plot, and despite the absurdity nature given to the look of the town and the obviously Gothic look of Vincent Price's Professor's castle, it's as much a tome of American drama as American Beauty is, in its way.Depp is in his breakout performance here, with the role that took him apart from his 21 Jump Street days as a character who could just as well work, if not better, as a silent-film character. In fact, the kind of Lon Chaney characteristic that's been applied to Depp in the past years is more than evident in this film, as his wounded Edward has a vulnerability that Depp rarely gets to play this well. The roundup of supporting actors is quite good too, with Dianne Weist as the housewife who finds him in the castle and takes him down to the town. Ryder too is in a good role too, especially when playing off of the very against type Anthony Michael Hall (yes, the Breakfast Club nerd) as a jock who becomes quite an antagonist. The little scenes of Edward acclamating to the small-town life, cutting and shaping hair and bushes his specialty, are interesting and amusing. But it's in the final fifteen to twenty minutes when the darker portion of this tale takes shape. And, it's likely, aside from scenes in Big Fish, the most affecting Burton's ever fashioned.One of the better films of 1990.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
This movie hits all the right notes,"Edward Scissorhands is a very unique film. It's dark, funny, sad, Gothic, but most of all, beautiful. The movie is powered by strong performances from Depp and Ryder, in a movie that sends a powerful message on ""judging a book by its cover"". Everything in this movie is so well done: the cinematography using the trademark Burton style using models of the town as seen in Beetlejuice; the acting, the soundtrack, the amazing makeup and costumes, it all fits in perfectly to create what is arguably Burton's best movie. What's most funny about the movie is the town filled with housewives that gossip about pretty much everything and anyone. They are full of themselves and just fake and shallow, but it's presented in a great, funny way. The romance in the movie is also great.Edward Scissorhands is a masterpiece, a beautiful movie that will transcend and continue to cause emotions on viewers for a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A Wonderful Fairy Tale,"Tim Burton had made three great movies during the 80s such as ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure;"" ""Beetlejuice;"" and ""Batman."" Now as we enter in the 90s, Burton makes a movie about a man with his hands that are razor sharp scissors and my thoughts on the movie was wonderful. ""Edward Scissorhands"" is a wonderful fairy tale that is Gothic; funny; sad; and totally original. This is the first movie that Burton collaborates with Johnny Depp before they go on to make movies together such as ""Ed Wood;"" ""Sleepy Hollow;"" ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory;"" ""Corpse Bride;"" ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street;"" ""Alice in Wonderland;"" and so far ""Dark Shadows."" Don't know what they will work on next. I know everyone gets sick of Burton for casting Depp and Burton's wife Helena Bonham Carter to be in movies together, but I have no issues with that whatsoever. Anyway, I thought Depp did such a fascinating job for playing the main character of the film's premise. Also, I thought Winona Ryder was really good in her role as Edward's love interest. Anthony Michael Hall and the rest of the cast all did great. I thought Danny Elfman's music was beautifully well scored, and I thought the look of Depp's character is extremely well done. I don't have any problems with the movie, but I know that this movie is one of Burton's greatest achievements. I give ""Edward Scissorhands"" a 10 out of 10. Check it out!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Absolutely Beautiful..,"Direction, cinematography, acting, and plot... all beautiful. Just like the creations that Scissorhands creates in the film, every element of this movie is hauntingly beautiful - artistically pleasing, with undertones of hurt and pain.Edward Scissorhands is the creation of a brilliant inventor, who successfully created a fully functional human from machine parts. However, he dies before he is able to give Edward his last finishing touch: human hands. Edward remains isolated and alone inside his dark castle, longing to know about the outside world while passing away his time letting his imagination run free in the elaborate hedges he creates in the garden. It is not until a curious Avon representative, Peg, goes to the castle and meets Edward that he becomes integrated into her pastel-perfect community - finally finding the human interaction he so craved...unfortunately although things start off looking good, it doesn't quite end so well.""You can't touch anything without destroying it,"" is one quote that really stuck with me in this movie. The fact that Edward is missing hands is significant - human hands are symbolic of touch, of connection - and without them Edward is forever disconnected. He has so much talent within his scissorhands, but he is unable to establish a true human connection - in a way, this can be interpreted as a reflection of artistic prodigies in general (Michael Jackson, Tim Burton himself) - able to create and entertain, but are inherently isolated and lonely.A deeply touching movie, a must-see for anyone who hasn't already watched.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"One of the most beautiful, yet sad films I have ever watched","Johnny Depp is excellent as Edward. He is one of my favourite actors and this film is one of his best. He doesn't have very many lines in the film, but he doesn't need lines to give a superb performance.The film portrays Edwards emotions of being an outsider- wanting to please, to fit in, to love and to be loved.I have watched this film many times now and still cry during it. It really draws you into the movie and you feel for Edward. I brought the DVD as it is a must for my collection.Wonderfully written, produced, directed and acted.I definitely recommend you watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
I LOVED this movie!,"This movie is absolutely my fave! I am a huge fan of johnny depp, but this one is most likely one of his greatest film in my mind. I also enjoyed secret window, but it was a lil too creepy for my liking...anyway, If you like comedy, tragedy, and a bit of oddity thrown in for kicks, then this is the movie for u!I thought it was quite a refreshment from all the usual war/romance flicks. And although i was very young when it came out, I can still enjoy it, with or without all the hightech animation and fight scenes that we have today!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A story that should make you sick to your stomach with society's immorality,"I am extatic about this movie. I remember watching it the first time and feeling sick by the end of it, realizing that our society is really a farcical world. Johnny Depp, although VERY young, portrays the emotion of a character so well, I sometimes forget it is Johnny Depp playing the part. The busy bodies of the neighbourhood talk so much but say so little, while Edward hardly speaks, yet says so much more. I could go on for ever. Tim Burton and Danny Elfman really make this movie their own. The music is incredible, and perfect for the mood and tone, and Tim Burton, my favorite director of all time, pulls out all the stops once again and wows the audience with his imagination, his cleverness and his ability to make you see reality. This movie is a total must-see and a perfect 10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Worse than Beetlejuice.,"I hated Edward Scissorhands when I saw it 34 years ago, and having just rewatched the movie for the first time since then, I can say that I still don't like it. It's a treacly, romantic fantasy love story that sees director Tim Burton going overboard with his quirky gothic weirdness. Here's ten things that I hate about the film:1. Winona Ryder: I never understood the appeal.2. The scissor hands: why would an inventor give his creation scissors for hands when almost anything, even nothing, would be preferable? Short answer: he wouldn't.3. Edward's aesthetic: firstly, much of the look of the character is a rip-off of The Tailor from German children's book Struwwelpeter. And then Burton pops him in a leather bondage outfit that wouldn't look out of place in an S&M sex club and gives him his own messy hairstyle (we get it, Tim... you identify as the outcast weirdo).4. The sickeningly 'haunting' choral score by Danny Elfman. Every time it strikes up, I wanna hurl.5. The topiary: somehow, Edward shapes small bushes into large sculptures. He actually makes the bushes bigger by cutting them with his scissors. He's Alan Titchmarsh and Paul Daniels all rolled into one.6. The ice sculptures: where does Edward get the huge blocks of ice from? And how does he get them into the attic?7. All of the characters: I didn't like any of them. The neighbours were intentionally obnoxious, the inventor was an idiot, and Kim was played by Winona Ryder.8. Those stupid hairstyles: Edward does one bad haircut, and then they all want one. As if.9. That stupid cookie machine: the whisk whisks for about 2 seconds and the cookie cutters dangle loosely over the dough but somehow it produces perfectly cut cookies. But it's quirky, so who cares? I do!10. The ending: Kim tells the angry mob that Edward is dead, so they just turn around and go home. They don't bother to check for themselves. And no-one in the next several decades goes to see why snow pours out of the castle on the hill. Aaargh!I'm sure there are many more things that I didn't like about this film, but to list them would require me to watch the film again and take notes, and I'm not doing that. I guess the thing that gets my back up the most is the way that many people treat Edward Scissorhands like it's a masterpiece. It's not.",2.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
This Entire Movie Is Like Watching Art,"As a movie fan throughout my entire life, I can definitely tell you that the only movie to ever make me cry was Edward Scissorhands. Now it didn't make me cry last night, but when I watched it for the first time 10 years ago, it did. I don't know how, but apparently, the romance between Edward and Kim got to me. I can't hate them for it. The story itself is beautiful, heartwarming, and really moving. Edward Scissorhands is a Johnny Depp character at its finest. Even with his sharp touch, he's absolutely harmless. Every time you see Edward Scissorhands, you feel for him. This movie also benefits from the style of the cinematography and the production design, which perfectly blends in with the odd story to convey that emotion. Director Tim Burton and Johnny Depp would go on to collaborate on more movies ever since, but Edward Scissorhands remains as a masterpiece for both of them.Score: 99/100Recommendation: Anyone",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Tim Burton's most personal and relevant film...,"Edward Scissorhands was a transitional film, not just for its director, but also its star. While it was often overlooked and avoided by the mainstream audience when it was first released, people who have more in common with its titular character than they realised at that time have since embraced it with open arms. Watching it seventeen years later, I can understand how it put some members of the audience off, as it is also Tim Burton's most serious, least light-hearted film. In contrast to Batman, Ed Wood, or even Corpse Bride, Edward Scissorhands is played completely straight, with every note of the story intended to be taken seriously. Or so one might think from experiencing the manner in which the story is presented. Although it is tempting to think of Edward Scissorhands as being intended as satire or a joke, everything that the public knows about Burton suggests that he was totally and utterly serious about the message of the film, both those intended and those that the people the film particularly appeals to have discerned.At its heart, Edward Scissorhands concerns itself with an Avon saleslady named Peg, who finds the titular character within a haunting-looking Gothic mansion after a particular bad day at the grindstone. Unsure what to make of her new acquaintance, she brings him home and embarks on an effort to domesticate him, for lack of a better word. Figuring that all one needs is love, she slowly introduces Edward to the rest of the family, and eventually the neighborhood. At first, everything goes swimmingly, with Edward finding his rather strange condition allows him to do things the stiff-minded townsfolk would not deem possible. But with such sudden acceptance also comes a degree of unhealthy curiosity, not to mention jealousy. As Peg's daughter, played by Winona Ryder in one of her rare fits of relevance, takes more of an interest in the new arrival than she probably should, the normie element starts to deliberate about how to besmirch Edward's character. The manner in which they subsequently behave will strike many who have something in common with the director as oddly familiar.Much of Edward's background is told through the use of flashbacks that not only detail how Edward lived before he was discovered by the bored housewife, but also why he is in the state he is in. The film, or rather its publicity materials, describe him as being unfinished, but I really hesitate to use that word in this context. Unfinished, incomplete, or variations thereof have a very specific connotation, and the reality is that this connotation is very different from the Edward Scissorhands we see in the film. For certain, he lacks fingers, but he not only comes across as being far more sincere than those around him. He also demonstrates that what he lacks, a fully formed set of hands, is far less important than what the townsfolk he is introduced to in the first act lack, an open mind or an imagination. It is no coincidence that the hairstyles and greenery sculptures that he creates using his bladed fingers take on shapes that never occur in the imaginations of the townsfolk. Or within the imaginations of members of the audience, for that matter.As I said, the film marks a transition. Director Tim Burton was starting to be taken seriously as a director with a unique creative vision. Batman had just made so much money that one of its stars wound up being paid more than some small countries make in a year. Beetlejuice was prompting grapevine talk of this weird director who portrayed the afterlife as being warmer than the world of the living. And then there was the star of Edward Scissorhands, a former teen idol by the name of Johnny Depp. Although the effect took more time to become more discernible for Depp, this is but one of the films that began to make audiences and the press alike take him more seriously. Even though he was already twenty-one when he made his debut, it is easy to look back on his early appearances and realise he demonstrates more talent than anyone he shares the screen with. After working with Burton for half a dozen films, I am sure Depp must realise just how perfectly they are matched. The only other actor that comes close to benefiting so much from Burton's direction is Michael Keaton.Indeed, regardless of the colour scheme Burton uses for the different environments of his films, he manages to make one sharply repulsive compared to the other. The mansion in which Edward is found is dark, foreboding, and haunting. Yet it is at the same time so warm and inviting, thanks in no small part to a strong score by Danny Elfman, that one wants to run away with Edward and tell this normalised world they are never coming back. Indeed, after being denied knowledge of what I am for so long, and seeing normies get away with what would be called perjury in a just world during this film, I have to ask those normies one thing. Yours is a world of respect with trust, and mine is not? Tim Burton is therefore not just a director of unique and extraordinary vision. He is the voice for a neglected minority that is being assaulted from all sides by normalists and negationists. Whether he intended this is beside the point, as Edward Scissorhands demonstrates. That he does it so well, and so passionately, makes the end result infinitely more watchable.It is for these reasons and more that Edward Scissorhands is an unqualified ten out of ten film. Burton does not just offer a piece of himself here, he reaches out and touches so many.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

THE best film ever!,"this is the best film ever because it's a mix of many different genres and it blends them all together perfectly. Johnny Depps performance should have won an ""Oscar"" that year because it's simply brilliant he is both enchanting and funny. But the one who is even better than Johnny Depp is Vincent Price as ""the inventor"" I caught myself shaking and sometimes crying after every scene with him.Another star in this movie would be Danny Elfmans music it stays in your mind a long time after you have seen the movie. the music alone made me cry at the end of the film and I had to watch the end credits all the way till the end.Some people might have problems with the fairly simple story but since it is a fairytale at least I didn't have any complains about it.since there is hardly any visual effects in the film it should be a very long lasting one and in my case I would love to make it a Christmas tradition in the future.Enough now! go and rent it or buy it you simply have to see this movie it's Tim Burtons and Johnny Depps best collaboration yet and probably the greatest film of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Come on.  You know summarizing a Tim Burton movie is impossible.,"This is my favorite movie. Never mind that Winona Ryder uses age makeup that wouldn't fool an extra on a Planet of the Apes sequel. Never mind that this movie began the career of the Frankenstein creature that had once been a skinny teen named Anthony Michael Hall. Never mind that Burton chose style over logic in a lot of scenes. Edward Scissorhands is a movie for weirdos about weirdos. If the Goth crowd hadn't clung to Nightmare Before Christmas as their unofficial banner of nonconformity, this movie would have filled the hole. It's odd and funny and very, very poetic. The suburbs are portrayed as deeply strange, and counterbalance the deeply strange characters with pastels. If you're a rebel, or a hedge-trimming enthusiast, or a kid trapped in the suburbs, or a human being at all, you will be touched by this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Beautiful, moving, rare, quality cinema","Tim Burton at his best as he not only directs this but was one of the writers. The ultimate ode to the oddball. Whoever you are and in whatever quality you may've been treated wrong because you were different, whether for race, creed, religion or whatever, this will speak volumes to you. This is one of these pieces that urges to show the viewer who the real monsters are, and where true beauty really lies, and in a way that applies to so many situations in the daily life. But this isn't easy, self-indulgent or gratuitous. From the pastel-colored neighborhood and houses, to the utter uniformity of its people from the way their dress to the way they behave, the conform/biased understanding of right and wrong... both highly interesting and applicable food for thought. The story is so perfectly crafted to accommodate its plan, and it never lets out; we're given about 1hr45 of strongly crafted, constantly renewed plot and story, with each scene and more largely each section depicting a particular emotion, lesson or deep symbol. This is only strengthened by excellent score music from Elfman, in parts highly moving, and visually the film is greatly and so delicately poetic all the while being so unique and authentic. No film had ever felt like Edward Scissorhands, and no film has since.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Misses the point,"Tim Burton has a unique, instantly recognisable style, but he has no sense of balance and tends to go way over the top.That's the main problem of Edward Scissorhands, starting from the most important aspect, which is the stereotypical, cartoonish characters, who don't have the slightest connection to reality whatsoever and appear as pure caricatures, all the way to the fairytale-like setting (the colourful little houses in contrast to the dark, menacing tower).As a result, there's no subtlety in the social commentary either. Yes, society is indeed cruel and shows pretty much zero tolerance to anything different or out of the ordinary, trying to eliminate it at the drop of a hat, but this in-your-face type of message doesn't make for the most interesting, entertaining or thought-provoking viewing experience.",3.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A classic,"Even though Edward Scissorahands doesn't talk much, Johnny Depp is still able to show the emotion and sadness in this characters eyes and face. He did such an amazing job in this role and should have gotten an Oscar for it.I personally don't like Wynona Rider as an actress, but she was perfection in this. The two of them made the perfect pair.The humour, the plot, storyline and everything was perfect. This is a Tim Burton classic.The ending was sad and very touching. If you've been bullied or are an outcast this movie will make you emotional. It made me emotional!If it's ever on TV or you see it in a local walmart, buy it.

"Strange, beautiful fairytale from Tim Burton and Danny Elfman","I loved this film when I was 11; now I'm 22, I've just bought the DVD and fallen in love with it all over again. In some ways, Edward Scissorhands is an update of the Frankenstein story: an artificial being, created by a mad old scientist, and his attempts to fit into the human world. But there's more to it than that. The actors all give fantastic performances, for example, Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Alan Arkin, and of course, Vincent Price. Tim Burton's amazing aesthetic vision is fully realised here in the contrast between the colourful, sanitised, plastic town, and the monochrome, industrial world of Edward and his creator. It's one of the few films that genuinely manages to be funny and sad in turn, without getting TOO sentimental. Finally, Danny Elfman's haunting music completes the sense of wonder that this film produces. Very highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Truly Beautiful Film,"For Tim Burton, this is typical. This movie reveals the art and beauty of film making and I'm surprised it is not on the Top 250. The movie is a tale of unbelievable sadness and epic romance. Johnny played Edward perfectly. No wonder he is so popular! He is great! The movies script was not weak at all! It was perfect. The only thing I found strange was the name clash of ""Kim"" and ""Jim"".The story is brilliant. Edward is a man created by an inventor(played by the gem Vincent Price). The inventor dies and Edward is left at the inventors mansion, all alone. One day, a women, Peg(Dianne Wiest) enters the mansion selling AVON products. She goes into the attic where she meets a man with scissor hands. She is shocked at first by his hands and the scars on his face. She takes him back to her house and he meets her family, her son Kevin, husband Bill(Alan Arkin) and beautiful daughter Kim. Along the way, he falls in Kim, who is dating the jerk, Jim.Overall, it is a gorgeous film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
One of the greatest films ever made,"Tim Burton's EDWARD SCISSORHANDS is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. It is simply such a treat to watch a film about a man with such childlike ability and innocence. And yet he has talent and a good heart. He creates art and is happy to know that what he thought was just a hobby to do when he's bored can be so attention grabbing. This fantasy film is a simple one told mostly in images. An Avon lady(Diane Weist) is having a typical rotten day when she sees a creepy looking castle way off in the distance. She takes her chances and drives all the way up to the castle. She finds a pale looking man(Johnny Depp) in the attic and sees that he is missing his hands and in place of where his hands should be, there are different shards and colors of scissors. This sight scares her at first, but eventually she feels deeply sorry for him and takes him home with her. The neighbors see him in her car and so begins the gossip. ""A man with scissors for hands?!"" ""What a weird looking man!"" ""Who in the world is that?"" ""What is he doing here?"" The man is talked about by everyone. He befriends the Avon lady's laid back husband(Alan Arkin) and her young son(Robert Oliveri).Later in the film, The Avon Lady's beautiful daughter, Kim(Wynona Rider), shows up and meets Edward too. And eventually he becomes popular with the neighbors when he shows that his scissor hands can create absolute beauty. Unfortunitly, he is taken advantage of, and that is when darkness begins to shroud the town's usual colorful spirit. Edward has disadvantages with his scissor hands and yet nobody except for Kim sees him as a man who is complicated and scared of this new world he has entered. Edward is somewhat clumsy, he is very unsettling looking with his cuts and scars all over his face, and he is quiet. Everyone ignores these characteristics except for Kim. The neighbors, when he shows something different in his usual activities, freak out! The people run from him, he is molested in the back of a hair salon by a strange woman, he is attacked by Kim's boyfriend, and he ends up being expelled from this so called normal world. The musical score by Danny Elfman is absolutely spell bounding. Quite possibly the prettiest soundtrack in motion picture history. It completely fits with the classic feel of the neighborhood and the mystery of Edward. This is my favorite Tim Burton film and I believe that everyone should see it for its beauty, its love, its look, and Edward. The film is hypnotizing. Vincent Price, the nice inventor, gives his best( and last) performance to date, and the flashbacks involving him are an absolute joy to watch. They are touching, beautiful, revealing, horrifying, and spell bounding. He may have been even more childlike than Edward in fact. In one flashback, he is shown reading to Edward and he suddenly exclaims ""This is boring!"" so he switches to some funny poetry and teaches Edward to smile. This film must be seen.",,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
.,"Edward Scissorhands, directed by Tim Burton (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Planet of the Apes), is a movie with one very strong message. Throughout the movie it is shown that in most places there is not much room for acceptance. Tim Burton wrote in a passage after making this movie that the strongest impulse for the film was to show that from day one people categorise you. I believe that Tim Burton demonstrated this message very well in the movie. However, as much as I agree with the message in the movie, overall I didn't like the actual movie at all. For me in some places it was too dark and for a family movie the strong themes and messages in it could be confusing for children. I believe that maybe it could have been advertised to an older audience, rather than families. I also found this movie to be boring at some points, but that is only my opinion. Nevertheless you cannot deny that the acting in this movie is not to be commended for. Johnny Depp who plays Edward in the movie did a fine job at portraying his character, as did Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Anthony Michael Hall and all of the other actors and actresses in this movie. Overall I would give this movie three stars, but only because of the creative way the message was expressed and the quality of the actors.",5.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Timeless fairy tale,"This is probably my favourite Tim Burton movie.I hadn't watched it in many years but that scene of Dianne Wiest going Avon calling! always stuck with me.The visual impact of this movie is mind-blowing. Paired with an enrapturing soundtrack makes this film a modern day (at the time) fairy tale that will capture your attention and never let it go.There is a hint of magic and sadness and innocence and danger throughout the narrative while people first go around their normal lives and then try to get to know this mysterious character.The colour details are simply mesmerising. The gaudy coloured houses and cars, the lawns and dogs and everything that makes this the perfect neighbourhood where lonely housewives don't have much to do but gossip. Everything is bright and everyone is the caricature of happiness, but in a very realistic manner, if that makes any sense.As soon as things begin to turn darker for Edward, so do the colours around him. Then of course there is the magical scene of Winona Ryder dancing in the 'snow' and the crescendo up to the gruesome finale just sucks you in. The eeriness that kept creeping with the mansion's flashbacks finally culminates into a very broken heart for yours truly.It is not meant to be a realistic story.

A Film That Needed More Strength From The Crew,"This is an alright film that could have been better. It did not seem enough. The creations and imagination of Tim Burton are unique but sometimes it is not enough. The storyline of this film needed something else. The cast selection could have easily been better. They did not fully commit nor connect to the storyline nor to their respective characters. There was not enough chemistry between the cast members and that really could have helped. This film reveals to viewers that it is perfectly fine to be different. I was born different. I was born with a really rare syndrome that is a combination of disabilities and health conditions but I was always treated differently.

Not only does he look the part in his Gothic attire, but his performance really has you believing that he is in fact the character he is playing.The supporting cast are also good, Winona Ryder plays her role fine as Kim Boggs, Eddy's love interest, however I think the other stand out character is Dianne West who plays ""Peg Boggs"" the Avon lady. Her performance is really heartwarming, and you cant help but love her!There isn't much else i can say about this movie that hasn't been said million times over, only that its a truly great movie that's fun for all the family.-Highly Recommended",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
One of Burton's finest!...,"To me, this is one of Tim Burton's finest works; I must admit I have been less than impressed with his more recent offerings, but he was bang on form the day he came up with this one! A modern fairytale set in what appears to be 1950's American suburbia; everything about it is almost perfect. Everything from the music by Danny Elfman to the effects by Stan Winston is brilliantly done and works so well together. But I digress, here's a brief summary before I heap more praise on this wonderful film.When housewife, and Avon lady, Peg Boggs decides to visit the big ruined house on the hill, she comes back with more than she expected. There she finds a young man, Edward, who, for some inexplicable reason, has scissors for hands. We are told, in flashback, how this came to be; the inventor had made him that way but had sadly died before he could complete his work. Edward is soon the talk of the neighbourhood and when it is discovered that he can do brilliant topiary (hedge clipping) and even cut and style hair, he becomes a bit of a celebrity. He soon grows a fondness for Peg's daughter, Kim, who is going out with local rich kid, Jim. He's a bit of a bully and things are about to turn a bit nasty for Edward. I will leave my summary here or the Spoiler Police will send me back to that draughty house on the hill (again).I love the look and feel of this film; everything seems to fit in the world Burton has created perfectly. With no CGI I think the effects are really great, I'm still trying to figure out how some of it was done! Excellent performances all round and so honourable mentions go to; Johnny Depp as Edward, Winona Ryder as Kim, Dianne Wiest, who I think was really great as Peg, Anthony Michael Hall as Jim, Kathy Baker as Joyce, Alan Arkin as Bill and in one of his last roles, Vincent Price as The Inventor.There is a lot about this film to like, and much I have mentioned already. On the downside though, I did find the plot a little predictable in that there had to be a bad guy, a damsel in distress and a sacrifice. This is the only thing that lets it down. I really like this film and would love to give it a higher score, but I guess the studio had its say in the end. But it's not all that bad; it still comes very highly recommended from me.My score: 8.9/10 IMDb Score: 8.0/10 (based on 143,869 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 91/100 (based on 54 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

Tim Burton's masterpiece,"There came a time in my life when I changed different hobbies; from watching TV shows; mainly cartoons; to movies; to video games. I never really knew what piece of entertainment I was really into. When I watched Edward Scissorhands however; I just knew what I really loved. Edward Scissorhands is about a man created by a scientist in a castle. The scientist dies and the man; named Edward; is isolated and all alone in the castle. A woman named Peg; played by Dianne Wiest; stumbles upon Edward and welcomes him to his home. The movie then is about Edward trying to fit in with society; the town; and even finds love on the way.Edward Scissorhands is one of my favorite movies of all time; its story's and characters resonated with me so much. your with Edward every step of the way. The theme of the movie is about being different; trying to fit in; and the way people can use you for good and bad reasons.A romance blossoms between Edward and Pegs daughter; Kim; played by the wonderful Winona Ryder; and oh gosh; its like a modern fairy tale.Its incredibly sweet and full of charm. Its as if Edward was a reflection of Burton himself. Being eccentric and misunderstood at the same time. The film gives a good point about how just because you may look like a monster ( Edwards Scissorhands) but on the inside is much more kinder than any of the supposedly ""normal"" townspeople who accuse Edward of being a monster. Not just that; the fact that the teens in the movie allegedly led Edward to his ultimate demise. Its a sad and poignant movie. The scene when Edward creates statues using ice while also making the scenery snow all at the same time; is both emotional; complex; and poignant; all at the same time and is sure to get everyone teary eyed as well.Score: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Burtons best,"Surprised that this doesn't have a higher score: one of the best films of the 90s.If you haven't watched it yet, go for it, you won't ever regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
One of Burton's best,"Let me start by saying Tim Burton is my all-time favorite director. All of his films deal with the shy outcast who struggles to fit into society, usually with mixed results and ""Edward Scissorhands"" is probably Burton's greatest achievement.An artificial man (masterfully played by Johnny Depp) is taken from his secluded, castle home to modern day suburbia by a cheery saleslady. From there, the film becomes a fairy tale with Edward falling in love with a young cheerleader played by the gifted Winona Ryder.Burton brings so much to this film. It's production design is wondrous, the cast is a joy (with an amusing cameo by Vincent Price) and the story is well told. The fact the film also has a non-traditional ending makes it all the more unique.A modern masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Stunning,"This film just leaves me breathless every time I watch it. It's visually stunning, Tim Burton merges beauty and hideousness to create one of the most incredible films visually. The Suburbia is neat and tidy looking, but is actually quite ugly when you look at it, whereas Edward and the castle on the hill at first glance looks dark and horrific, but Burton has captured so much beauty in something you would not expect to find it.Besides being beautiful to look at, the story is so heartbreaking and wonderful; it's telling the popular story of an outcast in a truly unique way. Edward, looking something out of a horror film is actually the most gentle and sweet creature, whereas the majority of the 'normal' suburbanites are the monsters.Johnny Depp is on top form as Edward and conveys so much emotion in a look. His performance is perfection and no one could else could have played Edward with such conviction.Edward Scissorhands is timeless, and will remain a classic. Burton and Depp have worked together 4 times since this film, but have never come close to creating such a memorable and beautiful film as this. Many will argue that the superb Ed Wood is a better film than Edward Scissorhands, but Scissorhands leaves you with a feeling you can't explain or shift for days after viewing it. Although Ed Wood is indeed a fantastic piece of cinema, it doesn't quite leave such an impact that Edward Scissorhands does.Best Bit: There are so many. The Ice Dance sequence is possibly the most memorable, along with the stunning ending. As I mentioned before, a certain look from Depp can bring you to tears. An incredible performance.Quote Of The Film: Kim: Hold me. Edward: I can't.This film is arguably Burton's best, and is one of the greatest stories ever told. I defy anyone to watch this film and not fall completely in love with it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Truly a classic, Depp shines in an early role","This is one of those films i had to change my rating for, on first impression i liked it. The more i watched it, i began to love it even more. Johnny Depp gives one of his best performances here, another one-of-a-kind role for him. The rest of the cast was good as well, and Tim Burton quirky style suited the content and story of this film perfectly. The screenplay was written well and this was truly a tale of humanity and a great film at the same time. I can watch it more times in the future, and i don't think one gets the true feel for the film unless you have seen it a few times. Anyhow, im glad i got to catch it again this week, one of my favorite films --- 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
My favorite Tim Burton movie,"Of all the horrendous ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"" films I've had to watch this December, I'm so glad to be back to a truly wonderful film. I admit it is kind of a stretch to call this a Christmas movie. It is featured, but it's not very relevant to the plot. Still, it's in there and I wanted to see something good and boy was I rewarded! It's a great film for any occasion. What I was impressed by this movie was how it really wasn't that dark. Tim Burton was known for being dark in his movies but this one wasn't really that sinister.Okay, it gets worse near the end and it's not really a feel good movie, but I truly found myself rooting for the characters in this. Most of the people in this movie are in fact quite nice. The story is that a scientist created a human but died before he could give him hands leaving him with literal scissor hands. The flashback where it shows him dying is probably the best part of the movie. He was just about to give him normal hands but died at the last minute. For a good portion of the movie, people are rather accepting of Edward.The ending's pretty bittersweet but it doesn't have a hopeless atmosphere and for the most part, Edward learns how to use his scissor hands to adjust to society. I admit that the romance wasn't that well written. It's still great because honestly, everyone really does work hard to act realistic in this movie. As realistic as a movie about a guy with scissors for hands could be. It's not really far on the fantasy scale and often just tries to paint a picture of common American suburbia. It's a rather quaint movie with great performances by Johnny Depp and everyone else. ****",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A Beautiful Work of Art,"This is a spectacular tale of the man who just wanted to be normal. I first saw this recently, but not surprisingly it was a great movie. The story gets summed up pretty quick, gets told through a quick narration.By far this is one of Johnny Depp's best roll. I can't think of anyone else who can play Edward Scissorhands like Johnny Depp did. Almost as if he was made for the roll. The use of make-up and costume design for Edward was amazing, creating the belief that he was actually a created experiment. It proves that Johnny Depp can play almost any roll, but this is the most significant.The way each character changes throughout the course of the film is amazing. Like everyone thinks he's some beast, but inside he's a nice person who just wants to fit in. The character changes swing around a lot, along with their feeling toward each other.One of the great parts about this movie is that it actually made you feel the emotion intended, unlike some other movies where it fails to actually effect your emotions. Edward Scissorhands can make you feel anger, happiness, and sadness towards the same emotions that Edward would go through.I don't think I have ever seen anything accomplish this as good as this movie has.Overall it is a good movie. I would rather like to see more background story to Edward's life than it showed. But other than that it was quite good. If yet you haven't seen it, see it as soon as you can.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Incredible, Beautiful, Work of Art","This film, for me, was literally a life-changing experience.I experienced Edward Scissorhands for the first time this July when I was in the midst of quite a serious case of depression. I didn't have any previous expectations, although I'd heard good things about it. The trailer I'd watched wasn't spectacular, but I decided to give it a chance.From the first moment Edward appears on screen, timid and vulnerable looking, the film captured me. I still cannot recall a film character, or really any character at all, that ""got me"" like Edward did. The character of Edward Scissorhands in himself is simultaneously a tragedy and a blessing. He is a character that not everyone can be in accord with, but for those of us who can relate to him, he is a lament for the nature of the misunderstood.The film itself is, essentially, a fairy tale. It is, above all, a fantasy, and fantasy like you have never experienced it before. It is a film rich in detail and eccentric whim that seems to be practically leaking from Tim Burton's imagination. Because the film is purely imagination, nonetheless.This is the first film to make me cry. In all honesty, I was bawling at the ending. Not merely because ""the ending was sad"" - because the film itself, and Edward as a character, and all he represents, and all the film represents, was beautiful, honest, cruel, and passionate. This film awakened in me and renewed in me that lonely dwelling spirit of a dreamer inside.This is the film that sparked my interest in Tim Burton and his work, and I have ever since been engrossed in his fantastical world. He and this film continue to inspire me and my dreams.You may view this film and not feel as deeply about it as I do, but I can only hope you appreciate this fine masterpiece and miracle.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
It's a masterpiece,"Not a huge blockbuster , but a gem all the same. Just goes to show that you don't need tons of money to make a outstanding movie. You just need JOHNNY DEPP!

It's incredibly spell-binding, you can't help but be drawn into Edward's world, his mind. Incredible performances all around, but the star of the show was Johnny Depp. He completely nailed it. His soft-spoken voice and his blinding innocence touches my heart every time ever since I was ten years old.

My Favourite Film.,"Its my favourite film, everyone in it were at their best, Johnny Depp, Vincent Price and Winona Ryder. It made my cry at the end where they never saw each other again. Johnny Depp was great his child-like voice and the way he walked moving his scissors as he did. The first half of the film its like a children's film, everyone has different coloured houses and their cars match their houses but the second half it gets darker with all the people turning on Edward and then were they chase him away for doing nothing wrong, the opposite in fact saving the boy from being run over but the people think hes trying to hurt him and then Edward killing Kim's ex boyfriend, Jim. Vincent Price is the inventor who doesn't finish Edward before he dies in one of his last roles before his death from lung cancer. The director, Tim Burton who is well known for his odd main character that the audience loves anyway, Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood, both played by Johnny Depp, in fact Burton used Depp again in Sleepy Hollow. All of which are great movies but never made it big at the box office, the only Depp film that has is Pirates of the Caribbean but none of his films are bad he is in Platoon, Nightmare of Elm Street, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleppy Hollow, From Hell, Ninth Gate etc all which have cult following.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

But the snow thing was really unnecessary...PLUS it didn't make very much sense. The movie still would have been great if not better without that little part.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A PG - 13 film for all ages.,"Tim Burton. The Director of Beetlejuice, Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Mars Attacks, Big Fish and Batman. Out of all of those, only two were good. Then, in '90, we got to see an almost human story that was hard to believe, but still, was enjoyable. It's the story about a man named Edward, Who had scissors for hands, who lived by himself in a big haunted looking mansion with beautiful hedges and awesome animals. Edward meets Dianne Weist's character, and takes him with her to town, once there, he must adapt to new surroundings and new friends, and the occasional villain.I saw this film about a week ago, and found myself enjoying every part of the movie, I really felt the ending was heartbreaking, but all in vain, It was good, I have no shame to admit I had a big IL' tear streaming down my face in the last four minutes. It was a work of art.The composer seemed to make this movie flow slowly, and made you feel bad for his 'condition', but still enjoying the film.I write 'A PG - 13 film for the family' because, other than being creepy, It teaches you a lesson that appearances may be deceiving, but everyone's insides are the same, that you'll never change, no matter who you are. The movie also had The Late Vincent Price, playing the inventor, only two of his several hundred roles I had seen him in.My Advice: If you find it, Rent it for the family, you won't regret it. 10/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Edward Scissorhands cuts into your heart,"Living a life unable to come into contact with people must be pretty hard. This is the situation for Edward Scissorhands who has...you guessed it, scissor's for hands. Johnny Depp plays this outcast in Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands. The story of how a man made man comes out of exile and tries to live in suburbia.Depp as the lovable yet intimidating Edward Scissorhands is triumphant. His character is someone who fears people but also puts fear into people. When Peg Boggs (Diane Weist) attempts to make a sale for the Avon makeup company she works for at the old mansion in her neighborhood, she stumbles upon frightened Edward. With kindness in her heart, she takes him in.In her home Edward meets the daughter Kim played by Winona Ryder. She is at first taken by surprise, unlike her brother who thinks he is an interesting specimen. The father is very accepting. The family realizes that Edward has a gift...cutting. He can erect huge lawn statues out of the bushes and also give the local females a new hairstyle. Edward is used over and over again until the father believes he should make a profit. The story goes off on the contrast between Edward and their society. With Kim's boyfriend played by Anthony Michael Hall always picking on him and forcing him to do things he shouldn't, Edward is thrown into awkward, sometimes frightening situations.This is one of Burton's greatest pieces of cinema and is one for the ages. With great writing, a story that really hits the heart, and a great cast, this movie does well. As Peg Boggs says, ""Blending is the secret!"" One of the most interesting and imaginative plots out there, Edward Scissorhand's is a timeless treasure that might bring a tear to your eye.A man cut off from society in more ways than one is a story many can relate to. Not being able to make physical human contact is hard to do and Edward was just made this way so he can't help it. This struggle of his longing for people is one that is showcased beautifully. Burton's mind for great movie making is not wasted on this film. Edward Scissorhands is a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
One of the best movies of all-time!,"Edward Scissorhands is a great movie. There is not one thing wrong about this movie. It's about a woman salesman who goes up to this mysterious mansion.

All of the neighbors fall in love with him, and he becomes famous. Then one day everything goes wrong. The whole town is after him.I think that Johnny Depp in this movie is one of the top 10 performances in film history. He did a marvelous job! Edward Scissorhands is my 5th favorite movie of all time.

Read in between the lines to see the real message of this movie.,"It isn't easy to put a label on this movie. I guess the easiest way is to call this movie a fairy tale. It's obvious that this person would never exist in real life, but as the movie progresses, it doesn't even feel weird to see him.It's about a ""man"" who was created by an eccentric old man. Before he was able to give him real hands, the old man died, leaving his creature behind with hands that are made out of scissors and knifes. He lives in an old castle, completely on his own, because no-one in the village on the foot of the mountain where his castle stands would accept him. But than one woman finds him, takes him to her home and gives him respect. In return he performs all kinds of small household tasks for her and her family. Of course this doesn't stay unnoticed by the neighbors and soon they all want to make use of his wonderful hands and talents, without giving him anything in return...This movie may look a bit weird at first, but you have to read in between the lines to find the real meaning of it. In fact this movie is about the social acceptance of people who are different, because of some handicap or something else. It shows that these people can be valuable as well, that they also have normal human feelings, but that many people are afraid of them or want to use them in their own advantage. I give this movie 7.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Lost None Of Its Wonder And Power To Suprise,"Back in the days when Tim Burton could throw out these fantasy parables with almost carefree abandon, and the axis of him-Johnny Depp-Danny Elfman was still in its infancy, we loved this film. Coming back to it now, it remains funny, charming, warm and yet still comfortable in its gothic clothes and darker tones. This side of adulthood and with adopted children, it's fairly plainly a parable about adoption - not to mention being a child, ableism, race and any other outsider looking in kind of theme you care to mention. Seeing suburbia through the outsider's eyes is not an unusual idea in films, but this does it better than most - a film that's lost none of it's wonder and capacity to surprise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"A dark, modern fairytale full of heart and melancholy","Tim Burton has fashioned a modern fantasy fairytale that is a cross between Frankenstein and The Truman Show. Vincent Price, in his last role looking and sounding visibly frail, plays an inventor who lives in a castle and creates the son he never had, however before he can finish his creation he has a heart attack and Edward is stuck with temporary scissors for hands which gives him all kinds of problems with both hilarious and sad consequences.Burton is first and foremost a visual stylist, starting off as an animator working for Disney, with a predominantly gothic vision that reoccurs in most of his films, but he also knows how to pull at the heart strings, thanks in part to long time collaborator Danny Elfman's moving score, and Johnny Depp's sensitive performance which was the beginning of a long term creative partnership.There are flaws with the story but Burton and Depp immediately get you to buy into the fantasy as Dianne Wiest, new to a small surburban town in 1950's America, discovers Edward living alone in a castle on her round as an Avon lady. After befriending him and welcoming him into her family he falls in love with daughter Winona Ryder where a bittersweet love story begins. He also becomes a big hit with the bored housewives of surburbia as his scissoring skills delights the neighbourhood with his creative topiary and free haircuts. However things soon turn ugly when the local bully sets Edward up to commit a crime and runs him out of town.This film has a big heart and you really feel the frustration Edward has in trying to fit in. Coming off the back of mega blockbuster Batman (1989) Burton makes a much more personal film with Edward Scissorhands and allows him to stamp his unique visual style all over it.Nominated for several awards, including an Oscar nomination for Stan Winston's special effects, Burton establishes himself as a highly creative director, writer and visual stylist. Revisiting this 30 years on makes you also appreciate Depp's performance because this character is light years away from Jack Sparrow or Willy Wonka, and numerous other characters he has portrayed to general acclaim since, which has made him one of the most versatile actors in Hollywood.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
One of the greatest movies I've ever seen...,"... And how cute! It's a very special movie, not with any special reason... I just really like it! In the beginning I thought it was a bit scary you know - when Peg meets him for the first time. And the best part I think is the songs - and when Kim's dancing in the snow. Besides the whole story is told in a special way that I really like. And it's so sad when Kim wants Edward to hold her, and he sais he can't...And there's that witch, Joyce - I really did got angry on her, when she said all those stupid things about Edward.

A beautiful and touching instant classic.,"My Take: An imaginative and touching classic. A burst of imagination as only Tim Burton can conceive.Before I was a movie buff, I thought that ""Edward Scissorhands"" was a horror film, a counterpart of Freddy from ""The Nightmare on Elm Street"" (Yeah!I really did). But when I finally watched many years later, I was surprised at how magical and magnificent it was. This film really should be in the classics list, a really wonderful movie it was. This was Tim Burton's first collaboration with Johnny Depp, which led to other film success like ""Ed Wood"" and ""Sleepy Hollow"". But this was the best. Burton has never come up with a more fantastic that can surpass it. Johnny Depp really made his best performance, he should have won an Oscar for that.The rest of the cast including Winona Ryder, Dianne Weist, Alan Arkin and Vincent Price, in his final screen performance, give excellent support. Danny Elfman's music is outstanding and the settings and costumes are well done.This film is really great. So if your a movie collector, or simply a movie buff. Make sure you leave a space in the classics' row (and in your heart) for ""Edward Scissorhands"".Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Burton's first masterpiece,"With this one, Tim Burton delivers for the first time on screen the crazy world living in his mind. The philosophy is the same than in Beetlejuice, but this time it goes further in craziness. The tolerance message is more radical than ever, because I don't think that there's anything physically wrong with my black buddies, while Edward, by being this strange (close to horrible), forces you to go behind what he looks like (and I think that movies like this should be watched more often these days, when you hear people say about other kinds of people things that make no sense at all). But not only a political speech (that would be generous but maybe boring) this is a success in film-making : work on colors and architectures is, like always with Burton, wonderful, but most important, the movie stars Vincent Price for the last time - remember him, true horror fans !",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

25th Anniversary DVD (1990-2015),"I'm a geek who keeps an ongoing Master Calendar of my life, including all the movies I've ever seen in a theatre (not a huge number, maybe ten a year, but over the past thirty years that's 300 movies). I recently noticed that a 25th Anniversary DVD of Edward Scissorhands was being released, and didn't hesitate to order a copy because I fondly remember seeing it in 1990. After receiving the DVD I first carefully watched it with the Director's commentary, then Danny Elfman's (composer of the musical score) commentary, then the original theatrical release. That's well over five hours and it took me several days, but I was reminded of the film's creativity, beauty, over-the-top production design, and sweet story. Twenty-five years later Johnny Depp has gone on to be a big movie star, other actors in this film have become better known (including the ubiquitous but always watchable Alan Arkin), and Vincent Price has sadly left this earth. Looking through my Master Calendar of the past 30 years I often see movie titles that I literally remember nothing about, but not Edward Scissorhands.

E.T. meets Frankenstein (1931),"Tim Burton is one of the true auteurs of our time. He manages to put his label on virtually any project he takes on. And this is arguably his masterpiece. Excepting the ""Batman"" movies, the only other Tim Burton-directed movie that seemed to truly bring out his dark imagination is ""Sleepy Hollow."" My personal favorite is ""Beetlejuice,"" but that is more for sentimental reasons than anything else.Johnny Depp is the title character, a Frankenstein monster who has been left in the large, abandoned mansion of an inventor. The mansion sits at the edge of a small suburban neighborhood where the housewives' only function is to spread gossip. Edward is discovered by Peg Boggs, ""the Avon lady,"" after her unsuccessful bi-yearly visit to the homes of all the women in the neighborhood. Edward is brought home to the Boggs residence, and before they get home everyone already knows there's a tall pale man riding with Peg.The neighborhood is already full of kooks. Kathy Bates eats up her role as Joyce, the neighborhood slut, there's the overweight woman with curlers in her hair whose hobby is to stare out the window and spread gossip about what she sees. And Esmerelda, the neighborhood outcast, who raises hell, quite literally, when she sees Edward.Bill Boggs is a friendly man who is not above drawing the line somewhere. He just wants Edward to fit in. The Boggs' son, Kevin, is wowed by Edward, and even ventures to take him to show-and-tell. When their daughter, Kim arrives home, it is initially the entrance of someone who couldn't possibly be from the same family, but then we're reminded she's a teenager who has all sorts of inexplicable issues with her family already. For Edward it's love at first sight, or something like that, because being alone for so long, she's the first truly beautiful thing he's seen since he came down. Unfortunately, she's already attached to Jim, the spoiled bully who initially finds Edward amusing and pathetic, until Kim begins to like him, too, and stops seeing Jim. It's nice that as hateful as Jim is, we can see where it came from. He's the son of filthy rich parents. He never had to worry growing up. But his father won't buy him a car like he wants, he wants him to build character and earn the money himself. They have a top-of-the-line security system. And they are completely absent for the entire duration of the movie. We don't know these people, we just know what Jim tells us, and Jim doesn't think too highly of them, and as a senior in high school, he doesn't understand why they are the way they are.The cast is first-rate and inspired. Viewed in flashbacks, Vincent Price, as Edward's inventor ""father,"" is a misguided man so fascinated by his own creations. It's no surprise Burton cast him, since he seems to have a great admiration for classic horror, and as one of his later roles, it serves the actor well. As Price plays him, he's not an evil person. He's just too old to finish what he started. Alan Arkin and Diane Wiest are perfectly cast. Their sensibilities as actors complement their characters, as middle-class every-men and women. Kathy Baker makes the most of her slutty character, Joyce. Anthony Michael Hall, for those who know John Hughes' films, might be the most surprising. Looking back at his dorky beginnings, who would have expected Hall to ever be so menacing? And then of course there's Johnny Depp. This is, I think, the movie that made him known, although he didn't rise to star status until 2003 with the character of Captain Jack Sparrow. Depp doesn't say much, but it's in his face and body movements that touches people. He is a tragic figure.

Simply Special,"Touching, Heartfelt, and simply a Marvelous Masterpiece of Movie Making from one of the most Eccentric Directors.

If you are Unmoved by this You are an Immovable Object, this is an Irresistible Force.This Extraordinary Movie takes place in a Suburban Landscape that looks like that Plasticville Train Accessory place that Kids used to assemble under the Christmas Tree. That is No Accident and is another one of the Director's ""Parallel Universe"" where he Opens a Porthole so We can take a look.This Fantastic Fantasy looks Hauntingly Beautiful with a skewed familiarity that is Flamboyant despite its rather narrow strokes. There are Pastels and Gaudy People with Shallow Sensibilities.In fact the Shallowness is apparent Everywhere as it needs to be. The Dialog isn't deep, the Characters are One Dimensional, and it is so Amazing that this becomes a Sentimental Story for the Ages and it Plays for all ages. It cuts to the very Fiber of the Human Condition without hardly trying.This is Tim Burton's Best and although He has made many Fine Films about Outcasts and Rejects, Misanthropes and Odd Fellows, this one is His most Engaging and Enduring.

The most beautiful film I've ever seen,"This is the best movie i've ever seen. It's beautiful, fantastic, brilliant, great, magic... A masterpiece. A great job by the always brilliant Tim Burton and the always fantastic Danny Elfman. The cast, the story, the soundtrack... all is beautiful in this film. Johnny Depp is great, the same in all his films; Winona Ryder is so cute; Vincent Price is great...The movie tells us the story of a man called Edward who is not human, just an incomplete creation by an inventor who died before he could finish him. The man is alone for a long time, but one day, a friendly woman founds him and take him to her house. There,Edward falls in love with her daughter, Kim, but she doesn't love him. But soon Kim realizes that he's got a sweet and good heart.The protagonists in the film are Johnny Depp as Edward, Winona Ryder as Kim, Vincent Price as the inventor, Dianne Wiest as Pegg, Kathy Bates as Joyce and Alan Arkin as Bill. I think this film is the best by Burton,a man who must keep doing those cute and charming films like this and ""Big Fish"", ""Beetlejuice"", ""The Nightmare before the Christmas"", ""Corpse Bride"", etc. Do yourself a favour.

I don't wanna believe that there are people like you out there.For the rest of us who have seen the movie and just adore it, every time we watch it again like every other movie of Tim Burton, we found our selves dancing in the night hoping that is going to snow.

Beautifully made dark tale of romance and acceptance,"Edward Scissorhands is in my opinion a classic and besides Batman it's Tim Burtons greatest achievement. Johnny Depp is fantastic as Edward the the poor creation of a brilliant inventor (Vincent Price) who unfortunately dies before he is able to finish his greatest creation, thus leaving Edward with a pair of huge scissor-like hands instead of what we would call normal hands. Years then pass and one day Edward is discovered by the local Avon lady who decides to take him home to live with the family, obviously the whole neighbourhood wants to know about Edward straight away but it seems he only wants to know one person... I must say the scene where Winona Ryder is dancing in the falling snow always brings a tear to my eye, because its such a beautiful scene and it is really made perfect by Danny Elfman who manages to capture the mood with his wonderfully composed music. Edward Scissorhands is really one to watch, and so if you haven't already seen it i suggest you do.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

I really enjoyed this film, and how strangely surreal it was... I felt like it mixed certain aesthetics together very, very well. I also think Edward is just such an endearing character... He's so soft and gentle, and I think that giving the character some scary feature and scars definitely offsets that, and it's an excellent juxtaposition. I also think the character of Peg is so sweet... She takes him in just because she cares. Winona Rider's character also has a good arc, though it's cumulation is ultimately bittersweet.

"Dany Elfman score, Tim Burton bizarre visual style, your eyes and ears will be happy","The story line is very simple, most of the characters don't have a solid reason to behave like they do, the romance between the main characters is completely unbelievable, all of that would be true without Danny Elfman score and Tim Burton visual style.Those 2 elements made it all possible for me; ESH is as magic as fairy tale could be, and you would wish that it'd never end.The acting is by far too cartoonish, but that's what makes the movie a very entertaining and funny experience.Jhonny Dep is perfect in his role, he doesn't talk much, he looks creepy, but still he manages to be tender and kind enough to win you all over.Wynona is absolutely gorgeous (what eyes) and good make up too when she acts as a granny.Now let me say that Danny Elfman Score for this movie is one of my favorite scores of all time, is absolutely haunting and magical, so powerful that corny scenes with his music become historical scenes, that would give you chills on your back and arms, and maybe brought some tears to your eyes. Tim Burton's Best. 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A good introduction to Tim Burton,"Edward Scissorhands is a superficial movie, but it is definitely not a shallow one. The movie alone would not stand without a few key elements.Music is the first one. The main theme made me cry before I even watched it. The soundtrack is a must-buy. Go get it right now - you won't regret it.And, of course, there's Johnny Depp's acting. Leo DiCaprio couldn't have done it; Brad Pitt probably couldn't have either. Of course, the copious amounts of makeup help, but in general it's Edward that makes the movie.The atmospheres in 'Scissorhands' are liberally juggled with. First there's the foreboding, anti-fairytale into - then the Day-Glo shades of the neighbourhood and the in-betweens of Ed's living there. Back to the black at the end. Whew.Oh, yeah: if you're emotional, you may want to watch this with your boyfriend/hubby. And bring the Kleenexes. I don't cry easy, and I cried a few times. Be warned.8/10. Worth a view; sure, most of it is pretty boring and trite, but the good parts make up for it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
An absurd drama with real believability,"Johnny Depp is known for many roles in his career. Not only does he give his characters charm but also makes his fans feel like the character he plays is real. Before 1990, Depp had been in a number of productions but none were truly noted until after he became famous, like being in A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) or Platoon (1988). This however, is one of Depp's most critically defining roles and most likely what shot him to the top of popularity. This is also Depp's first collaboration with director Tim Burton, and we all know where that went from there. That is, at least the people who know of Johnny Depp.What takes place is a drama that centers on a small town with nosy inhabitants. When something new comes along, word spreads very quickly. What's new in town is Edward (Johnny Depp); a human with scissors for hands or scissor-fingers. After a mother discovers him all alone, she takes him home to live a normal life. There, Edward begins his transformation as a human being; going through various stages in life that a person could experience. The most significant of them is falling in love with the family's daughter, Kim (Winona Ryder). This particular subplot is not only magnetic in its execution but also plays a much bigger part in its story telling. This is where the heart and emotion of the story lies. As Caroline Thompson's first theatrical screenplay, she did a great job.Ryder and Depp have great chemistry and portray the emotion with power. Ryder is very beautiful here and has the proper character development. And although Depp says little throughout, he comes across as innocent and likable. Also, because this is a Burton production, he's going to add a bit of his influence, thus giving Edward his iconic and Gothic wardrobe. Along with these two leads, the cast also includes Alan Arkin, Anthony Michael Hall and the very last theatrical appearance of Mr. Vincent Price himself. Of all things that weren't wrong with the movie, this was my only complaint. Price plays ""The Inventor"" of Edward, but it is never explained what was the inventor's intention of replacing Edward's hands with scissors, nor was it explained to what the inventor himself did as a person. Apparently he ran a cookie factory but was that his life's work? There could've been more exposition on Price's character; especially since it was his last movie.However, this is the only problem. Everything else is entirely well constructed. Stan Winston did an amazing job making Edward's hands feel so lifelike and dangerous at the same time. That's Winston for you. Bo Welch's production design is heavy on being simple but loves to accentuate them in a big way. An example of this would be of ""The Inventor's"" factory at which Edward lived, or, even the hedgework that Edward created. It was all big and grand. Then there was Stefan Czapsky's cinematography, which contrasted the difference between the town's elementary colors and Edward's get-up, which made him stand out. The same year Czapsky also worked on Child's Play 2 (1990) where a parallel can be drawn to the color scheme. Finally was Danny Elfman's score, which was an enormous proprietor to the emotion. By incorporating vocals and several crescendos, viewers will more than likely have goosebumps on their arms. It's that good. It is definitely worth the time to see this.Aside from having one of the more important characters under developed, the rest of this film is absolutely wonderful. It is a fairy tale that excels beyond the clichéd ideas of the past with its riveting music, emotional acting and almost perfect story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Beautiful Masterpiece!,"Tim Burton was a rising star in film-making when in 1988 he released his successful mix of dark comedy and horror ""Beetlejuice"". This success took him to direct the ambitious adaptation of ""Batman"" in 1989 and gave him enough freedom to develop his own personal projects. The first of them was this little film. ""Edward Scissorhands"", a charming fable about a misunderstood young man, is probably the first film where Burton expresses his personal views on the world and at the same time, expands his vivid visual style to new heights.The story begins with Peg (Dianne Wiest), an Avon door-to-door seller who discovers Edward (Johnny Depp) living lonely in the haunting mansion that rises above the little suburban town where she lives. Surprised at the fact that Edward seems to have scissors instead of hands, she takes him home in order to help him to adapt to the community. While at first he is accepted, he'll discover that human relations are more complex than he imagined; and things will complicate even more when he falls in love with Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder).Burton creates a modern fairy tale that is not only visually impressive, but also very entertaining and most of all, very meaningful. Edward is a man who is just experiencing life, but due to his handicap he can't fully fit in Peg's apparently perfect world. His love for Kim also creates problems when Kim's boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall) makes Edward's life even harder. Edward is an outcast whose inability to touch gets in conflict with his desire to love, while at the same time faces the suburban community which seems more frightening than the haunting Gothic castle where he was living before.Johnny Depp changed his image of teenage heartthrob and with this film he began to show his great potential and superb talent to literally become one with his character. He portrays the emotions of the confused Edward with feeling and power, and gives life to Edward's mix of fragility and naiveté. Winona Ryder also was a rising star at that moment, and while her character is nowhere as complex as Depp's, she plays the role of Kim with dignity and grace. In this movie she displays the talent that would convert her into one of the most promising young actresses of her generation.Burton imagination has no limits and his eye for visuals excels in ""Edward Scissorhands"". His care for detail creates haunting images and beautiful compositions; from the haunting castle where Edward lives, to the grass sculpture that he creates, everything fits in this bizarre fairy tale and complete the perfection of this movie.It is hard to find a flaw in the film, as it is probably the first masterpiece that Tim Burton would create in his career. While of course it has some logical plot holes, as a whole the film is one of the best movies ever done in history, as it successfully mixes fantasy, drama and romance with a small dose of Burton's black humor. Depp and Burton would continue working together in many films, including Burton's masterpiece ""Ed Wood"".With the exception of ""Ed Wood"", Tim Burton has never been this good. ""Edward Scissorhands"" definitely has earned its classic status on its own right, as it is one of those movies that touch the deep parts of the soul with its inventive originality and almost-magical charm. ""Edward Scissorhands"" is simply unforgettable. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

"""Sometimes you can still catch me dancing""","Stories get reused all the time. Whether consciously or unconsciously, movies will reference or reshape far older narratives. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the best writers do not so much steal ideas as respectfully blend or rework them, often to rekindle the thoughts and emotions of the previous generation around the preoccupations of the present one. As the filmmakers of the modern era became ever more retrospective, such movies became more common.Edward Scissorhands is scripted by Caroline Thompson from ideas by director Tim Burton. As has often been commented, it has a fair amount in common with Frankenstein (more the 1931 James Whale/Boris Karloff picture than Mary Shelley's novel - the narrative influences are strictly movieland). But it takes even more from the lesser-known story Being There, brought to film in 1979 with Peter Sellers, about a man (possibly autistic) who has been brought up in one house, seeing the outside world for the first time and being mistaken for a genius. Thompson and Burton channel these influences but give the whole thing the qualities of a modern day fairy tale – a fable about surviving society as a misunderstood outcast. The titular scissorhands – probably the most unique thing about the story – are the literal extensions of a person who cannot get close to anyone without unwittingly doing harm.Just as the screenplay borrows from here and there, so too does Burton take cues from his cinematic forebears in the look of Edward Scissorhands. There are some clear nods to the weird, Gothic style of German Expressionism, but also contemporaries of his like Roman Polanski, Terry Gilliam and Paul Verhoeven, directors who have specialised in taking the real world (or something like it) and making it look baroque and alien. Burton was always more an artist than a technician. His designs for the picture and the way he frames them with the camera create a small town that is both familiar but eerily strange. There aren't too many connections to reality – no visible place names or brands. The houses, cars and clothing look normal apart from the abundance of tawdry, cartoonish shades. This is not mere stylisation – it is of utmost importance for the whole thing to work. The world Burton presents is just weird enough for us to believe the inhabitants wouldn't bat an eyelid at the huge Gothic mansion looming over of the town or think a man with scissors for hands was anything more than a subject for neighbourhood gossip. The snow-covered 20th Century Fox logo at the beginning of the movie is all part of the plan. We can't be distracted by the gold and fanfare of the usual logo; we must have total immersion.The disparate influences of Edward Scissorhands extend to the performances. Lead man Johnny Depp studied the work of Charlie Chaplin in preparation for the role, something I guessed at even before I read about it. There is something very Chaplinesque in his shuffling walk and the way he innocently investigates his environment – a wordless expression of personality that is very endearing. But the best bits of Depp's performance happen on his face. He runs a gamut of emotions, filtered through this incredibly stilted exterior, from that nervous smile we see when he rides in Diane Wiest's car to the quiet anger he shows towards Anthony Michael Hall. Other than Depp, there's an excellently deadpan turn from Alan Arkin which provides a lot of the humour. The most honourable mention however must go to Vincent Price, whose appearance is brief yet has an added layer of poignancy with knowledge of the elderly actor's long and distinguished career as a patriarch of Hollywood horror.Edward Scissorhands is a movie so contemporary in its style, and yet so dependent on the influence of the past. The whole tapestry is new but every strand with which it has been woven has been seen before. And yet it has all done been done with such precision and above all such appropriateness, that even when its derivations become obvious, they only serve to deepen the power and clarify the meaning of the picture. After all, a good movie is the sum of its parts.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

What do you call a man whose top is made from trees and who likes to throw cutlery from high buildings? Head Wood Sky Soar Pans! (edward scissorhands),"Edward Scissorhands is a terrifying, grim fairy tale, the story of a deformed boy with scissors stapled onto his arms in the place of hands. It is a well known fact that Vinnie Price went buck nuts before he died, believing that he was a real mad scientist. He began experimenting on neighbourhood runaways, cutting them up and replacing their limbs with household appliances- he would sand off their feet and replace them with a couple of hairdryers, he scooped out their eyeballs and inserted Christmas lights, he ripped off their danglies and tied on glue guns. The list goes on, all I will say is that this is where radiohead got their name from. Tim Button, fresh from his success with his version of Batfink made enough money to make whatever film he wanted. He decided to base his next film on the continuing existence of one of Prince's creations- Edward. It is made all the more horrific by the fact that a love story is tacked on along with some rather sick slap-the-stick comedy.The film stars Julia Roberts as a suburban saleswoman. In a clear rip off of off Desperate Houses, all the women are sneaky, self interested pointlessly neighbour obsessed with lives so empty and meaningless that the only way to fill the void with something other than outright hatred for themselves is to spy on their equally vacuous mud dwellers. Julia decides one day to go up to the spooky castle at the bottom of her street to try to sell her magic beans there. Inside she finds (amongst an assortment of fetish, S and M torture devices) a lonely young man called Edward. He seems normal other than the fact that he has scissors for his hands and is a complete weirdo. Naturally Jaunty Depp was picked for the role. Judy takes him home to meet her family- husband Richard, son Barry, and daughter Winrunner Rideher. Eddie falls in love for Wineowner but she calls him a hippie and has an affair with local jock Rob Lowe. Jedward goes buck nuts and begins having visions of his daddy, Vinnie Jones who advises him to become an assassin. He does, and the rest of the film is a blood soaked snowstorm of necks being sliced, eyes being gouged (with the camera placed on the tip of the scissor for maximum effect), and limbs removed as Tom Button shows his utter disdain for everything wholesome; it is basically him saying that he wishes everyone would murder everyone else and leave him alone to draw his zany pictures. The worst thing is, when Ed gets paid he can't count or spend the money as he keeps accidentally ripping it up.The scene where he moves from house to house impaling and mauling all the pets is so awful I may well have invented it just so I don't have to remember it. The thing comes to a climax when the FBI come to take Edwood away and he holds Winoprah hostage at the top of his castle. Helicopters swoop around the pair while he has a slow motion fight with their propellers. He finally cracks and cuts off his beloved's head and legs and is subsequently shot to pieces by the Feds. As the sad music rises, Winnie's blood drops onto the floor and we fade to white.Best Scene: The ending where we fade back in to find that it is the future, and Wimpy is alive and well and a granny. Surgeons were able so sow her head and legs together with a thin strip of her torso, though her midriff is completely gone. She is telling her granddaughter this story (I assume the young girl was naughty and this is her horrific punishment). The child asks 'What happened to Ed, granny?' Winotebook replies 'Ed's dead, baby. Ed's dead' before racing off on her space age mobility cycle.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

This is As Close As It Gets To Perfection!,"This is the most original take on the Frankenstein theme that I know of and for me is Tim Burton's Masterpiece. This is one of those rare films where everything comes together and works on all levels.  Everyone of the characters from Edward, the Avon lady and her family down to the neighborhood busybodies and eccentrics are played to perfection and the essence of suburban America is captured in a comical, surreal , yet accurate way. Edward's outward appearance is a masterpiece in itself. The way his dark, bizarre, freakish, yet innocent look contrasts with the pristine, pastel conformity of the homogenized world he finds himself in. Alan Arkin is at the top of his form with that low eyed, deadpan style of his as the well meaning but oblivious head of the household. This film has that very effective trademark visual and sound quality of Burton's and it really works on an emotional level as well which is what usually is lacking in his other efforts. We really begin to care for Edward the oddity with a heart of gold who's inner beauty is at odds with his outward appearance. His gentle trusting heart and  innocence that make him so appealing ends up being what gets him in trouble with the world at large and then of course his uniqueness becomes their source of resentment and rejection of him.  This speaks to that phenomenon in life where the masses are at first fascinated by someone new and different with an interesting talent and then equally relishing their downfall and demise if they should somehow trip up along the way. The media in particular loves to exploit these two phases of well known figures lives but why wouldn't they when it sells so big? The real beauty here is how Edward reaches the teenage daughter Kim and teachers her about true friendship and caring. In the end, when he has been banished from the world he still carries on in his separate reality creating a secret life of beauty and adhering to his gentle ways. He seems to evoke a higher level of understanding. Hence his home is located high above the neighborhood below where he watches over their existence. This modern Fairy Tale became an instant classic and is among the best from any era. Underneath the folly of the this story, allot is being said about human nature and the motivations behind peoples actions. It's what makes it a great story, it can be enjoyed as just a quirky, amusing tale or something much deeper.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"Tim Burton's Most Beautiful, Haunting Picture!","Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands is a modern-day fairytale about isolation. It is Burton's most personal film, even here in 2022. While Burton had a flair for comedy in his earlier films, he takes the Batman route to make a darker, gothic story about a man with scissors for hands. He still uses dark humor, especially with the adult characters, to make the story richer. Whether you get taken in by the story or not, you cannot deny that Burton always had a knack for creating rich visuals that never has been seen before. Here he creates a modern suburbia whose houses lack biting color pastels (done on purpose), but a large, haunting gothic castle overlooks these houses. It is odd, but it works for the story itself. I loved how Burton portrayed the suburbia and its inhabitants. Danny Elfman's wonderful score may just about be the best score he has ever done. The music is a major factor in the character's, especially Edward himself, characterization. Trust me when I say it will also play with your emotion. It remains my favorite score of his to this day. As a child, Burton's story spoke to me because I found it so relatable. Someone who was always alone as people couldn't bother with me. Once people got to know Edward and his skills, his social side was released. Very similar to my life. Unlike me, poor Edward has a bittersweet ending as explained in the touching epilogue.The genesis for Burton's film came as a schoolchild. He was generally left alone and hardly had any friends. He created a drawing of a thin man with scissor-like hands which reflected his loneliness and isolation. While in pre-production of Beetlejuice, he hired Caroline Thompson to write the spec script based on this idea. After the wild successes of Beetlejuice and Batman, he could have fastracked sequels to those movies, but he instead chose to make a movie that was most personal to him. With his A-list credibility, he now had the pedigree to go for the A-list cast starting with the highly respected Dianne Wiest. He always had Johnny Depp in mind as the lead role despite not seeing him in his teen idol show, 21 Jump Street. Burton hired the great Stan Winston to work with Depp's prosthetic scissor hands. It took Depp nearly two hours to be fitted into his costume. Those hands surely were scary and as seen in the film, could be a deadly weapon when angered.This is a story about a young man named Edward (Johnny Depp). He lives all alone in this large castle at the edge of town, a castle that all the townsfolk stay away from. He was created by an old man only known as The Inventor (Vincent Price). He died before he was unable to finish Edward leaving him with only sharp scissors for hands. He was all alone until the local Avon representative, Peg (Dianne Wiest) comes calling. Shocked at what she sees, she takes Edward to live with her family that includes her husband Bill (Alan Arkin), and daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). Soon after, the town discovers he has good hands for haircuts and hedge trimming. He even gets seduced by his neighbor, Joyce (Kathy Baker). Edward will soon learn that there can be a bad side to humanity.Johnny Depp hardly has any spoken lines. It is all in his eyes and facial expressions that expresses his true emotions. He spent lots of time watching Charlie Chaplin movies to get an understanding how to use face/body emotions rather than dialogue. The end result was a truly moving, affectionate performance. His character finds love with Kim, played beautifully by Winona Ryder. Ryder previously worked with Burton in Beetlejuice, so he knew she was right for the role. She certainly knows how to dance in the snow. Anthony Michael Hall plays her jealous boyfriend, Jim. He was great at playing a tasteless character who quite frankly deserves his fate. Alan Arkin said he took the role because it allowed him to branch into comedy. I think he did a good job. Both him and Dianne Wiest. Wiest cracked me up as the Avon lady. She is a kind-hearted but a bit naïve person. Fun fact, her makeup scene with Edward is widely considered one of the first ASMR scenes. Finally, this is one of Vincent Price's last roles before he passed away. It is fitting, with all the monster/sci-fi films to his name, that he was in a film about a kind man seen as a monster due to no fault of his own.The first of many collaborations between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, Edward Scissorhands is them at their best. Staying away from the blockbuster status, Burton created a smaller, intimate, personal film about being alone and inclusivity. A story that I found highly relatable. On this smaller scale, Burton still let the world know he is the master of creative, interesting visuals. Danny Elfman accompanied this fable with one of the best scores you will ever encounter. The ending is so bittersweet as it made me feel Edward's pain. There were times when I thought the film dragged, but those were rare moments. I think after watching this fairytale, you would also want to be dancing in the snow or creating magnificent ice sculptures. I know I did.My Grade: A-",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Has more heart than later Burton/Depp collaborations,"There have been many actor/director long term collaborations through the years - John Ford/John Wayne, Martin Scorcese/Robert DeNiro and Alfred Hitchock/Jimmy Stewart all come to mind. Another interesting collaboration is the unique one between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. The films these 2 have made have shown an ""outsider"" being introduced into an environment - usually in a quirky and gothic dark manner. So it was interesting to go back to the film that started it all - 1990's EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.Interestingly enough, this film works because of the lack of weight of previous Burton/Depp collaborations.Let me explain...If you were to hear today that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp were to collaborate on a film, what expectations would you have? Quirky, dark and gothic comes to mind. With EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, none of these expectations were in place. You can see the purity in the beginning of this collaboration with these 2 artists finding there footing together in a film that is...yes...quirky, dark and gothic.It is also, unexpectedly, light, airy, funny and poignant - traits that I think get lost in later Burton/Depp collaborations....collaborations where the focus seemed to be on the design and look and less on the emotion.Set in a timeless, stylized world that is part '50's, part '60's, part 80's and part ""everything else"", EDWARD SCISSORHANDS is Burton's loose retelling of the Frankenstein story, where an isolated inventor (in this case Vincent Price) creates life (Depp)...with scissors for hands (you'll have to see the film to see why). When a local resident (and door to door cosmetic saleslady) discovers Edward living alone, she invites him into her house - and into the lives of the the neighborhood that exists below.Depp owns this character - and owns it well. He brings an innocence and integrity to this character that rides a fine line well. His character is naive - but not simpleminded. He is longing to please - and to be loved - but has his own mind. In Depp's performance, you see an actor coming into his own.He is joined - wonderfully - by Diane Wiest as the lady that invites him into her home. Winona Ryder (who turned down Godfather 3 to appear in this film) as Wiest's daughter (and object of Edward's affections) and the great Alan Arkin as the patriarch of the family who is a fun stereo-type of the Suburban dad.All of this is packaged - uniquely - by Burton with an ""8 crayon"" color palate that exaggerates the various styles of the time. It is an expert job of combining styles into a unique vision that works very, very well.I also have to give Burton credit for casting the iconic horror movie veteran Vincent Price (in his last film role) as the inventor of Edward Scissorhands.I was taken under the spell of this film - and not just because of the interesting visuals - it has a heart and soul (because of Depp's work) that, I think both Depp and Burton lose in some of their later collaborations.If you haven't seen this film in awhile - check it out - I think you'll like it.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Johnny Depp is amazing as the titular Edward Scissorhands and Tim Burton directs another memorable classic.,"Tim Burton's dark fantasy Edward Scissorhands is still a brilliantly done movie. There are plenty of touching moments along with gothic themes and also moments of visual scenery.Johnny Depp does an amazing job as Edward Scissorhands, an artificial man with hands for scissors who lives in recluse in a gothic mansion after his inventor (Vincent Price) unexpectedly dies before completing his creation. Edward is taken under the wing of a kind hearted Avon saleswoman Peg Boggs (Dianne Wiest) who takes him to her home and introduces him to the small town. He befriends Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder) with whom he later falls in love with. Edward finds himself accepted by the pastel suburbia as he slowly fits in as best he can until things start to go wrong for him and he is eventually shunned by everyone.Johnny Depp has portrayed many memorable characters but his role as Edward Scissorhands is one of the best. Dianne Wiest as Peg Boggs was perfectly cast. Winona Ryder was terrific as Kim.Edward Scissorhands also stars Alan Arkin, Anthony Michael Hall, Kathy Baker and the late Conchata Ferrell.Riding high from the success of Beetlejuice (1988) and Batman (1989), director Tim Burton once again has done an amazing job bringing Edward Scissorhands to life on the big screen as a modern day tale of the ugly duckling of a softly spoken outcast who tries to fit into society after living in recluse for years.Released in 1990, Edward Scissorhands is still a timeless classic and is still a brilliantly popular movie with fans of Johnny Depp and Tim Burton.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
This film is a real treat,"Tim Burton's skewed suburban fairytale starring Johnny Depp as the unfinished experiment who has shears instead of hands. Visually, stylistically and emotionally stunning.After finding his fantastical feet in Batman and Beetlejuice, Burton gave free reign to his imagination in this strangely cold curio.The small-minded community of a pastel-hued suburb is rocked when an Avon lady (Wiest) fosters Edward Scissorhands (Depp), the unfinished experiment of local Frankenstein, Vincent Price. A pallid, wild-haired innocent with a heart of gold and fingers of steel, Scissorhands becomes the neighborhood's personal freak show. He fascinates with his dexterous ability (as hairdresser, ice-sculptor etc.) and arouses strange desires in female loins. But he is never accepted into their pringle swathed hearts. Only Kim Boggs (Ryder), a companion in square-peg-round-hole ostracism, sees the beauty behind the boy's ghostly exterior and they begin a fairytale romance.Verdict: With its comic-book design, 50s chic and peerless, Gothic invention, the film is a visual treat, while Depp's blinking bewilderment made his character one of the icons of the 90s.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Edward Scissorhands is a Freaking Masterpiece!,"Edward Scissorhands is an absolute freaking masterpiece that captivates from start to finish.

A Masterpiece,"Despite some people's comments, i feel that this film is one of the best ever made. It is a beautiful story, a modern fairytale, and definitely Burton's greatest work, if not Johnny Depp's. The cinematography is beautiful, the score is so haunting and Depp's performance as Edward absolutely melts my heart. I love how Burton can make even Suburbia seem sinister! He is a fabulous director and this just shows how good he can be. The story of the outsider looking in has been done a thousand times, it's true, but this film stands out as the best of these. I feel it also makes a statement about the close-mindedness of secular communities, unable to deal with a simple complication or development. It stuns me every time i watch it, and makes me fall back in love with the whole film. The fantasy genre has always been my favourite, and this film, is one of the best.Surely no-one with a heart can fail to be touched by the sheer chastity and innocence of such an incredible film.

A Gothic fairy tale with a sad ending or the Magnificent Tim Burton: Part two,"A Gothic fairy tale. We continue our journey through the filmography of Tim Burton - the greatest dark storyteller and visionary of our time, whose films are unique, and therefore worthy of your attention. And today we will talk about the Gothic fairy tale of Maestro Burton, which was based on the drawing of the main character that Tim drew when he was still a schoolboy. A good start, you must agree. I have watched this picture more than once, and this review was a great reason to review it again. And here's my brief opinion for you - A Gothic fairy tale with a sad ending. Despite my love and admiration for this painting (which has earned the title of ""masterpiece""), I have to note both its advantages and disadvantages, without which it could not do. And this should be the end of this introduction, and get to the point.So, the advantages:
1. Scenario - the picture tells the story of Edward, a half-man, half-machine (this is my assumption), who lives alone in a high castle and has a defect - he has scissors instead of hands, which he wields well. One day a kind woman came to his house, and when she saw Edward, she decided to take him to her home and take him into the family. The family and neighbors initially accepted Edward well, but gradually problems were revealed that the kind woman did not think about when she brought Edward to civilization. Along the way, Edward fell in love with Kim, the daughter of a kind woman. The ending of the picture is sad, and too sentimental people can even cause a tear (or even more than one). We are sincerely worried about Edward, because he is absolutely defenseless in front of the society in which he is now. He is a genius, a master of his scissors, capable of concocting a masterpiece in a matter of seconds, but he cannot resist envy, pride, deception and hypocrisy, sometimes he cannot even distinguish good from evil, but we feel in Edward a soul, a real human soul, which is very vulnerable, but capable of much, which can even be and learn. Tim Burton told us a great fairy tale that you want to watch and review again and again. This is facilitated by vivid images, the grotesque of everything that is happening, acting and dialogues that you believe in. Yes, this is a modern fairy tale, but I want to believe in it so much.2. The atmosphere is a mixture of romance and Gothic, horror and goodness, fairy tales and harsh everyday life, real characters and fictional ""monsters"". That's what old Tim always knew how to do (even in the God-defying series ""Wednesday"" it can be seen), so it's a great atmosphere, not without the participation of permanent specialists Danny Elfman (composer) and Colleen Atwood (costume designer). Without the atmosphere, Tim Burton's paintings would not be Tim Burton's paintings.3. Showing ""society"" - here Tim Burton contrasts Edward with representatives of the so-called ""civilized society"", who at first treat Edward with caution, then mercilessly exploit, and as soon as Edward made one mistake, they are indiscriminately accused of all mortal sins and are ready to go even to murder. And bright houses, friendly smiles should not deceive you - these hypocrites will destroy anyone who dares to be not like everyone else. Of course, even in this ""society"" there will be good people who will be kind to Edward and will protect him in every possible way - but there are so few of them, and they cannot protect him from all troubles. After viewing this picture, several thoughts come to mind that may even prompt certain actions. And the fact that America is shown in the picture does not mean anything. Society behaves like this everywhere, only faces, skin color, language, and flags change. After that, the viewer becomes more and more imbued with Edward. He also wants to escape to his castle and live there alone, so as not to observe these hypocrites every day.So, the disadvantages:
1. Questions to Edward - it is not clear from the picture who he is, a person or a mechanism, because we are shown that he eats ordinary food and drinks ordinary drinks, then what about some physiological actions, given that he has scissors instead of hands? But at the same time, they show us that he does not age, and does not require self-care. How to understand all this? So is he a man or is he a machine? I am inclined to the version that he is something in between, because he has a soul, and he feels like a living person. Apparently, when Tim was writing the script, he didn't want to think about this moment, or maybe it slipped his mind altogether. Who knows!2. Logic - of course I understand that this is a fairy tale, but the high castle is located right at the end of the street of the unnamed city where the events of the picture take place, and none of the children have ever penetrated it? No one at all? After all, the castle is within walking distance. Forgive me, but children are curious, all children, and I can't believe that the castle remained untouched and covered with a layer of dust. This is the most obvious logical failure, there were still minor ones, but we will not dwell on them.A little about the main characters:
1. Edward, played by Johnny Depp, is a kind creature with scissors instead of hands, who gets into an unusual world for himself and will experience a whole bunch of emotions, among which there is love. A real genius, whom society initially accepted, but when he did not play by his rules, he was mercilessly betrayed. Yes, comrades, this was the first joint work of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, which tied them in friendship, and gave us a whole series of good paintings, which we will definitely talk about in the following reviews. Well, young Johnny was good here. Well done!2. Kim, played by Winona Ryder, is the daughter of a kind woman who took Edward into her family. At first, she behaves like a typical girl who barely skipped adolescence, but gradually falls in love with Edward. Young Winona proved herself well with Maestro Burton back in ""Beetlejuice"" (there is a review for him), and here she has grown up, and has become a real beauty. Yes, and the ""spark"" between the characters is felt. Clever girl!3. The inventor performed by Vincent Price is the creator of Edward, who, in addition to him, invented and implemented a number of mechanisms. Tim came up with this role specifically for Vincent Price, a former famous Hollywood actor who starred in horror films in the fifties and sixties of the last century. Unfortunately, Vincent did not live to see the end of the filming of the picture, and his role here is more symbolic, but even she is remembered.This Gothic tale by Tim Burton collected a decent box office, which strengthened the maestro's position and allowed him to film his adaptation of the famous novel by the first American writer Washington Irving, but we'll talk about this next time.My rating is 10 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Overwhelmingly beautiful,"(r#105)Edward Scissorhands - which is in my opinion, hands down Tim Burton's best movie - is many things. It is a sweet and simple fairy tale, a colourful satire of suburban life, a quiet comedy and an emotional love story. How Tim Burton manages to combine these genres into something which feels anything but confused is beyond me. As a director he's an expert of combining stunning visuals with compelling soundtracks to create intoxicating and very entertaining movies. Still I wouldn't go so far as to call him one of the best directors ever - even if he is one of my favourites - simply because he's not the best storyteller, and his direction seems a bit confused at times.However, Edward Scissorhands is a true masterpiece in every sense of the word, and whether Tim Burton simply had a good day while filming, or his heart was more into it than, say, Planet of the Apes, doesn't really matter. Everything clicks wonderfully, from the intoxicating and haunting score (by Danny Elfman - who else?) to the pitch-perfect performances, to the beautiful visuals, to the simple and compelling story. It's just a wonderful movie and shouldn't be associated with the sticky, manipulative Hollywood genre called ""romance"".As the setting of his story, Tim Burton has created a small but memorable world in which suburban banality has been taken to an entirely different level. In this world every single woman is a housewife and all of their husbands drive off to work at the exact same time each morning to bring food to the table. Burton effectively parodies the suburbs without doing a ""Paul Haggis"" - i.e. driving home his point with a sledgehammer. The bright pastel houses and absurd dress codes are really hideous and the contrast between this exaggerated suburbia and Edward's Gothic hideout is glaring. If I had to choose, I'd pick Edward's castle any day.Acting is excellent all around, Kathy Baker, Dianne Wiest and Conchata Ferrel, among others, play their prissy housewives convincingly and Alan Arkin's laid-back father figure makes for some nice comic relief. The much-praised Johnny Depp shines and is extremely entertaining, as well as likable, as Edward (no, he did *not* deserve an Oscar for playing a drunk pirate). Winona Ryder is a gorgeous leading lady, and Anthony Michael Hall makes for a genuinely nasty, if a bit dorky, ""bad guy"". Burton's idol Vincent Price gets some of the best scenes, even if they're just flashbacks, as Edward's inventor.""Edward Scissorhands"" will not change cinema. It's just a sweet, well paced, well directed and superbly acted fairy tale with stunningly beautiful music and visuals. It's one of few romantic movies you can safely watch without gagging or feeling intellectually insulted. Relax, bring your girl- or boyfriend along, and enjoy this wonderful masterpiece of human emotion. One of my favourites of all time. I wish every romantic comedy was as good as this one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

The film stars Johnny Depp in what is perhaps his greatest performance and he portrays Edward in such a superb way that it is impossible to imagine someone else playing that character.

My brief review of the film,"A visually magnificent, magical fable, the film features some striking sets and great makeup, which are well photographed in different artistic colours and lights. Depp is good as the title character, however the character itself is hardly a good point of the film. As our hero, the film feels rather cold, because there is a distance between the viewer and the protagonist, to whom the viewer is never really brought close. The story, besides for the scissor hands gimmick, is nothing new or original, and it is rather a bit predictable. Yet with such a grand visual style, the film is able to survive primarily on the visual goodies that Burton provides. It is entertaining as something rather unusual and different, but it is not good enough to do better.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A Truly amazing film that will melt the coldest heart!,"This is Tim Burton at his absolute best! The film not only reflects upon feeling lonely and like an outsider but also makes you realise that although things look perfect they never are! Nothing is perfect, but it's OK.

Anyone who tells you that they don't like this film is lying ;) The film has warmth, comedy, meaning and a lot of magic nothing more than you could wish for from a Tim Burton classic.

Very Charming Dark Fairytale,"A very charming ugly duckling fish out of water story with such a unique character conception Edward Scissorhands. A man who visually seems designed to destroy everything he touches, yet has a true calling to creating art. A sweet albeit obvious metaphor for Tim Burton's own childhood trying to fit in California suburbia. The score is hauntingly beautiful and memorizing, much like the bittersweet storyline. I like the subversion where the superficial suburbanites actually take a liking to Edward Scissorhands much earlier in the story than I anticipated. Takes the story in a much more interesting and unpredictable direction. Great art design and direction with making the seemingly normal and mundane suburbia look so outlandish and unnatural in contrast to the more dark and gothic design of the protagonist and his grim home from up above. Admittedly most of the characters are pretty flat suburban caricatures, but they serve their purpose well enough even if they could've had more depth during the somewhat-rushed climax. The ending is really sweet too and definitely leaves a lasting impact with that annual ""snowfall in California"". It isn't perfect, but it's stylish imagery and emotional investment in the lead character are more than enough to let this shine above Tim Burton's typical ""goth loner vs pastel suburbia"" tropes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

With an originality that is rare for contemporary cinema, Tim Burton and Danny Elfman establish here their cinematic tour de force, and probably one of their most beloved projects - it is clear that this one was a labor of love. Johnny Depp is surprising in the role of Edward, but he is only the leading piece of a magnificent mosaic that combines unforgettable supporting characters, Danny Elfman's haunting score (that will stay in your mind much after the credits roll) and Bo Welch's incredible art direction.

Maybe I didn't pick up his exact point of the movie that he was trying to get across but I have my own opinion. In a world where everyone is normal and there's very unique, people are quick to judge those who are different. Basically, Edward is treated different because of his ""handicap"" and at times mistreated and used. One character in the movie, was the old man with the prosthetic hip and he says to Edward that you should never let anybody say that you have a handicap.

Gothic drama ensues.","The year was 1990, and from the dark, Gothic mind of Tim Burton came perhaps the most overtly dark and Gothic movie of his career: Edward Scissorhands. Sometimes the formula works, like in the cases of Sleepy Hollow or Sweeney Todd. Other times, we end up with weird messes of movies like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or Alice in Wonderland (notice, in each example, Johnny Depp is featured prominently). Fortunately, this film is an example from the former category. Featuring some excellent performances, an outstanding musical score, and typically Burton-esque visual flair, this film is one for the ages.Edward Scissorhands, as a character, is a very interesting guy. We're not quite sure if he's a flesh-and-blood human or some sort of cyborg, but we do know that he is capable of love and affection. Having been a recluse in an abandoned mansion for many years, these are acquired skills for him. He's a tragic and highly misunderstood man as well as a sort of embodiment of an emo wrist cutter's psyche. However cool a concept, I don't think Burton was trying to be subtle with the whole 'scissors for hands' idea.Nevertheless, Edward is a fantastic character. Despite his physically grotesque nature, we as an audience grow to love and pity him, and become emotionally invested in his story. Johnny Depp gives one of the best performances of his career here. Also worthy of note are Winona Ryder and Dianne Wiest, who are sympathetic and relatable in their roles. Anthony Michael Hall plays a great antagonist that everyone loves to hate, and Vincent Price has a great cameo as the inventor (his very last performance, sadly). Depp and Ryder have great on screen chemistry, and share some truly touching moments.Backing these moments and others is an amazing soundtrack from Danny Elfman, another common Burton collaborator. These men make real movie magic together here, and add a whole new dimension of dark emotion. Through the perfectly orchestrated music we feel joy, sorrow, or rage along with these characters. It gives the film more artistic quality, and continues to resonate long after you've finished watching. I must admit, every time I watch the movie I sit through the entire end credits scene, just to enjoy more of the music.And while the film is certainly a treat for the ears, it is also very nice to look at. Costume design, makeup, set pieces, cinematography These are elements of film that Burton and Co. have down to an exact science. The dark and distinctly Gothic look of Edward himself, the mountaintop mansion, and most of the nighttime scenes contrast beautifully with the happy and colorful suburban neighborhood setting. There is typically a lot of the color black, and a fair amount of steampunk machinery, juxtaposed with garish women's clothing and jolly Christmas season decor. It's what fans of these films expect from Burton, and he delivers it in perhaps his most stylish fashion yet. Even now it feels very original, especially when compared to his more recent, contrived outings. Dark Shadows, we're looking at you.As a work of art, as simple entertainment, or as a visual representation of Tim Burton's insanity, Edward Scissorhands succeeds. It is an excellent modern fairytale and a must-see, and I give it 9 out of 10 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Unforgettable story of a man with scissors for hands who is exposed for the first time to a colourful town who don't welcome him warmly.,"Edward Scissorhands is brilliant, although probably only this attractive to those who have enjoyed other Burton movies. Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder are both made for their parts and although the story isn't incredibly believably (it's not really supposed to be) the colourful neighbourhood where it is set is a comforting atmosphere for the audience. This is definitely a film to see. It's a magical experience with original ideas and the notorious imagination from Burton is once again no let down to his fans. Edward is an unforgettable character. This is a one-of-a-kind experience. If you enjoyed this film, check out 'The Nightmare before Christmas,' as it's also quite enchanting.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Best movie ever!,"It's colorful, funny, emotional, and entertaining. Everything about Edward scissorhands is just awesome!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Wonderfully Whimsical,"A wonderfully whimsical modern fairy tale from wonderfully whimsical director Tim Burton. Johnny Depp is perfect as the title character, a scientifically-engineered young man whose inventor (Vincent Price, in his final screen appearance) dies before Edward can receive real hands, leaving him with scissors as digits. Thanks to an overly helpful Avon lady, Edward is soon thrust from his castle into the real world - with all its marvels, cruelties and even romance. The stylish director has fashioned a film as pleasing to the eyes as it is to the imagination, complete with vibrant color, outrageous situations and bizarrely enjoyable characters.Perhaps the biggest downside of ""Edward Scissorhands"" is that it tends to be overly sentimental and just a tad dark. While those elements work in heavy doses in other films, they tend to detract from what could have been a true masterpiece. Nevertheless, on the whole this is a solid fantasy that adults and not-so-young children will enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Beautiful and poignant,"This movie is one that is hard to put into words. It is one of those movies you simply have to experience. Johnny Depp brings such depth and realism to his character that you never once think he's acting. He simply and fully becomes Edward Scissorhands. You can feel every emotion through Depp's expressions and mannerisms. The whole cast is phenomenal with, in my opinion, one exception, and that's Winona Ryder. Her acting was stiff and she simply didn't bring a lot of depth and believability to her character. I think they could've done a lot better casting that role. But that is a very very minor issue because the whole rest of the cast in the movie rises above that. I've watched it at least six times over the years and it's always such a beautiful, heartwarming, emotional experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Best Movie Ever -- see the movie before reading this,"This is the movie where it all comes together--the most creative story, the most moving music, the immaculate direction, and the impeccable cast. ""Edward Scissorhands"" is art, perfected.  There has never been a story told so eloquently as done here by Tim Burton; this movie is the best thing in the world, not to overstate it.First of all, the whole movie is absolutely beautiful.  It's hard to pick one, but the shot of Peg looking in her car mirror is a wonderful example of the aesthetics Burton uses throughout the film, mixing bright color with a darkness that is crisp, and not gloomy.Danny Elfman's score for ""Edward Scissorhands"" is the best I've ever heard. It is touching, funny, and always appropriate.  Tim Burton makes the right move playing Elfman's music almost non-stop during the movie, and there isn't a false note throughout.Little needs to be said for the cast: phenomenal performances by Depp, Ryder, Wiest, Arkin, and Price pull this movie together.As for Kim...she knew that she and Edward could not be together as long as he was outcast.  She couldn't just sneak up there every day after school or something.  And as she said, she'd rather he remembered her the way she was. But the silver lining of the movie is, no matter how long Edward stays up there alone, he is happier than he would have been without his days with Kim.As for the blocks of ice...Edward lives in a house owned by an inventor who created a human being, plus all those cookies and God knows what else.  A big freezer somewhere is not far-fetched.This movie really is about being different, and the functionalism of society.  It goes over the top on purpose--with the house colors and plain lawns, and the shot with all the husbands backing out of their driveways to go to work all at once--to stress that this is just basic American suburbia. Edward changes the lawns, and in the end, when society's disturbed, the party responsible is rejected.Of course, there's always the more fun way of looking at it--that it's just a bunch of stuff that happened.  Do that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

The whole town gets to know Edward's arrival due to gossipy neighbors who Miss Peg and her family have, and everyone is interested to know Edward, who shows have multiple special talents with his ""scissorhands"". The cast this solid and does a good job, but Johnny Depp is superb, makes a character so adorable and sweet that we learn to love from start to finish, and see the magic of his character only by his look.

His character is a sort of Of Mice and Men idea, hurting the things that he loves. Winona Ryder and all the other supporting actors play their roles to perfection, notably Vincent Price in his last film role.Although the suburban design is a bit outrageous (the blandness idea is really forced onto you), it really shows a place we find boring may be an amazing place to others.The film is an astonishing combination of music and visual effects and I think it may well be Tim Burton's greatest film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

"Complex, vulnerable, beautiful","This film is one of the best I have seen in the nineties. It is beautifully directed and superbly acted. One of the most compelling aspects of the film are it's subtle juxtapositions and the way we get such a superb insight into the world of an ""uncommonly gentle man"".I love Burton's style and the way he does nothing the way he is supposed to.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Perfect,"Edward Scissorhands, as its slogan states, tells the story of an uncommonly gentle man. As the film progresses it is clear to see that he is the only gentleman in a neighbourhood filled with narrow-minded and ignorant residents. This (and many other reasons!) is why it is easy to fall in love with Edward, who is perfectly portrayed by Johnny Depp. The story is a simple one: boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, but it's not meant to be. However, Tim Burton put a twist on this typical, Hollywood rom-com structure when he created this dark fairytale. Edward is discovered by the cheery, Avon representative Peg Boggs (Dianne Wiest) who thinks it would be a great idea for him to go home with her. Little does she know, that this is the worst thing she could have done. Tim Burton emphasises the monotony of life in the Suburbs when showing every resident rushing to Peg's house to have a look at the new visitor. Edward immediately falls in love with Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder) when gazing at her photograph. She, however, has a jock boyfriend: Jim. He rapidly forms a hatred for Edward and mocks him throughout the film. Life in this neighbourhood eventually takes its toll on Edward, and without giving anything away, he doesn't get the fairytale ending he deserves. The ease at which we fall for this story, is perhaps, the best thing about it. Tim Burton invites us into his Gothic fantasy world and we enjoy every moment we are there. The music, that accompanies the many bitter-sweet moments between Kim and Edward, is beautiful; it is easy to see why Danny Elfman believes the music he composed for Edward Scissorhands to be his greatest. It is also understandable why Tim Burton favours this out of all of his films; if he had only made Edward Scissorhands, he would still be thought of as a great Director. The wonderful performances by all members of the cast, which include Vincent Price as the inventor, add to the brilliance of this film. Each character is different from the next, yet equally believable. This just adds to how heart-breaking this film is; we know, that this is how people would act towards someone this different. We sympathise with Edward because all he wants to do is fit in. The amount of themes Edward Scissorhands covers is endless: love, hatred, jealousy, kindness and it, also, raises many questions about society. Something else that needs to be touched on is the amazing contrasts between Edward's dark, eerie, lifeless world and his new life; filled with bright colours, flocks of people and noise. This makes Edward stand out even more from the crowd, his pale face covered in scars and his all-black clothes. To sum up, Edward Scissorhands is a must for Tim Burton and Johnny Depp fans alike, they are both at their best here. It is definitely a modern- day classic that will stay with you long after you've seen it, and want to be watched over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

We see the sympathy that she shows for him. and humorous complications. when the doctor gives the answer the long way to say whether or not Edward will be fine in the town. And when he is shown around the house and the intimate actions he doesn't understand. Simply a classical but funny way of showing that since Edward has been in isolation for so long that he doesn't understand the ways of ''normal'' people.Yet he seems to have a good chance of an art career turning, whizzy messes into masterpieces and works of art. changing hedges into topiary and husky dogs into elegant poodle-like creatures. then he meets a partner he falls for but isn't sure if they shall get together because he is not ''normal''.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

This one, though, took it one step farther. This so called ""monster"" lived amongst the people, loved the people, lived for the people, and would gladly die for the people. Sadly, the ending is the saddest part of the movie. I am now a fan of this movie and the story it is trying to tell, human nature has not changed since Frankenstein hit the big screen. Mankind still points at the ""monster"" and the remaining fingers point back at the ones making the accusations, and many with very sad endings. When will mankind ever learn?

A comical/sad masterpiece,"After seeing a tiny part of Edward Scissorhands on TV a long time ago and hearing that it was only ""strange"" I didn't think much of it. After seeing it completely and understanding it better, I have to say it's one of my favorites. It's very funny and also incredibly sad from the haunting music in the beginning to the very last well acted scene.It's a mature and dark story told in a fairy-tale like way. It takes a simple idea really (a young, secluded, shy man with scissors for hands thrown into regulatory society) and depicts as many emotions, jokes and scenarios from hilarious to bitterly sad as possible. What would a man with scissor hands be good at? The movie is unique and strange and that's part of what makes it great; its a look at reality from an odd angle. The fact is; there are people like Edward out there (I'm not talking about the scissorhands obviously) and there are, sadly, neighborhoods like that out there. There are too many good morals to the story to put down here.The entire cast is perfect for their roles. The directing is brilliant as well as the music. One of Time Burton's best (if not best). This movie solidifies for me what a great actor Johnny Depp is. Winona Ryder & the small part of Vincent Price is just another reason this is one of my favorites.

A meal you'll remember,"""Edward Scissorhands"" reminds me of nothing so much as one of those fantastic Caribbean meals that blends flavors, colors, and textures you'd never think of putting together -- but, composed by an artful chef, becomes a food experience to be retold for years.  The characters provide the pungent flavors: Depp's innocent Edward, Ryder's ethereal Kim, Arkin's crusty Bill Boggs, Wiest's sweet Peg Boggs, Hall's brutal Jim, Baker's man-hungry Joyce, and Price's cadaverously paternal Inventor.  Edward's environs give color, from the black and white of his castle, to the eerie green of his gardens, to the pastel-mint kitsch of his neighbors' houses. And the story puts the meal together with softness, chew, and crunch, and the romance between Edward and Kim finishes the meal sweetly.Of course, when your chef is Tim Burton and your server is Vincent Price (in one of his last performances), the lights are dim, the tablecloth is black, and the candlesticks are cobwebbed.  Though presented as a children's fable (which, like Rocky and Bullwinkle, also satisfies the adults who ""get"" what the children don't), this might not be for kids who still fear the darkness under the bed.

One of Burton's Finest...,"Burton has lamented over the years that Edward Scissorhands is his personal favorite work, and his most personal one. You can certainly feel the love and care that he put into this film, and it shows. Edward Scissorhands is probably his most heartfelt and emotionally warm feature that he's ever done. While his films tend to be offbeat, madcap romps with a macabre, gothic edge, Edward Scissorhands is probably his most emotional feature (at least that I've seen), while still retaining his wackier, energetic style that he's become known for over the years.Burton is self aware, but never cruel or cynical with his satire. His depiction of surburbia is just as fantastical, offbeat, and madcap as any of the other fantasy worlds that Burton and co have dreamed up. Burton's satire comes from the perspective of a curious child, mystified and perplexed by the odd ways that their parents operate, rather than the pessimistic, jaded edge of an angsty teenager or a world-weary, sardonic adult. It is mocking and jeering, but also loving in its offbeat, oddball sensibility that only Tim Burton is capable of when on his top form. Elfman's score is also fitting for the film, as all great scores are. It is whimsical, playful, and even etherial, but also ironic and biting in its own satirical elements. Much like Spielberg and Williams, Burton and Elfman are collaborators who work like a finely tuned machine.Depp is at his peak form here, the best that he's ever delivered if you asked me. This was at his peak in the 90s where he really came into his own and showed the world that he was more than a teen sex symbol. He brings a deeply felt emotional sensitivity to the character of Edward and captures the innocent, child-like personality of his character perfectly. I often dislike when people say that an actor 'disappears into the character', but Depp brings an earnestness to the character that makes you buy into the idea that he is this character at play. The rest of the acting is great, from Anthony Michael Hall's turn in a villainous role to Pam Grier and Alan Arkin's roles as Kim's parents, and most importantly Winona Ryder as Kim, who becomes Edward's love interest. It is the relationship that gives the film most of its heart and power that makes it so lasting after all of these years.I also wonder if Edward has a form of Aspergers disorder, which would make sense with Burton himself suffering from the disorder and it also creates another subtext that I can also latch onto, considering my own experiences with the disorder. Much like other sufferers of Aspergers, Edward is awkward, slow to understand normal human interactions, and not always aware of how to make friends. This often leads to some of the film's more humorous moments, as well as some of the film's more tragic moments where people attempt to take advantage of Edward's naivete for their own ends.In the end, Edward is an awkward, socially inept young man who's just trying to find acceptance in his community. I've heard some criticisms of the film being a sort of power fantasy for Burton, himself known as the eccentric outsider, where he can get the girl and 'be cool', but again I find that Burton's view is not of a disgruntled outsider, but of the curious adolescent. He doesn't make Edward into an overtly 'cool' character, but keeps him true to himself as the shy, awkward loner, trying to find a place in the world, yet never managing to find it. Edward Scissorhands' bittersweet tragedy lies in the fact that Edward will never find acceptance in normal life, but he knows that it was nice to be loved while it lasted.Edward Scissorhands is Burton at his best, his penchant for exploring the outcasts and freaks of society has never been more purely expressed than with this film. I think why Burton is so special is that he appeals to the freak and outcast nature that lies in everyone, and I think that the people who know how it feels to be an outcast find more meaning in it, I know that I am among those people who find such a meaning in Edward Scissorhands.Many childhood films tend to not age well, rather it be because they're of their time, have dated poorly, or are simply just not as good as you once remembered them. But I can happily say that Edward Scissorhands is one of those childhood favorites that seems to be more profound to me, even as I move towards a more cynical age.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A nice fairytale with good humour,"In a suburban location where all houses are alike, but in different colour, there is a scary castle on top of a hill where Edward lives all by himself.

A cosmetics seller finds him and adopts him, the problem is to get the community to accept him..This is a highlight of Burton, Depp and Elfman, each doing one of their most supreme achievements so far. Emotionally, touching, sad and funny this caricatured picture of suburban America is highly engaging. A film fit for family and Christmas.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Where All the Best of Tim Burton Has Pooled Into One,"An inventor (Vincent Price) creates a man from a robot, but passes on before the being (Edward Scissorhands, played by Johnny Depp) can be completed -- he still has scissors for hands and black leather for a body. After being rescued by a door to door saleswoman, Edward finds a new home in the city. But can the villagers accept someone so different?I don't know if this is Tim Burton's best film, but it certainly is the most Burtonesque film of his, if that makes sense. We have plenty of the quirky aspects Burton likes (see ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"") and, of course, his love of all things goth (see almost all his other films). We also have two of his favorite actors (Depp, who has appeared in countless Burton films, and Winona Ryder, from his ""Beetlejuice"").Visually, this film is stunning. The houses all pastel and in a row look very odd, but make a great statement about the uniformity of communities. The inventor's shop is a perfect Rube Goldberg machine in action. The ice carving scene is beautiful, and the hedges are clipped wonderfully. The only thing in this film I found actually difficult to look at was the contrast between Winona Ryder's hair and her eyebrows. Please, Winona, stay brunette.We have comedy, romance... we have the meanest looking Anthony Michael Hall (what happened to the lovable nerd from ""Breakfast Club""?). You'll love the monster, you'll fear the monster. This modern retelling of ""Frankenstein"", unlike virtually every other retelling, is actually fun for the whole family and beautiful in its own way.And, of course, we have the Danny Elfman soundtrack. I can't think of any good reason not to see this film. At least ,as long as you don't mind the really obvious bait-and-switch of dogs during the grooming scene (watch the breeds change during the snipping). Go ahead and watch this... the fewest words Johnny Depp will probably ever say in a movie, back when he had that baby face.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
One of the best movies of 1990,"Movies are made to have a lasting expression on the audience for many days.Edward Scissorhands is one of them.This movie is showcased so beautifully by Tim Burton that you seem to think how could Johnny Depp (Edward)take up such a role and play it to perfection.The man has frequently been criticized for his expressionless acting and does not have the capability to carry a film on his own shoulders.But Depp's performance in the film has silenced his critics forever and made them stand to witness arguably the best performance of his career.Depp doesn't have many lines to boast of in the movie.But he portrays brilliant expressions convincingly in each and every scene.Editing and photography is top notch.Dialogues are superb and give a lift to each scene.Music by Danny Elfman is haunting,magical and outstanding.The melody of his songs is in accordance with the theme of the movie.Winona Ryder(Kim)was Depp's girlfriend during the shooting of the movie.She too plays her part perfectly and gives able support to Depp.The chemistry between them is the highlight of the film.They look so beautiful on screen no wonder they were a couple in real life.But the credit has to go to Tim Burton,who has handled his most personal project with dedication and sincerity.He has shown how Edward adapts to a new world outside his mansion and how he experiences various emotions in life.The movie is an honor to watch and the climax of the movie will move you for days to come.Excellent 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Loved This Growing Up!,"This movie will go down in history as one Johnny Depps best of all time, this film has it all.. comedy, sadness, and happiness, it really is the whole package. Johnny Depp is an amazing actor who has the charisma of an entire room filled. Perfect peformances from pretty much everyone, this really holds a special place within me and it will never be an incredible film.The fact that its not relatable doesn't make it dull or boring, imagine having scissors for hands, the possibilities are endless or limited depending how you look at it, such an underrated film that should have a re-release to show this new generation how beautiful movies once were. I catch this film anytime its on the television, Netflix literally anywhere i see it i click it.Highly recommended for sure, one of Depp greatest, definately worth the watch if you haven't sen it, I had to review it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A Modern Day Fairy Tale...,"...is how I would describe this excellent movie hatched from the wonderfully twisted imagination of Tim Burton. Johnny Depp is brilliant as Edward, a lovably naive and believably tragic character built by a mad genius (Vincent Price) but left incomplete with razor sharp scissors for hands. Depp's facial expressions and mannerisms in this film are so excellent. Depp is truly one of America's greatest actors.Burton constructs a wonderfully surreal and satirical suburbia world. The bulk of the interest of this movie is Edward learning to adjust himself and his uniqueness in environment that is bland and thoroughly not unique.Excellent performances all around. However, the ending was kind of cliched and too easy of a way out. This is the only thing preventing me from giving this movie a perfect score. However, this movie's main underlying morals/themes about being colorful in a colorless world strike a chord of understanding within myself. Those of us who have been different from the norm our entire lives will find a immense love for Edward and a deeper understanding of this film.

"The Perfect  Holiday Movie - but forget the scissors, what about the teeth?","Holiday movie watching is not a tradition to be taken lightly. Non-binding clothing must be donned, a hot drink must be within arm's reach, and a cozy blanket must be tucked up against one's chin to foil any possibility of draught. In a perfect world, a fire would sizzle and pop in the fireplace, and inclement weather would rage against the window panes.And Johnny Depp would be on my couch. Or at least in my DVD player. ""Edward Scissorhands"" (1990) is a heartwarming, quirky romantic comedy with a twist of fantasy. It's the story of an awkward, innocent misfit, and it's just the right choice for a wintery evening in.My personal love affair with Johnny Depp began in 1990 when he played Edward Scissorhands. But I'm going to try to be objective in this review, really I am.It begins as a kind of fairy tale, a grandmother tucking a child into bed while explaining the mysterious origins of snow. I would like to say the film is suitable for the whole family, but there is one seductress scene where the neighborhood hussy (Marge, delightfully played by Kathy Baker) tries to Mrs. Robinsonize young Edward in the back room of her beauty parlor, the innuendo of which would bump the film into the PG-13 category. (Hooray!)Edward (Johnny Depp) is an awkward misfit boy, who has been created with scissory blades where his hands should be. He speaks only 169 words in the entire movie and looks at the world with wide wonder. He desperately wants to do the right thing; moving around gingerly so he doesn't stab or slash anything. By the time Edward punctures the water bed with an accidental poke, and then tries to fix the spouting water by covering it up with stuffed animals, he has won our hearts.Edward Scissorhands is regarded by many critics to be the crazy-haired director Tim Burton's finest film. No argument here. Burton calls it his favorite creation as well. It was his first project with the then 27-year-old Depp, the first of seven collaborations between the two.The Burton/Depp relationship itself bears some discussion.Why is there this unholy alliance between the disheveled, uncombed lunatic Tim Burton and the man-god Johnny Depp? What fuels this obsession of Johnny's to keep making Tim's movies? Johnny once said in an interview that he would do anything Tim Burton asked him to do. ANYTHING! (capitals mine) Yes, Johnny, we KNOW you love Tim but you don't have to say ""yes"" every time the man drinks too much tequila and has a weird movie idea.I have a theory about why Tim and Johnny are joined at the artistic hip: People with gaps in their front teeth are magnetically drawn to other people with gaps in their front teeth. Hear me out, there's empirical data.In orthodontic terms, this gap is called diastema, and I think the National Science Foundation needs to throw some serious research money at the diastema-to-love correlation. Tim Burton has it. Johnny has it. Johnny's life partner Vanessa Paradis has it - the exact same gap in her front teeth that Johnny has. Coincidence? My theory is that there is a glittery, invisible beam of attraction that emanates from the heart, comes up through the esophagus and is emitted out the gappy tunnel between the teeth. It then passes through the other person's gappy tunnel, and locks on to their heart, resulting in love. Or a movie deal.But Burton and Depp aren't the only ones involved here.If it is possible for me to love anyone in this film as much as I love Johnny Depp, it is Dianne Wiest. She superbly plays Peg, the Avon lady and the mom everyone wants to have. Her reaction upon first meeting the frightening looking Edward? ""What happened to your hands? Where are your parents? I think you need to just come home with me."" She adopts Edward and brings him home to live with her family. I want her to adopt me.This was Vincent Price's final film. Price plays a small but poignant role as Edward's creator/father, living in the eerie, Gothic castle, and kindly tutoring Edward in all subjects including proper decorum when tea is served. Ironically, Price's death scene was to be the last scene he ever filmed before his own death, a fitting farewell to the Crown Prince of all things mysterious.Winona Ryder plays Edward's love interest, Kim. Edward is instantly transfixed by her photograph, but the relationship never materializes. SPOILER ALERT: At the end of the film, Edward hears the words he has longed to hear from Kim: ""Hold me."" He tries, but cannot, because he is afraid of hurting her. But she maneuvers in past his blades and snuggles against his chest in what is possibly the sweetest embrace in all of cinematic history.In real life, Johnny and Winona had a hotly fueled affair that was to end in a bad breakup and a tattoo revision. I think it's obvious why things didn't work out: Winona has good teeth.** Special thanks to longtime friend Carlos Alcala, the ""Chick Flick Guy,"" for prodding me to finally write this and for including this on his wonderful romantic comedy Blog!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

"Burton when he made good films, this was one of them .","Tim Burton was ones among them most loved and respected directors and writers in the business with his first films like Beetlejuice (1988), Batman (1989) and Edward Scissorhands (1990) been some of them and today I will review the later. In Edward Scissorhands, we follow a typical suburban family, who discovers Edward, a gentle, quiet and lovable man, who has a ""small"" issue, he has scissors for hands!! OK, that seems wacky and nuts, but this Burton we are talking about and his style is intense to say the least.After-wards the family brings him in their home ,where the rest of the community starts to come to see that person ,ho frankly is as unique as it comes. Something I admire is that how they approach Edward, it was totally realistic ,think yourself how would you act if you saw a dude with scars in his face ,in goth clouting and wit huge scissors for hands, this how!! In general the film feels like a modern fairy tale with the mix of Gothic and suburban colorful image.One other thing that I have to praise is Johnny Depp as the title character. Also this was his first major big screen role. And unlike the ones we all have known and at this is point bored to see, he was completely unrecognizable as Mr. Scissorhands, very little dialogue and he mostly expressed himself through saddle facial moves and body language. Which is also really realistic for he was isolated for years and he didn't have any human contact for years up to now, so yes it is reasonable for him to be a little awkward.To continue we have also a romance in the film ,which is handle so beautifully that at times you feel sorry for our protagonist for even though he is quit nice, his fantasy , as it is showed by his enterprises when he uses his hands, is of the chart, he can't hang or pet some because of his hands. Pretty sad if you ask me, I mean we often hear about persons, who have incredible strength or possess a deep knowledge of martial arts, but they are unable to be physical with others out of the fear that they would cause intentionally any injury. Now think that Edward has literally sharp blades for hands, it is if not worse, then the next worst thing after the previous examples.All in all this a modern classic ,with a ending that will make you cry and it is high recommended to any couple or film-buff in general. Also like Princess Bride this is the one of the thousand romantic films that everyone can enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

"Some flaws in the story, but a very powerful message within","I have always admired the unusual way, in which Tim Burton is able to communicate his opinion on old-as-our-world topics. In Edward Scissorhands he confronts the viewer with the constantly recurring problem of personal alienation and rejection from the society, because of differences that might seem too hard to comprehend or actually too scary for most of the 'normal' people.In the deeply satirical, and highly unconventional manner Burton tries to persuade everyone that good heart and pure kindness won't be enough to be accepted, and that it sometimes takes less than a few minutes to change the way others perceive us. The extraordinary often tends to bore people after a while and they simply throw out human beings like trash bags when they don't need them anymore.With fantastic special effects and spectacular optical illusions Edward Scissorhands is able to astound in the sphere of visual experiences. However, due to some flaws in the storytelling department it is still not such a fine piece of work like Beetlejuice or Batman.In a strangely artificial world, where all houses are painted in high-contrast pastel colors, and people wear deliciously ugly and glaring uniforms, there is also a place for a gloomy 'haunted' house standing on a hill. The only person that occupies it is a boy named Edward. Because of the death of his creator, a mad scientist (Vincent Price), he is left with pairs of huge temporary scissors instead of hands.Ono one shiny day one of the loony housewives, Peg (Dianne West), who lives in the city with her husband, son and daughter, comes knocking on his door, and after just a few moments she decides to take him home. In a community, where everybody is nearly as weird as Edward is, people don't find him strange or frightening. What's more, they are truly amazed by his fantastic abilities, namely the special gift of forming beautiful figures in bushes and ice blocks, and turning regular haircutting into an art form. He is glorified by the local news channels and loved by all the creepy ladies. He is the talk of the town, a one of a kind 'toy' that brings so much fun into this bizarre scenery. There is even some place for romance between him and Kim (Winona Ryder), the family's daughter. However, as it always happens, there are some people who don't appreciate an eccentric man with scissors as his fingers running around posing as a proper citizen. Soon, after a series of unlucky events, Edward is wrongly accused of breaking into a house and all of the fame and love starts to fade away as quickly as it came. And even though what happens next to Edward is truly sad and unfair, the ending is merely as predictable and Hollywood-like. Hard-pressed and angered, the main character is forced to resort to violence and kill the oppressing forces.The collaboration between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp is nearly as perfect as ever. Without the fantastic character that they both created the movie wouldn't ever be as watchable as it is now. Depp shines on-screen, other characters maybe not so much, but what counts is that through this bizarre and visually impressive movie Burton was able to spread out the word about discrimination and loneliness in the most peculiar, yet really admirable way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Johnny Depp & Tim Burton / Wow!,"What a great film! Wonderful writing, directing & acting. One of the best films of the '90s. Thank you, Johnny Depp & Tim Burton!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
The best movie.,"It is only in a Tim Burton world that such a scenario could begin a film...we have a dark, gothic looking castle sitting in the midst of small-town America. It is unlike any other home in the town, and it clearly is a place to be avoided. It exudes darkness and isolation. Yet, in a Tim Burton world nothing is untouchable and no place is unreachable. So, we become witness to the town's ever present Avon Lady (Dianne Wiest) walking dutifully to the door, knocking on the door and meeting its sole inhabitant, Edward (Johnny Depp).Wiest is, perhaps, the perfect actress to play this role as she herself presents as eccentric yet strangely maternal. She listens to Edward unlike anyone probably ever has, and she learns that he was created in a laboratory, however, before he could be finished his creator (Vincent Price) died leaving him with scissors for hands.She becomes the protector of Edward and takes him home to her family, a spouse (Alan Arkin) and daughter (Winona Ryder). Much of the first half of the film involves Edward's transition to a more socialized existence, and the natural curiosity of the neighbors, ranging from a nosy Joyce (Cathy Baker) to a wide range of others. In many ways, Edwards becomes accepted for his gifts with his hands, especially for lawn decoration. His scenes with Winona Ryder are quite tender, and scenes with neighborhood children of great innocence.Yet,being in small-town America always exacts a price. Edward becomes the object of ridicule and hatred of Jim, a town bully (Anthony Michael Hall).Here is where the script from Burton and Caroline Thompson begins to do a slow fade into mediocrity. Where the first 2/3 of the film had been unique, innovative, touching and imaginative, the latter 1/3 of the film becomes stereotypical Hollywood and the ending itself feels largely plastered on and created only for marketing purposes. It is, in my opinion, where the film loses its potential for greatness.As with nearly all Burton films, ""Edward Scissorhands"" is beautiful to behold with stunning cinematography, art design, costume design and production values. Burton always has a stunning vision and the ability to create that vision within the context of film. Yet, ""Edward Scissorhands"" also reveals Burton's willingness to occasionally dip into his barrel of cliche's in order to finish a story. Furthermore, he occasionally rests on the style of his film instead of using that style to enhance the development of his characters. Thus, towards the end when we are forced to deal with Edward's conflicts it is difficult to become emotionally involved in the scenario.Johnny Depp is simply marvelous in the role of Edward. Long a courageous actor, Depp inhabits a character that by all accounts should have been a freak or caricature. Instead, Depp gives Edward a soulfulness and depth that makes you ache for him until the final third of the film.""Edward Scissorhands"" is a special film. It's a unique, lovely and enchanting Burton vision brought to life beautifully. Bordering on masterpiece, but nearly sabotaged by the final third of the film, ""Edward Scissorhands"" will move you even when the script fails him. In a time when too many films fall into the cookie cutter studio formulas, ""Edward Scissorhands"" is a reminder of the power of a unique story and a grand vision to entertain and inspire.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

"It's a simple story, simply told","In the weird-looking house at the top of the hill an almost perfect man is created on a strange-looking assembly line.  Unfortunately, before his hands can be attached, the mastermind collapses and dies.  It is the Avon lady on one of her calls who finds pale-faced Edward.  That's what she calls him.....Edward Scissorhands because he has scissors instead of hands and fingers,It's a great little fairy tale acted out with so much sincerity and good humour you could be forgiven if you believed it actually happened.The simple sets are cleverly painted in primary colours that give you the feeling you are looking at a child's picture book of fairy tales, everything is so neat, so clear-cut, so uncomplicated.I don't think Edward has any blood in him which accounts for his pale face. No wonder then that the Avon uses him as a model to experiment with her large range of cosmetics.What a transformation!  What a nice advertisement for Avon!Edward (Johnny Depp) with his dead pan expression is an expert with scissors.....chopping salads, cutting hedges, trimming dogs, and hairstyling the ladies of the neighbourhood.

Heartwarming and Tragic Tale of Being Different,"This is a movie that I remember, but it wasn't until after college that I watched all the way through. I would see this on the movie channels. I believe it also took a while to connect that Johnny Depp was the star as the titular Edward Scissorhands, that Tim Burton directed and that this also featured Winona Ryder. Jaime and I watched this as we continued to work through Depp's filmography for JwaC Presents Depp Dive: A Depper Look at Johnny's Feature Filmography.We start this in the present where Kim (Ryder) is an old woman. She is telling a tale to a little girl. This is following her mother, Peg (Dianne Wiest), who is the local Avon representative. She goes around to her friends who shut their doors on her. She also targets a teenager who doesn't have money. That's when she sets her sights on the spooky house at the top of a hill. She goes there to find Edward hiding. He has scars on his face, so she takes him home to help.Currently, Kim is away so he stays in her room. Peg lives with her husband, Bill (Alan Arkin), and son, Kevin (Robert Oliveri). The man that she brought home makes her the talk of the neighborhood. Her friends are Helen (Conchata Ferrell), Marge (Caroline Aaron), Joyce (Kathy Baker) and Tinka (Susan Blommaert), to name ones that jumped out. They bully this family into hosting a cookout to show him off.Edward is a quiet young man who might be human. He was created by the inventor, played by Vincent Price. This old man passed away before he could give Edward real hands. He tries to acclimate living in this different world, but it's not easy. He doesn't understand things and he's bullied by Kim's boyfriend, Jim (Anthony Michael Hall). Being isolated like he has is tough. Edward doesn't seem to fit in.Now it was with this watch that Jaime asked if this was a horror movie. I don't think it is even though we are getting a variation of the Frankenstein story. The inventor created machines that have human-like features. He decides to create Edward. What is different here though is that Peg wants to help him. She means well. The problem is that he is a 'monster' due to being different. There is a variation on the angry villagers with torches and pitchforks that we get here as well. This was creative what Burton did.I do think this is aided by the first collaboration between him and Depp. Cry-Baby before this shows that Depp can take on odd roles. This one is even more so. He must show limited understanding to the world around him through dialogue and social cues. He is also a robot, android or something like this, so he doesn't come with emotions for the most part. To bring back the idea of Frankenstein, Edward falls in love with Kim. She is already seeing Jim, but this young man is odd. She does see that he is sweet and would do anything for her. Before getting away from this, Depp has a great performance here. He doesn't need to talk as much to convey different things.Surrounding him is talent as well. Ryder is good as this teen girl. I even like Hall as her jerk boyfriend. It is funny to think of his role in Breakfast Club to what he does here. Wiest is great as this motherly figure who wants to help but has to realize that it won't work. Arkin is funny as the aloof father to this family. I like Baker, Ferrell, Aaron and the other nosy neighbors. They're all good. Oliveri is solid as the annoying younger brother. I also love the cameo by Price. The acting is quirky and fit a Burton film well.All that is left then to say is that this is a good movie. It feels like a dark fairy tale that Burton is known for. I love borrowing elements of Frankenstein to tell this tale. The cinematography is good and showing how similar all the houses in the suburbs are. It is even better that there's this dark ominous house on the hill. What I'll say is that I love this film. It is heartwarming and sad. The acting helps to capture that feeling as well. I'd recommend this if you've never seen it or it has been a while.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A creative man who wanted to touch but couldn't.,"You may not be able to touch with scissorhands but you can still feel.Tim Burton created the character of Edward to portray a gentle outsider who wanted to touch but couldn't due to his disability-if that's what it could be called. Edward, played masterfully by a young Johnny Depp, lives an isolated life away from ""suburbia"", until he is discovered by a kindly Avon lady (Dianne Wiest) and taken into her home.Johnny Depp lends an innocent performance to the role, his eyes show his emotions more then any other part of his body. The character he plays is instantly likeable despite his strange appearance. I think that this performance paved the way to some of Depp's other roles as general outsiders in an unforgiving world.Winona Ryder plays the part of kim. Edward immediately falls for her beauty, but, alas, she is attached to Jim (played by Anthony Michael hall, seen in John Hughes movies including the Breakfast club) But kim soon sees the love that Edward holds for her in his eyes.The film portrays the horror of ""suburbia"" and how people can turn on other's in the blink of an eye. It is a very emotional work, although humour is involved as Edward tries to adjust to suburban life.The film also shows how the love between two people can survive forever even when pushed apart by the pressures of society.It is a fairy tale that digs deeper then its appearance. Tim Burton creates Edward's world in typical Burton-esque style, from the mansion that Edward resides in, to his topiary,ice, and hair creations, Burton somehow merges dark images with vibrance.Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's first film together cements there movie partnership in great style.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Edward Shouldn't Run... Ever.,"Oh Burton, what happened to you? This was a stunning visual feast, a series of captivating images and metaphors, a whole world from inside his twisted mind and brought to life in a way that is magically macabre. Depp delivers an astonishing performance given the outfit and makeup he's working with as well as the stunted speech the character has, making him really work in order to get all the emotions across. There's so much here that it's one that definitely warrants repeat viewings.This really is a gem. The only downside is that it reminds us of when Burton/Depp was an absolutely killer combo and now we have... Alice in Wonderland and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. They used to be a dynamite pairing and they have each really dropped off since then. Maybe that's more of an endorsement to how great this was. This is an absolute must watch.

Great intro to Johnny Depp,"This is the very first movie in which I saw Johnny Depp - and I was hooked.A lot of things were very unbelievable, such as how the heck does the man dress himself with those hands? But then, it's a fantasy, or maybe I should say sci-fi story.The topiary forms were most unbelievable, as those animals, etc. couldn't have been shaped from the trees and bushes that he worked on. The viewer just has to go with the flow and not be too critical of those things and must allow for a great stretch of the imagination.That said, I love Depp's acting and since this movie, I have bought everything of his that I can get my hands on.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

"""His scars run deep""","An uncommonly gentle young man, who happens to have scissors for hands, falls in love with a beautiful teenage girl.Edward Scissorhands marks the first film I've seen by Tim Burton, the man behind all these weird but engaging films. The concept intrigues and the man behind it all seeks your wonder, and Edward Scissorhands succeeds! I was on Netflix, lost of what to watch. There's films that I've seen, films that do not intrigue, and films that are critically criticized. I've never wanted to watch one of Tim Burton's films, because they all seem to be presented campy and strange. While I do love films like this, Tim Burton seems to be getting somewhere else. But nevertheless, I watched it and simply loved it. Edward Scissorhands is possibly one of the greatest characters known to man. Johnny Depp plays him wonderfully, and his emotions were sad and lost, but you can read them easily. The character is put into a world just like today's, and doesn't exactly know what to do. I loved this concept, because it's real and entertaining, and also lots and lots of heartfelt put into it. The movie also has this bizarre feel to it. It wants you to be feeling for this character, but also feeling an comedic side to it. Tim Burton succeeds at presenting the film with great dark-humor, and I was chuckling at scenes that weren't meant to be chuckled at... What I liked most though was the ending. Yeah, yeah, endings are mostly a hate/like relationship, but Edward Scissorhands wins at all directions. It takes a fantasy-esque direction, and ends it with the feeling of sadness and happiness. The ending was fantastic, and it was great to see this emotional dept to it. So all in all, if you can take your daily dosage of bizarre-ness, and also understand Tim Burton's perspective, you'll love this film. Even if you love romantic films (which Edward Scissorhands presents real and true) this film is going to be loved. Now I'm going to be right back while I watch another Tim Burton film. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A Beautiful Duo in Johnny And Burton,"When Johnny & Burton team up.. you know they are going to bring down the house. This is one of Tim Burton best movies that I have seen. What a sad and lonely place it is to be different from everyone else Johnny Depp pot ray's these emotions and more in this beautiful movie, the music is so intoxicating and dark. I love everything about this movie. Edward Scissorhands is one of those movies that become something really big on our hearts and becomes one of Depp's best iconic movies of all time, everything that this movie deliver was great and its just one of those films that we the audience will always have on mind.

Very touching story,"As always, Johnny Depp are awesome as in all other pieces he's been involved with and ""Edward Scissorhands"" ain't no exception. I was sort of surprised, it all starts pretty much like a comedy to me, to later on develop into a really touchy story. I'm very impressed by Tim Burton, this is truly a masterpiece. The way Edward is played, reminds me pretty much of the main character in ""Donnie Darko"", and I just love it.The good thing about this piece is, that it ain't disturbing the mood too much after seeing it, still you feel very touched and like you've been through a so much longer story than you really have (105 minutes feels like 3 hours, in a good way). Seeing this ain't something I regret, thumbs up for this piece!",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A romantic fantasy classic,"Edward (Johnny Depp) is a man created by an inventor (Vincent Price) who is unable to finish him before his untimely death. Edward spends many years in solitude in the castle upon the hill until he is discovered by a kind lady from the town below (Dianne Wiest) who brings him into society and he quickly finds a lot of advantages having scissors for hands while also trying to find his place. It goes without saying that this is an iconic film not just in the genres of romance or fantasy but of filmmaking in general. Much like Beetlejuice beforehand, nothing has managed to capture the magic and the feeling of isolation more than this. Edward is a beautiful character; you feel such sympathy towards him and is one of the most relatable protagonists in film history. Tim has mentioned before that Edward represents how he felt as a teenager; wanting to fit in but being unfairly categorised. The desire to touch but inability to do so in fear or destroying something. It's a really powerful metaphor and through his perfect direction and Depp's incredible performance this symbolism completely hits home. The make up and costume department absolutely excel in creating the look of the characters, particularly Ed with his scarred visage resembling years of troubled attempts at self-care. West is fantastic as Peg; such a lovely human being and a career-defining role. Winona Ryder plays Kim; the girl who captures Edward's heart and his fascination with her is gorgeously told with delicate camera close ups. As well as being romantic and sweet, it's also tinged with genuine threat from outside influences making for the more sinister edge of the film and is also really funny with great supporting roles from Alan Arkin adding to it; Ed's first time drinking is a classic comedy moment. I could go on but you already know how great it is surely! A film for anytime of the year, especially the winter months and a brilliant, star-making performance for Depp",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Definitely an Art-house movie,"The movie is very darkened, and cripsy like Twas the Nightmare Before Christmas because the meaning throughout the movie was something that no other movie would've had. This movie had also moved from the 80's into the 90's in a good transition. Tim Burton makes brilliant films, even his Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is probably going to be a box-office hits, and probably better than the original. The characters are not stereotypical. They're the creepy neighbors that are too jolly until Johnny Depp's character totally misplaces the scene. I call that genius because it's symbolic for someone trying to fit in, even they do have scissors for hands. Probably wondering what an art-house movie is....well, it's a film that shows some sort of quality, that it could tell a story without making it into a film, also it could be symbolic in superflourous ways. The movie in the beginning has a good feel to it because the narrator is an old lady, making it cozy, and pleasing to hear. This is an art-house movie because this movie is very symbolic, and has a feedback that can be strong enough to be a story itself. If you've watched his other movies, then this movie has total relations.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A wonderfully moving film,"I have seen this many times over the years and my view that it is truly a masterpiece has never changed. It is simply Tim Burton at his best with the use of Gothic and mystical sets, dark humour and wonderful performances. The real show stealer here for me though has to be the score of Danny Elfman which is truly something to behold. I have always been a huge fan of his and Burton has used him in every film I can think of. Here he is at his peak. The score here perfectly captures the tone of the film brilliantly and is at is best during the scene where Winona Ryder dances in the snow while Johhny Depp is cutting an ice block towards the end. It should have won an Oscar and is one of the best, if not the best scores i've ever heard.Perormances of the entire cast led by Depp and Ryder are top notch and the cinematography beautifully captures the 1950's town and dark mansion perfectly. I have to say this is my favourite Tim Burton film purely because it shows what a wonderful vision he has and the fantasy and tragedy of his story really works well. I believe this is heavily underrated but looks to be finally receiving the acclaim it deserves here on IMDb. Long may it continue.Beautiful 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A magical film,"Tim Burton has proved himself as an amazing visual artist over the years with movies such as the first two batman films, The nightmare before Christmas and beetlejuice. But the film he is mostly remembered for is this towering achievement. It is almost like watching a modern day version of Frankenstein. Johny depp plays the role of the boy with garden shears for hands down to a tee. The dark imagery and haunting soundtrack from Danny Elfman make it all the more worhtwile to see. Although this movie might scare some children (I first saw it when I was 4 and it scared me to death) it is actually a beautiful fairy tale and a tragic love story about two people who are made for each other but their differences tear them apart. All in all I strongly recommend this wonderful gem from the master himself Tim Burton. Its a pity that he doesn't make more films like this today.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Is this one in the textbooks?,"As I type this I ask myself ""with 204 comments posted already, what can I add?""  Well, probably not much, other than to say that this is a film that compels you.  It compels you to smile, to laugh, to cry, to cuss, to want to see Anthony Michael Hall's character beaten into an inky black spot, or in my case, write a comment on IMDB.I've never been to film school, and I find myself wondering if film schools make a study of this film.  Is it in the textbooks somewhere?  Do aspiring filmmakers study this movie for direction, context, genre, subtlety?  Damn if they shouldn't.Anyway, since a million others have done a fine job summarizing the film, I won't repeat their efforts.  I'll just say.... Tim Burton: Masterpiece... a stellar director's crowning achievement.  Jonny Depp: Genius... a bold move, early in his career, firmly establishing himself as his generation's finest actor.  Danny Elfman... Brilliant... a perfect score, not a note out of place, again, establishing himself as his generation's finest cinematic composer.

When I Fell in Love with Johnny Depp...,"I officially fell in love with Johnny Depp and gained a brand new respect for him as an actor after seeing 1990's EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, the darkest of black comedies, in which Depp plays the creation of a mad scientist (Vincent Price, in his final film role)who, after the death of his creator, is disturbed to learn that his creator did not finish his hands and left his hands as large scissor-like objects who is befriended by a kindly Avon Lady (Dianne Wiest)who takes him home to live with her family. Director Tim Burton takes the ""fish out of water"" concept to an all-new level, creating an alternately dark and vibrant cinematic canvas that encompasses some of the most interesting color schemes that I've seen in a film in ages. A razor sharp screen- play is given yeomen service by Wiest, Winona Ryder as her daughter who Edward develops a crush on, Alan Arkin as Wiest's husband, Anthony Michale Hall as Ryder's boyfriend, and Kathy Baker as an amorous neighbor; however, it is Depp who dominates the proceedings with a devastating, tragic, sweet, brave, and touching performance. There is nary a false note in his performance as Depp plays the stranger in a strange land to perfection. This film was the genesis of the Depp-Burton collaboration that would continue into other films, but it all started here...this magical fantasy journey into the darkest parts of suburbia will thrill, amuse, and entertain.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Tim Burton and Johnny Depp now that's a winning team!,"Tim Burton might just be the most interesting director from the last few decades and there's no doubt in my mind that Johnny Depp is the best character actor to ever grace the big screen. Neither are my favorites but extremely high on the list. I have always said that Johnny might not be my favorite actor but he is definitely the best, and watching movies like Edward Scissorhands is proof of that.Edward Scissorhands is one of those movie characters that will forever be remembered and that's possible not only because of Depp, but Tim Burton's beautiful and artistic way of bringing him to life. The town and the castle on the hill and the perfect mixture of bright colors and dark ones to differentiate the moods and atmospheres surrounding those settings were on point.I have noticed that this is the second feature film in which Burton really shined. The first being Beetle Juice, which was his breakthrough masterpiece, also had this direction style that took on a life of its own. When a director can just add so much beauty to a scene and do one of those shots that you just cant take your eyes off of that's rare and Burton does it so well.The actors were amazing and are almost as memorable as Edward was. I was so happy to see Vincent Price in what I think might have been his last role. Price is a legend and like Ed Wood tried to do for Lugosi, Burton wanted to showcase the legend that Vincent Price was.This movie is amazing and a historical cinematic gem.

Tim Burton's Best,"My favorite Tim Burton movie.Johnny Depp plays the eponymous eccentric, a patchwork man created by an old inventor (Vincent Price) who dies before he can give him hands. A tragedy of sorts ensues when he's adopted by a suburban American family, only to ultimately discover that there's no place for him in the ""normal"" world.""Edward Scissorhands"" covers many of Burton's recurring themes: the artist as mad genius; the lack of tolerance for anything different from the norm. But what I like about it is the intense heart beating at the center of the movie. It's full of love, really, and of kind people. The community is quite accepting of Edward at first. Only when they become scared do they fall into their ""follow the herd"" mentality, but they're not bad people. The character of Edward himself is a miraculous creation, the first sign of what Johnny Depp's idiosyncratic acting choices were capable of. Edward is filled with nothing but kindness and the desire to be kind to others. And the inventor loves his creation the way a father would love his child.The film is sentimental to be sure, but it's sentimental in the way that a fairy tale is, and it works. Every time I see the scene when the inventor gives Edward a heart made out of a cookie, or the scene where Edward creates an ice sculpture while Winona Ryder dances in the ""snow"" created by the ice shavings, I have to fight down a lump in my throat.And let me say that this film would not be what it is without Danny Elfman's marvelous score, one of the best ever written for a movie.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

A good film,"Tim Burton's ""Edward Scissorhands"" (1990) is a gothic fantasy film that tells the story of an artificially created man named Edward, who has scissor blades for hands. Isolated in a Gothic mansion, Edward is discovered by a suburban Avon saleswoman, Peg Boggs, who brings him into her community.Edward's unique appearance initially fascinates the townspeople, and his talent for topiary and hairdressing makes him a local sensation. However, his scissor hands also make him an outsider, leading to misunderstandings and ultimately, rejection.The film explores themes of isolation, loneliness, and the dangers of conformity. Edward, a gentle and innocent soul, becomes a victim of the townspeople's prejudices and their own superficiality. His tragic story highlights the importance of acceptance and understanding.""Edward Scissorhands"" is a visually stunning film with Burton's signature dark and whimsical aesthetic. Johnny Depp delivers a captivating performance as the gentle and tragic Edward, while Winona Ryder shines as Kim, the young woman who falls in love with him. The film's poignant message about the importance of embracing individuality continues to resonate with audiences today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Everything about this movie is perfect,"Edward Scissorhands (1990) is an underrated holiday movie and Tim Burton classic in my DVD collection that my daughter and I recently rewatched on Prime. The storyline follows an artificially created young man who was made by a genius whose last wish was to give him hands but he died before he could put the finishing touches on his creation. The young man lives in hiding above a small town. When an Avon lady discovers him she brings him to her home to try and help him fit in. At first everything begins peachy but as he turns into the target of lust things get out of hand quickly...This movie is directed by icon Tim Burton (Beetlejuice) and stars Johnny Depp (Pirates of the Caribbean), Winona Ryder (Little Women), Dianne Wiest (The Birdcage), Anthony Michael Hall (Weird Science), Vincent Price (The Raven) and Alan Arkin (Argo).Everything about this movie is perfect. The sets and settings are out of control. The cast is perfectly selected and every scene Vincent Price is in makes me smile. Depp's mannerisms, facial expressions and body language is outstanding. Wiest and Hall deliver underrated performances also and this is one of my favorite Winona Ryder characters. The storyline is so unique and like nothing else ever brought to film; and for a concept that sounds outlandish, it worked. The plot unfolds well and the various subplots and supporting characters are interesting. The ending is awesome and I loved the Hall vs Depp showdown...and how can you not love the use of lawn sculptures?Overall, this is an absolute gem and an American cinematic classic.

It's weird and wonderful,"Very enjoyable.It's funny the way we picture things in our minds. I had heard of 'Edward Scissorhands' but actually knew very little about it, typified by the fact I was expecting this to be very dark - probably just based on the seeing the cover here and there. It's much sillier than expected, but in a positive way.I do kinda end up wishing they went down a more dark/creative route, instead of relying on the novelty of having scissors as hands; though, to be fair, they do touch on the deeper side a bit. With that said, I did get a good amount of entertainment seeing this plot unfold. It's weird and wonderful.Johnny Depp is a great actor and is very good here, mainly via his facial expressions and body language. It's cool to see Winona Ryder involved, someone I've thoroughly enjoyed in more recent times in 'Stranger Things'. Alan Arkin and Anthony Michael Hall also appear.The film looks neat, as I've come to expect from Tim Burton. It has the obvious touch of Bo Welch to it, with the neighbourhood looking not too dissimilar to what Welch would create for 2003's 'The Cat in the Hat' - which I, truly, enjoyed.Undoubtedly worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

Amazing and Sad Film.,"Edward Scissorhands id one of Tim Burton's greatest films, and all of his are great films. The movie is a very emotional and artistic movie. The movie is in a class by itself. I couldn't put this movie in any basic genre, though most Tim Burton films can't be, either. Edward Scissorhands has a very artistic and fantasy-like story, one we knew couldn't happen in real life, but it also has a lot of touches of the real world. For example, the setting of the movie is completely far fetched, yet as the story progresses, Edward finds out about many real life problems. We all do, and we all find out about the monsters in us all. Edward, the artificial and ""crippled"" man in the story is the only one that does not have that characteristic in him, while the rest of the cast, normal humans, are the real monsters in the film. Johnny Depp gives a stupendous and absolutely exceptional performance as Edward, a creation made by his master, the late Vincent Price. Edward's creator and master dies before he can complete him, so Edward is left with an error-scissors for hands. He lives up in a mansion until a local Avon lady brings him to her neighborhood, where he falls in love with Kim Boggs, played by Winona Ryder. What follows are extremely sad scenes of the neighborhood slowly progressing to thinking Edward is some monster, especially after a terrible decision Edward makes. Anthony Michael Hall plays the villain-type roll as Kim's boyfriend. He is the main reason why Edward is typecast as a monster in the neighborhood. The ending is very emotional, I can't say that it happy emotion either. The movie succeeds in everything it tries to accomplish. This movie proved to me that there wasn't anything Tim Burton couldn't accomplish. The movie was a flat out masterpiece. 10 out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

"Edward lives in complete solitude, his face and limbs scarred by the scissors he bears in place of hands, until one day he is introduced at last to the 'modern world'. . .","This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Johnny Depp is in top form in his trademark role as an outcast and he captures the character, indeed the very essence of Edward, perfectly. It is also one of Tim Burton's best films. He either makes brilliant films or terrible ones. This is definitely one of the former. The two strongest impressions from this film are of it being something uniquely wonderful and heartbreakingly sad. Although it can be seen as a comment upon society, it is, first and foremost, a story, so merely suspend your disbelief (not that you'll need to try hard to do so,) and lose yourself in the magic of the film.I love this film. . .but I expect you have already guessed that!

"Haunting, achingly beautiful","It's nearing the end of 1999, and this is *still* my favorite Tim Burton film. This is definitely my favorite modern fairy tale. The Elfman score is exquisite, the story is haunting and lovely; the film is simply magnificent.While some have criticized -Edward Scissorhands- for being too ""heavy-handed"" or too obviously allegorical, I think that the inherent message of the film is one that is universal enough not to be a distraction to the film's beauty. The plot and the characters are too original to evoke feelings of ""been there, done that"", even while it may be true that everyone has felt alienation at one time or another.The content of this film runs rampant with ""Burton-isms"", the clever absurdities that are Burton's trademark in films. This film does contain a lot of humor and oddity, but unlike films like  -Beetlejuice -, its story revolves around something that is not alien to anyone - love. This is a love story that breaks the heart. The originality lies in the details, and in the conclusion. It's been a long time since someone has written a fairy tale love story that doesn't end up with the beautiful girl living happily in the castle with the handsome prince. It is the ending that gets me everytime. This is a truly beautiful movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

"Pinochio, Frankenstien, I don't really think so","Coming from Tim Burton, you know that the story won't be something you see everyday. although, it will have elements of classic storys and classic dilemmas, but with that creative Burton twist.A very very ordinary classic 50's style American town sits at the bottom of a huge dark mountain with a scary castle on top. An Avon door to door sales women, discouraged by the fact that everyone in the town knows her and has already bought their supply of makeup, decides to travel up the mountain to try her luck there. She walks right in to the castle and finds Edward there all alone. She sees that Edward has no hands, but instead huge scissors and knives. She assumes he is helpless, and takes him home. The whole town begins to buzz about the irregular visitor. Edward lives with the sales women, and begins to show unusual artistic talents for things like sculpting bushes and cutting hair. unfortunately, Edwards nieve nature is taken advantage of and the town almost immediately all turns against him. To avoid spoiling the movie, I insist you see this movie to learn the rest of the story.I really don't think this movie is as much about Scissors or even Edward, but more about the little town, and their reaction to him. Its easy to say this is just a warped Pinnochio but instead of a little puppets who wants to be a boy, its a guy that wants hands. but, I think there is more going on here. Edwards Scissorhand's are clearly a sort of prison, but they also allow him to express himself, and really his only way to communicate. I think I watched this movie once and counted him as only haveing about 30 lines in the whole movie. For a main character, he is practically Helen Keller. I think that it could be more that he doesn't want hands as much as everyone thinks he should so he can be like them. Possibly, I think this movie is more about society. They go to great pains to show the ordinary, american dream suburb where everyones house is the same, everyone has the same dreams and hopes, Everyone goes to work at the same time, SAME SAME SAME SAME SAME. One example is what I like to call ""the car ballet"", where all the cars pull out of the garage at the same time and drive off. Pure symbolism. They are crying out for something new and different but, are also frightened by it. Just like a school of little scared fish, that change directions in quick motions, with no real good reason. One of my favorite examples in the movie is where a man with a prosthetic leg tells Edward to never let anyone tell him he's handicapped, later he calls Edward a cripple.Is this really about Edward wanting so badly to be like these people, or these people wanting so badly to be like Edward? Or is it simply about the worlds rejection of creativity, and diversity? Truly, these plain, boring, ""ordinary,"" people are just as weird if not more so than Edward. I really think this story is about how the world is full of these people that have no real solo thoughts, and condemn anything different. The crumbling of human society through the effects of purity and perfection. A sad commentary on the current human condition, or lack there of. Love thy common man? only if he is just like you.Does Edward want to be ""a real boy""? I think he probubly already is more than anyone else in the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A dedication to the handicapped,"Truly, Edward Scissorhands is one of Tim Burton's masterpieces.  He mixes mystery, fear, magic, legend, incomprehension and love.  Mainly, the relation between Kim Boggs (Ryder) and Edward Scissorhands (Depp) goes far beyond any imagination could have thought before (no wonder why they dated after the making of the movie).  In a few words, a contemporary fairy tale of how a man-made robot could have become the model of human perfection, until a tragic event crumbles everything down, and how the love of a girl gives him the inspiration to carry on with his life to bring beauty and happiness to the people on the town. Every time I see this movie, it makes me think that life is short and that you must have to get the most out of it...never lose time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

A Beautifully Arranged and Emotional Film,"One of my all time favorite movies, Tim Burton directs another one of his outstanding pieces. There's a marvelous cast playing imaginative characters, especially Johnny Depp, who in the movie plays Edward, and says only a few lines, but was still best for the part and really gets you close to him while watching the movie.Along with Danny Elfman's beautiful score, the plot is well written with touching scenes that that are really meaningful. And there are of course a few funny scenes that can really crack you up. And most of them are quite simple too.This movie truly shows how powerful movies can be.

Beauty and the Beast.,"Tim Burton has updated an old tale of the misunderstood and scary-looking beast (Edward) and his love relationship with an incomparable beauty (Kim or Winona Ryder).  The tale is modernized (sort of) into a suburbia America setting with 60's styles houses, clothing, cars, and people.  The reason this movie is so likable is simply because it interweave's romanticism and darkness with bits of comedy to relieve the tension of the viewer.  This dark fable puts chills down your spine (e.g. when Edward first steps out of the darkness of the attic to meet Peg) while at the same time fills your heart with an equal mixture of happiness and sorrow.  In addition, Burton's  picture was filmed with great elegance.  Who can forget the scene when Edward is carving the ice sculptor and Kim is dancing in the snow he has created?  The ending of the movie is not as melancholy as everyone believes.  It is revelatory about who the real monster is.  This movie can obviously be compared with other tales of individuals who were also outcasts in their society such as Frankenstein and Burton's other masterpiece, Batman.  This work of Burton's is his personal statement to all pariahs who have ever been spurned by the greater populus.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

An Imaginative World Only Possible By Tim Burton!,"Edward Scissorhands (1990, Dir. Tim Burton)In a castle high on top of a hill, an inventor had created his greatest creation. He had created Edward, a near complete person. The creator died before he could finish Edward's hands. Instead, Edward is left with metal scissors for hands. Edward always lived alone, that is until a kind lady called Peg discovers Edward and welcomes him into his home. At first, everyone welcomes Edward into the community, but soon things begin to take a change for the worst.'Edward Scissorhands' is one of those breathtaking pieces of cinema, which open up the imagination completely. Directed by Tim Burton, Music Composed by Danny Elfman and starring the wonderful Johnny Depp. All the ingredients to make not just a perfect Burton movie, but an overall perfect movie. The movie is amazingly created with a tale which you would have not heard before. The costumes are fascinating and the casting is superb. What a better person to work with, for Vincent Price on his last big theatrical role. What really stands out though, is the amazing colours placed throughout the film. Tim Burton goes for his usual dark scenery, but once away from the creepy old castle, the screen comes alive with every colour imaginable.

Burton's most touching piece - a dark and creative fairytale,"Edward (Depp), born with scissors for hands, is brought into the local village and becomes the talk of the town.God bless Tim Burton. Who in their right minds would take a fairy tale and include a man with scissors for hands? Burton's sheer strangeness continues after his beautiful Beetlejuice and Batman in this darkly colourful fantasy drama and throws the fairytale convention out of the window. Burton is an inspiration to the film industry, a man who does everything differently and there is no one else out there like him, and his finally cut creation, inspired by one of his own drawings, is a sentimental spark in his collection, his most touching to date.For those fairytale lovers out there don't worry. This 1990 picture follows the convention of an outsider trying to make it in a land of troubles and difference, also including a beautiful girl and a touching if slightly obvious love story.Like many Burton films he gives us a wonderful imaginative other world.The oppositions encoded into this drama are fantastic. From the cold hearted dark home of Edward's to the unbelievably organised and colourful suburban town below, Burton's imagination allows viewers to see two opposite worlds living next door to each other.These settings are exquisite in establishing the characters. The similar styled houses are those tidy and sophisticated homes you expect the rich and posh to live and sure enough all the middle aged gossip loving women live next door to one another. Their tidiness and appearances create that stereotypical shallow middle aged woman that shapes the story in so many ways.The darkness of Edward's home is brought to life through the cold machinery. The inventor's house is a dark walled, miserable and negative creation and marks the quietness and shyness of central character Edward.Who would believable Captain Jack Sparrow and Edward are portrayed by the same actor? You see Jack's cockiness provoking Elizabeth Swan with his quiet ruthlessness, and then you see Edward hiding his face from Kim with his Scissorhands. How Depp was never nominated for as Oscar for this performance will rage on until the end of time. Words cannot describe how he makes this character.Good support is given by Ryder, West, hall and beautiful protagonist Joyce is created by Kathy Baker's ultimate fake charm.Burton has waved his wand again to cast a dark and imaginative spell over the conventional fairytale and turned it into a bubbling dark and touching fantasy",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Once Again: Awesome,"Tim Burton strikes again in this beautiful fairy tale about Edward, a man with scissors for hands. This is the second Tim Burton movie I've seen, and this one is just as good as the other one. He is great at showing the emotions of the characters in this film. It'll go from funny to sad to another emotion so smoothly. Johnny Depp is great at this character. He brings the sweetness to Edward. He also shows how hard it is for Edward to survive with scissor hands.Again, good facial emotion. Winona Rider was good at showing the change in feelings she feels towards Edward. Danny Elfman also brings the perfect musical score to set the mood. The only thing I did not like about the movie was the pastel colors of the town. They were ugly!! But, all in all, go see this movie. It brings out the person in you that has always wanted to fit in a certain way but couldn't.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Excellent...,"This movie is to Tim Burton what ""Pulp Fiction"" was to Tarantino, and ""Taxi Driver"" to Scorsese.  A definitive directorial vision, put artfully and beautifully on film.  The story, apparently, is a metaphorical reflection of the lonely childhoods of both Burton and screenwriter Caroline Thompson.  The role of Edward put Johnny Depp on the Hollywood map as an artist to be considered for roles of depth and substance.  Burton's direction is flawless, oddly moving, and visually stunning, with the same eerie and head-tilting weirdness that audiences have come to expect from his material.  Long time collaborator Danny Elfman provides a score that ranks among his very best.  The socio-political observations, citations, and commentary that the story and movie provide are both on the ball and thought provoking.  As a character, Edward's tragic innocence, awesome talent, and extraordinary imagination are brought to life with remarkable sensitivity by Depp.  Winona Ryder, Alan Archan, Diane Weist, and Anthony Michael Hall are wonderful in their respective supporting roles. A film that will be remembered.  10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
"A funny light-hearted but also sad and tragic tale about a man-made ""monster"" with a human soul","Edward Scissorhands is a classic. It's a funny, light-hearted feel-good movie that actually ends up being quite sad and tragic. The design of Edward's castle/mansion is so cool, it definitely has that Tim Burton aesthetic to it. Edwards tale is one of a fish out of water, one of a man-made monster trying to fit into society. In reality, he's a gentle monster with a pure soul and a kind heart. One could argue that he's probably more human than the actual humans that end up upending his life. It's so sad because Edward has such a good heart and means well, but society and people keep putting him down and making him out to be the villain. Edward also can't help the way he looks, he was almost destined to a future of torment and isolation.It's a movie about abandonment, loneliness and being an outcast. It's about a person that wishes to fit in and wishes for human interaction, but unfortunately society can't help but deem him a monster. The movie also highlights the utopian suburban life, the mob mentality and how quickly people can turn due to gossip, rumors and lies. Almost how the town turned on the monster in Frankenstein. It has a very bittersweet ending, but you can't help but feel so sad for Edward. In essence it's a movie about real life people who look deformed or scary, but have the gentlest and kindest of souls. Highly recommended. Raw score: 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Tim Burton fans should watch it! (Even if they aren't into romantic movies.),"I'm going to say this: I'm not a giant fan of the romance genre. It's either cliched or boring. There are some exceptions like Disney films, Grease, Fault in Our Stars, Shape of Water, and this film. This is one of my favorite Tim Burton movies next to Beetlejuice! The performances are amazing, the music is spine-chilling, and the movie, as a whole, just feels magical! I cannot think of a single flaw that this movie has. This is a tearjerker film that every movie fan should experience at least once in their life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Maturity education.,"After I watched Beetlejuice I disliked the movie so much I did lose faith in Tim Burton a lot. Beetlejuice is clearly the work of some 6 years old person who had just power enough to direct a movie with a huge budget - nothing more. But if this movie wasn't one of the Johnny Depp movies I honestly wouldn't watch it as he is my favourite actor of all time. To be honest I don't think I would like this movie that much without Johnny Depp but I cannot deny anything else is so in perfect harmony with each other so this movie really deserves 10/10 so we gotta thank Caroline Thompson for such an epic movie.Without spoiling you in detail this is the story of a person who is different. The moral of the lesson is you can use your difference to make a good difference in the world and you can have a good life no matter what by using your difference. This movie is very realistic about how people are and how society works therefore in that regard this movie is a good documentary about humanity and it felt like you watching a documentary of animals in a humorous way. Unlike Beetlejuice this movie doesn't make fun of people living a tragedy but instead it can be humorous in a mature way so it's not childish like Beetlejuice.The another moral lesson you learn is no matter who you are, you are nothing when you are being a toxic person therefore even Edward was liked by people despite his difference just because personality-wise he is a good person while a normal person was hated even though he is a normal person just because he was toxic no matter he tried to be a hero. That point of view alone is very wise because so many people try to be normal and hide their differences even though their differences are their strengths. Also so many people bark like a dog and are selfish to get what they want but society shut them up eventually which is what happened to the normal guy in this movie. So it's actually interesting to watch a movie that doesn't have a hero and evil. The difference between two opposite people in this movie is just a matter of behaving wrongly like a kid and being realistic by being mature. It's also interesting to watch a movie that doesn't focus on a sense of morality but it just focuses on what's being wise and caring about the win-win situation and what happens to immature people.So my favourite person in the movie is Jim. He is one of the rare characters who is a real mature and wise person therefore it felt like watching Donnie Darko's parents. I really needed to gain my sanity after dealing with kids for a long time these days so much I had to watch a mature person get my senses back therefore this movie was also like medicine for my mind.Only bad aspect of the movie is how Winona Ryder is a bad actress. It's actually insult to even call her an actress. Like Leonardo Dicaprio every character she plays as feels like the same person which for me is a sign of bad acting. An actor/actress should be the character, not making the character like their real self therefore Winona Ryder breaks immersion a lot but fortunately she is not in the movie much. On the other hand Johnny Depp, Brad Pitt and Evan Rachel Wood knows how to act.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Praise for one of Tim Burton's best.,"Director Tim Burton uses his trademark Gothic perspective to bring to life this film. And the result is excellent. Sometimes I don't know which is more terrifying; the dark, unsettling world of Edward or the pink and blue, bland world of conformity he is thrust into. The movie itself is driven by Johnny Depp's powerful presence. You can't help but feel strongly for his title character, wishing that he could move past the impossible: trying to achieve acceptance from a world that he could not understand. Winona Ryder is Edward's love interest, and really this is her only great acting, aside from Girl, Interrupted. This movie will stay in your mind for a long time. 4 1/2 out of 5 stars, not to mention arguably Depp's and Ryder's best performances.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Beautifully Told,"When I first saw it as a kid, I didn't really understand it much except that there was a man with scissorhands who got adopted and kissed a pretty girl. Watching it as an adult, I realized that there are actually deeper meanings in this film.The story is told very simply, and it opens with an old lady telling a bedtime story to her granddaughter. The story is about a man named Edward with scissorhands. Edward was an unfinished product of an aging inventor. Years later a nosy but kind-hearted neighbor finds out about him and adopts him into their home.It's a simple tale with a lot of deep meanings. It's a tale that shows us one of the worst sides of human nature. Despite some evil in this world, the story also shows us that there are always people with genuine and good hearts. Edward is also a relatable character, misunderstood and alone. It's a beautiful story, really.Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

The houses are all the same, and the interiors are very lightly decorated.This movie is pretty good overall.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Beautifully sad...,"I just saw this movie for this first time since I viewed it in in the theater back when it came out in 1990.  I was 17 then and maybe really didn't appreciate it as much since there were no big explosions.  This time around I saw it for what a truly beautiful and sad movie it is.  Edward is menacing to look at at first, but Depp brings true childlike innocence to the character with his face.  Watching the town turn on him is like watching a child being tormented.  The relationship between him and Kim is touching to watch as it changes, as is how the end shows us how the town changed Edward.I gave this movie 8/10.  I probably would have given it 9/10 if it were not for the ""Battle Royal"" at the end.  It seemed kinda shoe-horned in if you ask me. Didn't really seem to fit the theme of the rest of the movie.  (I'm not talking about the prologue, that was cool).Lastly, a lot of folks have commented on how all the houses are solid colors. Actually during the fifties many homes came close to that.  The idea was that it made it easier to paint.  Obviously Burton took it to another level, but just FYI.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

A bittersweet parable about conformity(possible spoiler?),"I love most of Tim Burton's movies, but I would have to say that ""Edward Scissorhands"" is my favorite. The art direction and set design are all wildly imaginative and a treat to behold. The hauntingly emotional score by Danny Elfman is also his best IMO.And at the center is the fantastic, indispensable Johnny Depp in the title role. Edward is a character for whom very little can be expressed verbally;Depp uses body language and(above all) his eyes to depict emotion, and it works perfectly.Though there are moments of humor(ie Edward and the water bed)this movie is ultimately a sad elegy for all of those that are ostracized by the ""normal people"". The highest emotional moment(for me) is when Kim(Winona Ryder) and Edward part;she's finally awakened to genuine emotion,but it is just too late.""Edward Scissorhands"" is without a doubt my favorite Burton movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Frankenstein's monster in 20th Century suburbia,"What if Frankenstein's monster had met the Avon lady instead of an angry mob with torches and pitchforks? Would things really have turned out differently? That's the premise for this charming fable. Edward is the ultimate man-child. Unlike so many other man-children, he doesn't bear a special message of hope for mankind. He doesn't possess supernatural powers. He's simply confused, awkward, and open-hearted. He's brilliant at some things, but when he makes mistakes or doesn't conform, disapproval falls on him hard. Ryder points out in the extras that her character's reaction to Ed is the only honest one. Everyone else projects their expectations onto him because he's a blank slate. He's sexy. He's a genius. He's a devil. He's a scissor-wielding maniac. His love is as open and honest as a puppy dog's, and when he's at his lowest, the neighbor's dog is the only one who approaches him. When he's a persecuted and hounded criminal, it's a black cop (the only black person in town, it seems) who cuts him a break. The movie suggests that behind the veneer of suburban civility, we're not as far removed from torch-wielding Transylvanian peasants as we'd like to think.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!,"It was a great movie.I seen a lot of movies and that has to be top five.What makes a good movie is the actors/actresses facial expressions on the set, and that is what makes the movie seem real and gives off feelings and johnny depp did that, which made the movie even better.I love the movie because its not every day you see a movie of a lonely man with sissorhands. its unique and thats another reason its better than other movies.a lot of movies are the same but this one is different. the set was awesome and the cast was awesome everything about it was great.the actors/actresses were awesome because of their talent. they made this a great movie and i cant get enough of it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
A portrait of an offbeat humanity,"Edward Scissorhands to me represented the inhumanity of the mass, the complacency of people when faced with the troubles of society, of the individual. In the beginning, everyone loved Edward, everyone profited from him. However, at the first sign of trouble the walls began to collapse. The crowd who joined to embrace Scissorhands turned against him as his flaws became apparent as the eerie and offbeat hedges he sculpted and that everyone seemed to enjoy.A scene I can recall but that seemed to make this point was the confrontation between Kim's (Winona Ryder) boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall) and Scissorhands/Depp. Jim, an embodiment of the cruelty of youth, was shoving Edward, who slipped and sliced Ryder/Kim's hand. He then chased Scissorhands away, while the contented father character, within earshot, continued to set up his Christmas decorations on the roof, confused about why the protagonist fled. That illustrated to me the father's inability to grasp what was beyond the obvious, and his neglect of his would-be stepson, the decorations a facade of an easy-going everyday.Another point I liked was the end, after the mob had decided Edwards fate. What struck me was the fat woman, who casually said after the dramatic scene she wanted to go home, the first of the mob to disperse. It seemed cold, like a dog-eat-dog sort of scenario, and was a slice into the veil of civility people use to make for smooth but one-dimensional interaction. I think there's a difference between niceness and intention, and sincerity. Everyone's relation to the main character was this superficial show, and the almost mute Scissorhands was sort of left a mystery to the viewers, except when revealed by the only true friend he had, Kim.The film overall related, to me, to the illusory layers of optimism that shield people from all the shortcomings of the world around-- and can be contrasted with the truer reality of mishap and conflict that usually lie beneath the surface, in an imperfect world. It seems to face the dilemma of whether to choose popcorn and bubblegum, or take things for what they are. Like in the movie, most seem to find it difficult to try this-- or to take the experience in stride-- and that's the inhumanity of it: the coldness, like ignoring a homeless person during winter-- and I found the film a very interesting depiction of this, even more so because of Burton's strange creativity.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
Beauty,"Tim Burton has a knack for, and perhaps a habit of(but as long as the movies are great, what's the harm?) making Gothic films, centered around a misunderstood outcast who is or will be distrusted by townspeople. He really understands the characters, and he helps us to understand them, too. This is an utterly beautiful film. I'm not sure it's possible to watch this and not be affected emotionally. The characters are exceptionally well-written, and portrayed. The acting is basically all good. Depp is astounding. As with The Penguin of Batman Returns, I wasn't really watching the actor, I was watching the character. The writing is great, throughout. The pacing is just about flawless. The humor is magnificent, and seldom harsh or unnecessary. Some things in this are perhaps at least a little above what children should watch. Some language, and suggestive dialog and actions. The unclear time period is well done... this could take place today, or decades ago. The use of color is expertly done. The film is amazing. I recommend this to anyone who can look beyond the surface. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

An overrated but charming and eventually very moving fairy tale set in modern-day suburbia,"There have been many film collaborations between filmmaker Tim Burton and actor Johnny Depp, but it all started with ""Edward Scissorhands"", a successful dark fantasy movie. I was a preschooler when this was released, and I remember hearing about the film and seeing a bit of it within the next few years after that. However, I never actually sat down to watch the 1990 blockbuster until 2006. At the time, I wasn't sure what I thought of the first hour or so, but found it very powerful later on! After a little over four years, I've seen the hit modern-day fairy tale again, from start to finish. I still certainly wasn't as impressed as so many other viewers definitely have been over the years, but still think it's a good first Burton/Depp collaboration.Edward is an artificial human being who lives in a mansion up the hill from a suburban neighbourhood. This mansion was the home of his inventor, who died just before he got to finish his invention, leaving Edward incomplete, with scissors for hands! One day, a local Avon representative named Peg Boggs is not having any luck with her sales, and decides to go to the mansion to try and make a sale, not knowing who lives there. Up on the hill, she finds nobody in sight until she reaches the top floor, where she meets Edward, and it seems he has never been off the mansion property! Peg takes him back home with her, and he stays with the Avon representative, her husband Bill, young son Kevin, and teenage daughter Kim at their house. The artificial being is admired by most of the neighbours, but Kim's boyfriend, a thug named Jim, does not think too highly of him, and he could lead Edward into a load of trouble!At the beginning of the film, we see a grandmother about to tell her granddaughter the story of Edward Scissorhands. This elderly woman is not played very well by a young actress in makeup, trying to speak in an elderly voice. After the story begins, the part where Peg Boggs discovers the mansion and searches for someone inside is a little tedious, but the mansion is a fascinating location, and the scene showing her meeting Edward for the first time can certainly grab viewers. Edward, played wonderfully by Johnny Depp, stands out as a likable character, but some of the other characters are not portrayed so well, especially Esmeralda, the Christian fanatic who thinks Edward is from hell. I honestly don't get this character! Is she meant to be funny?! If so, she's not. She's just weird, absurd, and annoying! Good thing she only has four scenes! There are also some fairly sappy moments in this film. However, most of the movie is well done. It's usually intriguing showing the protagonist's relationship with the people in the neighbourhood, and there are some other good performances, such as Winona Ryder as Kim, Vincent Price as Edward's inventor in flashback sequences, and Anthony Michael Hall as the despicable Jim. Later on, the film gets very dark, intense, and often heartbreaking, and I've never seen a character harder not to hate than the one Hall plays here! The tension and emotion at this point are unforgettable!This first Burton/Depp collaboration is probably thought by many to be their best. It does seem to be more popular than most of the others, but I have to disagree. Unlike some people, I've found some severe flaws here, but overall, I still think it's a very good film which deserved its success, even if it's not as great as its reputation suggests. I would say the film is most effective after the first hour or so, which was what I thought the first time as well, but I think the movie as a whole was better for me the second time. It's probably a good thing I didn't see much of ""Edward Scissorhands"" as a kid. What I saw at the time didn't hurt, with Edward accidentally puncturing a waterbed and struggling to try and eat with his scissor hands, but it might have gotten to be a bit too much for me near the end, especially with the Jim character. Well, it was rated PG-13. I certainly wouldn't recommend this for kids, except maybe older ones, but for many adolescents and adults, I'm sure it's a worthwhile fantasy drama, with a bit of humour.",8.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"

A masterpiece,"Edward Scissorhands is one of my all-time favorite movies, and is something I could watch over and over again.Here, Johnny Depp gives his best performance. It's amazing how he went from a bad boy role in Cry Baby with a sad, vulnerable character in Edward Scissorhands.This is also Burton's best work. If this is the first film you watch by Tim Burton, you will think he is a fantastic director. Danny Elfman's score also helped the film because it's happy at the right times, and it's sad and mellow at the right times.Overall, the story was very heartfelt and emotional, the score was amazing, the acting was superb, and the suburban setting gave the film a fairy tale feel to it.

The title character is more sympathetic than ""Frankenstein"".  The ""creator"" scenes are more mesmerizing than the cuckoo clock scene in ""Pinnochio"".  I could go on...I really think Tim Burton deserves a lifetime achievement award for the invention of the character.  Notice the scars on his face look like permanent tears?Dianne Wiest is my favorite ""mom"" from 80's movies.  Winona Rider is in a limited role, but she does a great job, and looks very princess-like with blonde hair.  Alan Arkin plays a perfect dry-humored ""dad"".Of course the problem here is a plot that is basically on a TV-movie level. It's a basic exploitation story where everyone in town makes Edward a hero, then tear him down.  Such a great character deserves much more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Fantasy, Romance"
