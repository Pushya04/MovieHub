Almost Too Heart-Wrenching To Watch,"Man, this is a powerful and great movie. We are all moved different degrees by different things, but to witness sincerely nice people being treated cruelly always bothers me big- time....so this film is tough to watch in spots. Some scenes are just painful and depressing to view.Whatever your sensitivity, the movie is very involving and hauntingly shown with eerie black-and-white photography. Eerie, and downright beautiful camera-work in here, so kudos to cinematographer Freddie Francis, one of the best in the business.A young Anthony Hopkins is very likable and John Hurt is, well, someone you won't soon forget as John Merrick, ""The Elephant Man.""This is an uplifting movie at times, too, not just a tear-jerker or horrific in showing man's cruelty to man. Be prepared for an emotional experience and an amazing story.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A heartbreaking expose of society,"Nobody but Lynch could have directed this movie and made it the masterpiece that it is. Where other people would have gone for fake sentimentality and/or gruesome imagery; Lynch just presents the story how it is. The film is never gratuitous, and that is much to it's credit. It is, however, utterly repulsive. The black and white cinematography enforces this. There is nothing pleasant about The Elephant Man; it is as ugly as it's title character, and that is the way that this story needs to be. On the surface, it is ugly and repulsive; but just like it's title character; the movie has a hidden depth that is ultimately touching and heartbreaking. The movie sets itself up for this early on; the scene in which the Elephant Man is introduced is most of the most gut wrenching ever committed to film. As the doctor (Anthony Hopkins) sees the freak rise up and realises the extent of his deformity...a tear slowly form and rolls down his cheek. From this, you can see the pity that he feels for this man who has drawn the lot of a lowly circus freak; just from that one shot of a tear, David Lynch shows us the sorrow and the pity, and that's all he needs. Where some directors would have piled the sentimentality on, David Lynch is economic; that's all it needs, so that's all it gets. And that is the mark of a great director. Something that David Lynch most certainly is.The film is also ironic. Aside from it's visuals that link to the title character, it also observes how society is not unlike a circus. The good doctor has taken the Elephant Man away from the glares and the scowls of the circus audience, the exploitation that he's had to face, and put him a kinder and more loving environment; only now the scowls and stares come not from the circus audience, but from society's upper crust, who want to exploit the Elephant Man themselves for their own selfish reasons - to impress their friends. The Elephant Man is not merely a horror story of the life of a very unfortunate man; it's a story of love, a story of acceptance. Despite being taken from one circus to another, the Elephant Man is happier and more fulfilled than he ever was; he doesn't care about the looks and the exploitation, he merely wants to be loved. By 'normal' people, this is taken for granted; but The Elephant Man shows us that love and acceptance isn't something that can be taken for granted. As one doctor notes in the film, ""we can't imagine the life he's had"". We can't.David Lynch also succeeds in making voyeurs out of his audience. Just like the various audiences in the film; we too want to see the Elephant Man, and yet are utterly repulsed and disgusted by him. With this, David Lynch makes a mockery out of today's society, without ever making a mockery out of the character upon which this film is based. The Elephant Man himself is a perfectly balanced example of how pathos can be achieved. Not only is this man seen as a monster, but his character is pathetic also. With The Elephant Man, Lynch is saying to the world that it is society that is the monster, not the freaks that live within it.To put it simply: David Lynch has taken a story that could have easily been told simply and expanded it to take in themes that are outside of the central premise. This small story of one unfortunate man has been moulded into a striking comment on society. And all in all; it's a masterpiece.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Beautifully Sad Film,"In memory of Joseph Carey Merrick (5 August 1862 â€“ 11 April 1890).The movie is Joseph Merrick's story who became known as The Elephant Man. This is one of the saddest movies I have ever seen and yet it is so good. My heart goes out to Merrick - he had to endure so much in his life.The Elephant Man is filmed in black and white - which is perfect for the film. The black and white gives the viewer a feeling of being a much older film than it actually is. It also has a feeling of being a classic horror movie - which works perfectly for the story because Joseph Merrick's condition is horrifying yet his story is so beautiful, touching and sad.A great film.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
a perfect film,"If one was to turn on David Lynch's The Elephant Man midway through, without knowing what it was, one might be startled at the appearance of the main character. One might even be tempted to make fun of the character. But if one was to watch the film from the beginning, one's sympathy with John Merrick (John Hurt), 'The Elephant Man,' would be strong enough to deny that the former situation was ever a possibility. Lynch does not allow his audience to glimpse Merrick sans mask until his appearance has been built up substantially. When we the audience are at our zenith of anticipation, we see him-no dramatic music, no slow motion; a simple cut and he's there. There he is. And it's no big deal.This is the beauty of Lynch's direction. We are led through our morbid curiosity at the same rate the characters in the film are. We develop alongside them. More specifically, we develop alongside Frederick Treeves, played with an astounding sublimity of emotion by Anthony Hopkins. Next to Treeves we pity Merrick, respect him, pity him again, and then ask ourselves with him, 'is he just a spectacle to me? Am I a bad person?'Lynch certainly doesn't let us bypass this question easily. Are we bad people for being intrigued or are we good people for pitying? Certainly there is a mix of intrigue and pity with every character who first meets John, and we are not excluded. However, as with almost every character who truly comes to know John and confer with him, we learn to respect him as a human being and not as a spectacle. Nonetheless, this issue never finds close in the film, nor do I feel it ever can be closed in actual life. Hopkin's Treeves is never fully sated in how he feels about this dilemma, and so, neither can we be.Technically, The Elephant Man is a beautifully shot film. In crisp black and white, the film recalls the cinematic technique of American cinema circa the 1930's. The scenes dissolve into one another; there is no brisk editing. The lighting is kept low-key during dark scenes, balanced during daytime scenes-this is standard film-making of the era. The one digression from this form are the distinctly Lynchian surrealities-pseudo-dream-sequences of commendably original imagery that break up the film and serve as distinct mood-setters for the audience. These are, for the most part, fairly intimidating sidenotes. We as an audience are caught off-guard because in these tangents we are not identifying with Treeves, we are put instead into Merrick's shoes. It is unsettling.But Lynch has never been a director to flinch at unsettling prospects. We must watch Merrick beaten, abused, harassed, humiliated, and tormented. We may feel a surge of happiness when he finally stands up for himself, but by that point we still have to cope with what we've already, what he's already, experienced. I suppose that is the greatest and most devastating aspect of the film-empathy. Every moment is heartbreaking. Yet no matter how hard it gets, and how much better it then turns, there is always the threat of another jab. And those jabs only get more and more painful.The Elephant Man is a perfect film. It is sorrowful but it apologizes not at all for it. It is a film about where our empathy stems from, a film that asks you to feel sorry but rebukes you for your blind pity. It asks you to respect Merrick, not cry for him. But you can't help crying. The Elephant Man is a film that treks you through despair and asks for your hope in the end. It asks you to hate humanity but to love the humane. It asks you to look at a man who appears sad and know that inside, he's okay.",,Anonymous,Biography
Cuts Deep,"There have been many films made dealing with an individual who's outer appearance is completely at odds with their inner character. Some of these films are quite good but this is by far and away the very best. This is probably one of the most perfect films ever made. It succeeds on every level. Visually it transports one into a dark, grey, industrial nightmare of a world. It's within this world that we come to discover true beauty. It lies within one hideously deformed, abused and unfortunate soul who is being kicked around in this hellish existence. The screenplay, acting, direction all come together to create this extraordinary viewing experience. You really feel like you get inside this man and his tortured existence. The ending is one of the most effective and completely engrossing I've ever seen. Rarely does a film find a way to leave us with such a sense of closure and lingering fascination. The thing that really makes this film truly great is it changes the way people see themselves, other people and the world. I can still remember the palpable air of silence and awe over the audience when leaving the theater both times I saw it on the big screen. There's a transforming quality about it. You only need to read the many other user comments to see how people were moved and changed by this film. If you haven't seen it, it's a must!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Nothing Will Die.,"This movie changed my life forever. To see someone so beautiful, dignified, and unique, hidden behind a body and face that society considers ugly, made me realize how the body is a decaying pile of dust, but the soul is a breath-taking and uniquely formed indestructible diamond.I believe that everyone should get a chance to see this film, for those of an open mind, and a caring soul, there is nothing else like it.It also shows the detestable ways some people treat others. I felt at first pity for John Merrick, but then my feelings changed to admiration, as the film went on. John, in the film starts as a severely deformed mute figure being badly mistreated, as the story progresses, he becomes the hero. A bold and courageous man, standing against the  evils of modern society.Joseph (John) Merrick, was a man so one-of-a-kind, that someone else like him physically or emotionally will never appear again. His life should be taken as an example to everyone.As in the film, John's mother says ""Nothing will Die"", Joseph Merrick will live on in the hearts and souls of everyone who has witnessed the story of his life.My love goes to Joseph Merrick, where ever he may be.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
i'm speechless,"I just watched this movie last night and i must say... it touched me in a way no other movie has... some of the scenes even brought me to tears, which has never happened to me before.... John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins are simple incredible, and this movie is just filled with unforgettable scenes....but like some people have mentioned here before, it is an incredibly hard movie to watch, especially after you realize what a sweet, kind, smart and innocent man John Merrick was, it is often painful to watch the way he's treated by some people, and like Hopkins says after he sees him for the first time ""I pray to god that he's an idiot"", sadly, he is everything but that...10/10, no question",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Masterpiece, Truly Remarkable","David Lynch is a remarkable director and The Elephant Man is a remarkable film. Inspired by a true story in the streets of London during the Victorian Age, the film is based entirely around the life of John Merrick (John Hurt), an individual dubbed by his `owner' Bytes (Freddie Jones) and others as 'The Elephant Man' because of his hideous deformities. With this film, Lynch grasps his audience and stretches them to a new parallel of an emotionally capturing film. And what makes this so daunting and so intriguing is the fact that 'The Elephant Man' is a true story, no part of it is fictional. Anthony Hopkins plays Dr. Frederick Treves, the man who somewhat saves John from those who persecute him for being a freak, being a `monster.' A story of human triumph could never be so remarkable as that of The Elephant Man. Lynch takes The Elephant Man to a new level of technical aspiration with a dark, dank setting shot completely in black and white. This film is amazing and would undoubtedly be just okay any other way. The black and white adds to the story in a way that touches the audience much deeper and much more personal. Not to mention stunning performances and dialogue by all cast, `David Lynch's portrait of John 'The Elephant Man' Merrick stands as one of the best biographies on film.' Literary critic Leslie Fiedler maintains that freaks stir `both supernatural terror and natural sympathies' because they `challenge conventional boundaries between male and female, sexed and sexless, animal and human, large and small, self and other.' In this very interesting and moving film, we are challenged to clarify our values in regard to `very special people.' However, in one powerful scene of tension and curiosity, John Merrick screams out, `I am not an animal! I am a human being! I.am.a man!' This particular sequence, I believe, is incredible and it ties in with the whole focus of the film itself, human dignity and emotion. David Lynch is known for some pretty twisted films, and yet, The Elephant Man is not that twisted at all. Even though his audience views John Merrick as not the average person because of his medical condition, the story is cherished because of how it is put onto the big screen. Compared to his other films such as Blue Velvet and Eraserhead, The Elephant Man is more surreal in terms of what Lynch was going for. Lynch does a magnificent job in portraying his version of The Elephant Man, and many people along with critics alike agree. I can easily rate The Elephant Man with four stars because David Lynch deserves no less. The Elephant Man is a classic, a striking and devastating film depicting the account of John Merrick's search for a dignified and normal life. I would definitely recommend this film to those in search of a wonderful story about one man's conquest to a regular life. Dr. Treves' account with John not only presents him with respect and normalcy, but also takes him as far as an uplifting scene where upon John states `my life is full because I know I am loved.' With such an inspirational and true story, David Lynch puts on a film that should be loved by many, if not all.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ones of the most heart rending films of all time.,"It is truly baffling to me that there are people who have seen this film  who still think that David Lynch is a cold and cruel film-maker. David Lynch is ,in fact, a man of extraordinary gentleness and sensitivity, who cares deeply about the sort of people whom mainstream society stigmatizes as 'freaks'.Please, watch this film--watch it carefully-- and you will see that Lynch's deepest concern is with how a over-industrialized, rigid, and profoundly hypocritical society crushes its outsiders. It may sound odd, but I really believe that the non-Christian Lynch has, in the person of John Merrick portrayed one of the most profoundly moving ""Christ figures' in all of film.  Let me also note how well Lynch( In only his second effort at directing!) handled such legends as Hiller, Gielgud and Hopkins.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
amazing....but not for the weak at heart,"this is a brilliantly done film.  it is quite raw and blunt about its subject matter, however, so it should not be viewed for ""entertainment"" purposes, thought he story is inherently intriguing.  we must just sit and watch in curiousity and amazement, but in concurrence with extreme sorrow, as we are shown the brutality that john merrick must face as his reality.  a smile from another human being, or even a pleasant greeting (which is something that we all take for granted), is treated by this man as the highest form of complimentary behavior possible.one of the best films that i have ever seen.  it wouldnt be called a top 25 of all-time film by the public (though i may place it there), however, based solely on the fact that it, as i mentioned earlier, is lacking in terms of typical ""entertainment"" value.  even though you will certainly be immersed the entire way through. ah, who knows! im not expressing myself very well. make it a priority to see this film. enjoyabsolutely amazing and memorable - 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Touching,"Great performances by Hopkins, Gielgud and Hurt. Also look out for small roles from some famous British faces, including a young Pauline Quirke!Beautifully shot and a heart rendering tale that thankfully doesn't get too soppy or sentimental. A lot can be taken from the film about the way we treat people in general, not just the Elephant Man.I wonder if anyone else saw a clear link between Merrick making a model of a cathedral and the story of Quasimodo in Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame? Was this intentional by Lynch or just a happy coincidence. Worth thinking about!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A master work.,"There's always the inclination to say, ""My God, how could anyone go wrong with a cast like that?"" but of course the list of such disasters is long. This is one of those (few) movies about which, in my opinion, there's just nothing bad to say. The story is true, and John Hurt's incredible make-up corresponds very well to photographs of the real-life ""elephant man."" Hurt's interplay with Anthony Hopkins carries the film along on the evolution of their relationship from detached scientific fascination to enduring friendship. Ann Bancroft's performance is as masterful as one would hope and expect. The interviews included on the DVD were worth watching too, and will add to appreciation of the next viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great Film-making, Problematic Treatment of John Merrick","Moralising narratives are at the heart of many ""outsider"" biopics as a means of exposing the flawed logic of a ""civilized"" yet inherently inhumane society. This approach is exemplified to the extreme in David Lynch's The Elephant Man. The famous biography of John Merrick is presented as a horror film in which the viewer is repeatedly subjected to scenes of violence against a helpless and cripplingly deformed man. Historical documentation reveals that Merrick indeed suffered a great many injustices but testament to his survival is his industriousness and independence, qualities not explored in the film. The intelligent and gentle nature of Merrick is emphasized not to explicate his strength of character but rather to expose the stupidity and brutality of his tormentors. Fictionalized abuses such as a kidnapping, a violent manager, and a psychopathic night-guard supplement an already grotesque vision of 19th century England as an era of absolute inhumanity. The industrial nightmare which is the basis of Lynch's earlier experimental film Eraserhead is recycled and juxtaposed with the world of etiquette and bourgeois finery of the self-righteous Victorian upper classes. The system of capitalism is exposed for its inability to acknowledge the worth of human life outside of productive capacity. Those without labour power are dehumanized and stripped of all dignity in order to survive, fuelling the prevalence of prostitution, child exploitation, and freak shows. The treatment of John Merrick in The Elephant Man is yet another exploitation of sorts as it reduces an extraordinary life to a moral tale. When Dr. Treves says, ""Mr.Bytes, I'm sorry but all you do is profit from another man's misery"", one has to wonder at the hypocrisy of a film which replicates the spectacle of the freak show and exaggerates victimization in order to drive home an unsubtle misanthropic narrative.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
David Lynch's most accessible work. A truly remarkable film!,"I first watched 'The Elephant Man' over twenty years ago, not long after it was released. It was the first David Lynch movie I ever saw, thought at the time I'd never even heard about 'Eraserhead' and knew nothing about the guy. I was incredibly impressed by the film, as I have been every time I watch it. Eventually I became a big Lynch fan, and could see the similarities between 'Eraserhead' and 'The Elephant Man', both visually and in their use of sound. Apart from that, they are very different movies. 'Eraserhead' still freaks most people out, but 'The Elephant Man' is arguably his most accessible film. It has heart and an emotional impact, something rare in Lynch's movies ('The Straight Story' is another exception). Anthony Hopkins is an actor I've frankly had it up to HERE with, especially after his increasingly hammy Dr. Hannibal Lecter, but boy, is he wonderful here! Probably his finest performance to date. Of course John Hurt is superb too, especially taking into consideration him having to work under pounds of make up. It's hard to fault anybody in the supporting cast, especially John Gielgud and Hannah Gordon, who plays Hopkins wife. Freddie Jones, who Lynch has worked with a few times since, is really evil as Bytes, and the late Michael Elphick ('The Element Of Crime', 'Withnail and I') plays another memorable baddie as the hospital's night porter. 'The Elephant Man' is a remarkable achievement. Lynch doesn't seem to have compromised his unique vision one bit and yet manages to make a genuinely moving drama about one of the screen's most unlikely heroes. I don't throw the term ""masterpiece"" around lightly but it's difficult not to use that word when describing this truly extraordinary film! Simply one of the best movies I've ever seen.",,Anonymous,Biography
"An elephant never forgets, and ""The Elephant Man"" is unforgettable.","Anthony Hopkins is so associated with Hannibal Lecter, that we almost forget that he did star in movies before that. ""The Elephant Man"", for example. It's sort of hard to determine whether the main character is disfigured John Merrick (John Hurt) or Dr. Frederick Treves (Hopkins). Either way, it's the movie's plot that's important. The plot of course shows how Merrick has been treated as a monster all his life and Treves tries to cure him. As for the possibility that the movie may have revered its subject too much...well, would you feel comfortable mocking him? A particularly interesting combo is the people behind the movie: director David Lynch and executive producer Mel Brooks (Brooks' wife Anne Bancroft appears as an actress). The former is synonymous with deliberately weird cinema, while the latter is synonymous with silliness. Both men show a different side here. All in all, this is definitely a movie that everyone should see.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The most moving masterpiece of all time!,"You have got to love the Elephant Man. There isn't one scene that doesn't move me. It is also underrated, as it is very difficult to find, and is hardly on TV. The cinematography was beautiful, and the subject matter about a doctor treating a heavily-disfigured man is so sensitively handled I felt I was there. One of the most moving scenes, was right at the beginning when Treves sees Merrick for the first time, and a tear rolls down his cheek.Extraordinary! The scene with Treve's wife is so sad that I had tears in my eyes for the rest of the movie. When he cries, ""I am not an animal, I am a human being,"" I was actually sobbing. i really was. The ending, with the lovely Adagio for Strings(the only time it has been played well) was so poignant, as was the scene in the theatre, with the Tchaikovsky-like music, and Merrick enjoying himself like a 6 year old boy. The music is very haunting, as made apparent in the crowd scene mocking Merrick in the hospital. Don't criticise the beginning, or the end, because David Lynch was trying to create images of pure sadness and inner beauty, and they were very powerful images. As for the performances, never have I seen Anthony Hopkins more sensitive than he was here(well except for the final scene of Shadowlands). His performance was actually one of the main reasons why this movie is so beautiful. The best performance, without a doubt, is the heart-rending performance of John Hurt as John Merrick. Almost unrecognisable, but so magnificent, especially when he recited the psalm without the help of Treves. It is also incredibly difficult to speak with a lopsided mouth, and John Hurt mastered it. Other notable performances are from Freddie Jones, Anne Bancroft, Michael Elphick and Sir John Gielgud. Anyone who gave this a 1/10, what is wrong with you? This is an absolute masterpiece, without question! 10/10. Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Superb haunting story about human nature.,"With a crowd bearing down on him, the tortured cry of The Elephant Man (John Hurt) rings out: ""I am not an elephant! I am not an animal! I am a human being!""Set in Victorian England, it looks into the Freak Show trade that was popular then, through one particular gentleman, grossly and uniquely deformed, by the name of John Merrick (The Elephant Man), and is based on the memoirs of the doctor played by Anthony Hopkins, Dr Frederick Treves. It shows the humanity of poor Mr Merrick and condemns the society that exploited him for its own monetary gain and sick pleasure.The story itself is a difficult one, and i'm surprised that any producer, even someone as offbeat as Mel Brooks, would have agreed to pour money into this idea. It has none of the classic elements of the commercial formula for making a movie that will make money: it has no love story, it has no sex, and, without spoiling too much, it is quite a tragic, unhappy story.The pervasive tragedy of the story is that John Merrick is an intelligent man, trapped inside this hideously misshapen body. Hanging over the head of the story is also the fact that nothing can be done for Mr Merrick. And the metaphor running throughout is that Merrick is no elephant man at all, he's just as human as the rest of us, but this exhibitionist, heartless society whipped him and made him dance around for them like an elephant in a circus tent.""Luck, my friend,"" A circus dwarf says to the elephant man at one point in the story, ""and who needs it but we.""It is a story of immense sensitivity and humanity, and one the likes of which you won't see anywhere else. Its definitely not for the weak-hearted or depressed. Its often devastatingly difficult to watch (mainly in one or two scenes), most of this story is wildly compelling and human drama due to the immense talents of Lynch and Hopkins in particular. There are certainly moments of reprieve - all is not black.Its certainly a beautiful movie - every frame is perfection. Gorgeous black and white cinematography give this subject the class it deserves. A wonderful score by John Morris helps give it a haunting beauty. It is directed with superb classical storytelling, illustrated by Lynchian brushstrokes: expressionistic dream sequences and trademark Lynchian soundtrack. David Lynch should be very proud of this early effort. It is a marvellous film. The sensitivity of the construction, and its classic perfection, are the work of a master.But it is hard to say what this movie would be without Anthony Hopkins. It is a topic that easily could have fallen into the trap of the society it depicts, of exploiting freaks for the petty thrill of exhibitionism. But whatever credit for this that does not go to Lynch, must go to Hopkins. His sincere delivery, in one of the most genuine performances i've ever seen, are a major factor in our believing this story really happened (which it did), and taking it seriously (which we do).5 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Essential.,"There is no feeling, no virtue, no human baseness ""The Elephant Man"" doesn't scrutinize: hypocrisy, cruelty, mercy, sadism, love...). David Lynch reached the status of genius with his second movie, he created an instant classic for the history of cinema, a masterpiece. He probed his huge talent beyond the oniric or surrealistic fits of ""Eraserhead"" (and of most of his filmography). He probed he's capable of doing anything he wanted to with a camera on his hands. For those who think Lynch is just a pretentious guy which only films nonsenses, please take a look at this movie.As for John Hurt, he didn't need to become the elephant man to demonstrate he's one of the best actors of his generation; nevertheless, he accepted the challenge... and he won. He made an outrageous display of physical and mental effort, and of body talk. I can't imagine how hard it was for him to carry that disguise all along the whole filming.

I recommend watching it alone, for two reasons: 1) it is very painful and sad to watch and 2) the value is lost if you are trying ""not to cry"" or have something else on your mind (like talking to your friend).The performances are very well done, by Hurt, Hopkins, and everyone else in the cast.

Troubling and moving,"""The Elephant Man"" has its faults(historical inaccuracies, at times overly sentimental), but it is one of those films where the good things manage to outweigh the bad . The excellent acting(esp. by John Hurt in the title role), inventive cinematography and an emotionally involving story would be the good things. Indeed, there were moments during the film when I was nearly moved to tears; the vision it presents is of a gentle, intelligent man who is ostracized and abused because of his appearance, and his struggle for dignity had me mesmerized.

If Your Life Sucks Watch This Movie,"'I am not an animal! I am a human being! I Â…am Â…a man!'John Merrick (as portrayed in The Elephant Man)'If Your Life Sucks, Watch this Movie' 'The Elephant Man,' directed by David Lynch and written by Sir Frederick Treves and Ashley Montagu, is a macabre story about Dr. Frederick 'Freddie' Treves (Anthony Hopkins) who shows compassion for a man with Proteous Syndrome John Merrick (John Hurt). The story is based on the true account of John Merrick's life as a side show freak in the nineteenth century. The viewer is taken on a journey of a man trying to regain some self-respect and the doctor who is helping him to do so.If you are like me and in a bad space in your life, watch this movie. Although a depressing film there are brief moments of hope with the interaction of Merrick and Treves. But, mostly it is scene after scene of abuse, torture and the dark side of human nature. This is not a movie that a viewer is going to want to watch time and time again. Watching this movie is like being drug through a crime scene, most don't want to look but most can't help themselves. After viewing the film, I felt a lot better about my life, and right now I am unemployed, fat and alone.That being said, the movie taken as a work of art was excellent. The black and white cinematography really added to the Victorian feel of the nineteenth century. The character development was superb and the acting of Hopkins and Hurt phenomenal. The makeup and costuming was dark as the film itself and the direction by Lynch, using his signature 'dream' scenes only added to the dimness of the entire film. I highly recommend this film once because it is beautifully directed and a great story. But, unless you are a masochist, once is enough.",,Anonymous,Biography
In a word - excellent but also extremely sad...,"Hi all,I saw this movie for the 1st time on 5th December 1999. I was about to go to sleep as it was about 00-40 in the morning and I flicked over to the movie and even though I was falling asleep as I flicked over to it, within  five minutes I was wide awake and totally captivated.Everyone knows the tale of John Merrick, it is so sad and painful to watch and see a man with above average intelligence trapped by his physical deformity and to be physically and mentally abused and tortured for a few meagre pence.I thought Sir John Gieulgud(?) and Sir Anthony Hopkins were both excellent in their respective roles. John Hurt did Merrick proud.I had a bit more than water in my eye on 4 occasions during this movie and not ashamed to admit it either. This is the 1st movie to make me cry.On the Kleenex scale - Titanic is 1 and this is 10!A movie not to be missed but be prepared to be disgusted and upset by the story told.ThePM",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""The stream flows, the wind blows, the cloud fleets, the heart beats...  Nothing will die""","Never could one hope to find a film as ugly and beautiful as David Lynch's film biography of John Merrick (The Elephant Man).  Merrick's story is perhaps one of the most heartbreaking and appalling cases of human injustice to those different, with a strong message, which still holds importance to this day.  In the hands of a lesser talented director this film may have been just another pointless Hollywood story, but in the hands of Lynch the film becomes a haunting, beautiful, but at the same time, highly disturbing work of art.  Always surrealistic in its storytelling approach, the film sets up Merrick's complicated birth with an abstract dream/flash back sequence, dimly lit and photographed in gloriously grainy black and white the audience can't help but be immediately drawn in to the story.The film then jumps forwards, and introduces us to the character of Fredrick Treves (Hopkins) at a London carnival, where Merrick is being shown as part of the sideshow.  Treves is unable to see Merrick due to the police, who close the show before he gets there, but hungry for a glimpse he arranges to for a private showing with Merrick's owner Bytes.  Lynch is reluctant to show us Merrick in full daylight for the first quarter of the film, which in my opinion was a clever move, because it allows we the audience to share Treve's intrigue as to weather or not the tag Elephant Man is suited, or whether we are being duped into seeing something not too much out of the ordinary.  It is only later that, after we see Merrick, we realise that he is truly deformed beyond human recognition.The next part of the film is where the real argument of The Elephant Man rests, the age-old argument of beauty only being skin deep and how those who have beauty on the outside often have none on the inside.  As Merrick goes to show the staff of the hospital of which he's taken residency that he is an articulate, erudite human being, he is slowly integrated into polite society, not from respect though, the crowds are only gathering because viewing Merrick has become something of a status symbol, and this is where Treve's must decide whether or not he has forced John to exchange one freak-show for another.For me The Elephant Man is one of the most staggering and moving films of recent cinema, the herald of a maverick talent in the then young David Lynch, and brimming with evocative production design, beautiful photography and a wealth of fine performances from Hopkins, Anne Bancroft, John Gielgud and Michael Elphick, not to mention Hurt's remarkable performance hidden under layers of prosthetic make-up.  It is true what others have said, that The Elephant Man is a very bleak, very downbeat film, a film not afraid to hold a mirror to society's injustices, but the ending is uplifting in a different way than most conventional happy endings.  In the respect that John has just has the happiest day of his life, and no day will ever be that good, so the perfect way to end that perfect day, is to sleep like he has always wanted to, even if it will result in his own death.  With the final line (used as my summary), we are told that nothing dies, that the spirit will always live on.  What a touching sentiment to the endurance of the human spirit.

Despite all the ugliness this is a film of absolute beauty.,"""The Elephant Man"" is overwhelming. Never before, not ever, have I been so emotionally moved by a figment of cinema, or piece of music, or any other work of man. To admit that is hard for me, but to neglect doing so would be to rob this film of what it is due. This is the most arousing cinematic accomplishment, perhaps, in the history of motion pictures.This is also the true story of a man, a freak, who was absolutely vulgar and disgusting to the eyes. Maybe he was the ugliest man in history, and was certainly treated as if that were true. He was unceasingly beaten, caged, mocked, and exploited. Women screamed at the sight of him and men were repulsed. However, despite living like an animal, despite being treated as one for most of his life, John Merrick possessed an unwavering kindness and civility that made his condition utterly heart-breaking.Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt are two of the finest modern actors. To watch them both at their best in ""The Elephant Man"" was the only way to do this film justice. Dr. Treves (Hopkins) was the character through which we felt our own moral questions arise. Did we look on John Merrick (Hurt) with a purpose of compassion, or was it to satiate some inherent desire to point and stare? Certainly at the outset I was merely curious to gawk at Merrick, and at first, looking upon him made me curl my nose at the sight. But as the story progressed I began to see his inner beauty. And it moved me almost inexplicably.There are many instances of cruelty towards Merrick throughout the film, but this is not what defines it. Despite all of the ugliness in ""The Elephant Man"" it is a thing of absolute beauty. There is a simple sweeping elegance, displayed in wondrous black and white, that unwraps itself in moments of terror, sadness, and joy. And when Merrick, even after an eternity of horror and injustice waged upon him, shows that his heart is bigger than all of it, it will set yours to flight.I see God in this picture, and I cannot comprehend any grander praise to give.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An unabashedly sentimental masterpiece from David Lynch,"THE ELEPHANT MAN is a powerful and moving story with incredible performances by John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins. Based on a true story, the movie is about John Merrick, a horrifically deformed man who Anthony Hopkins' character (Frederick Treeves) finds as a sideshow freak in a carnival. Initially, he only displays him in a similar manner to his colleagues (he's a doctor), but after finding out that the man is intelligent he begins to care for him. The movie isn't quite easy to sit through, as you see the mental and physical abuse that John is put through. But for all the moments like that, there are many more touching moments that will put a smile on your face and/or a tear in your eye. I'll be honest, I cried on more than one occasion, and this has to be one of the most emotionally powerful movies I've ever seen. Family-friendly, has a great message and highly recommended for anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A biopic that means well but misses its point by a lot,"The elephant man has always been a marvelous character to comprehend. From the day he was born, he was doomed to live a shortened life span and that's not the worst part. He had to live as a disfigured individual and there was nothing he could do to change it. He lived in a time where cures for diseases were very rare and if they were available, it cost a fortune. So it is fair that this film will be tragic because it is explaining the life of a tragic individual. But it's the way it's portrayed that is questionable.Anthony Hopkins, an actor whose performances I've enjoyed multiple times plays Frederick Treves, a Victorian surgeon who happens to run into the elephant man while visiting a carnival event. Playing the elephant man, or by his real name, John Merrick, is John Hurt. Hurt honestly gives an emotional performance as Merrick, especially in the beginning. Merrick is quite sensitive since he never experienced any real appreciation from anybody until Treves finds him. Even more astounding is how Hurt makes his voice so gentle as if he couldn't swat a fly. That's good characterization.But what squashes this exceptional acting is how the view of John Merrick wasn't ever changed. The only people that saw the potential in the character of John Merrick were Dr. Treves and his wife. All of Dr. Treves fellow doctors took him only as a lab rat. The public viewed him as a freak. And the people that Merrick was with originally, saw him as an outcast, because to them, he didn't deserve what the upper class had. If Merrick wasn't in his room, which was specifically made for him, he never had it easy. I'm not saying life was supposed to be easy for him, but the script could have been written so society was a little more flexible.I felt that this film might explore John Merrick's nightmares but I didn't think it would drag him so far down to the point of no end. I thought this project was written in recognition of the life he lived. Not to have audience sit through two hours worth of good acting and for what? To see a man, who has a troubled life get even more complicated than it was before? It at least should have had a satisfying ending but that didn't even happen. It felt more like it was a story of humiliation more than nobility. How's that recognition?The story of John Merrick or the elephant man is a sad one, but no one said the film had to be this depressing. The actors perform well but the tone needlessly blacks it out.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Touching"" doesn't begin to describe it.","This wonderful, heartrending drama stands tall as one of the finest hours for filmmaker David Lynch and actors Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt. Hopkins stars as Frederick Treves, an eminent surgeon in Victorian era London. While attending a carnival, he becomes aware of the existence of a sideshow attraction, John Merrick (John Hurt). Merricks' face is grotesquely distorted due to a congenital disease, and Treves's heart goes out to the poor man. He tries to give Merrick every comfort he can, and for the first time in Merricks' life, he's treated with respect and caring by people. Of course, there will still be those damnable individuals who merely seek to exploit Merrick for their own selfish reasons.Hopkins is absolutely great, but it's Hurt who commands your attention, and for good reason. He plays Mr. Merrick as a kind, gentle soul, who struggles mightily to maintain some dignity yet has a heartbreaking vulnerability about him. He also does an impressive job of conveying emotion beneath the amazing cranial makeup devised by Christopher Tucker. Hopkins and Hurt are supported by a peerless, mostly British cast, although Anne Bancrofts' role as stage star Mrs. Kendal is really no more than an extended cameo. John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller are particularly fine as the supportive Mr. Carr Gomm and the head nurse Mothershead. And on the other side of the coin, where we see ""humanity"" at its worst, we have solid performances by Freddie Jones as the possessive Mr. Bytes and Michael Elphick as the sleazy night porter.The film is well made in every respect, with Lynch and his crew creating a very rich and powerful period atmosphere. It's beautifully shot in black & white and Panavision by the great Freddie Francis, and receives a lovely music score by John Morris.Long but engrossing, ""The Elephant Man"" earns its emotional responses from the audience in an honest and memorable way.Unrelated to any previous telling of the real-life story or to the Broadway play.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very emotional and cuts deep - for me an unorthodox Lynch film (because it is so straight up narrative and emotional!),"I must say, I was rather surprised by the tone and narrative approach of this film... mainly because I have seen many more WICKED films by Lynch before (Twin peaks, the LA trilogy, ...). This one is super emotional on a few levels. We stay always close to the 'Elephant man' and are taken trough his journey among men and we experience his hardship from first hand.Visually it transports one into a dark, grey, industrial nightmare of a world, a victorian tough (and hell, I liked the circus bit at the beginning - this is how one imagines those old circuses, don't we?)The screenplay, acting, direction all come together to create this extraordinary viewing experience. You really feel like you get inside this man and his tortured existence. The actors did a very intense job.Rarely does a film find a way to leave us with such a sense of closure and lingering fascination. The thing that really makes this film truly great is it changes the way people see themselves, other people and the world. There's a transforming quality about it.To me, this proves once again and once more that Lynch is a chameleon, slipping in different film maker roles. He strangely stays close to the deeper levels of the soul - sometimes through wicked, mad riddle-tales (LA trilogy), sometimes through mixing soap-and-horror-genres (twin peaks), sometimes through heartfelt and emotional close-to-main-character-plays (this film). He is a very changeable filmmaker that thrives on many levels. He never stops to surprise me and this is maybe one of his greatest qualities: to go deep and surprise us all over again. Wonder and transformation are in his hands.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Victorian morality yarn with a thin story and thick make-up,"Choosing monochrome for his foray into the smog age and Jack-The-Ripper back-street London, director David Lynch does everything to place his freak-show action far in the past. However, he is exploiting the Elephant Man (Hurt as John Merrick) no less than his ""owner"" was in the fairground. He offers no explanation for the man's condition, not even from the eminent surgeon Treves (Hopkins) who got the unfortunately deformed man admitted to the London Hospital. Apparently, plastic surgery was far in the future when Treves practised medicine. Not even a dental surgeon was able to sort out Merrick's mouth for him, it seems. Once this is established, the medical dimension is removed from the story and it shrinks into a little morality tale that can barely support a 90-minute feature. There's no sub-plot, for example, to change the tempo, and the civility of Merrick's entry into society is laboured while we wait for the janitor to bring in his paying crowd, along with the wretched, drunken 'owner', and wreck Merrick's life once again. Anne Bancroft's walk-on appearance as an improbable West End actress speaking American and doing a reading of the love scene from Romeo & Juliet is poorly handled as the story clunks along in ""and then"", ""and then"" mode. The Elephant Man is a rather tiresome and poorly constructed bio-pic that fails to transcend the age in which it is set, and succeeds only in making a banal point about the gulf between appearance and inner nature, something that Charles Dickens would have handled in one paragraph.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"One of the greatest films, but so little appreciated","I first saw The Elephant Man at its pre-release showing in 1980, and it struck an immediate and resonant chord with me.  Few movies are like this, and it remains (many viewings later) one of my top 10 films of all time.The plot is presented well in other reviews here, so I will not repeat it or comment further.  Of the film itself I would only add that it is without doubt the most mature and satisfying of David Lynch's works - in many ways it is the final, polished jewel carved from the rough and ugly (but fascinating) diamond of Eraserhead, with the self-conscious artiness and juvenile qualities of the earlier film distilled into a potent and poignant statement on the human condition.Some critics have dismissed The Elephant Man as an exercise in emotional manipulation, however I believe this completely misses the point.  All films are manipulative to some degree, but it is a manipulation in which we as an audience engage by consent.  The Elephant Man will stand the final test and it will be appreciated fully by future audiences, in much the same way as Citizen Kane had to wait for some decades until audiences  were able to fully comprehend its greatness.",,Anonymous,Biography
A true story of courage and human dignity,"This must be one of the most beautiful, cleansing, surreal tear-jerkers ever made. The fact that The Elephant Man(1980) was directed by David Lynch and produced by Mel Brooks and his company makes it even more surreal and incredible. It may seem over-sentimental and manipulative for some viewers but it is a great movie about the unbearable, unfair human condition, about dignity and what it means to be a Human Being, a Man. David Lynch's only second feature treats its subject with compassion and restraint and features outstanding performances by John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins. B/W cinematography that brought to life the feeling of expressionistic movies from the 1920s is appropriately disturbing. And who can forget the make-up work by Christopher Tucker! It took John Hurt seven hours every day to apply it and two hours to take it off.John Merrick had lived with such deformity that forced him to sleep sitting up, with his legs drawn up and his head resting on his knees. His enlarged head was too heavy to allow him to sleep lying down and, as Merrick put it, he would risk ""waking with a broken neck"". Poor, pure John Merrick who died before his 28th birthday. He required great deal of care from the nursing staff. He suffered a lot but he always remained a loving, gentle, dignified person.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Quite an extraordinary movie...,"I remember watching this movie back when I was but a young boy back in the early 1980s, and I remember finding the movie absolutely terrible and I was scared rather witless of the appearance of the 'Elephant Man'. And oddly enough, I have only watched director David Lynch's 1980 movie ""The Elephant Man"" once since then. So as I had the opportunity to sit down and watch it again here in 2023, of course I did so.Writers Christopher De Vore, Eric Bergren and David Lynch did put together a rather enjoyable and memorable script for the movie, based upon the written works of Frederick Treves and Ashley Montagu. The material put together for the script certainly made for a very memorable movie experience.I always thought that ""The Elephant Man"" was a much older movie than 1980, given it was shot in black and white. But then again, I never really delved into this movie.The acting performances in the movie were quite good, and there is a great cast ensemble in the movie, with the likes of Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt in the leading roles of Dr. Frederick Treves and John Merrick respectively. They really carry the movie quite phenomenally. But the movie also have good performances from Anne Bancroft, John Gielgud and Freddie Jones. It was quite a nice surprise to see the likes of Dexter Fletcher, William Morgan Sheppard and Kenny Baker on the cast list as well.Visually then ""The Elephant Man"" was and still is quite outstanding. The prosthetic make-up is just astounding and really looks authentic. I actually looked up John Merrick and did some research, and what they did with the prosthetics in the movie was quite good. It definitely added a lot of flavor to the movie.""The Elephant Man"" is one of those types of movies that you have to watch, because it is a rather memorable and outstanding movie experience. It is somewhat of a classic, actually.My rating of ""The Elephant Man"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Keep The Tissues Handy!,"The Elephant Man is truly a moving story that is earnest and throughout the film, it makes the point that humans are not animals, no matter the dysfunctions or handicaps. In the case of John Merrick, he is revolting to look at because of an terrible accident, but he makes clear to all the people wanting to use him or gape at him, he is a human just like the rest of them. No matter who you are, it will be impossible not to cry at some point. That's how emotionally-affecting this film is.Directed by David Lynch, this is one of his more conventional films, but the subject matter is still very intense. This film is about a surgeon at a London hospital named Frederick Treves who discovers a ""freak"" named John Merrick and he rescues Merrick from a freakshow, thus allowing Merrick to live at the hospital and have a life of his own.The acting is excellent. John Hurt delivers a stirring performance as Merrick. I was not able to recognize underneath all that makeup, but he delivers a tour de force performance. Anthony Hopkins also does a really good job as the first man to have truly shown Merrick kindness.Overall, The Elephant Man is a film that believe that all people should be treated equally, no matter what he or she looks like. From a technical standpoint, this film is excellent. I liked how it was filmed in black and white because it captures the essence of the Victorian era. A really emotional film and while it's really sad, there are glimmers of hope here shown by Merrick. This is very fine filmmaking. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Beautiful and sad,"The Elephant Man is a beautiful film about several things: the two very distinct human characteristcs; compassion and cruelty, aswell as the curiousity that is John Merrick.It is a tale based on the life of the actual person Joseph Merrick with some dramatic changes to his life story. It may be a David Lynch film but the storytelling is very classic, similar to other stories of the genre like Beauty and the Beast or the Hunchback of Notre Dame.We follow the heavily deformed man John Merrick who everybody seems to treat as a monster or rather an animal until he is helped by the doctor Frederick Treves. Frederick sees the humanity in John and also discovers that behind all those tumors (and makeup) is an actually very sensitive and intelligent man.So what did I think? Despite it's lack of Lynchian mind trips it is still very well made with excellent photography and great acting from both leads. It is almost impossible to not like the compassionate doctor or the sensitive John Merrick.I'm sure the film contains many secrets but the ones that were easy enough for me to spot was the symbolic significance of the cathedral model that John builds which may be a reference to The Hunchback of Notre Dame or that John is simply Jesus as hinted at in the ending phrase ""nothing will die"" and there are quite a few similarities between those two stories as well.
A lesser obvoius symbol is that elephants are usually said to be wise and intelligent which John Merrick also is.You can still tell that David Lynch directed this movie without the help from imdb or the credits, there are a few weird mind fog trip things going on just to a fitting degree and in appropriate places. The film also keeps you at the edge of your seat to the very end because you are always waiting for terrible things to happen to John and you really don't want it to.in other words I recommend you watch it.//Johannes T",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Elephant Man,"On many web-sites this movie was a common factor in top classic movies. I was quite interested to see it. I also saw the IMDb review and the poster and that appealed me more. I was too eager to settle down on my chair to view this classic.This is a second half of 19th century (1860-87) true story of a Joseph Merrick (John Hurt) man with physical abnormalities thus the name Elephant Man. A surgeon Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) gives refuge to Joseph in his hospital and makes him part of the high circle society of England. But still Joseph faces humiliation from people due to his looks. In the end of the movie Joseph is given standing ovation by the then Queen Victoria and all eminent people.The movie though based on a true story is a distorted version. Joseph was affected at an age of five by elephantiasis Â– but the movie starts with a dramatic misrepresentation of a dream sequence (or I do not know real) of an elephant raping a young woman Â– through whom assumingly this boy is born. The movie's script is a big let down. It showcases typical irritating British-ness; exaggerate the miseries of the man and the goodness of rich British people. Most of the poor people are shown as villainous clowns who are insensitive, ignorant, uneducated, rascals; whereas the rich class is shown as overly sensitive and humane to ugly Joseph. Again I think a total mis-representation! This movie reminded me of a documentary I have seen recently Darwin's Nightmare. African poverty is shown and exploited by the Director to fetch a name in the ignorant and insensitive western audiences. Similarly here ugly looks of a person is exploited by the Director to fetch a name for himself in the ignorant and insensitive western; mostly British rich class.There are so many things that are badly scripted in the movie that I would not even venture to mention them here. Most IMDb reviews rate this movie very high. I am saddened by the fact that they because they have failed to relate with such characters in real life Â– they feel so moved in reel life.What about people who considers being humiliated throughout the life with people's insensitiveness Â– find this representation over the board.Acting wise I found everyone more dramatic, and overacted Â– including reliable Sir Anthony Hopkins. For no obvious reason at all (may be to hide the make-up of John Hurt) the movie is shown in Black and White. John Hurt due to a huge make-up and limping character, even though had some work to do; but with this character Â– any actor could have done an equally satisfying job.I think, Director David Lynch is not a competent director, but has achieved some mastery in showcasing miseries of people and earning a living. His list of movies proves that. He may have felt that he is sensitively portraying miseries, but actually he is exploiting miseries to make a name for himself in an insensitive British/ western society.Because of the fact that this is a true story I give 3 out of 10 for this otherwise Â– poor movie.(Stars 3 out of 10)",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Something I realized after I had watched the film.,"I believe that one of the greatest ideas in the movie, is that it starts by frightening you, it makes you fear John, in such way that you don't even want to see him. And then when the movie continues it is revealed that John is just a loving human being, who wants to be loved like everybody else, and you suddenly look at him and has a kind of sympathy for him.This is a VERY VERY VERY strong idea in my opinion BECAUSE the movie shows us that we are not better than anyone else. Even though we think that the people who've seen John as a horrible deformed monster were horrible, we were thinking the same way in the beginning of the movie. Because the movie introduced John to us that way. This teaches us that unfortunately we are not objective, we don't really check things out before we judge them. We base our opinions on what others tell us, and not on what's right.",,Anonymous,Biography
A baroque masterpiece,"""Elephant Man"" is the 6th movie from David Lynch and probably is most ""baroque"" work. Staged in Victorian England, directed in 1980 and shot in black and white. Elephant Man might very well be one of the most powerful movies in history so far... The film is based on the true story of John Merick, the Elephant Man. David Lynch adapted this story following a very basic/simple narrative construction, emerging the audience in part of the life of John Merick from the time when he gets noticed in a freak show by a British surgeon to the time...(well you'll find out by yourself). The interpretation of both Anthony Hopkins as the British surgeon, Dr. Frederick Treves and John Hurt as the Elephant Man, John Merick is ""mistakeless"". The ton is right from beginning to end. Not one dialog is overplayed or downplayed. Overall the actors deliver an amazing performance. Anne Bancroft (Mrs. Kendal) is acting so true, John Gielgud (Carr Gomm) is the archetype of the humanist gentleman and Freddie Jones (Bytes) is impersonating this pathetic drunk vile character to perfection. The picture itself is flawless and very well balanced: few close up, few traveling. Every camera technique serves only one purpose: telling the story. The black and white picture is the perfect fit and reinforces the 'baroque' like atmosphere as well as helps the audience focus on the feelings demonstrated by all actors. Feelings are really what make this 'quest for humanity' an exceptional cinematic experience. It is an 'initiatic journey'. We start with a descent in Horror, dehumanization and monstrosity; we climb back to decency and tolerance to eventually arrive at the door of 'humanism'. We need to remember that how we act is who we are. If we act like animals we are animals and if we act like human beings we in fact become human beings. In other words we are not human by essence but we become human through our actions. In this regards John Merick appears to be the human one among us...Once again and after 'Eraserhead' (1977), David Lynch is demonstrating his skills in terms of 'mise-en-scene'. He is comfortable handling weirdness and monstrosity and he does so with maestro, triggering our deepest fear, our darkest side and eventually the more human part of our body: our heart",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A script and a story just waiting to be made into a Disney movie but put in the form of a dark twisted movie that still shows such happiness. Great acting from Anthony Hopkins, which is as to be expected but the performance from John Hurt, an actor who's filmography before 1979 is somewhat lackluster, is outstanding. He becomes John Merrick physically and emotionally and his performance is better than any I have ever viewed in a film.

One of the greatest,"This was a truly great and touching movie.  It's hard to give a review because it really has to be seen to be believed.  Hopkins and Hurt are terrific.  This has to be one of the best by David Lynch and that's saying a lot considering the obsessed Lynch fan I am.  One of my friends have begged me to see it at a party but he and I were outvoted by Shining fans.  Anyway this movie will make you cry.  John Merrick may look like a monster but he is a caring, kind, intelligent, respectful, and above all great man.  It's the people that discriminate against him, ridicule him, and use him that are the monsters.  Several scenes in the movie can be rather disturbing (one is hard not to turn away from) but that's what makes this movie so powerful.  I don't see how anyone can put down this film and say it is not great.  Even if you hate David Lynch's other movies you'll probably still like this one. If it didn't win any of the eight academy awards it was nominated for it would have been an injustice.  You have to see it to believe it.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Elephant Man,"Saw this, recently up-converted to 4K at the London Film Festival and, apart from the clear improvements to the quality and detail of the image, I was reminded of just how good it is. Anthony Hopkins and Anne Bancroft play their roles with engaging sincerity - very ably supported by Sir John Gielgud and Dame Wendy Hiller. Prosthetics aside, John Hurt captures both the despair and optimism of Merrick with empathetic style; and Freddie Jones is just downright evil as ""Bytes"". His son Toby was at the screening and I couldn't help but wonder when he watched this portrayal by his father whether the pride in the performance must have been tempered by a disgust in the character, itself!!

Lynch's only goal is human,"Lynch's only goal is human beings, he deals with the inner and bottom layers of human personality and sometimes shows a monster from these layers, a monster that can be inside every human! We are facing a monster, and in the lower layers of this monster's personality, there is a real human being, a firm faith and maybe a saint! Perhaps we can call The Elephant Man the most unconventional film of David Lynch. Unlike other works of Lynch's cinema, The Elephant Man has a linear story, and the illusions and ambiguities of other works of this director are less seen in this film. But the common point of this film with other works of Lynch is the masterful characterization of the characters in the film. And another important point of this film is the brilliant black and white cinematography of Freddie Francis, who is known as the master of the Gothic style in filmmaking. From London in the 19th century. But maybe, in my opinion, the reason for the black-and-white film Man of Film Nama is perhaps another point, and this goes back to the same characters that exist in the film, good and bad characters! Because the characters that exist in the film They are either black or white in terms of personality! The Elephant Man is the story of an individual's encounter with society, a society that rejects a person because of his appearance and looks at him like an animal! But the Elephant Man does not have this look. By observing the appearance of John Merrick, who is wearing a hat and a cape, we realize that John Merrick is hiding himself from society and people, but this concealment is not because of John Merrick's abnormal appearance, but because of his vision. The director of the film, the people that John Merrick lives next to are monstrous and hideous people, although the only difference is that these hideous faces are hidden behind beautiful masks! No! The only reason that causes him to be rejected from the society are only the people who cause the fear of Merrick's life. Of course, there are people who are also good, like the doctor who saves John Merrick from a stable, but later on, we see that this doctor uses John Merrick as a means to become famous, in fact, in the movie There is no saving angel for John Merrick's freedom. Lynch's view of the society has always been a deep and wise view. The picture he shows of a society is an ugly and dark picture, unlike what I have seen in Hollywood. The rich and the capitalist show the society as an enlightened and rational stratum, but the liberal and working class of the British society are shown as backward, superficial and stupid people, people who are so hard-hearted that they pay money to watch the suffering of a human being! Of course, maybe this is Lynch's approach in this The movie itself is a mockery of the rich class! Because maybe if the majority of people had the facilities of that rich class of society, maybe they wouldn't do such acts! People who apparently have no other entertainment than making fun of a human being! And in this Between John Merrick and the man in the film, he sacrifices himself to these people, he accepts all the pain of humiliation to make the human beings of the society he lives in laugh and be happy! But the only problem that John Merrick faces is this. He says: I am not an animal. Perhaps the most interesting scene of this movie for me is the scene of John Merrick's confrontation with the doctor's beautiful wife, when John Merrick immediately after seeing the doctor's wife shows the photo of his mother, who is a beautiful woman, to the doctor and his partner. David Lynch shows beauty in this scene, but this beauty is not specific to the face of the doctor's wife or the beautiful face of the elephant man's mother. He is a wonderful artist and is constantly talking to God. Whenever I am going to talk about a work by David Lynch, I can't help but feel a strange feeling throughout my being, the feeling that we find inside ourselves when we see any of David Lynch's works! Lynch's only goal is human beings, he goes to the lower layers. And it deals with the inner character of the human being and sometimes shows a monster from these layers, a monster that can be inside every human being! But in the film Man of Film, unlike other works of David Lynch, this time we are faced with a monster that is in the lower layers of a personality. This monster is a real human being, a firm believer and maybe a saint! I use the word saint because the character of the story is always suffering but never loses his faith. Maybe the elephant-faced man We can name the most unconventional film of David Lynch, unlike other works of Lynch's cinema, the film Man of Film has a linear story, and we see less illusions and ambiguities in this director's works. But this film has a common point with other works. Lynch is the masterful characterization of the characters in the film. And another important point of this film is the brilliant black and white cinematography of Freddie Francis, who is known as the master of the Gothic style in filmmaking. In my opinion, the reason for the black-and-white film of Man Film Nama may be another point, and this goes back to the same thing The actors in the film are good and bad characters! Because the characters in the film are either black or white in terms of personality! The Elephant Man is the story of a person's encounter with society, a society that rejects a person because of his appearance. And looks at him with the eyes of an animal! But the elephant-like man does not have this look. By observing the appearance of John Merrick's character, who is wearing a hat and a cloak, we realize that John Merrick has removed himself from the society and He hides people, but this concealment is not because of John Merrick's abnormal appearance, but from the point of view of the director of the film, the people that John Merrick lives next to are monstrous and hideous. Of course, the only difference is that these ugly faces It is hidden behind the beautiful masks! With the faith that John Merrick has, he has no complaints about his situation! The only reason why he is rejected from the society is only the people who cause the fear of John Merrick, people who are not really human and in The inner layers of the character itself are a monster! The characters that David Lynch has dealt with well in his next films! Of course, there are people who are also good, like the doctor who saves Merrick from a stable, but we will see later that This doctor also makes John Merrick a means to his fame. In fact, there is no savior angel for the freedom of John Merrick in the film Man. Lynch's view of the society has always been a deep and wise view. The image he shows of a society is an image. It is ugly and dark, unlike what I have seen in Hollywood. In this movie, David Lynch shows the wealthy and capitalist class of the society as enlightened and rational, but the working class of the English society is shown as backward, superficial and stupid people, people who They are so hard-hearted that they pay money to watch the suffering of a human being! Of course, this approach of Lynch in this film is a mockery of the same rich class! Because maybe if the majority of people had the facilities of that rich class of society, maybe they would not have committed such acts. People who apparently have no other entertainment than making fun of a human being! And in the meantime, John Merrick or the man in the movie sacrifices himself to these people. He lives to laugh and be happy! But the only concern that John Merrick faces is this. He says: I am not an animal. Perhaps the most interesting scene of this movie for me is the scene of John Merrick's confrontation with the doctor's beautiful wife, which John Merrick immediately after Seeing the doctor's wife shows the photo of her mother, who is a beautiful woman, to the doctor and his partner. David Lynch shows beauty in this scene, but this beauty is not specific to the face of the doctor's wife or the beautiful face of the elephant-faced man's mother, but the director of that beauty. And it depicts the extremely tender feeling of a human being in an extremely awkward appearance, a fashion that is extremely artistic and is constantly talking to God.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Absolutely brilliant! Emotional Masterpiece!,"I really wanted to see this movie. Anthony Hopkins, one of my absolute favorite actors of all time, great IMDb and I was interested into the topic aswell. After watching the movie these thoughts got confirmed and I now happily recommend everybody reading this review, watching the elephant man.The story is emotional and so are the perfect written characters. You can take a lot with you while watching this movie, it will be two hours full of learning. And while these characters are written so greatly the acting of Anthony Hopkins outshines even that. The man is the legend, a movie gets immediately better when he is on board.And then let's talk about the end. Seeing the elephant man succeed is so satisfying and sad at once it will NOT be forgotten.With this said, there is no excuse for not watching this movie.

The Real Best Picture of 1980...,"There isn't much one can say about this movie. I mean it speaks for itself. I will however explain why I enjoyed this masterpiece. It was a triumphant and intriguing story about man vs. society. It featured an amazing performance from John Hurt (as John ""The Elephant Man"" Merrick) and from a very talented supporting cast led by none other then one of the few acting gods Anthony Hopkins. It is a powerful film that will/should totally involve you. One of the best things about it is the fact that the viewer starts making a connection to John Merrick, you find yourself caring about this man because you know that he is otherwise alone in this world. This movie had a profound effect on me because for the first time in my life I was able to understand that no matter what people look like they are just like you, they're Human beings. Many people believe that Raging Bull was robbed of the Best Picture Oscar in 1980, I on the other hand disagree. I always say that the most interesting film should always win Best Picture and ""The Elephant Man"" is far and away more interesting then the other masterpiece of 1980 ""Raging Bull"". Like I already stated; Elephant Man had an amazing effect on me when it comes to human beings, Bull however did not.Final Grade: ***** (out of 5, meaning 'excellent')",,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful and Sad In Many ways!,"I just have to say this is the first time I have seen this Movie and I Loved it, Very Moving and warm. The Cast was brilliant as was the story it was quite a tear jerker to say the least. John Merrick was an amazing man and many could learn from watching this just how some things we take for granted. This is a 10/10 for me. I avoided watching this movie for years as I knew it would be sad, yet happy in many ways. I do not regret it at all but I don't know if I could view it on a regular basis as its so difficult to watch, overall It has to be one of the best movies I have seen and would recommend it to anyone out there. It is a movie you will never forget,every performance was amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"""People are frightened by what they don't understand.""","The Elephant Man (1980) tells the story of a grotesquely disfigured man by the name of John Merrick (John Hurt) who is being pitilessly used as a circus sideshow freak before being discovered by philanthropic surgeon Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) who takes him in at his hospital to examine his abnormalities and soon later provides him with a room that he can call home. It is at this late stage of Merrick's awfully short life that we get to see the truly kind-hearted soul & surprising level of intelligence that lies behind this monstrous facade.David Lynch is one clever man. He knows exactly what the audience wants to see. He knows the audience is desperate to get a glimpse of what this supposedly freakish figure looks like. So he builds up a ton of tension by really lengthening it out beforehand. He teases you. When you think the big reveal is going to happen, something else happens. I literally said to myself multiple times throughout this film ""the suspense is killing me!"". And then when that elusive reveal of our titular protagonist finally does happen (13 minutes in!), it has the exact same shocking impact that it would if we were visiting this ""attraction"" ourselves in person. Except it's not *marvellous*. It's not *amusing*. It's not *fun* in the slightest. It's horrifying, and it's just plain sad. Immediately our sickening curiosity quickly turns into tremendous sorrow. And once again, Lynch knows this. Which is why he barely shows Merrick's appearance in that scene, and continues to hide it until significantly later (once we have somewhat recovered from seeing his unfortunately horrific sight). The thing with this though, is that it had been so long that we had sort of forgotten what he even looked like (especially since it was a very dim lit setting). So when the nurse opens that door and gets the fright of her life, so do we, once again. And it causes just as powerful a reaction - if not more - for us as it did last time. But what Lynch manages to do this time around is he instantly get rid of that barrier of fear between the audience and Merrick. And we realise this in a rather strange way when we see the main character a minute or two later and suddenly, we feel oddly comfortable seeing him on the screen, and just how Treves was when he first brought John into his office, we soon become extremely intrigued by his condition. It's like we are watching this story unfold through the lens of Treves, expect much more slowly, and that helps us, as people from a much different era, to fully understand the perspective of a person from the Victorian era, and what their first encounters with an oddity such as John would've been - and were - like. It is an absolute masterclass from the legendary David Lynch ladies and gentlemen.I would've spent more time writing about the exceptional cast and other noteworthy positives but I've basically ran out of time, but all in all, it's a tremendous picture, my favourite Lynch film way ahead of Blue Velvet (1986). If you're a David Lynch fan and you somehow haven't checked out this masterpiece yet, what are you waiting for?",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very touching,"Three people who did an exquisite job. John Hurt, Anthony Hopkins, David Lynch.David Lynch set the perfect mood, especially in the beginning. Anthony Hopkins, loving considerate human being. John Hurt, what can you say about him? He made you compassionate about a mutilated man with that amazing performance.I was really disturbed by the man's appearance and especially his sound while he talked. I personally dislike when someone talks in that way, I almost gaged. But amazing acting and the story even though disturbing it's very emotional how people have treated him. Society doesn't look into someone's heart or education or enlightenment. Just appearance. How cruel and judgmental they become just by the looks of someone. Also how they would pay whatever to watch someone get his heart broke in a stage.Loved the bathroom scene, despite his social anxiety and fear of contacting other people and all the trauma caused to him he exploded.All of that self-expression because one doctor treated him like a decent human being not a freak. Also, another scene that melted my heart is in the theatre when the actor called him ""my very dear friend"" this sentence has its deep sense of meaning. Both of those people were able to detach their emotion toward his gruesome looks and treat him with their heart. True showcase of how society it divided, yes there is too many cruelty but some people are decent.Amazing choice doing it in black and white with many excellent shots by Lynch! Absolutely worth the watch!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the greatest movies I have ever seen!,"Based on a true story, ""The Elephant Man"" is about John Merrick, a man who suffers from a congenital disease. He is so horribly disfigured that the only place he can find a niche is the circus. Despite his condition, a Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) finds and brings him to the hospital of where he's doing research on such unusual diseases. Here, John develops a friendship with Dr. Treves and regains his dignity for being a human.John Hurt as John Merrick a.k.a ""The Elephant Man"" gave one of the most memorable performances I have ever seen. I can understand why Robert De Niro won for Raging Bull since he's a more well-known actor than Hurt. But underneath the hours of make up, John Hurt is not a screen robber like De Niro, but plays a troubled and unloved individual who wants to be accepted. His performance in several scenes almost moved me to tears. Anthony Hopkins, Anne Bancroft, and John Gielgud are equally as wonderful as Hurt.Even though this is the only movie I have seen by David Lynch, I was immediately pulled into the film. His direction is simply wonderful, particularly with the limited shots of the Elephant Man. His body was never fully shown, until John Hurt developed the character. Because of this, rather than being frightened by The Elephant Man, I felt sympathy for him.The work of the cinematography by Freddie Francis is marvelous. The black and white not only made the Elephant's Man appearance less disturbing but it also set the tone of the time period during the late nineteenth century. The movie would not even been as good if it wasn't for the black-and-white. In addition, the score by John Morris adds to the gloomy atmosphere of the film.The Elephant Man is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. It is sad and depressing, yet it is brilliant and very moving. It makes you cry for John Merrick, not just for pity but for sympathy. It makes you realize that we are all human, despite our disadvantages. It also makes you realize that one man knows that despite his condition, he knows he's all right. It is a shame that this did not get any Academy Awards. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Somber, graceful, eloquent--if not always moving","Filmmaker David Lynch sees the beauty in misfits, whether it be a disfigured saint such as David Merrick in ""The Elephant Man"" or the bizarre carny folk who make up the traveling sideshows, though he shows no interest in plucking our heart-strings over them, or in being emotionally prodding. While this is often a big plus, Lynch's non-sentimental take on Merrick's story keeps the movie grounded when it should soar. True story of a horribly disfigured British man at the turn of the century who is rescued from a freak show by a sympathetic doctor is layered with a dreamy atmosphere but also anchored by serious, intelligent performances by John Hurt as Merrick and Anthony Hopkins. However, once Merrick is brought out into a curious high society, one feels that the director's dramatic resources have been tapped out, and the last act plays like an afterthought. Certainly this is a fine piece of cinema, adapted by Lynch and others from two books on Merrick; it is graceful and deliberately downbeat (appropriately so), though its technical finesse ultimately presses out the emotion. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Beautiful and thought-provoking film,"David Lynch has a talent of holding up a mirror. The audience is allowed or even forced to confront its own flaws, its numerous shortcomings. Yet the undertone is more often than not the one of hope, that we still have the chance to learn. Some could even claim that in some respect this film is educational. It certainly has a moral lesson. That pity rarely is the right answer, as it is nothing more than the grudging nod of a supposedly superior being towards a lesser man. Rather we should learn to respect and accepts others as equals, worthy of our time and their own individuality. It is a difficult lesson to teach without preaching or pointing fingers, but I rather think that this film accomplishes just that and it accomplishes it with beauty and grace.The brilliance of using a character like John Merrick, played by John Hurt, is that he's such a shocking figure. And the movie plays with our expectations and our ingrained need to gawk and whisper. Our glimpses of Merrick are controlled and shrouded for a long time and when we finally see him it's such a sterile experience that we're forced to ask ourselves what all the fuss was about. And right after that Merrick starts to grow as a character and I honestly felt rather awful later on when I realized that I had immediately dismissed this man and his nature just because I had been so interested in how they had managed to make him look. It's a skillful trap and one that many will fall into, which helps to teach you the lesson.Though speaking of Merrick's appearance, I must commend the makeup department, as he really looks hideous. There's an immediate reaction of repulsion when you first lay eyes on him, even though the shot itself is such a sterile one. And that repulsion is of course the fact why the need to respect this man needs even to be taught. You absolutely wouldn't expect such a kind soul from a body like that, but as always, you cannot judge book by its covers. In this case ugliness only goes skin deep and in time I learned to greatly respect and even admire Merrick's character and his willingness to endure.A film with just Merrick in it would hardly be adequate, however. Thus I am glad that they managed to get someone like Anthony Hopkins to play the part of Frederick Treves as he is an important audience-surrogate. We feel and process our emotions provoked by this film by watching and learning from his reactions. The initial sick wonderment, the horror of realization, the misguided pity, the shame, the willingness to know better and the eventual respect. It is a staggering amount of emotions and subtle nuances to express, but Hopkins manages it with ease and aside from Merrick, his role is easily the most captivating in the entire film.I would however slightly criticize just how saint-like Merrick has been made in this film. In some ways it works for the film's favour as the lesson gets taught much better when the contrast is as clear as possible without being naive. But the real-life John Merrick - yes, this is based on real people and events - was by all accounts a man, he had his flaws. Not numerous, but flaws nonetheless. Merrick's only real flaw in this film would seem to be his inability to stand up for himself, which makes him more rounded and more identifiable - plus it helps with the pity - but it's still a minor issue, at least for me. Treves is also given a much nicer role to play in Merrick's life, while his initial ""handler"" is greatly vilified, but I can recognize that the film works much better this way rather than if the real-life events had been perfectly replicated.On the technical side of things, this is a remarkably well-made film. The shots and settings have themes and ideas behind them, they're not just random shots of hospitals and the streets of London. The black and white aesthetic also works really well with the Victorian setting, plus I bet that it helps to disguise the rubbery texture of Merrick's face. The music and the pacing also work rather well, but it's the visual side where this film really shines, aside from the story of course.I admire this film. It doesn't feel like it's trying to force you to some conclusion or another. In retrospect you can of course see that you were guided, but it felt natural and I was allowed to draw my own conclusion. I had to gaze into my own person, my own soul, and allowed to decide whether or not I liked what I saw or not. And that's the strength of this film. It wants you to better yourselves, to show you that you still have some ways to go and that the society of today is not without any flaws. It's a beautiful film.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fascinating story exploring humanity through a rare example,"""Looks are deceiving"" would be an adequate way to describe the ""The Elephant Man"" as a film from the outside, but it would be a horribly amateur way to describe its message. David Lynch's film soars beyond mere pity for those with life-altering physical abnormalities and serves as more than just a slap on the wrist to a generally unsympathetic public. It is a study of the human condition and Lynch's camera a microscope examining one of its most fragile examples.Taking place in Victorian London and filmed like a classic '30s or '40s film in black and white, ""The Elephant Man"" carries that classic naive sensibility that combined with the hideous deformities of its central character, creates a bit of horror and suspense before it appeals to our better nature by eliciting sympathy and understanding.John Merrick (John Hurt) is ""The Elephant Man"" to the abusive owner exploiting him in a freak show, but when Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), a doctor studying anatomy, finds him and sees him for the first time, a tear runs down Hopkins' face in a powerful close-up and the doctor brings him to hospital, nursing him to health and soon socializing him.It's a fascinating story. For the first half hour we're hooked by sheer curiosity over what John looks like and how he came to be, a technique that catches one of our most unflattering flaws in that we gape at the unknown and the abnormal. It then shows us more and more of John, slowly unveiling his humanity, and suddenly we're converted and incredibly protective of this unusual character.The film provides an array of human reactions to seeing/meeting someone so terribly disfigured. Treves' wife, for example, cries uncontrollably out of pity, a famous actress treats him like a fascinating human being, a nurse screams at the sight of him and sadly many exploit him. This broad spectrum fully puts you in John's shoes and leaves you with incredible insight into his unique situation.As a filmmaker, Lynch leads us quite easily to our own discoveries about what John's story teaches us. He nudges us toward symbolism without beating us with it and cuts away from scenes just as we react to them instead of giving moments of pause and total resolution. This creates a totally different reaction to what happens in a scene. It's raw, unresolved, maybe even troubling -- but it works and we manage to understand the significance better because he pulls us away at a moment of tension.There are some abstract techniques and shots bookending the film in short scenes with John's mother, but little else is cryptic. Lynch really draws out the similarities and differences between John as an uncared for circus attraction and John as the fascinating man everyone wants to meet, which is the heart of both our and Treves' moral dilemma. Then, as John runs away from a mob at a London train station, we get that simple but powerful line: ""I am not an animal! I am a human being! I ... am ... a man!"" and suddenly it all clicks. Now that's fantastic film-making. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Thank You David Lynch..,"..for taking a break from making Laura Dern movies to create this masterpiece that is heartbreakingly beautiful and sometimes just heartbreaking.It turns out that Lynch is the perfect director for this movie.  He assembles one of the best casts in any movie, starting with a ground-breaking performance by John Hurt in the leading role.  Anthony Hopkins is just as good; he can say more with a glance, do more with a moment, then most actors can do with ten pages of script.  When he first sees John Merrick, he cries one tear and its perfection.

The Only Movie that could make me cry..most touching ever,"I have been a movie geek since childhood and though a lot of movies touched my heart,never did I feel to cry during the movie but it all changed after I watched this.I saw Elephant Man after I became a huge fan of David Lynch after 'Eraser head' and 'Mulholland drive'.I always had the creepy Lynch in my mind who could scare/thrill but Elephant man was a different case.It is Drama made with so much originality and force that it can melt a stone.It is based on true story of John Merrick which I have read and many people know but Lynch gave it a touch of artist.To shoot it in black and white,multiple edited shots and the camera angles are all perfectly implied.Lynch creates an atmosphere at the start by showing the hatred of people and suspense is created when in the early movie,there is no detailed shot of Merrick.As we start to feel his misery,we are made accustomed to his looks,now that's story telling.It would also be wrong to appreciate movie of such magnitude without a pat at the back of the cast.It was John Hurt's movie all in all and he won BAFTA for this.The dialog delivery,the expressions in that heavily made up face,and the wheezes of bronchitis all were so original that you reach 1880's,the time of Merrick.When he says, ""I am not an animal, I am a human being, I am a man"", not many can resist emotions.Anthony Hopkins is so natural but he always is,John Gielgud is also worth applause.Background music score is mild and just blends so well.There was something in the movie which couldn't stop the tears flowing but there is also a message, as Merrick says, ""People often fear the things they don't understand"".I recommend everyone not to just see this movie,but to own it to acknowledge the dark truth that our eyes judge people even before the heart or brain starts to feel them...",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A well constructed movie but not as good and interesting as Joseph Merrick's real life-story.,"""The Elephant Man"" is certainly an above average biographic movie about Joseph ""John"" Merrick, better known as the elephant man. The movie takes lots of liberties and of course over-dramatizes at times. I never have anything against altering a true story, as long as the movie and its storytelling benefits from it. In this case however, the truth was better than the fiction of this movie.As a movie it is well constructed and it's atmospheric. The black & white cinematography makes this movie feel like a 'horror-monster' movie from the '30's and early '40's, like for instance ""Frankenstein"". Through its style it makes us realize and aware of it, that we look same upon John Merrick, as we do on the Frankenstein creature. We're disgust and frightened. At first sight we don't bother and fail to really see the wonderful personality and qualities of the person. In a way it makes us more monsters than Joseph Merrick ever was.It's especially the cinematography and way of storytelling that contributes to the movie its style and quality. Director of photography Freddie Francis is a well known name in the horror business so his style and experience is notable and adds to the good of the atmosphere. If you really didn't knew any better you would really think that the movie was made in the '30's or '40's of the last century. Also the sets and costumes and of course make-up, add to the 'feeling' of the movie.But now the negative aspects of the movie. Main problem for me was that I didn't really got emotionally involved with the movie and its characters. The explanation for this is however simple I think. I personally was already quite familiar with the true story of Joseph Merrick, his life and his condition. So nothing in the movie came as a real surprise to me and I already knew how it would end and most of what happened in between. Still I felt that the character lacked real depth and were perhaps even a bit underdeveloped. For instance we never really get to fully understand what drove Dr. Frederick Treves, or what went on in John Merrick's head (especially in the beginning of the movie.).The movie truly could had been a more powerful one if it had sticked more closely to the truth. For instance the interesting aspect of Merrick being a suspect in the Jack the Ripper case was left entirely out of the movie. If they had put it in the movie it would had been more and better shown how the general public, in that time period, thought and felt about Merrick. It really is a movie filled with some missed opportunities and that is the reason for me why I regard this movie not as a perfect or emotional one. But I'm convinced of it that persons without too much knowledge about the story and appearance of Merrick will find this movie a satisfying and emotional moving one. In that case I would advice you to just ignore this comment and simply go and watch this movie for yourself, because it almost most certainly will be worth your time.It's a good looking, well acted and nicely constructed movie but honestly, if you want to learn about Joseph Merrick's life and condition I still recommend you watch a good documentary about him instead.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Most Depressing Movie I Have Ever Seen, I Wish I Had Not Watched This Film","THIS MOVIE RUINED MY DAY.""The Elephant Man"" is about a man who was horribly deformed while still in his mother's womb. He was born deformed and because of this he has never been treated like a human being.The entire movie revolves around this deformed man being discovered and cared for by a doctor. The doctor and his contemporaries care for the deformed man throughout the movie but not once is he treated like a normal human being. The kindness that everybody, but a small few, show him is surface level nonsense.The movie is supposed to show how kindness and ""love"" turned this deformed mans life around. This would be true if the kindness and love were genuine. Unfortunately they were not.I strongly do not recommend this movie. It is about a miserable man who is mistreated and abused his entire life. Not once did I ever believe he was truly happy. This movie, right from the beginning, made me sad and I honestly wish I had never watched it.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A hard movie to watch, but a truly great one as well","I haven't read or heard anything about the story of Joseph Carey Merrick, aka John Merrick, aka The Elephant Man before seeing this movie, so I can't say if it's accurate or not. However, from everything I've heard, it seems to be as close to the original story as it can get. I hadn't seen any other films by David Lynch when I sat down to watch this, so I was quite excited to see if it really lived up to all the hype surrounding it. It does. The film is excellent and nearly perfect. However, there are small imperfections that pull it just below a perfect rating, but it's very close. The plot is very good, and the way we learn of The Elephant Man is great. The way Lynch builds up suspense for the first few minutes, luring us with the promise of seeing something bizarre. When that promise is not kept, we are only more interested in seeing this, this creature that they speak of. But Lynch drags this even further... in fact, we don't get a good look at The Elephant Man for the first half hour... and even then, it's just in a flash. From there, we slowly see more and more of him, but somehow we never manage to truly get used to him. This is brilliant directing from one of the best directors out there, because obviously he would lose effect should we ever actually get used to his looks. The acting is great. I don't think I found one single character to be poorly performed. However, those that stand out the most are definitely Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt. Hopkins is great as the doctor who is amazed at this new phenomenon and is instantly intrigued in the physique of this man. Hurt is astounding as John Merrick, The Elephant Man. He brings such an innocence and purity to his character that we can't help but feel sorry for this man, as he is treated horribly by the majority of those he meet or who see him. I didn't cry during this film, but it was more close than I thought possible. For a film that deals with such a delicate subject, it has no actual sap or sentimentality... only sadness. Pure sadness. Near the ending, there is a powerful scene that shows, in a non-preachy fashion, the point of the film; it is not his looks that make him an animal, if he ever was one... it was the reactions of other men. The ending is beautiful. No other way to put it. Simply beautiful. As for those small imperfections I mentioned... I can't quite put my finger on what it is, specifically, but it just seems like something was missing... maybe I just felt that the film was too sad, maybe it was that the few attempts at lightening the mood fell flat and seemed out of place... maybe I just wasn't prepared for this moving experience. I don't know. I am honestly not sure. But while I found this movie to be great, excellent even, I have to say that there are better films. Not far better, no... but slightly better. There are films where all of the elements come together more perfectly and create a better movie overall. This one is worth watching, though, and should be seen by anyone who feels they would benefit from it on a personal or emotional level. It's a masterpiece. I recommend this movie to anyone mature enough to understand it. Yes. There is no 'definite' group of people that will get more out of this film than any other... except those that are intelligent and mature enough to understand and appreciate it. If you are one of those, and you have not yet seen this movie, go out and get it. You won't regret it. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"An amazing drama, one of the best of its kind",David Lynch brings some great atmosphere in this updated Elephant Man film. It is a drama filled with true compassion that makes you think and draws you in with great cinematography and black and white film.  The story is about a deformed man (John Hurt in his best performance in incredible makeup) who gets some help after years of torture by a doctor (Sir Anthony Hopkins in a early and good performance).  Real emotion is evoked here and it works as it is one of the best Lynch films and the 1980's films.  Biggest surprise- film is produced by Mel Brooks and his Brooksfilms productions.

Stunning Artistic Depiction of One Man's True Life Story,"One of the rare times director David Lynch was a hired hand was for this beautiful true tale of John Merrick.  With its stunning black and white photography, great attention to detail, bleak but beautiful look at Victorian squalor, amazing make-up work, and wonderful performances from John Hurt as the titular victim of society and Hopkins as the doctor who eventually helps him, this is Lynch at the top of his game.  All the pieces come together here for one of the most bittersweet true stories ever put to film.  Anybody who thinks Lynch can't make a coherent and meaningful film need only look at this.  Horror and beauty are beautifully contrasted here and Lynch gets to the roots of our humanity.  One of the view films that made me cry.  A masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
a true masterpiece,"I saw this film when I was very young and knew that it was wonderful, but seeing it again as an adult was a truly amazing experience.  The acting (Freddie Jones, Anne Bancroft, Anthony Hopkins is his best performance ever), cinematography (Freddie Francis), makeup (Chris Tucker), directing and editing is truly masterful.  I can only be amazed - and it is a true credit to him for this reason - that David Lynch had the ability so early in his career to spearhead this film.  I love Dune and respect all of Lynch's other works, but I have to say that this trumps them all.  Bring a box of tisues and get ready to feel what it is to have humanity.  You will come away from this film a better person.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Movie A Work Of Art?,"To answer my own question, YES! A rare event, a movie which stimulates the intellect, asks questions, moves the soul and heart, and ENTERTAINS.This movie DID change my view of the world and other people. Yes, it did break my heart, but ultimately it uplifted my spirit.Shot in gorgeous black and white, with moments of realism - the cruel belching of fumes from Victorian factories - and surrealism on a level with Jean Cocteau. The performances are magnificent. Hopkins (in my view the greatest SCREEN actor of all time) is superb, understated yet portraying every emotion of a dedicated man who cares about the world. And John Hurt is truly magnificent. Buried in make up he portrays the man. Finally, we see Merrik as a MAN. And there is the pleasure of Wendy Hiller in a rare movie role, and Anne Bancroft proving she is one of the great American actresses.Lynch gives us the oppressive and cruel Victorian value system (not the glorified Thatcher vision), and demonstrates the power of love and friendship I personally have never seen in a movie before. And it moves at a sufficiently fast pace to ensure viewers of clash bang wallop genres won't be bored. The black and white imagery is a feast for the eyes. And the score one of the most haunting, beautiful and most underrated ever - in my opinion! So, if you don't like phoney art house pieces, don't be put off, and ignore the period setting and black and white cinematography - it is sumptuous. And should be shown to everyone, including children, to try and prevent the dreadful racism and Nazism and intolerance that appears to be increasing in our times.I have loved many many other movies, but none have affected me the way this movie has. It was cruelly robbed at the Oscars, but Garbo and Hitchcock never won one - and that says it all!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The film is factually incorrect,"In the film, it appears that Treves has to walk a long way to see Joseph for the first time. In the film, Treves leaves the Hospital and appears to walk for ever. This is incorrect. The dark, damp and filthy abandoned premises where Joseph was displayed, was on the opposite side of the road from the hospital. The building is still there. The Whitechapel area hasn't changed much at all during these hundred years or so.Gas lamps have been replaced with electric ones, horse-drawn trams have been replaced by the London Red Bus, but it doesn't take much imagination to see the place as it used to be.... dark.......dangerous......and e-x-t-r-e-m-e-l-y mysterious. If you listen carefully you are able to make out the sound of hooves on the cobble stones. (Some Whitechapel back streets and allies still have them).The nurses who attended Joseph were very frightened at first. In the film, a nurse runs screaming from Joseph's room in the attic. This is absolutely true., the nurse wasn't prepared for what she saw. and she did scream very loudly. After not too long though, people came to love and respect Joseph.Joseph's cap has survived. The author of this site has seen it close up - it's very daunting. The circumferance of Joseph's head was 3ft and the curtain at the front of the cap was intended to hide his face. He was often tormented by children and adults alike, who attempted to lift up the curtain and peek inside.This is the part of the film where Joseph is on his way back home from Ostende (Belgium). Freak shows had become increasingly unpopular in the UK towards the latter part of the 19th century, and so Joseph was forced to make a living elsewhere. Hence, he went to the continent. His companion (and owner) the Showman, who incidentally didn't mal treat him as the film depicts, ended by robbing Joseph of his life savings. Stranded in Belgium and with no money, Joseph had to rely on the charity of the skipper of the cross-channel ferry.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Beautiful Portrait,"There are movies that take you away into a realm of their own,into a world that existed in London-if you lived in London this is even more poignant. John Hurt is John Merrick the Elephant man-may be john Merrick reincarnated as John Hurt since no one could have a personified a disfigured,downtrodden human being that was the Elephant Man. If this movie does't bring tears then you lack the tear glands. David Lynch takes you into the life and times of John Merrick so much you want to meet him and hear him say ""My na--me-is-Jo--hn"". This is a masterpiece of movie-one of the best movies made and made anywhere that will never cease to amaze at the talent of an actor in the caliber of John Hurt.

The best and worst of humanity,"...are to be found in The Elephant Man, David Lynch's masterful follow-up to his debut, Eraserhead. In many ways, this is an enormous departure from the utterly bizarre Eraserhead - it is a polished drama with well-developed characters and a clear-cut storyline. However, there are certainly artistic similarities, and maybe even thematic ones. There are a few strange Lynchian flourishes to be found in The Elephant Man, and the black-and-white images and industrial sounds are reminiscent of Eraserhead. Both films also are sympathetic portraits of outcasts.However, The Elephant Man is ultimately a very different beast than Eraserhead, and distinctly different from most of Lynch's other works. This is a deeply compassionate, achingly sad film. John Merrick's story is heartbreaking enough on its own, but when told with Lynch's intimate, graceful approach and John Hurt's entirely believable and dignified performance, it's just about too sad to bear at points. But The Elephant Man also shows the moments of beauty and joy in Merrick's life. It may be a movie about the tragedy and injustice of human cruelty and ignorance, but is equally about human compassion, love and faith. This is one of those rare movies that everyone needs to see.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant,"The Elephant Man is one great movie. It has several brilliant performances by John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins, great art direction/editing/costume design and such, but there are three things that stand even farther out. The direction is just perfect. David Lynch manages to disturb us without making us stop caring for his characters. The screenplay is one of the greatest ever. It helps a lot in the area mentioned before disturbing us while making us care deeply about the characters. The original musical score is however the strongest point of the film. It is just absolutely brilliant. Maybe the best ever. All around a fantastic movie that everybody who can handle the general disturbing nature should watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
10/10,"The Elephant Man, directed by David Lynch, is a film that deeply moved me on many levels. It's a poignant, heart-wrenching story that left a lasting impression on me long after the credits rolled. I was captivated by the powerful performances, particularly by John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins, and by Lynch's sensitive direction that brings this true story to life with grace and empathy.The film tells the tragic and inspiring story of John Merrick (John Hurt), a man born with severe physical deformities in Victorian England. Cast out by society and exploited as a sideshow attraction, Merrick's life changes when Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) discovers him and brings him into the care of a London hospital. As the story unfolds, I found myself deeply moved by Merrick's gentle nature and intelligence, qualities that starkly contrast with his appearance and the way he is treated by society.John Hurt's portrayal of Merrick is nothing short of extraordinary. Despite the heavy prosthetics, Hurt's performance is incredibly nuanced and soulful. I could feel every ounce of Merrick's pain, dignity, and yearning for acceptance. Anthony Hopkins is equally compelling as Dr. Treves, who struggles with his own moral dilemmas about the fine line between helping Merrick and exploiting him. Their interactions are the emotional core of the film, filled with moments that are both heartbreaking and uplifting.The black-and-white cinematography enhances the film's haunting atmosphere, capturing the gritty reality of Victorian London. It's a stark reminder of the harsh conditions and prejudices of the time, which, sadly, still resonate today. The use of shadows and lighting not only emphasizes Merrick's physical deformities but also highlights the inner beauty and humanity that lie beneath. The film's score, composed by John Morris, is hauntingly beautiful and complements the narrative perfectly, adding an extra layer of emotion to an already powerful story.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Who is the real monster?,"As unbelievable as it may sound, 'The Elephant Man' is not fiction. It is a factual story based on the life of Joseph Merrick. It is believed his mother was attacked by an elephant, and she constantly had nightmares of an elephant. From the age of five, Joseph developed abnormally, and literally turned into a freak, or hideous being.John Hurt stars as Joseph and delivers an incredible performance. To effectively bring the story to the screen, the most important aspect of the film was the make-up, which is fantastic.The film tells the story from the time Joseph was exhibited as a freak show at a traveling circus. At the time he was 'owned' by Bytes, who treated him like an animal. When surgeon Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) saw Joseph, he made it his mission to help him and to offer him a 'normal' life. He admitted him to the hospital where he worked so he could take care of him.Although this is an exceptionally well made film, it wasn't always a pleasure watching it. I sympathized with Joseph. No human being should ever be treated the way he was, or look the way he did. With the cruelty of men who benefit from another's misery, who is the real monster?",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great but heavy,"In one of the greatest Oscar travesties, there was no category honoring outstanding makeup until the year after the incredible makeup used on John Hurt in The Elephant Man. They couldn't have added the category in time, could they? I've always found it grossly unfair, a pattern repeated from when they added the category of Special Effects the year after The Good Earth and The Hurricane were released.This incredibly heavy drama was nominated for eight Oscars and didn't take home any gold. When you watch it, you'll scratch your head wondering how that's possible. John Hurt's heartbreaking performance, his dedicated and sensitive doctor, Anthony Hopkins, the beautiful period costumes and thoughtful black-and-white art direction, couldn't have been better. Even Anne Bancroft is wonderful, and she's only onscreen for ten minutes or so. But perhaps it wasn't the right time. Perhaps audiences leaving ten years of the wild 1970s craved a bit of angst before they settled into a historical drama. If you think you can handle this, go out and rent it. You'll be rewarded, but you need to go into it knowing it's upsetting.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

As a person who has experienced a lot of bulling in my life and seen other people getting bullied, this movie is very weak in comparision.

"""This Immeasurable Kindness""","It is historical fact that in Victorian London a man came to light whose head and body were so appallingly mis-shapen by fibrous growths that he was frightening to behold.  This unfortunate man, John Merrick, could never hope to live in society, and was forced to endure a wretched existence as a fairground exhibit - the 'Elephant Man'.  Merrick came to the attention of a surgeon, Frederick Treves, who rescued him and helped him reclaim his human dignity.  This true story is the subject of David Lynch's astonishingly powerful film.The 'look' of the film is a tour de force of sheer brilliance.  Not only are the images aesthetically resonant and horribly beautiful, but they also reinforce (and even shape) the film's very meaning.  In a recent TV interview, Lynch explained his choice of monochrome for ""The Elephant Man"" by saying, ""Some movies cry out for black and white.  Black and white removes you from reality and you can drift into another world.""  It certainly holds true in this case.  Veteran cinematographer Freddie Francis has worked miracles, recreating 19th-century London as if old engravings had been brought to life.  Lynch and Francis have set about composing an essay on the grotesque.  Two whores fight in a pub, their faces distorted by rage and injuries.  The operating theatre, with its bizarre stands and clamps, is a parody of a factory, little more than another Victorian processing plant. Lamplight casts tortured, exaggerated shadows.  The band of carnival freaks who liberate Merrick constitute a monstrous procession of deformity as they escort him to safety.  And the purpose of it all?  To descant on Merrick's own distorted form, and to comment on the Victorian psyche, with its morbid interest in the grotesque.Bytes, the fairground 'owner' of Merrick, gives out a story to the paying public that Merrick's mother was attacked by an elephant during her pregnancy.  The film begins with disturbing images of toplit elephants in a black nothingness, a woman in the throes of childbirth, and a close-up of the portrait of his mother which Merrick keeps with him at all times.  From this nightmare we move into the organised nightmare of the fairground, where people pay to be frightened.  A board near Merrick's cage reads ""The Fruit Of The Original Sin"", so that revellers can comfort themselves by supposing that what has been visited upon poor Merrick is in some way his own fault, or at least it was 'meant to be'.  It is our own moral deformity, not on display as nakedly as this wretch's physical dystrophy, which prompts us to stare and to mock.The Victorians had a passion for machinery, and the film sustains a brilliant metaphor of human society as being just another apparatus. Fairgrounds are machines of entertainment and profit.  The public is circulated around the stalls and its money extracted.  The grim streets around the London Hospital form an apparatus for housing the workers, hovels laid out in joyless serried ranks, conveniently close to factories and wharves.  Even the hospital is a processing machine, with its regimented lines of beds and its severe architecture.  By moving from fairground to hospital, Merrick has left one industrial monster and been swallowed by another.  Even the public urinal is a comment on the Victorian obsession with 'order', its troughs arranged as regularly as looms in a cotton mill. Because Merrick's poor distorted body offends against these notions of symmetry, he is despised and vilified.Steam and flame recur as images throughout the film in endless variations.  Steam was the Victorians' power-source, the foundation of their wealth and confidence, quite literally the supplier of their drive.  Here, it represents the dark energy of the human psyche, so admirable when harnessed properly, so destructive when it breaks the bounds of social discipline.  Fire is the enlightening goodness of science, the Promethean beneficence of Treves and his circle, real Victorians who belie the stereotype of pompous and sinister hypocrisy, and who go to enormous pains to nurture and protect a malformed wretch such as Merrick.And for all the terrible suffering of Merrick, this is film is a resounding tribute to human kindness.  As viewers, our cynical expectations are continually being defeated.  Treves does not treat Merrick like an anatomical specimen, but warms to the Elephant Man's innate decency.  Carr Gomm does not expel the  hideous creature from the hospital, but shows profound compassion.  Teenage nurses are afraid of Merrick at first, but grow to love him.  We suspect the fashionable actress Mrs. Kendal (played magnificently by Anne Bancroft) of taking a shallow and insincere interest in Merrick, but we are proved wrong yet again.  Treves' wife (a deeply affecting performance by Hannah Gordon) is initially dismayed by Merrick's ugliness, but finds herself weeping helplessly at the tragedy of this sweet man's crushing misfortune.John Hurt, as Merrick, gives a performance which fills the viewer with awe.  Hardly recognisable as a human being beneath the latex make-up, he blazons Merrick's humanity across the screen.  The gentle wonder with which Merrick beholds the beauty of an ordinary middle-class drawing room is heart-breaking to witness.Anthony Hopkins and Freddie Jones, as Treves and Bytes respectively, are marvellous.  Treves is tormented by a recurring doubt - is he really no better than Bytes, the deranged mountebank who believes that Merrick belongs to him?  Are the two of them no more than showmen, seeking to exploit Merrick's misfortune?  And flowing from that, are we, the viewers, waiting impatiently to see Merrick's face unveiled, any better than the Victorian gawkers?The film answers its own question.  Decency is better than cruelty, and Treves is nobler than Bytes.  We all have both Treves and Bytes within us, in varying proportions.  How many of us are capable of Treves' searing self-examination?  Merrick, and this magnificent film about him, touch something deep in our inner selves.",,Anonymous,Biography

Everyone should see this movie.,"No film has ever touched me the same way as The Elephant Man.When you look at the surface and see the names David Lynch and Mel Brooks involved with this movie, you will most definitely get a different view than what it is actually like before you see it. What astonishes me about that fact is that it's also a central theme for the movie: Don't judge a book by it's cover.I have seen more movies than I can count and this is by far the most emotionally human out of them all. There are several scenes which are so devastating, that you forget you're actually watching a movie. The way certain characters treat John Merrick are simply cruel. Especially after we find out what Merrick is REALLY like. On the outside, he's a disgusting mess, but on the inside...he's one of the kindest, most gentle characters that you can think of.The academy completely robbed John Hurt of a much-deserved Oscar for best actor that year. I'll be the first to say that Deniro's performance in Raging Bull was also amazing, but Hurt played his role in a way that no other actor in the world could have. I saw none of John Hurt in The Elephant Man...just 100% John Merrick.This film is almost perfect. I saw almost because I am still looking for flaws. So far, I haven't found any. The story is extremely uplifting and also very sad at the same time. The acting is out of this world, and David Lynch's directing really contributes to the greatness of the whole project. The last half-hour or so is especially noteworthy.

very slow with an interesting performance from John Hurt,"London surgeon Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) tries to see the Elephant Man in a freak show. The police closes down the show for being degrading. Bytes (Freddie Jones) is the man in charge of John Merrick (John Hurt). Treves is able to pay Bytes to let him see Merrick. A drunken Bytes brutally beats Merrick and Treves brings him back to the hospital. He scares the nurses and is an oddity for his colleges. Everybody assumes Merrick to be an idiot. The drunk Bytes demands to have his meal ticket Merrick back. Treves convinces the hospital governor Carr-Gomm (John Gielgud) to allow Merrick to stay. It turns out that Merrick is quite a well spoken man. Famous actress Madge Kendal (Anne Bancroft) is fascinated with news story of Merrick while the hospital's low life Night Porter brings people over to gawk at him.There is a lot to admire about this movie. John Hurt is able to project innocence through all that makeup. Hopkins is fine but I kept wondering what the movie is trying to say. There is a lot missing from this. The twisted style of David Lynch is missing. The black and white looks good but it doesn't elevate the style. The story lacks tension. It's all very flat. And the movie is horribly slow.

The Egotism of Artiness,"Hats off to Freddie Francis for his excellent black and white cinematography, but there's little merit to this story of Joseph Merrick except The Message: we mustn't judge people by their appearance. More significantly, this appears to be the Reagan/Thatcher Period antidote to the best of British proletarian cinema, very roughly bracketed by ""Look Back In Anger"" (1959) and ""This Sporting Life"" (1963). Here, in ""The Elephant Man,"" we are regaled with a stark contrast between the coarse, vulgar, grasping ""lower orders"" and the refined, courteous, compassionate upper class. Coincidentally, Jack the Ripper's most infamous work was performed against several ""Unfortunates"" in Whitechapel, 1888-90, during the last years of this subject's life. From the opening sequence suggesting the gang rape of a pretty young woman by a herd of roaring, rampaging elephants to her dissolving portrait in the stars accompanied by a Samuel Barber adagio, the cheap sentiment is unalloyed. This creeping 124 minute opus is nearly as inflated as the late Mr. Merrick's head and far more tiresome. Stellar job by the Makeup Department and John Hurt for enduring it.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography

"The good ones, the bad ones and the very ugly one","David Lynch surprise a lot of us with the story of John Merrick (a great John Hurt), a Circus freak of the XIX century which has his face and body totally deformed, to the point that people frightens when they see him. He lives with his ""owner"", Bytes (Freddie Jones), a really mean man, who gets paid for showing him in a cage, in a vulgar and horrid spectacle. But one successful Doctor (Anthony Hopkins, sober and good as always) in London finds John in a Carnival and he wants to help him.At the beginning, the only thing he wants is to show the man (just like the other man used to do) in an anatomy class for doctors, but once he get to know John a little bit, he gets a room for him at the Hospital and he protect him from Bytes, from whom he had been stolen.At first, John seemed to be dumb and stupid, but after a while, we noticed that he wasn't any of those things: he can talk (he has some difficulties but he can) and he can also read (not a common skill at the time). But what really shocks Doctor Treeves and us is the fact that John is the most pure and gentle man we could ever imagine. He is incredibly kind and sensitive, and he feels that he had found a friend in the Doc.The fact is that John became very famous in the city just for being deformed and living at the Hospital, and with him became Doctor Treeves very popular.And here is one of the keys of the whole film: Dr. Treeves ask himself whether he's good or bad, because he understands that he made the same that Bytes, he won something by showing the monster.But what I think is the most important element is the fact that John could be the purest person in the world, gentle, kind and polite, but he is so extremely ugly, that people can't really love him. I know this could sound crazy in some way, but I beg you to be honest and ask yourself if you could. Remember this scene in which an old couple visit him in his isolated room: remember the expression in their faces... he can be the best man ever, but he's still a monster and we suffer every time we see him.So, we get to see that there are good people (like Merrick or Treeves or the other freaks from Circus), there are bad people (Bytes and some that I rather not mention) and there is also ugly people. But maybe we are some kind of a mix of all this...The plot is very good. The acting is good as well (it is really funny how a lot of us, including me, say that John Hurt performance is great, in spite he is wearing a mask and a lot of make up from the beginning to the end, and he has almost no expression in it!) and this is until now, the best movie i've seen made by David's Lynch peculiar brain.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"If this movie doesn't touch your heart, you should have check if it's beating the right way","This movie shows us the contrast of the beautiful and ugly in humans. It's actually a movie about basic concepts of humanity with some glamorous performances, very good editing and mesmerising atmosphere.John Merrick, The Elephant Man, is firstly pictured as frightening creature and you will think that he just got from the circus to another torturing hands of scientific research by a surgeon Dr. Frederic Treves (Hopkins). But because Dr. Treves is a man who doesn't look at John with prejudices, he gives John a personal space and start to discover his beautiful humanity and talent. This wouldn't work if there was another doctor who just would followed the official instructions to don't care about uncurable patients.Then we see different people reacting to and handling John differently. We se beautiful looking people who laugh at and torture John. We see Dr. Treves wife who is very beautiful but also humble, empathetic, and warm. We see people fighting for John's better future, people who have doubts about John, people who just want make money off of him. And we see a very talented man with beautiful personality - John - and we will just want to protect him as he was the last such a human being on earth.By the way, I don't remember if I've ever seen better costume design - the masking of The Elephant Man. Can't believe it didn't win the oscars.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""And who needs it more than us?""","Despite the fact that ""The Elephant Man"" is about a grossly deformed man, it is truly one of the most beautiful movies ever made. Director David Lynch has peered into the souls of both the ""outcasts"" and those considered ""normal"" in our society. Lynch has never been better, and the same may also be said about actors John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins.Bytes is a would-be circus man who puts The Elephant Man/John Merrick (Hurt) on display in the freak show, attempting to profit from another man's misery. Dr. Frederick Treves (Hopkins) ""saves"" Merrick from the evil Bytes, but what does he do with Merrick? Puts him on display in another freak show of sorts for a panel of doctors. Treves has again stripped Merrick of his dignity and tried to to profit from his misery. So who is worse? Bytes or Treves?And this is only the first 15 minutes of the film...What eventually saves Treves is that he actually gets to know Merrick. Behind the deformity he discovers a human being.There are so many beautiful and touching moments in this movie: Merrick's awe at watching the play, Merrick removing the pillows from his bed so he can sleep like a normal person and, of course, Merrick trapped at the train station and shouting out ""I am not an animal!""But my favorite moment comes when Merrick's fellow ""freaks"" in the circus help him escape. As they put him on a ship so he can hopefully find his way back home, the dwarf (Kenny Baker) says to him ""Good luck, my friend. And who needs it more than us?""Filmed in gorgeous black and white. They don't come any better than this.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
good but not great,"""The Elephant Man"", rather than being all around great, is actually a mixture of good and bad. The good is that  , well, first of all, the cinematography is nothing less than amazing, feeling like a series of cutting edge paintings. For example, all the dark passage ways utilized really do seem scary and mysterious, the extended shot of the pipework is art at its finest, and the dream sequences are some of the most disturbing ever committed to film. Otherwise, the film has all around excellent acting (Hopkins as Dr. Treves is especially memorable, presenting the character as a gentle but realistic hero with self conscious doubts about his own virtues) and no punches are pulled in presenting the deformed main character being abused or making others feel uneasy. Indeed, in most of the scenes where Merrick tries to interact with people in a normal way, you can just sense how awkward the ""normal"" characters feel in spite of trying to act like his deformity does not matter. And when he gets bullied, he REALLY gets bullied (youÂ´ll probably cheer when Dr.  Treves gives the abusive hospital worker a serious a-kicking in return). Otherwise, though, the problem with the movie is that Merrick is not really a well fleshed out character (no pun intended). The basic recipe for him is ""take a deformed person and make him stereotypically innocent and slightly socially retarded to show how isolated he was"". John Hurt conveys this quality well under a heavy makeup job but thatÂ´s pretty much the beginning and end of the character. Also, David Lynch, being David Lynch, usually focuses on getting the most violent shock value, absurdity, surrealist weirdness, or odd awkwardness out of most scenes. Plus, 1940s style melodrama and ""Eraserhead"" style surrealism, as good as they are on their own terms, are uncomfortably combined here. Hence, it sometimes even feels as if Lynch is making fun of the screenplay. All in all, though, itÂ´s worth a look if you want to see something different.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Art,"My father always talked about this movie until I looked it up and watched it. It was moving, restorative, and awakened many feelings not felt for a long time, as I saw, in each scene, the faces that exist in human beings. It's impressive to see how the most oppressed are sometimes the most tender and sensible, while the prejudices wander around without bothering to find out why. An excellent movie, without a doubt!A complete movie! Fantastic performances by John Hurt, which earned him an Oscar nomination that year, and Anthony Hopkins, whose performance also deserved a nomination, but the academy forgot about him, beautiful photography and spectacular editing, a magnificent script that deserved not only to have been nominated for an Oscar, but to have won, an unforgettable soundtrack that is still remembered today in other films!

Immensely Powerful,"_The Elephant Man_ is an immensely powerful and moving film. As a biography of Joseph Merrick, it's somewhat inaccurate, and events have been juggled around chronologically, presumably for dramatic effect.  However, this takes little, if anything, away from the impact of the film.The black and white photography is excellent, as is the cinematography; a very real sense of Victorian England is evoked.  As in other Lynch pictures, such as _Eraserhead_, sound is used skillfully in the creation of mood and a sense of place.  Anthony Hopkins, John Hurt and a host of others offer a sense of their characters that is almost palpable.I found _The Elephant Man_ to be, at times, very uplifting and positive; at other times, it was almost unbearably sad.  Scenes of great joy and happiness are contrasted almost immediately with scenes of mindless brutality and infuriating ignorance.  For anyone that has never quite fit in, or felt an outsider, Hurt's portrayal of Joseph Merrick will be something that will strike a very, very deep chord, and leave a lasting impression, as it did with me",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wow Wow Wow,"I saw this for the first time when I was very young, I had no idea the movie was made in the 80's.

never before have I seen a sadder and more inspirational story,"My favorite movies have always been the ones that are based off of true events. The movies that you can go on the computer and look up the facts. A couple I can name are Raging Bull, JFK, Goodfellas, or Braveheart. Out of all of these the Elephant Man is the best I have seen. The story is sad with the way John Merrick was treated and no one could have played him better than John Hurt. I believe Robert De Niro's performance in Raging Bull was superior and I am glad he won best actor. However, I believe the Elephant Man should have won best picture. The direction is great, I believe it was a great choice to film in black and white. I love the cast starring Anthony Hopkins, John hurt, and Anne Bancroft. I respect and admire anyone who had anything to do with this movie because they brought forth the true story of a misunderstood man. John Merrick would be proud of this accomplishment.

A true story of courage and human dignity with several tender and touching sequences,"An awfully deformed man called John Merrick -John Hurt- is rescued from a freak show and sheltered at a hospital in Victorian times by a brilliant surgeon, Anthony Hopkins. Other important characters appearing here and there are the following: John Gielgud as the hospital chief, Wendy Hiller as the hospital's senior matron, Freddie Jones as sideshow owner, Anne Bancroft as a prestigious stage actress and Phoebe Nicholls as Merrick's Mother. An incredible but true story... probably this year's best film! .""I am not an animal! I am a human being! I...am...a man!""The Elephant Man (1980) is a good work, more accesible than David Lynch's enigmatically disturbing Â¨ErarserheadÂ¨ and his other films. It has much the same limpidly stirring humanism asÂ¨Francois Truffaut's L'enfant sausageÂ¨ in describing as the unfortunate John Merrick, brutalised by a childhood in which he was hideously abused as an inhuman monstrous freak and exhibited at sideshows, but he was gradually coaxed into revealing a soul of such refinement and delicacy that he became a lion of Victorian society. Someone may encounter this remarkable movie hard to see, simply because of the matter subject: a grotesquely deformed man, though this issue teeters on the edge of bewildering at odd moments, it results in a really sensitive and agreeable story; it always draws back the brink, thanks to controlled interpretations from John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins. But that is only the half the story the movie tells, turning out to be a great yarn graced by splashes of Lynchian touches and a special atmosphere. The darker side, underpinned by an evocation of the smoky, steamy hell that still underlies a London facelifted by the Industrial Revolution. In The Elephant Man (1980) there're several sensitive scenes as Merrick is persuaded by a celebrated actress to read Romeo and Juliet, as well as the wonderful final images. But is John Hurt , the great and deceased actor who steals the show playing the title role under a mound of makeup, and really eliticing pity and sympathy.Excellently shot in black and white by cameraman Freddie Francis. Adding an evocative and moving musical score by John Morris. The motion picture was originally and inmaculately directed by David Lynch, including some of his ordinary trademarks and it was one of the most critically praised films of 1980. David Lynch's shooting is very good , though his treatmant tends to melodramatic, but the tale is still affecting at most stages. In 1977, Lynch released this his first film Eraserhead (1977), being too rare to be easily enjoyed, although not critically acclaimed, was noticed by many people, including Francis Ford Coppola, who was rumored to have screenings of it for his cast and crew on the Apocalypse Now (1979) set. After Lynch directed a stream of visually striking films such as Blue Velvet (1986), Lost highway (1997) and Mulholland Drive (2001). Thanks to these films and others, beginning with Blue Velvet (1986), and including his Twin Peaks (1990) TV, David has gained the reputation of one of the foremost auteurs in the film industry, and one of the few living auteurs who continually defies cinematic convention. His films continually represent his ideal representing his peculiar stye of life and thought that should be complex, and in some cases, inexplicable. Due to his decisive innovation and the weird confusion of some films, he will always be recognized as if not one of the greatest filmmakers, one of the most original. Rating : 7.5/10. Above average. Decent, terminally agreeable and moving. The flick will appeal to David Lynch enthusiasts, as well as John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Haunting, riveting and one of the most beautiful films ever made...","I saw the movie for the first time 2 weeks ago and it left me speechless and with my mouth gaping. Never have I seen a more moving film and I've seen lots. Hopkins and Hurt gave the performances of a lifetime and played them with such passion and feeling.The movie broke my heart and broke it even more when I learned it was a true story! I was horrified when we first see John but then as we went deeper and realized what a kind, loving, and intelligent man he really was...wow. My favorite part had to be when he and Bancroft were doing Romeo and Juliet, although it was disappointing that Bancroft got so much credit for such a small part. Seeing John being treated so inhumanely infuriated me on so many levels and it's hard to watch those scenes without yelling at the screen. It also made me realize that there are still Elephant Men and Women in the world today and I hope they're not treated like John Merrick was. I sincerely hope we can all learn some- thing from John Merrick and Dr. Treves. Was he attractive to look at? No. Was he a wonderful human being? Absolutely. Watching him remove the pillows and quietly slip away made the tears start all over again. In all, this is a beautifully haunting movie that stays with you and makes you think! A definite must see!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Quite simply...,"Quite simply the most beautiful movie I have ever seen. Even reading through others comments and remembering a film I haven't watched for nearly 20 years can still move me to tears. John Hurt is wonderful, but his performance is complimented perfectly by Anthony Hopkins and the viewer's own slow and gradual realisation that inside that deformed body is a truly beautiful soul struggling to know itself and communicate with the world it loves. Possibly the finest moment of cinema is the quiet dignity with which he removes the pillows from the bed to ""sleep like a normal person"" with full knowledge that the very act will kill him. So poignant, even the memory can bring on the tears.",,Anonymous,Biography
Purposeless,I didn't get the message in this film. Who may ever want to make a movie on a freak show? The film is completely purposeless. People keep humiliating a crippled man from the beginning till the end. It is slow paced and contains repetetive scenes. Dream sequences are terrible.

The masterclass from David Lynch,"""The Elephant Man,"" directed by David Lynch and released in 1980, is a profound and deeply moving film that delves into the life of Joseph Merrick, referred to in the film as John Merrick, who suffered from severe deformities. Shot in black and white, Lynch's direction elegantly underscores the harsh realities of Victorian England and the stark contrasts between beauty and brutality, humanity and exploitation.John Hurt delivers an unforgettable performance as Merrick, capturing the sensitivity and intelligence of a man trapped behind an imposing physical facade. His portrayal is both tender and powerful, earning him widespread critical acclaim. Anthony Hopkins stars alongside Hurt as Dr. Frederick Treves, who rescues Merrick from a life of sideshow exhibition and offers him a chance at dignity and respect. Hopkins' performance is nuanced, reflecting the complex emotions of guilt, responsibility, and compassion.The cinematography is stark and artistically striking, emphasizing the grim atmosphere of the London streets and the clinical sterility of the hospital. Lynch's use of shadow and light plays a crucial role in storytelling, drawing viewers deeper into the emotional and physical landscape of Merrick's world.The narrative is not just a tale of cruelty and kindness; it also explores themes of what it means to be human and the intrinsic need for connection and acceptance. ""The Elephant Man"" is not merely about the spectacle of Merrick's appearance but more profoundly about the society that shuns him and the individuals who embrace him.Overall, ""The Elephant Man"" is a powerful, haunting film that stays with viewers long after it ends. It challenges the audience to confront their perceptions of normalcy and beauty, making it a timeless piece of cinema that resonates on multiple levels. The film's blend of emotional depth, stunning performances, and thoughtful direction makes it a classic worthy of its critical acclaim.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

As other movies from Lynch, we need to see and feel the movie. Lynch's movies are made not just to be seem, but to be felt. And you can fell the pain of the man character even when he does not talk.In addition, the perfomances and the gloomy atmosphere bring intensity to the plot. Great performances by John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins.David Lynch is a remarkable director. A great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Elephant Man is both tragic and beautiful,"Not the most typically Lynchian of movies, but very likely my favourite of his films, The Elephant Man is a masterpiece at a variety of levels, from script, to acting, to special effects to sheer emotional punch. If Lynch might seem to you too cerebral or unemotive in his weirdness, you only have to watch this film to realise that there is a depth of feeling behind his love for the freakier side of human nature.The Elephant Man is a move which will have you tearing up some 20 minutes in and won't release you until 100 minutes later when the credits are rolling. The life of John Merrick the titular Elephant Man is both tragic and beautiful, a story about a man who in spite of being horribly afflicted by a number of conditions which leave him completely disfigured and barely alive, clings desperately to his humanity and goodness........ Merrick is a man who had every reason to curse his existence, but what we see here is a man who is thankful for every little good thing that happens in his life, every gesture of kindness or sign of friendship will fill his heart with gratitude, even while most of the world acts disgusted by him. An acting masterclass by a heavily made up and unrecognizable John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins as his doctor and friend, this is a truly life affirming film. All the while the cinematography by legend Freddie Francis mimics British cinema from the 30s so perfectly that you might forget that this is actually from 1980.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best films of the last 25 years,"This is film making of exceptional quality.As one would expect from David Lynch it is visually impressive. Shot in black and white the film evokes a Victorian world which is dark and sinister.But what sets this film apart is the portrayal of Jon Merrick by John Hurt. Merrick is a man who has seen and experienced the worst humanity has to offer - indeed his life has consisted of little else. Yet his exquisite appreciation of what is best and most beautiful in mankind is incredibly moving. So moving in fact that the film is at times almost too painful to watch. We see scenes in which a cruel world brutalises Merrick alongside moments when he treasures simple moments of kindness and expresses a fine understanding of aesthetic beauty.The film reminds us that Merrick was, in its truest sense, a fine and beautiful man.",,Anonymous,Biography
A Moving Story,"A very unusual David Lynch movie, this tells the story of the life of a disfigured Victorian man and the doctor who tried to help him. Few American directors have really had a feel for Britain, let alone continental Europe, (Landis (An American Werewolf in London) and Losey (The Go-Between) are exceptions that come to mind) but Lynch's portrait of Victorian society is both powerful and poignant. Similar in concept to Bogdanovich's Mask, the film is profoundly different in execution.

A well-made and powerful film which could use some polishing,"David Lynch is a genius when it comes to the weird and absurd. He puts a lot of imagination into his films, and its interesting to see what he can do in each of them. Eraserhead was the 1st film that I saw from him. Over time, it grew on me to an extent to be my 4th favorite film of all time (currently). The Elephant Man was the 2nd film I watched from him. Even though its story is more grounded, it still manages to keep Lynch's absurdity feeling present found in most of his filmography.A Victorian surgeon named Frederick Treves rescues a horribly disfigured man named Joseph Merrick who's mistreated, and works as a side-show freak for a living. Behind his disturbing appearance is an intelligent person who Frederick begins to appreciate as they continue to spend more time together.Often, when movies contain bleak plots like this film or attempt to make the viewer feel sadness throughout them, it's very easy for them to be crippled by feeling overly emotionally manipulative. This can also easily hinder the viewer's immersion with the film their watching. For that reason, it seemed unlikely that this film would be able to succeed concerning the hopelessness of its plot. Despite that, however, Lynch was able to make one of the saddest films I've ever seen without making it feel overly sentimental or cheesy whatsoever. By firmly sticking to the facts of the true story this was based on, he did all that was required for him to do in order to make this film into a powerful experience. Also, we got to know more about John Merrick throughout the film as Lynch did a good job at developing his sensitivity and intelligence. This proved to be a highly powerful characteristic which made the film stand out so well. It makes many other feel-good films crumble into dust when compared to this one.The acting is another high point to the film. John Hurt as Joseph Merrick gave an amazing performance. Underneath all of the disturbing makeup, he is able to project humanity. Also, his voice was very muffled, like one would expect. Despite that, however, his voice was still understandable, and I was able to make out his voice without having to try too hard to listen or replay a line of dialogue. He stole the show. Also, Anthony Hopkins as Frederick Treves gave a great performance as well. He was able to convincingly play a doctor trying to help Merrick without ever sounding bland. Both of them did pretty good as the 2 main roles. I had no glaring issues with the rest of the cast.The visuals were pretty good. Since the movie was set in the last 1800's, the black and white seemed fitting, and it made sense for a movie set over 100 years ago to have black and white. Also, the make-up on John Hurt looked gross and realistic. To make it, Lynch looked at different photographs of the real Joseph Merrick. Also, after this film wasn't recognized at the Academy awards for its make-up effects, tons of people wrote angry letters to them, demanding them to give the film an award for Lynch's recreation of Joseph Merrick. They didn't do it, but they did create a new award called ""Best Makeup"" with ""An American Werewolf in London"" being the first to receive it. Since the effects inspired all of that to happen, I'd say that it did something right. Also, because of the black and white, the disturbing and realistic make-up effects on John Hurt managed to look gross without distracting me from the movie.When it comes to historical accuracy, this film isn't the most accurate film out there. It had several inaccuracies. Firstly, the events from the films famous railway station scene happened before Merrick stayed at the hospital. Secondly, the whole kidnapping sub-plot never happened. Merrick went to Europe on his own accords. Mr. Bytes, the original cruel owner of Joseph Merrick, never existed. Bytes was based off of Tom Norman. Thirdly, it's likely that Tom Norman was never as cruel as the movie made him out to be. Fourthly, Frederick Treves never had to rescue Joseph Merrick from Tom Norman. A few weeks after Joseph Merrick started working with Tom Norman, their exhibit was seen as 'distasteful', and it was shut down by the police. After that happened, Joseph and Tom went their separate ways. In addition, several operations were required to enable Joseph Merrick to talk. Finally, his first name was not ""John"". It was ""Joseph"".In conclusion, I enjoyed this film. It succeeds where many feel-good films fail at. It has great acting and gross and realistic effects made even better by the black and white cinematography. This may not be the most historically accurate film out there, and it may be a bit dull in a few places near the middle, but it's still pretty good. I'm going to check out more of Lynch's films in the future. People who aren't a fan of Lynch's work tend to agree that this one and The Straight Story are his best films as they prefer his more straightforward work. I think that this was pretty good as well. It just needed some polishing in a few areas.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"scary, or is it just me","i am so glad i read lots of comments on this movie particularly the ones that hit the nail with me...i read reviews on this film,beautiful,heart wrenching, moving,is it just me i thought,the best review i read on here was ""its not black and white"", ""its black and grey"" I'm haunted by this film, yes it got me interested,but it also put me off living, sleeping and eating for about a month, till the vision went away.........so i guess you could say job well done...don't get me wrong its a brilliant movie,but to me its horror,but it also got me interested in the subject,apparently he was a famous icon in 1900 england and yet before the film no one was really any the wiser,i also read that the mentioned Joseph Merrick wasn't as dumb as it seemed stories of him renting out a shop to show himself off to make money from his own appearance,so a keen business brain too,i too have seen the allegedly real cap of his,they had an ELEPHANT MAN exhibition in Madame Tussuad's in Blackpool,why i went i don't know cause i knew it would throw me for a while but all the same i went...recreating the dark streets of old London town, very romantic, and there he was in the corner in all his waxed glory, bloody terrifying,the one thing that sticks with me on a lighter note is English comedian frank skinner had done routine talking about the elephant man and was saying how while watching the movie he noticed that he didn't look like an elephant but his head looked more like fresh ginger,but obviously it would be bad business to be paraded around various cities as the ""AMAZING GINGER MAN""",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A beautiful, strange, touching, bittersweet and ultimately haunting true story, well-told and respectful of Merrick without ""cheapening"" the tale.","Few films capture ""true stories"" as well as The Elephant Man. Although there were, of course, certain artistic liberties drawn (as with any film based on actual events), David Lynch respects Joseph Merrick enough not to present him as a monstrous caricature of a man. (You may be wondering why I do not refer to Joseph Merrick as John Merrick...well, his real name was actually Joseph, but was changed for the film as its screenplay was based on correspondence letters between Dr. Frederick Treves and Joseph. For some reason, he altered Joseph's name in the letters to ""John"" at some point in time. No one's sure why.) John/Joseph Merrick had a rare disease called Proteus Disease, a congenital condition. It made him appear hideously deformed and unrecognizable as a man.Of course, in today's age of scientific reasoning, Joseph would have been provided with great care; however, in 19th century Victorian England there was still a heavy reliance upon superstition and, to a certain extent, religious influence upon the public's perception. Because Joseph was so disfigured, everyone figured he was either being punished by God or he was a murderous monster. (In fact, at one time he was a potential suspect in the Jack the Ripper killings in Whitechapel, based simply on his physical appearance. It's actually an interesting theory they proposed - that he had taken out his sexual frustration upon prostitutes who rejected him - but the simple fact remains that no one in Joseph's condition could have ever managed to perform those murders. Still, it's an interesting addition to the legend and John/Joseph can even be seen briefly in the Johnny Depp film ""From Hell,"" which is based upon the Jack the Ripper case.)John Hurt does a truly wonderful job portraying Joseph Merrick. His performance is captivating because it hints at innocence beneath the hideous appearance - proving the age-old saying ""beauty lies on the inside""...it's a touching performance and one of the few that brought me close to tears. For what it's worth, as convincing as the makeup effects are in this film, the real Joseph Merrick was far worse looking. There is actually a picture available on Google Image search; if you take the liberty of looking for it, you may be shocked.The real Joseph Merrick was born in Leicester in 1862 and began showing signs of deformity at age two. He was eventually forced to live with his father, who did not want the child, and sent him out onto the streets to earn money.Because no one would hire him, he decided to star in a carnival attraction as ""The Elephant Man."" When sideshows were outlawed in the UK in 1886 he traveled to Belgium to find work and was mistreated by a showman.In due time gained a friendship with Dr. Frederick Treves (played by Anthony Hopkins in the film), a physician at London Hospital. He was finally given proper care and actually ended up drawing the attention of many rich Victorians of the time, including the Queen herself.Joseph died in his sleep in 1890. Because of the size of his head he could not sleep horizontally, but the film proposes he tried to just once in order to imitate normal sleeping patterns of other humans. Others claim he was trying to commit suicide, which I somewhat doubt.In July 2003, a doctor named Charis Eng took samples of Merrick's hair and bone and determined that he had suffered from Proteus syndrome, and not neurofibromatosis, as initially suspected.Of interesting note, although Merrick's skeletal remains are now on display at London Hospital, Michael Jackson reportedly tried to purchase Joseph's remains in 1985 to add to his ""private collection."" The less said about this, the better.David Lynch seems an odd choice to direct this tale for obvious reasons - he is typically associated with the more bizarre, but The Elephant Man is actually quite Lynchian. Its cold, macabre layering provides a nice texture to the film. It's not unabashedly sentimental. It doesn't pull any cheap tricks. Lynch, as usual, keeps a certain distance from the viewer...and for once it pays off in a drama and makes The Elephant Man seem like a sort of macabre tale - which works to the film's advantage because it IS a rather macabre and depressing (if bittersweet) tale.This is my favorite Lynch film that I have seen so far and it's a pity that it isn't more highly regarded by those in the film industry. Although it made a bit of a fuss when it came out in 1980, it seems by today's standards it has drifted into semi-obscurity and its influence speaks more than the film itself.However, I think this should be required viewing for any film lovers. Technically it's beautiful - the black and white compliments the eerie undercurrents and the direction and performances (particularly Hurt and Hopkins) are very good.On another level (as an emotional experience) it doesn't resort to the type of controlling sentimentality that, say, a film such as Forrest Gump might. It is less manipulative, and as a result, far more honest.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Biography Masterpiece!,"After David Lynch's 1977 bizarre flick ""Eraserhead"", he was asked to direct a film adaption of the true story based on John Merrick. ""The Elephant Man"" is a film where emotions and the human spirit really show. A film about the development of humans. Just because people are deformed, does not mean they are useless, or a waste. In this story, its about an Englishman who was born differently than everyone else. Now what I admired about this film is how its acting is done by John Hurt as John Merrick (Elephant Man). Such a disgrace a man like him must have lived through.If anyone has a heart for films and loves teary-eyed films, this is probably for you. Its much different than most of David Lynch's films, but it shall be remembered for its beauty and sadness that John Merrick must have felt. He admired art, he loved plays, and he wanted to sleep in a bed like a human.....and thats exactly what he did.""The Elephant Man"" is a powerful, moving biography on the never forgotten John Merrick.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A story about a monster inside each of us,"I don't know why, but for some reason I expected more shock value from a movie called ""The Elephant Man"". You know, something extra-ordinary, perhaps, on the verge of being revolutionary, especially from someone like David Lynch. On second thought, though, I reckon I managed to identify the source of my unreasonable and ungrounded expectations: the Russian arthouse movie ""The Green Elephant"". What I've just described regarding my expectations is actually the description of that Russian film. Funny how our brains work, isn't it?Anyway, even though what I got is not exactly what I had expected, nonetheless, I enjoyed the picture a lot. It runs for exactly two hours, but it flew by in what felt like half the time.""The Elephant Man"" explores two significant themes I'm personally invested in :
1) Are we fundamentally better than that one particular person we consider a ""bad human"" just for doing something we don't like, for believing in things we don't believe in. At the end of the day, we might perceive them as being a ""lower class"" only because they are different from us, when, actually, they couldn't be more like us, and perhaps that's exactly what makes us despise them.2) No matter how hard we try to pretend we are not superficial enough to judge people based on their looks, when this is pushed to an extreme we often reveal our true colors. Kudos to those who indeed are capable of seeing people for who they truly are.In conclusion, I want to share a though that came to mind during that scene when a bunch of drunks came to see ""the monster"", and started to hurt his dignity with their abusive behavior: ""These men are more monsters than the Elephant Man is"".",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Work of Genius,"I think it is a testament to all people involved in the making of this film, that through the presentation of the life of one individual, such powerful messages about humanity; it's prejudices and fears; it's hopes and dreams; the decisions we make in regard to the way we communicate with and treat others, are conveyed with utter brilliance, whether that be through Christopher DeVore, Eric Bergren and David Lynch's screenplay; Lynch's trademark directorial style; John Morris' haunting fairground-esque soundtrack; Freddie Francis' grainy black-and-white cinematography; the exemplary performances of the likes of Anthony Hopkins (Dr. Frederick Treves), Anne Bancroft (Madge Kendal) and, the man himself, John Hurt (John Merrick); or perhaps, what I believe, a wonderful mix of all of these aspects, creating a motion picture masterpiece that visually and thematically gorgeous.Being first introduced to this film through an interest in Victorian society as well as, in my opinion, the depth of atmosphere that can be produced in film through black-and-white, I feel privileged to have been allowed to immerse myself in such an unforgettable world that ties these two things together flawlessly.I am not a person usually effected by emotion within film, (In most films, I tend to find it to be usually forced and contrived), but this film provides that perfect balance, recognising that, rather than portraying Merrick as an all-around extraordinary person, a portrayal of a real human individual, who has been born with such horrendous deformities, yet attempts to be seen as equal in a time of extreme prejudice, is more suitable for developing that emotional connection with an audience, as Merrick's humanity is heavily emphasised, being more identifiable.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An artistic film but one that requires the right mindset,"The films of David Lynch are abstract and off beat. One needs the correct frame of mind to enjoy them. The Elephant Man is one of the more mainstream, straightforward narrative films by the auteur but even a mainstream Lynch film is abstract and The Elephant Man- based on the true story of John Merrick is filled with imagery and allegories that might bore the watcher. Make no mistake- this is a good movie and the performance of John Hurt as the titular character is so good it is a shame that he did not win an academy award for it. Hauntingly photographed and well-acted by everyone from Anthony Hopkins to Anne Bankcroft this is an artistic film and needs a certain mindset to be viewed.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

"It is NOT the ""true"" story of the elephant man","I agree that the film is remarkable, involving and emotional, but it is part fiction. If you study all the material you will observe that about 30% of the film is exaggerated to make better drama. It is wrong to say that it is the ""true"" story of the elephant man.Early biographies of Merrick inaccurately give his first name as ""John""; an error repeated in many later versions, including the 1980 film The Elephant Man.Born in Leicester to mother Mary Jane Merrick, he had a younger brother and sister. He began showing signs of deformity at age two (or, according to [1], at age five). His mother died when he was 11. According to family accounts, she too was ""crippled"". He then was forced to live with his father, Joseph Rockley Merrick, and stepmother. She did not want him and gave Joseph's father an ultimatum, ""Joseph, or me.""Joseph was forced to earn a living by selling shoe polish on the street, where he would be harassed constantly by local children. For the better part of his life he was unemployable, so as a last resort he took a job as a sideshow attraction. He was treated decently, and made a small amount of money. When sideshows were outlawed in the United Kingdom in 1886 he travelled to Belgium to find work and was mistreated and abandoned by a showman.After making his way back to London, Merrick was befriended by Dr. Frederick Treves, who discovered Merrick at the train station suffering from a severe bronchial infection. Treves was a physician at London Hospital, and Joseph was given a permanent home there. He was something of a celebrity in High Victorian society, eventually becoming a favourite of Queen Victoria. Although numerous people, including a few women came to visit him, he never received the thing he sought most: love. Treves later commented that Joseph always wanted, even after living at the hospital, to go to a hospital for the blind - so that he could find a woman there who would not be frightened of his appearance. He found some solace in writing, composing both prose and poetry in his later years. He was cared for at the hospital until his death on 11 April 1890 from suffocation while sleeping, which was apparently accidental. Merrick was unable to sleep horizontally due to the weight of his head, but may have intentionally tried to do so in this instance in an attempt to imitate normal behaviour.His life story became the basis of a 1979 Tony Award-winning play, and in the following year an Academy Award-nominated film, which were unrelated but both called The Elephant Man.In 1971 Ashley Montagu suggested that Merrick suffered from neurofibromatosis type I, a genetic disorder also known as von Recklinghausen's disease, and this disease is still connected with Merrick in the mind of the public. However, in 1979, Michael Cohen first identified a condition which came to be named Proteus syndrome by Rudolf Wiedemann in 1983. In 1986 it was argued that Proteus syndrome was the condition from which Merrick actually suffered. Unlike neurofibromatosis, Proteus syndrome (named for the shape-shifting god Proteus) affects tissue other than nerves, and is a sporadic rather than familially transmitted disorder. In July 2003, Dr. Charis Eng announced that as a result of DNA tests on samples of Merrick's hair and bone, she had determined that Merrick certainly suffered Proteus syndrome, and may have had neurofibromatosis type I as well. His PTEN gene (often mutated in the Proteus syndrome) appears to have been healthy (i.e., not mutated). As it stands, many people still refer to his condition as elephantiasis (sometimes misspoken as ""elephantitis."")Merrick's preserved skeleton is on permanent display at the Royal London Hospital. Singer Michael Jackson reportedly attempted to purchase the remains in 1986, but his offer of $1,000,000 US was rebuffed, and he has since denied that this ever took place.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The use of black and white gives that extra something that makes this film perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A heartbreaking and horrible story, beautifully told","Who could possibly have thought that the young director David Lynch would have made a film like The Elephant Man? The director's only previous feature film was the utterly bizarre Eraserhead. There are similarities or course â€“ the grotesque subject matter, some surreal details and the black and white presentation â€“ but it's the differences that are so incredible. Unlike Eraserhead, The Elephant Man is a character-driven biopic with a clear narrative and powerful emotional core. It has a string of world-class British actors and strong production values. It certainly seems like producer Mel Brooks took an incredibly risky gamble in his choice of director for this project. History has shown, however, that it was a gamble, to Brooks's eternal credit, that paid off handsomely. The young avant-garde director proved himself to be far more than a one-note merchant; he in fact showed that he was an artist of incredible skill, capable of not only astonishing experimental weirdness but also linear story-telling of the highest calibre.Lynch handles the heartbreaking story of the famous 19th century circus freak John Merrick with both delicate care and unflinching disgust. His approach avoids saccharine sentiment in favour of a more genuine emotional approach. Not only does he ask us to pity Merrick and despise those that abuse him but he also actively invites us to look at this appallingly deformed man. So we as an audience are confronted with questions of ourselves, as we too want to see 'the terrible Elephant Man'. Dr Treeves himself wrestles with such demons â€“ is he using Merrick too? As the film develops we share the character's emotional responses to John Merrick from outright disgust to warm affection. There is something of a build up to us actually seeing Merrick; we catch little glimpses and details, until he is revealed in a simple shot that is simultaneously shocking and understated.The acting is universally of the highest standard. John Hurt has been given much deserved praise for his portrayal of the title character but Anthony Hopkins as Dr Treeves is at least as good. Hopkins gives a perfectly pitched performance in a quite complex role that is extremely believable. Visually and aurally the film is beautifully conceived. The black and white photography from Freddie Francis is exquisite and the accompanying hum of machinery not only puts us in the world of the Industrial Revolution but also is a hallmark of Lynch in general. The director does keep his usual eccentric flourishes mainly in check but when he does add surreal imagery â€“ such as the opening elephant attack and Merrick's dream â€“ the imagery is highly original and adds immeasurably to the final whole.The Elephant Man comes highly recommended to everyone who loves cinema. It's one of the most genuinely moving stories ever committed to film by one of the indisputable masters of the medium.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
We the Victorians,"This movie touches upon many issues discussed in Academia by Michel Foucault, and I highly doubt it was coincidental. The Elephant Man is a character that could only come from the Victorian era and the rich duality that comes with it. The double personality of John Merrich, who goes from a gentle and refined man in the day to a poor beast that can only scream in the night, reflects the tension and evolutions of the power relations of that time. The oppressed goes from being a silent subject suffering from a brutal circus to being part of a much more subtle, scientific and bourgeois circus. Power structures are sharpened, but this comes together with an improvement of the objective welfare of the subject, who is now eternally grateful for this new form of control.David Lynch is a very clever guy, and he manages to really convey the feeling of the time, with the use of sounds, black and white, and dialogs. You feel the sadness of the Elephant Man, you share it. What does it say of us that we are so interested in these Victorian characters, that we can relate so much to somebody like the Elephant Man?",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lynch is an excellent story teller,"People who haven't seen this movie yet, but who are familiar with the work of David Lynch, might think that they know what to expect. But the man can surprise you. He does not only make movies like ""Lost Highway"" or ""Mulholland Drive"", which demand from the viewer that he or she remains focused from the very first second until the last, not for 100% but for 200%. The man is also an excellent story teller, as he proved with the movie ""The Straight Story"" and with this ""The Elephant Man"".This movie has been based upon the true story of John Merrick, a man who lived in Victorian England and who suffered from an awful disease which disfigured him completely. Not only was he physically in an awful state, because he was seen as an attraction and treated as an animal by several people, the man also had lost all self esteem. He doesn't even speak anymore and lets all the torture and abuse come over him. But than Dr. Frederick Treves hears about him and decides to pay the man a visit. At first he sees him as a medical curiosity, but as soon as he gets to know him better, he sees that John Merrick too is an ordinary human being with normal feelings...I don't think that I have to explain to you how original the story is. For as far as I know there has never been a movie that has talked about this Proteous Syndrome or shown someone who had it. And yes, at first you are shocked and disgusted by this strange person. But that shock is necessary, because from that moment on you are completely sucked into the movie and you start to feel one with the man. You're happy and sad when he is and as soon as you start to see the world through his eyes, you can only feel admiration for this brave man.But not only David Lynch did a wonderful job, although I want to add that his choice of filming this movie in black and white is absolutely brilliant (it gives you even more that feeling that this is a man from another era, a time in which such people couldn't be treated, but were seen as an attraction). Anthony Hopkins, John Hurt, Anne Bancroft and all the other actors, all did a wonderful job in this movie too. Without their excellent performances (and I really can't say who was the best or who was the least), this movie wouldn't have been the masterpiece that it is now. This movie doesn't deserve any less than a 9/10. But even when you give this movie the full 10/10. I can understand it without any problem. This is definitely a must-see.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Simply A Masterpiece,"Based on the true story of Joseph Merrick, a 19th-century Englishman afflicted with a disfiguring congenital disease. With the help of kindly Dr. Frederick Treves, Merrick attempts to regain the dignity he lost after years spent as a side-show freak (plot).I saw this film again because i can't remember many scenes maybe the end and the great quote in the film ""I am not an animal! I am a human being! I...am...a man! ""!, so i saw it today and what a film!, for sure one of the best films in the cinema history and deserve full mark.The character of John Marick is interesting because he is not predatory and viscous like other hybrid characters from the other movies but he is actually terrifyed of humans because of the cruel way he has been treated. There is a sad emotional background with his mother and how women shriek in fear at the sight of him. The story continues with the sad atmosphere because he fights for acceptance and freedom to try and live a normal life and gets to a point where he gains friends and society accepts him, to the end it's really a sad thing to watch this human, anyway no long words about the the acting it was great an simply superb by (Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt) they present a great job here and deserve more what they get.Finally about the director, David Lynch far from his style as i know (Surrealist & Mystery) in this film he was simple like the film! he present a really simple sad story and great screenplay, he shot the film in black and white to show more realistic in this film, to add more dark story more sad faces in this film and hide the mistake in Merrick Make-up, Lynch use a great soundtrack at the sad scene, in 1981 ""53rd Academy Awards"" this film should won it was better than Ordinary People and Mr Lynch should won too! anyway, The Elephant Man simply A Masterpiece.5/5",,Anonymous,Biography

9 out of 10,"I wish I had as much time to comment on this movie as some of they put into this movie. I will try to make a sensible comment in a short space of time.It's not my favorite film, there are some problems with it. I'm not sure of the life of John Merrick (sp?) other than what is related by this film, but I would imagine the film would have been more challenging (to us, the viewers) if the deformed man wasn't so sweet, contrite, and appreciative. Perhaps the meanness of his treatment should have been reflected in his behavior. This would have presented us with a more difficult dilemma, of having to penetrate not only the visual aura of this sick man, but also a barbed personality.However, they took the easy way out of making John Merrick a wholly sympathetic character.The film delivers something of the black and white industrial age austerity of David Lynch's preceding film Eraserhead (which is sadly becoming hard to find). I thought Eraserhead was a more tightly focused on advancing those kinds of atmospheres.The acting in this film as one would expect, considering the quality of the actors involved, a stellar British cast. Just look at all the names. These are great actors and actresses.This film could have been better, but measuring it against the other films I know (including most of the films in the IMDb top 250), this definitely deserves a place even higher than it's been rated. I would have liked more time spent on the John Merrick's personal character.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"You have to see this. Even if you hate Lynch's other stuff, just do.","I adore this movie.From it's first scene I was captivated. I wish more movies would start with an abstract sequence. I rewatched that scene twice when I was done. It was hypnotic, delicate yet quite terrifying in a unique way.It doesn't disappoint when the movie begins properly. The stark black and white cinematography paint a vivid picture of industrial pictorial London. It feels like a fantasy but that's the charm. I think they did use Ultra high frequency so it's TECHNICALLY in colour, just the only colours black, white and grey. The effect is a crystal clear picture of a world that swings between immovably clinical and sordid.There is a fairy tail feel as Joseph is rescued from his cruel owner (not historically accurate, the freak show owner was a friend to Joseph, but who cares), built not from magic but a story of victim of a cruel nature finding tenderness.It would be so easy to make a story that felt exploitative, or trite or both with this premise but the handling is delicate enough to appeal to cynical pretentious teens (like I was) and find a real pathos, never quite losing its dark power.Perhaps I'm a little biased by the make up. It is endlessly fascinating to watch John Hurt in make up and listen to him speak in that magically refined yet impedimented voice. I thought the movie would just be unsettling and I was indeed quite terrified of the build up to seeing Joseph. The essence of it though is a dignified message of enduring humanity in a dark world that never gets mawkish thanks to a feather touch that rises only at just the right moment.It was the first movie to make me cry (excluding the Never ending story but I was pretty little then). It really is a beautiful experience, not surrealist exactly, but stylized in way we don't often see. It makes me wonder what other marvels Lynch could have given us if only he had been on a short leash all his career.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Majestic powerful affecting movie,"Majestic powerful affecting movie. The acting is simply superb. Anthony Hopkins, who would rise to fame a decade later in the chilling 'The Silence of the Lambs,' is brilliant as Frederick Treves, a doctor who initially exploits Merrick's condition to advance his career, but inevitably falls in love with the man. Likewise, John Hurt is so perfect as John ""The Elephant Man"" Merrick that I feel I don't even need to express how good he was! The famous scene in which Merrick, unfairly cornered at a train station by a mob of angry men, desperately cries ""I am not an animal! I am a human being! I...am...a man!"" is one of the great moments in cinema. I would consider this film to be absolutely perfect, but for the very end. As Merrick lays himself down on the bed, determined to sleep and die as a normal man, I would have been blissfully content with a brief pan to his mother's photograph, a pause of several seconds and a soft fade into black. However, we instead have the stars in the sky flying past the camera and, as I interpreted it, the spirit of Merrick's beautiful mother offering him comfort in his final moments. Perhaps I am missing the significance of this final scene, but I simply felt it was unnecessary.We shouldn't let this minor nitpick detract too much from the brilliance of the film. Afterall, it is not often that I am so completely captivated by a film.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
I am a human being!,"Even before I realized that David Lynch directed this film and was specifically in charge of its sound design, I immediately recognized his trademark background effects, which reminded me of the constant drone of old industrial machinery, from ""Eraserhead"", which he had directed three years earlier. Although my unfavorable review of the earlier film has received a mostly ""useless"" response from IMDb readers, I am not here to win any popularity contests, and that review stands exactly as is. To this day, thanks to ""Eraserhead"", a film I admittedly couldn't understand or appreciate, I can't look at a roasted chicken in a supermarket without wanting to throw up. Perhaps this was Mr. Lynch's deliberate intention. At any rate, what a difference three years makes as my reaction to this film was totally the opposite. That producer Mel Brooks had the vision to select Lynch as the director here was a stroke of genius. Brooks could see what I could not. That explains his success and my sitting here at a keyboard as a washed-up old geezer passing judgment on the actual, creative achievements of others.Although the subject matter and atmosphere of this film is as bleak as that of ""Eraserhead"", the visual depiction of Victorian England and the impact of the industrial revolution on the nation as a backdrop was fascinating, as was the unique and compelling story. While the true story of the real Joseph Merrick was fictionalized for the film, I had no problem viewing it as a work of fiction that was based on factual circumstances. It wasn't the first, won't be the last, and no one pretended otherwise.At one point, Dr. Treves (Anthony Hopkins), Merrick's physician, asks his wife, ""Am I good man or a bad man?"" This is one of the key questions of the film. Once he ""discovered"" Merrick and began medically treating him, was Treves more interested in the well-being of his extraordinary patient or in his own professional or social standing. If his priority was on himself, how were his motivations different from those of evil Bytes, Merrick's original captor, even if Treves did treat Merrick far more kindly and introduced him to British royalty and high society along the way? While Treves found comfortable shelter for his patient at the hospital, what good was that accommodation when he could not guarantee Merrick's safety from the torment of the night watchman and eventually of the very real threat by Bytes himself. It was almost as if Treves set Merrick up for disaster by failing to protect him from the terrible sequence of events that followed Merrick's admission to the hospital. In answer to Treves' question, I would say that the jury is still out, Doc. I'm just not sure about you or your motivations, dude.The cast was high caliber, but I felt that Hopkins and Bancroft, one of the most talented and versatile actresses of her time, were wasted in their muted roles, preventing them from demonstrating their true potential. John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller, two very experienced veterans, were excellent. Although the Oscars don't sway me one way or another, I will have to view ""Raging Bull"" again to understand how John Hurt lost out to DeNiro in the category of Best Actor. My memory is shot.This is a film that very effectively illustrates just how cruel humans can be to each other and how even the best intentions can result in disastrous consequences. While humans did not create John Merrick's horrible condition and while some acts of kindness at least partially compensated for overwhelming meanness and selfishness, he deserved much more compassion from us. Now let us go outside and practice in real life what we have learned today. Be kind.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The film is simple, but it is written and directed with the highest level of skill. The film is a very sad story of a man who was mistreated, and of course, such a film will be criticized as manipulative. I am not a big fan of 'sad' films that play with emotions. I prefer the dark, edgy mystery/crime films or thrillers that play with your head and not your heart, but I cannot deny that The Elephant Man is the best you can do without pushing me over the edge. It is honest, and that is a quality to be admired these days.

A deeply moving experience.,"When my wife and I saw this in 1980, we returned the next week and saw it again, the only time we had ever done that.  This is the very touching, true story of John Merrick (John Hurt), a Victorian Englishman who was born normal but became grotesquely deformed through disease.  Abandoned by his mother, he became the slave of a vicious entrepreneur who lived by displaying him in a freak show.  He was rescued by a doctor (Anthony Hopkins) who wanted to study him.  When treated like a human being, he responded and proved to have a very noble nature.  He eventually became a favourite among the members of high society for a variety of reasons.  The cast and everything about this black and white film is superb.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful film,"It is a great story, and it is well percieved and executed. There are many references and beautiful pictures. But one could have hoped that Lynch had gotten over his ""Erasorhead"" fever and grown up. It is annoying to see such a straight story infected with pop-surrealism. Another director would have suited this film.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tragic and emotional story,"The Elephant Man is a heartbreaking and touching portrayal of the life of John Merrick, a man afflicted with severe deformities. David Lynch's direction is compassionate and sensitive, capturing the emotional struggles of Merrick and those around him. The performances of John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins are both powerful and understated, capturing the humanity and grace of both the characters and the story. The film's focus on Merrick's internal journey and the way in which he is treated by those around him is both thought-provoking and poignant.Yes, David Lynch was the perfect director for The Elephant Man. His ability to capture the emotional depth and inner world of John Merrick was exceptional. His compassionate approach to the subject matter was sensitive and respectful, while his unique visual style added an extra layer of depth and meaning to the film. Furthermore, Lynch's direction helped to bring out the themes of humanity, tolerance, and empathy, making the film not just a biopic, but a poignant commentary on the human condition.Overall, The Elephant Man is a timeless classic that speaks to the power of humanity and the resilience of the human spirit.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
David Lynch was right! People should screen this movie every 4 years.,"It's very movie and will make you feel better about life. I think a lot of people would appreciate it with what we're going through right now.

The ultimate outcast,"In 1884 London, a doctor (Anthony Hopkins) meets Joseph Merrick, aka The Elephant Man (wrongly called John Merrick in the film) who was being exploited as a freak show attraction. Treves (Hopkins) tries to help Merrick (John Hurt) for the last six years of the latter's life wherein he becomes cultured, but he inevitably remains an object of curiosity, to high society as well as low society. Anne Bancroft plays a winsome entertainer who is warm toward Merrick.Directed by David Lynch and shot in B&W, ""The Elephant Man"" (1980) is a melancholic biographical movie, and understandably so, but Merrick's story is worth checking out despite the fact that it inspires pity. It calls into question the concept of beauty: Natural beauty is something one is born with and did nothing to acquire, but so is physical unattractiveness. Then there's inner beauty. The charismatic actress (Bancroft) displays both. Of course there's also inner ugliness, like the carnival huckster.A myth developed about Merrick's disfigurement that his mother was raped by an elephant, probably started by sideshow hawkers. The opening conveys this in an artistic manner, but it's not to be taken literally, which is why it's surreal. Meanwhile the factory scenes with the pipes and corresponding dangers exhibit the reality for workers in Victorian times.The score by John Morris is noteworthy with one piece being ripped-off for the moving parts of ""Platoon"" (1986), e.g. Elias' melodramatic death scene.The film runs 2 hours, 4 minutes, and was shot entirely in London and nearby Shepperton Studios, just west of the city.GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Disabled Being with Humble Value,"When it comes to biopics on the disabled, they can more often than not be used to display sympathetic narratives to make one feel guilty for their subject at hand. Sometimes they can be overly sentimental, but in the case of The Elephant Man, it's more than just that. This film is not only sincere in how it tackles its subject's life of prejudice and deformity, but also in terms of how any act of good will can overcome the harshest obstacles in life.The film follows the tale of John Merrick, a 19th century English man who was struck with a severe body deformity at birth, thus living as a circus freak and being bombarded with cruelty from people. Soon, a medic named Frederick Treves rescues John from his inhumane conditions to make him more accustomed to a better life, in spite of other people's prejudice. What makes John Merrick such a charming character is that underneath his rotten outer shell is a benevolent intellect who only wishes to share the same amount of respect as any other being on Earth. In addition, Anthony Hopkins effecting presents Treves as cautious in regards to whether or not he is really helping out Merrick or not and John Hurt does a phenomenal job emoting through the deformed face in order to believably present his character as tortured yet delighted by his fascinations in life, no matter how small they may be.As this film was directed by the abstract horror legend David Lynch, the film looks appropriately gloomy and dry given the classic Victorian environment. The choice to shoot the movie in black & white not only makes Christopher Tucker's frightening makeup look remarkably appealing, but it also recreates an almost German expressionist approach with subtle grays and cast shadows, though with less bluntness in the more calm moments. Some sequences are also told strictly through the visuals and sound design, and they manage to communicate the purpose and effectiveness in the narrative without coming off as distorted. Also, despite being more well known for his collaborations with Mel Brooks, composer John Morris lets his broken lullaby score practically paints the insecurities of the unfortunately morbid victim who has no real desire in life other than living as a human being, not as an animal.To some, The Elephant Man is a depressing cautionary tale about how hard it is for humans to accept others. To others though, it is a harmonious and inspiring story of a remarkable individual whose one wish is to live among the people normally. It's the heartfelt tenderness from those who care that can really make a difference to those of unfortunate circumstances, making this film a timeless venture through tragedy and emotional resonance.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

I do not really understand how this world can bear this type of human beings.

The poetry within,"A splendid film, as lovingly made as the cathedral its tragic hero constructs. The film works on the surface level of horror where the real monsters are ordinary people.

The film challenges viewers to look beyond physical appearances and see the inherent worth and dignity in every human being.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Accessible Lynch,"The main things that makes this film work so well is its theme and the way that Lynch, as a director, communicates that theme, not just verbally, but visually. The film loosely tells the story of a real man's, Joseph Merrick's, life. Luckily, Lynch understands, as do the best directors, that making a film is not about telling the facts. It is about communicating ideas and thoughts. As such, he does not confine himself to actual events, opting instead to try and communicate his own feelings about this man's life as he reacted to it.Merrick, the 'elephant man,' played by John Hurt (1984), begins the film already in a cage. He is a circus side show, only for the especially brave. His appearance remains unseen to the audience but it is so ghastly that the carnival owner treats him simply as a beast and he behaves as one. A surgeon, played by Anthony Hopkins (Silence of the Lambs), buys the elephant man from the carnival owner and sets out to rehabilitate him, once he realizes that there truly is a man beneath that mass of malformed flesh.It seems the stage is set for a miracle to occur. A little love and kindness, and the most deformed and hurting among us turn from monsters into men. At least, that is how most Hollywood films would go.This is where Lynch's brilliance shines. He never lets us forget that John is a human being, but that very very few other people see him that way. As Merrick learns to dress, speak, and converse properly in society, there remains no cure for his deformity and so he simply becomes the subject of another sort of disgusting carnival show, this time playing at high society but never really belonging.Lynch is the perfect director for a task such as this. His eye hones in on all of the ways that society, the surgeon, and the carnival owner all behave like animals toward Merrick. He sees the malformed human heart and holds it out for us all to see and examine. In the end we see that the film is not about transforming a near animal into a man, but about all of the ways that we, who have no outer scar, are deeply flawed within.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A powerful true story,"The Elephant Man tells the true story of Joseph ""John"" Merrick, a man so savagely deformed that he is part of a freak show, and he is called the Terrible Elephant Man. A doctor from the London Hospital discovers him there, and rescues him from his violent ""owner"". At the London Hospital, John Merrick learns that people do care, and the world is full of good people. This is a touching drama that teaches us acceptance.This movie was filmed in black and white to give it a classic feel, and it certainly succeeds. I couldn't picture this film being better in colour. Even though it was made in 1980, it feels like you're watching one of the great classics of the late 50's/early 60's. The story is very touching and it really makes you feel sorry for the real Joseph Merrick. The whole plot of the film, as well as dialogue between characters, is interesting and it draws you into the story.Anthony Hopkins is great as always in his role as Dr. Frederick Treves, the doctor treating the Elephant Man. John Hurt is absolutely phenomenal in the role of Joseph Merrick. It is quite simply the best role he's ever played.Overall, this is a classic movie that has a strong message of acceptance, and tells the story of a remarkable man who managed to inspire millions.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Excluding the different is a fact that humanity lives in every period. I felt compelled to fast forward the movie while watching the scenes where John was tortured and bullied.

This one is a tear-jerker. The layers of extreme contrasts in this movie make quite a strong impression on the psyche. For example the contrast between the gentleness and beauty of Merrick's soul and his horrendous appearance. The contrast between the kindness of Hopkins' character and the cruelty of some others. By the end you are wrung out. I believe Merrick is in heaven, in bliss and free from deformity. In the movie he quotes scripture flawlessly and I believe we are being led to think about that.Once I saw a computer generated face of how Merrick would have looked had he not had his disease.

A touching and depressive story,"The movie tells the tragic story of Joseph (John) Merrick who lived in Victorian England. As a biopic, it is focused on the relation between Merrick and Dr. Frederic Treves who saves him from freak shows and arranges a permanent room in London hospital where Merrick spends rest of his life. Except some deviations which probably don't affect the main theme, the movie in general sticks to the historical facts. Anthony Hopkins displays a superb performance as Dr. Treves who finds himself in a moral dilemma: his humane approach to help Merrick from the cruelties of outside world is counterbalanced by his scientific curiosity which drives him to study Merrick's abnormal physical condition and exhibit him in conferences reminiscent of despicable freak shows. In comparison to the pictures of actual J. Merrick of his time, the makeup artist does a phenomenal job on John Hurt to recreate Merrick's disfigured appearance. The fact that all this happens in a pre-CGI era further adds to the value of the work. Finally, John Hurt delivers a top notch performance in a difficult acting job where he successfully plays Merrick's physical impediments along with his mental and psychological state.On the negative side, the pace of the movie is a bit slow and the narrative is quite depressing which is deliberately aided by the black and white shooting of the movie. Merrick's physical condition and the resulting mental burden on himself get us all moving but can't carry the movie for 2 hrs alone. The surrounding stories involving his abuse by his ""manager"" and others, the curiosity he evokes in London high society lack in human drama and tension. The subplots of these stories are bland and too weak to pick up the crawling tempo. Finally, the movie is very categorical in displaying the attitude of people towards Merrick. Overall, we are exposed to three types of people of the time: those living underground and suffer silently due to their freakish appearance sympathize with him; the general public react very cruelly on streets and pubs towards Merrick; the concert going, educated, higher class elites on the other hand are benevolent and behave more accommodating.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Terrific masterpiece!,"Joseph Merrick, the man once known as ""The Elephant Man"" due to his terrible deformities, is definitely one of the icons of the Victorian age, as his sad story is an example of how terrible can we be with people with physical differences. Right after his surrealist debut with the ""Eraserhead"", David Lynch was asked by producer Mel Brooks to direct a film based on the life of Joseph Merrick as written by Merrick's doctor, Sir Frederick Treves. Brooks was so amazed by Lynch's debut that he wanted that bizarre and unique sensibility to tell the story of the bizarre and unique life of Joseph Merrick, ""The Elephant Man"".The movie follows Merrick's (played by John Hurt) life in a relatively faithful way, from the time that Sir Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) finds him working in a Victorian freak show. After he takes him to the hospital, Treves will discover that behind ""The Elephant Man"", there is a human being that deserves to live with the same dignity as any other man. Merrick's efforts for having a normal life, his struggle to adapt to society and Treves' doubts on his intentions are the core story of Lynch's film.Director David Lynch is probably more known for his surrealist works, so ""The Elephant Man""'s harsh realism may come as something unexpected to people more familiar with his later work. Still, the movie contains small but noticeable elements of what would become the director's trademarks, such as the nightmarish surrealism and the dreamlike atmosphere. The film's beautiful black and white cinematography gives the movie a look reminiscent of the early silent films that perfectly sets the stage for the events presented on film.The story unfolds with good rhythm and pacing, it is surprisingly accurate to the real story (albeit it does have some alterations) and while many have labeled it as emotionally manipulative, it is hard to think of a different way to present this story. The script focuses on Merrick's life under the care of Sir Treves, and the friendship that grew between them. It is a very moving and powerful story and the way it is adapted to the big screen is remarkable.While Lynch and his team deserve credit for the success of this film, the cast is what definitely makes the film a masterpiece. John Hurt makes an inspired performance as Merrick and portrays the emotion and passion of this man who ironically, was unable to express emotions in his face. It is definitely one of the best performances of that decade. Anthony Hopkins as Sir Frederick Treves is, as usual, very effective in his role and gives proper balance to Merrick's part. John Gielgud and Anne Bancroft complete the cast and are equally superb in their small roles.The film is completely flawless and even people usually turned off by Lynch's bizarre film-making style will probably enjoy this atypical work from the American director. What in other hands may had ended up as a blatant exercise in emotional manipulation, here is a subtle yet very powerful and moving portrait of a man who had a tragic life, and that despite of this, he still could find something to hang on.Merrick was a prisoner in his own flesh, and the people that could saw past his appearance discovered a brilliant young man with ideas, dreams and ambitions like any other normal man. Lynch has captured this real life example of courage and turned it into a masterpiece of cinema. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Simple Yet Moving Tale,"This movie is impactful and empathetic. The story is about a deformed man, John Merrick who is exploited as a freak show.

Powerful tale of a man who was treated like a monster,"The Elephant Man is a film that tells a heavily-altered version of the true story of Joseph Merrick, a severely disfigured man who became somewhat famous in Victorian London. I know they played a bit fast-and-loose with the truth when making this film because I went down a deep internet rabbit hole reading up on this man's life after watching the film. That is typically a good sign that a biopic connected with me, when I am so touched by the story that I want to know more. It's hard not to get emotionally invested in a tale like this, particularly when we see an innocent man treated with such indignity through no fault of his own. I was hooked by the story even though it's a somewhat familiar tale. I thought the cast all did a wonderful job, especially John Hurt who had to perform with those complicated prosthetics. The villains of the story might have been a bit exaggerated, but otherwise I thought the character work was delightful.Perhaps the most intriguing part of the film is when Anthony Hopkins's character is forced to look at what he is doing for his friend, and questions whether he has actually improved his situation. It makes you think a bit more about what is happening, and calls into question how people sometimes take advantage of those less fortunate than themselves. At first, I thought they might avoid ever showing us the appearance of John Merrick, and allow our imaginations to fill in the gaps, but I think the choice to present it with extreme makeup effects worked well for the kind of story they wanted to tell. Keeping him in the dark or off-screen would have dehumanized him too much, and the entire film is about showing that there was a human underneath the mask. I usually struggle to understand why modern filmmakers choose to shoot in black-and-white, and this film was no exception. I suppose it might have added to the old-timey quality of this story, but it never felt necessary. That being said, it's a high-quality film that had me on an emotional roller coaster for the full 2 hours.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The elephant man,"The film uses an extreme situation to experiment with social maturity and tolerance. England was known as a gentleman in Victorian times, and this film shows us that most gentlemen are just fake, hypocritical and mean, even the doctor in the first half. The transformation of doctors, the introspection of doctors, shows that there is hope in this society, and the film is not completely revealing and criticizing.What impressed me most is a sentence said by John: people are nervous and afraid of things they don't know. This explains the attitudes and causes of most people in society. When John finally signed his name in the church he built and made a voice saying that he was not an animal but a human being, John realized his dignity and existence as a human being and began to work hard to defend his rights. John realized that he was not alone because of the help and love that the doctor and the dwarfs had given him. Let people see, in the general hypocrisy of the society there is always a kind of warm force, although not strong enough, but enough to illuminate John's heart.

Society's inability to accept,"David Lynch's second film is held up as one of his best, but I think it's hampered a bit in a couple of spots that keeps it from greatness. There are wonderful performances from an incredible cast throughout, the production is amazing to simply look at, and the makeup effects are great, but there are also some dramatic moments introduced that feel wrong to me and the use of industrialization as a motif feels out of place where, in Eraserhead, they had felt incredibly appropriate.The story of the historical elephant man, Joseph Merrick (whom they call John, probably because of the source text written by...the man who treated him in the hospital) and his time in the London Hospital under the care of the doctor Frederick Treves, The Elephant Man is about a man who can only ever be an outsider trying to find his place in society. Hobbled by deformities across his entire body, most grotesquely on his head and face, Merrick can never be seen by society as large as any more than a freak.When Treves discovers Merrick, Merrick is a sideshow attraction under the management (perhaps ownership) of Mr. Bytes , a brutal drunk who's been struggling to maintain his existence because Merrick is so deformed as to upset local authorities. Taken into a dirty back alley, Treves sees Merrick for the first time with Mr. Bytes giving his traditional introduction that includes the fable that Merrick's mother was attacked by elephants while carrying him, which, he assures the audience of one, is the source of the deformities. After Treves convinces Mr. Bytes to allow Merrick to come to the hospital for a display to some fellow doctors (mirroring the show in a more clinical environment) Mr. Bytes beats Merrick hard enough that Treves must come to provide his services. Due to the violence of the beating, Treves brings Merrick to the hospital as a patient, underhandedly without the permission of the hospital's governor because Merrick's condition is both untreatable (the deformities, which are not the purview of the hospital) and standard (the beatings, so he should be with the regular population). Through a series of events where Merrick demonstrates his intelligence through his slurred speech as he quotes the 23rd Psalm and news reaches Queen Victoria of the hospital's generous treatment of Merrick, leading to a visit from Princess Alexandra, Merrick gains a permanent station in the hospital.Where this movie works best is where it treats the different sections of society and their views of Merrick. We start the film with Treves as he navigates the carnivalesque atmosphere where Merrick finds his home. He brings him to the hospital for doctors to gawk at. When Merrick has to justify his presence in the hospital, Treves teaches him to put on a show. When Merrick gains his place, he gains a steady stream of upper class visitors who don't seem able to stomach the view of the deformed man, but they go for social status reasons. How different is Treves at a certain point from Bytes? Instead of parading Merrick around in a cage, he's keeping Merrick in a small room in the hospital and parading the upper crust of London society to view Merrick in the same way the lower classes viewed him at the carnival. Can Merrick ever become a normal member of society? These are fascinating questions.One way that this gets played out is through the night watchman Jim. Knowing his position allows him to exploit Merrick easily to his own financial gain, he goes to his local pub and brings along a dozen or so drunken visitors to gawk at Merrick through his window every night, making a pretty penny for himself in the process. The distinction between the carnival and the hospital collapses completely when Jim shows up, in particular when he shows up with Mr. Bytes who steals Merrick away. This section of the film, late in the running time, feels false to me. It doesn't help that it didn't actually happen (but neither did Bytes' (based on the real Tom Norman) general mistreatment of Merrick, and I have no problem with that), but this sudden kidnapping feels like a distraction in the story. I'm not sure what it's supposed to contribute, but it does end with the most famous part of the film when Merrick makes it back to London with the help of the fellow freaks in Bytes' circus. Chased by the denizens of London at the sight of his freakish visage, he shouts that he is not an animal but a human being, highlighting the central tension in the film. Merrick is a human being, but he's so disfigured that society at large simply cannot accept him as just another man. Uncurable by Treves, the only place he can be treated normally is in an enclosed environment with a handful of people, almost like he is an animal. There's the tragedy of the film. I think that I would come closer to finding greatness in the film centered on that idea if it didn't take that third act detour into Bytes stealing Merrick away.I mentioned it at the beginning, but as Lynch did in Eraserhead, Lynch intercuts images of smokestacks belching black smoke with the action from time to time. I don't really see the connection between society's mistreatment of Merrick with industrialization, though. It could imply a sickness of the world, but that sickness doesn't seem tied to the technological innovation brought on by the industrial revolution, instead reflecting a more permanent state in our souls. So, I sort of get the point, but I don't think it works. He chose the wrong image to make the point.John Hurt is kind of amazing through the pounds of makeup, providing a wonderful sense of pained humanity to the deformed Merrick. Anthony Hopkins is solidly composed as Treves. John Gielgud is kind of perfect as Carr Gomm, the hospital director. Freddie Jones provides a wonderful sense of humanity to the cruel Bytes. Lynch really does have a good hand with actors, understanding how to most effectively use them within a story.Overall, I think this is a good film that takes some of its departures from the reality of the story poorly. This is a cynical look at how society treats those who are unable to help their differences, how society at large simply cannot seem to find it within itself to treat someone based on their character rather than their looks. Some of the dramatics inserted distract from that central idea. There's so much to admire, though, that the late turns in the story can only hold this movie back so much. I can understand some of the long-standing love this film gets, especially from those who are less inclined to Lynch's more surrealistic impulses, but I just don't share it, feeling a certain admiration instead of adoration.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Heartbreaking movie,"The elephant man: This movie is based upon the actual statements of Dr. Frederick Treves from his time when he took care of Joseph (John) Merrick also known as ""The Elephant Man"". The fact that this is based upon real events just adds to the strength and sadness of this movie. The sheer story can shock and/or touch you when you here about it, but seeing this on screen, with such splendid acting performances, makeup and technical merits, simply just makes your heart ache with contempt and sympathy. The black and white footage mixed with the sad and sinister dark lighting gives this movie a gentle horrifying and yet at the same time calm mood. The music score simply enhances this emotional experience.I also like the way David Lynch has chosen to end/change some scenes, with this black fade-away, as if the viewer slowly closed his/her eyes to give the scene extra impact. We experience this alongside Dr. Treves and follow his emotional and mental states throughout the revelation of this dramatis personae; the elephant man. We feel sorry for John and pity him, but at the same time we sit curiously on the edges of our seats eager to get a glimpse of his face. We want to see him just as much as the customers we hate so much from the freak show. We look upon him as an attraction at a curtain point, whether we like it or not. We ask ourselves, just as Treves, ""Am I a good man, or a bad man?"" This is exactly what Lynch wants us feel at some point, he wants us to blame ourselves, blame humanity for the cruelty it possesses, and simply just respect John as the gentle person he is. Not to feel sorry or be ashamed, but to respect the humane content of a character. This movie is simply remarkable. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The mind's the standard of the man.,"Victorian England, circa 1886. A severely disfigured man called John Merrick lives a deplorable life as a carnival sideshow ""freak"", until he is rescued by a kind doctor and given a second chance at life.Anthony Hopkins is good, of course, being the veteran thespian he is. But the show truly belongs to John Hurt, whose character is more deeply human than anyone else in the film.I can't imagine what Mr. Hurt must have gone through, in regards to the several hours of make-up each day. He more than deserved an Oscar, but instead it went to Robert de Niro for ""Raging Bull"".The screenplay commendably claims to be based on true events rather than any fictional accounts; though in real life, the name of ""the Elephant Man"" was Joseph Merrick. Not for young children, the film is macabre and at times downright horrifying; it is also strangely poignant.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A film that makes us think and is worth watching occasionally.,"Director David Lynch died recently, and I decided to watch this film now, almost as a personal tribute to his work and legacy. I watched it many years ago and enjoyed it, and wanted to revisit it to see how I felt about it. It continues to be deeply impactful, moving in the way it forces us to think about disability, difference, and the enormous indifference and lack of kindness we often show to people like that. The film is a slap in our face, and in the respectable face of Victorian London. It's a thought-provoking film that makes it difficult to watch, which is probably why it's rarely shown on television. Yet, in an increasingly selfish, materialistic, brutal, insensitive, inhumane world, it becomes more urgent to think about how we treat different people, vulnerable people and those in need of support.Another aspect that makes the film more dense and introspective is the black-and-white cinematography. The choice may seem anachronistic, considering that it is a 1980 film, but the theme and atmosphere perfectly validate the director's choice. It is not merely an aesthetic issue, it is something that contributes decisively to the construction of the environment and the message that we want to convey. The construction of the set and costumes, as well as the selection of props, immediately transport us to the period and help us to become aware of the humility of that man and the brutality to which he was subjected for much of his short life. The soundtrack provides the final touch, with a careful choice of melodies, including Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings, used in one of the final scenes, and some famous pieces by Tchaikovsky.In addition to impeccable direction and a good technical team, the film features deeply committed and capable actors. The cast is led by John Hurt, who gives us the greatest dramatic work of his career. In addition to giving soul to the character, the actor perfectly mastered the difficulties of speech, movement and expression that were imposed by the costume and makeup applied to him. He is responsible for some of the most impactful scenes, as is natural, and some of the most quotable dialogues, such as the phrase ""I am not an animal! I am a human being!"", which his character exclaims, agonized and suffering, in front of a crowd that ridicules him. Sir Anthony Hopkins, living one of the most tender phases of his career, shone through the humanity and sensitivity of his interpretation. He is not just a competent and curious doctor, he is also a man of heart, with moral values and full of doubts about his own actions. The film also brings us Anne Bancroft, Michael Elphick and Sir John Gielgud, in short, a group of notables of British dramatic art.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Impressive and touching,"One of my favorite movies to date is the real life-based story of Joseph (John in the movie) Merrik, aka the Elephant Man, a 21 years old Englishman living across the 18th and 19th century (am I right?) and whose whole body is severely deformed from a rare and incurable disease. It may sound strange, for a director, wanting to make a movie about a so profound disgrace happened to a man, and maybe inappropriate, but the portrait furnished by David Lynch of this unusual gentleman is one of the most touching, deepest, yet most impressive figures the history of cinema has ever displayed. It's presented in a wonderful b/w photography which helps you get into the dramatic reality, into the sadness of its story. Anthony Hopkins is simply amazing in the role of doctor Frederick Treves, a man whose intents of study and knowledge of the strange disease he's witnessed will soon bring him so close to the very soul of the Elephant Man, and yet he's not really sure if he's acting in John's or in science' interest. The carachter impersonated by John Hurt has nothing to envy to the most tormented heroes of Tim Burton's flicks, but the actor's performance, his suffocated voice, and deep artistic sensitivity define his beautiful soul much more than his appearance. In the beginning, this movie is very hard to watch, due to the fact that the disfigured facade of the Elephant Man is shown in all its dramaticity and some more sensitive ones could find it...heavy. That's what happened to me. All I can say is that after 30 minutes of movie I was in love with both the movie and its lead carachter and now this film stands in my personal top list of all time. It really strikes some chords..... Beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Best of David Lynch - The Elephant Man,"I, like many millions of others, enjoyed watching the mesmerizing series ""Twin Peaks"" when it debuted on television several years ago. With quirky characters, bizarre dialogue and unusual situations, the series was extremely popular with viewers. But Elephant Man surpasses that effort by a wide margin. This tragic, yet courageous story, of a man dealt a bad hand by nature on the outside of his face and body, but who still retains his internal dignity, and positive spirit of mankind is truly inspiring and unforgettable. The entire cast from Hopkins and Hurt to Gielgud and Bancroft are just letter-perfect in their roles. It is a story and group of images you will long remember.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A compassionate, tragic look into the life of one unfortunate yet fascinating intellectual","The Elephant Man is a drama film based on the life of Joseph Merrick and starring John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins. Directed by David Lynch (Eraserhead, Blue Velvet), it is a compassionate, tragic look into the life of one unfortunate yet fascinating intellectual.In 1880s London, surgeon Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) visits a carnival in his local area and stumbles upon a freak show as its most popular attraction. While there he discovers that the show's main exhibit is ""The Elephant Man"" (John Hurt), a man with hideous birth deformities giving him an almost elephant-like appearance. Intrigued by this poor man's plight, Frederick rescues the so-called Elephant Man to learn more about his condition, only to discover that he is far more intelligent than his monstrous appearance suggests.Easily one of David Lynch's best films, The Elephant Man effectively paints a human portrait of the titular character and showcases him in the positive light he most certainly deserves. Despite being more linear than most of Lynch's work, the film still contains many of his directorial trademarks, including close-ups on eyes and flashes of surreal imagery. John Hurt gives a terrific performance in the title role and the makeup effects applied to his face were fantastic. Interestingly enough, this film helped serve as a catalyst for Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to introduce the ""Best Makeup"" category at the Academy Awards.I rate it a solid 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Must be shown in schools,"My view of the body/heart of people will never be the same after watching this film. I know this may sound stupid, but it was extremely hard, hurting, devastating to see all the abuse and discrimination a person can get just because of his appearance. Sadly, it made me think of how many feel dehumanized not only by their physical capacity, but emocionally.
By a lot of very sweet moments, the protagonist speaks and moves so tenderly I wouldn't think it's John Hurt behind a mask. There's just some deliciousness in the quality of the image in black and white that makes the film even more touching. This adorableness, in my opinion as a teacher, makes it a perfect movie for students to enjoy and learn the most valuable lesson I couldn't ever provide like the film can: everyone deserves respect, understanding and empathy, no matter how they look or where they come from.

I am not an animal...I am a great film!,"The Elephant Man is a classic film. Its great acting stands out extremely, David Lynch's direction is a marvel, too bad he didn't create more fascinating pieces. John Hurt's wonderful performance in the title role is indescribable. Anthony Hopkins' classy acting fits perfectly with the character, along with talents of Anne Bancroft, John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller and Hannah Gordon.I was touched by the film because of its storyline of drama, brilliant script, acting and music. The sorrowful and suffering life of John Merrick and the grand end of his life brings out the sadness in us all. At the end of the film, the music, Barber's 'Adagio for Strings', is a masterpiece, it fitted perfectly into the upsetting grand finale. I mostly enjoy 'true' films, when the plot actually happened.Overall, I suggest the film to be one of the best in movie history. It brought out the best in John Hurt, and the joy within us. With its outstanding cast, subtle and touching script, The Elephant Man proves to be David Lynch's finest.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Full of Surprises,"In one of the most memorable scenes of David Lynch's film, the protagonist, John Merrick (John Hurt) utters a remarkable sentence that, in a way, seems to reveal the gist of the story. He says: ""People are frightened by what they don't understand.""Although this may directly refer to his unique story and unique suffering in a desperate quest to be noticed as a 'human being,' this may also embody the motives behind liking or disliking this film. The dilemma revolves around 'accepted' or 'not accepted.'As based on the true story of Joseph Merrick (the film changes the name deliberately as the protagonist may represent any man), the storyline develops characters from the standpoint of the protagonist, the victim of his destiny, a pitiful scapegoat of the mob's undying curiosity and a grateful receiver of the open minds around him. John Hurt portrays Merrick is a very subtle way highlighting his suffering, his despair, his little joys and...perhaps the most discussed feature, his courage. Roger Ebert in his rather critical review on the movie quotes an American novelist Wilfrid Sheed who doubts the 'true courage' from Merrick since, what he points out, 'true courage requires a degree of choice."" What choice does the protagonist have in these circumstances and what choice does anyone have? Anyone whose condition is totally beyond one's control? As more or less courage a viewer can find in the character though, one thing is certain: along with the supporting characters of the movie, we grow perceiving the protagonist more and more as a likable, even lovable human being. I would not agree with Mr Ebert and his statement of 'pure sentimentalism' but rather see certain scenes heartily where, indeed, Merrick's sense of beauty and sense of subtlety emerge. The theater scene is, perhaps, the most important to be quoted here. There is also a religious undertone in him, namely, in the quotation of Psalm 23 which appears as comforting inspiration and 'his cathedral' which occurs to symbolize his quest for spiritual heights.Clearly, the most important character except for the protagonist appears to be Dr Frederick Treves (also a historical figure) played with sheer brilliance and precision by Anthony Hopkins. In all what he does for John Merrick, we see true doctor's charisma. He tells the truth...he is not afraid of a bitter answer 'No' to a desperate question ""Can you cure me?' Yet, as he portrays a man of good intentions and right deeds, he also powerfully depicts a man of doubt. In one memorable scene with his wife, we encounter Dr Treves asking himself: ""Am I a good man?"" This modesty of his character makes him memorable and approachable. It is, finally, him who Merric calls his true friend. This certain 'bond' between the patient and his doctor is compared to Francois Truffaut's WILD CHILD by Roger Ebert and, indeed, there are certain parallels that may be drawn. However, there is one prevailing aspect between Merrick and Treves: that is confidence from the start.Sir John Gielgud and Anne Bancroft need to be mentioned as supplying the story with charm and heart. Both portraying real figures (Francis Carr Gomm and Ms Kendal), they constitute an 'oasis' of kindness and understanding to Merrick. Ms Kendal, more to say, played delicately by Ms Bancroft, represents 'mother's care.' (consider the camera-frame of the scene when she calls his 'Romeo'). The scene of gift (the dressing case) stands out as an emotional resonance. Ms Kendal On the way towards contrasting those attitudes appear to be some intentional and unintentional 'victims of sensation' like a nurse who drops Merrick's supper in shock of his looks and the mob who break in and mock. The character, the evil character of course, deprived of any sophistication is Bytes (Freddie Jones), a true tyrant for whom Merrick is a mere 'freak.' He is undeniably deprived of any psychological approach, he is wicked in the very sense of the word, a sort of evil incarnate.Apart from the characters, the film's technical aspects may satisfy even the more 'pretentious' viewers. The black and white and the camera-shots supply the film with adequate atmosphere and powerfully combine the gloom of the story with aesthetic glamor of the Victorian times. Christopher DeVore's screenplay occurs as clever.THE ELEPHANT MAN is a film worth seeing because it depicts a story of any of us, it makes us realize how important it is to perceive others with love and dignity in spite of the fact they may be very different from the image we have created in our prefabricated perceptions. Fine direction, atmospheric sets, brilliant performances and a touching story.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Mesmerizingly beautiful!,"Can't believe I waited 26 years to watch this, and realize how director Lynch's career took off at such a peak. What a mesmerizingly beautiful and hard-to-fathom tragic account of deformed man John Merrick's fate in 1800s London. It wrenches out as much emotional sadness as a viewer can bear, but is very simple (sometimes too simple) in its storytelling structure. Its surreal dream elements are a good, welcome break in that matter. John Hurt gives an immortal portrait, and the images burn in effective, almost pencil-sketchy black & white. The similarities to Fellini's ""La Strada"" just adds to its likability.Man, that scene when John Merrick comes back to the London train station and is chased by a mob... as classic, haunting and heartbreaking as it gets!!8 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Timeless messages of the human condition,"The Elephant Man is a melodrama that convinces with stunning make-up, monochrome images and splendid acting performances. It's inspired by the true story of Joseph Merrick whose body was terribly deformed by a combination of different diseases that remain uncertain until today. Ridiculed, exploited and abused by a circus owner named Bytes, the young man is studied by an ambitious doctor named Treves who initially only wants to impress his colleagues. Soon enough, the doctor discovers a wonderful human being behind the scary appearance and helps him find a home and integrate him into society. However, Joseph Merrick continues to face ridicule by a greedy night porter, is confronted by the vile circus owner and struggles to accept that there doesn't seem to be a cure for him.This movie certainly makes you think about humanity. It proves once more that you can't judge a book by its cover. The Elephant Man is the most humane character in the entire movie. On the other side, the sensationalism, prejudice and bullying he faced back in the nineteenth century still hasn't changed in our society. The character trait that human beings tend to ridicule others in order to make themselves feel better is a horror you can still witness on the news every single day.The make-up still looks haunting nowadays and has aged surprisingly well over the past four decades. The fact that the movie doesn't use any special effects makes it look very realistic. The monochrome images provide a gloomy atmosphere that is equally ancient and timeless. The acting performances are particularly strong and especially John Hurt truly became one with his character. The film features some surreal dream sequences that prove that experimental mastermind David Lynch directed this movie. The timeless soundtrack enhances the emotional story splendidly.On the negative side, the film has a few lengths and takes some time to unfold. The idea to reveal the entire appearance of the main character very early in the movie prevents the film from building anticipation. While the movie is of great emotional value, it's missing some intellectual challenge as the story is easily predictable.If you are interested in the human condition and like dramas with moving messages, you should certainly watch The Elephant Man. The professionalism, detail and dedication put into this project by make-up artists, cameramen and actors is still astonishing. This is a movie worth to be taught in school to prevent bullying.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
a tortured soul with the heart of a poet.,"A beautiful film with stark black and white cinematography, brilliant performances from John Hurt and Antony Hopkins. The film has an old school 1940s style to it, with not a lot of soundtrack, a slight hissing sound, limited use of music and some amazing production design taking you back to Victorian England. The themes of the film are about kindness and cruelty. Mr Merrick throughout the film learns to recover his humanity, a tortured soul with the heart of a poet.The screenplay is also excellent and the film is superbly directed and looks brilliant in 4K.The camera movement is kept fairly traditional, avoiding a lot of handheld shots, weird angles or sweeping overhead shots in favour of a much more classical style you find in older films. One notable exception is a long amazing tracking shot in a train station. The sound design is also superb.This isn't just one of the best films from the 1980s but one of the best films of all time. Every cast member does a perfect job.If I had to say anything negative about the film it would be it does take plenty of artistic license with the truth.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A searing look into the depths of the human soul...,"I picked this movie up at my local video store without any previous knowledge about it. I was simply intrigued by the curious title, and the strange hooded figure on the cover it seemed to refer to. Not surprisingly, all the characters in this movie, are driven to find the answer to the same question. What is intriguing about this movie is its exploration of each individual's response (us included) once they are confronted with the truth.I will not be spoiling anything by telling you that he is hideous; the most deformed, deranged man you will probably ever see. So a warning to those of the faint of heart. The movie does a fine job of covering the entire spectrum of human responses, from obvious shock and revulsion, to sympathy and kindness, to exploitation and greed.I believe though that at the heart of this movie is clear humanistic message: that while superficially he may be different, he is still a man, and certainly deserving of anything that any other ""normal"" man is entitled to.Once you've can overcome the shock of seeing the ""ogre"" full face, and you look him straight in the face without fear, without disgust, are his eyes in fact any different? He is simply another human being, born from a mother's womb, capable of happiness and sadness, destined to die, no different in anyway except that he had the most unfortunate fate of being born into a most hideous vessel.While this is not a horror movie, it is certainly disturbing. But not in way due to the behavior or appearance of the elephant man (far from it ironically). Rather the disturbing content comes from the way he is treated by other ""normal"" humans.If your thinking well all this has been done before, your right it has. But I never get tired of it, and only rarely has it been told with such fine performances all around, and such searing truth. I highly recommend this movie to all, and sincerely wish more movies like this would come out in the near future.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Emotionally Exhausting but the Most Beautiful Film I've Ever Seen,"This may be the greatest movie of all time. I know for a fact that I have never been more moved by a film in my entire life and i doubt I ever will be again. I have never cried during a movie because I never find something on screen to be that touching. I learn to care about the characters and the story but never become attached enough to really feel it emotionally. However, I must admit that tears were sliding down my face at several points during The Elephant Man. I really fell in love with everything about this film.It is definitely a David Lynch film, there is no refuting that. It has his lighting, his eerie sound effects and his feeling of tension throughout most of the film. This difference between this film and his others is that it is a very straight forward story. Don't get me wrong, I love his weird and confusing movies 100 percent, but it is awesome to see movies that he branched out on.The story is breathtaking. I have to admit that I don't know the real story of John Merrick very well but I have read a little about it and it seems that at least portions of the film are, in fact, reenactments of things that really happened. I saw some pictures online of the real John Merrick and I have to say that they did a great job of turning John Hurt into the character. His wonderful acting only added to the dimension of The Elephant Man. Everyone else does amazing work in their roles, especially a young Anthony Hopkins who, I believe, was perfect for the role of Dr. Treves. I wish I could put this film into words but it is impossible. You just have to see it.I don't think anyone will have a problem with this movie and I think that everyone should see it. It is more of an experience than it is a movie so be prepared to be attached to the story and the characters.

Quintessential Lynch...,"FREAKS was the undoing of director Tod Browning; it touched a nerve, let's say. THE ELEPHANT MAN, not unlike FREAKS, touches a nerve or two, as well. And it's quintessential David Lynch. I was already a fan by the time THE ELEPHANT MAN saw release: I'd seen ERASERHEAD at several Midnight showings and had hunted down and seen on a college campus two of his shorts, THE ALPHABET and THE GRANDMOTHER. Going in, I was pretty sure I knew what to expect. I was wrong. Eschewing the surrealistic touches that made his previous endeavors so quintessentially quirky, he opted this time around to tell a straightforward tale of the Human Heart. ""Abominable things, these machines,"" Hopkins as Treves says when first we meet him, treating a burn victim: ""You can't reason with them."" In ERASERHEAD, the dark, industrial landscape through which Jack Nance as Henry moves is every bit as uncompromising as the Industrial England of Merrick's time. This integration of the Industrial with the Human would continue full blown in DUNE and, to a much lesser degree, in TWIN PEAKS- which boasted an ""industrial soundtrack."" David Cronenberg pioneered Biological Horror; Lynch, a type of Twisted Industrial Surrealism. (I wanted to see a Bernie Wrightson black and white comic book adaptation of THE ELEPHANT MAN, but, alas, 'twas not to be.)

A uniquely human story,"The elephant man is a subtly and fantastically realized allegory to our society and the way we personify the fear of the Unknown. In this movie John Merrick suffers from a horribly disfiguring disease that makes him look and seem like a monster, but beneath his seemingly repulsive figure lies a man of genuine knowledge and sensitivity. In this movie a young spry Anthony Hopkins plays a doctor seeking to better the living conditions of John Merrick but also discover the reasons behind his baffling medical condition. Though he is most likely the most redeemable character in the movie, one must question if he shows hospitality to Mr.Merrick merely out of kindness or wish to further his career in the medical field. This constant looming question functions as the dominating theme for the movie and makes us question ourselves and look at society in a different light, which is what superb movie making should be all about. a fantastic story from beginning to end, well acted, superbly shot, and overall a 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Haunting Human Tale,"The Elephant Man is a powerful reminder of how cinema can touch the deepest parts of our humanity.the film opts for a more restrained approach here, and it pays off beautifully. The black-and-white cinematography adds a timeless quality, making the harsh realities of Merrick's world all the more impactful.What I appreciated most was the film's refusal to sensationalize Merrick's condition. Instead, it focuses on the man behind the deformities, exploring his dignity, intelligence, and humanity. Hurt's performance is nothing short of heartbreaking; he gives Merrick a soul, making every small victory and every moment of suffering feel personal. Anthony Hopkins also delivers a strong performance as Dr. Treves, the man who saves Merrick from exploitation but struggles with his own sense of morality.If there's any drawback, it's that the film can be emotionally heavy-handed at times, leaning into melodrama in a way that might feel manipulative. But honestly, in a story as tragic and deeply human as this, it's a minor quibble.The Elephant Man is a masterclass in compassionate storytelling; a film that doesn't just ask you to sympathize with Merrick, but to see the beauty in his humanity.

A Wondrously Gorgeous Monster Movie,"This is a very early film in Lynch's professional career, his 1st major studio production following his much more personal, intimate and outrageously bizarre masterpiece, Eraserhead. That freshman effort is perhaps Lynch's most pure expression of cinematic artistryâ€”a fiercely idiosyncratic, absurdly inscrutable gesture of audio/visual mischievous of the most masterful kind. Contained within Lynch's debut feature length movie can be found the bulk of the sublime ideas and ingenious cinematic techniques which infused all his later films with such shockingly vivid & visceral emotionalism. Eraserhead is such a powerfully effective bit of cinematic wizardry that upon witnessing itâ€”no, upon being assaulted by it!â€”Mel Brooks was convinced that its mad genius creator had to be the director of the unusually odd film which he was producing, and thus David Lynch was hurled into the gaping, yawning, voracious orifice that is Hollywood film-making.Luckily, David Lynch had a magnificently talented cast (Anthony Hopkins, John Gielgud, Anne Bancroft, Freddie Jones, and of course a brilliant John Hurt) as well as a superb script (Christopher De Vore, Eric Bergren & David Lynch) with which to fashion his quaint Victorian period piece/archly Gothic nightmare monster movie. The narrative is strikingly concise and terse, almost bleak in its unadorned simplicity, yet more than ample to support the gargantuan mass of barely tolerable pathos which burdens nearly every scene. That's not to say it's a tortuous slogâ€”no, not hardly. The Elephant Man is only as emotionally crushing as David Lynch has astutely calculated we can endure, and it regularly assumes a surprisingly delicate & buoyant demeanor. In other words, it's an intensely disturbing, wonderfully rich & rewarding emotional roller coaster.Lynch's monster is a ghastly creature dwelling in the darkest, dankest recesses of the human psyche, and it's by dragging us kicking & screaming down to those formidably threatening depths that he's able to then kindly usher us to the shimmering splendor of an equally remote but welcoming inner realm where resides compassion, empathy & genuine humanity.It seems it's only by directly facing life's most daunting, most ugly, most horrific truths can we hope for any real joy, or at least any relief.

God blesses which they could see the human being, the person and the soul of Joseph God blesses to which they respected it and they did not make fun of of Joseph. God blesses to which they took care of Joseph. That God has it in its glory. That its soul rests peacefully.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bloody outstanding,An acting tour de force - a truly beautiful film in every respect.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""My life is full because I know I am loved.""","Lynch's iconic and sentimental story of John (Joseph) Merrick retains this sort of timeless majestic quality - partially because having only just watched Freaks you can see it's been done in this woozy 1930s throwback style and partially because of the disarmingly understated performances of both Hopkins, Hurt and the great John Gielgud. You get the unsettling nightmarish Lynchian moments too, but so briefly that it infuses the whole endeavour with this strange transient beauty. It's a great beacon of light and humanity but not without profound darkness around the edges.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
John Hurt and Hopkins shining!,"Director David Lynch is known for his unconventional approaches and his ability to explore the depths of the human psyche on screen. This film is a hymn to humanity that reminds us that we are all flawed, but that our weaknesses should not define us. Through the eyes of Merrick, a physically disfigured human, we see the beauty in difference and realize that true greatness lies in the heart. The film is a journey into the depths of the human soul and a passionate plea for compassion and acceptance.The story is loosely based on the life of Joseph Merrick, a man who lived with severe physical deformities in Victorian England.John Hurt shines in the lead role as Joseph Merrick. His portrayal is nothing short of revolutionary. Hurt gives Merrick a human depth beyond his physical appearance while conveying the deeply moving message that true beauty and strength lie within a person. Anthony hopkins shows his early talent as well. All in all great!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very good!,"The elephant man is a risky film, well accomplished and well directed. I have a great soundtrack, which not only accompanies the moments with sound, but also accompanies the soundproof moments you need and takes the film. Good script; although it has implausible sections, script holes and, clichÃ©s, that even at one point, the latter, at some point feel necessary to be able to transmit the messages. A final surrralistically well achieved by the autonomous nuances that the same film is being built and used throughout it. Great denotation of the moral, ethical and scientific ignorance of the time. There is also the fact of how to make films of the time, which must be taken into account when analyzing the tape. A very good performance by the cast. And you cannot ignore the literal and subliminal messages that denote the cruelty, apathy and capitalism of the human being, asking ourselves who is the real monster of the film? Him or us? 80% score.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Worth Watching!,"This was definitely a very interesting movie, and to think it's based on a true story makes it very touching.  There are many notable things about this film that make it so good.  I have to be honest though, I'm less than thrilled about the director.  I've now only seen two David Lynch movies and I hated the other one that I saw (""Wild At Heart"").  There were a number of things that I thought could have definitely been directed better or just seemed out of place in the film, but I'm not going to let that ruin the movie for me.  I'm very curious as to why David Lynch decided to make this film in black and white.  I know a lot of people love black and white, but to me it just seems to take away from the realism of it.  Also, to me it's basically having the technology to make it better and not using it.  But in any case, it didn't really bother me, I still enjoyed the film immensely.The story is actually very moving and it really makes you think about how much you take for granted in life.  The acting is just great, you can't really go wrong with Anthony Hopkins, and John Hurt pulls off a great performance.  I was very happy to see Kenny Baker in the film, he's probably best known as R2-D2 in the Star Wars series.  In case you don't know, he's the guy inside R2-D2 controlling him.  The pacing is very good and does a great job of getting you interested in the story.There isn't really much else I can say other than it's definitely a good film, and you should see it if you haven't already.  Oh, and I should also say something about the make-up.  I thought John Hurt (John Merrick aka The Elephant Man) had some incredible make-up on for the part, and it just really impressed me.  I hope you enjoy the film as much as I do.  Thanks for reading.-Chris",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
a sad story that unfortunately was real.,"The Elephant Man is one of the movies WHAT shows the human being is capable, film tells the story of Joseph Merrick, who had Proteus Syndrome that actually existed, the makeup is great, I am very well done makeup on John Hurt, the cast is John Hurt this great Anthony Hopkins, this excellent, Anne Bancroft, John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller, Freddie Jones, etc., the direction is one of the best film directors David Lynch (Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, Mulholland Dr), and he drives very well this film, one of his best work, he is a director who usually do complicated film to understand, and bizarre as Eraserhead, this film is perhaps the most normal of the director, the picture is great, the pace is moderate, even though only 2 hours of film, it is slow sometimes, but I found these two hours of good size, the Elephant Man is one of the best decade of the film 80, with a great cast and a very sad story, the film has a very good end.

What a sweetheart.,"Honestly, some of the most amazing acting you'll ever come across. Filmed totally in black & white for the purposes of Victorian, industrial age atmosphere.The strongest emotion I take away from this film is a sense of sincere endearment for John Merrick. On the outside he's nothing but a monster, but on the inside he's the sweetest, dearest and humblest person you could ever hope to meet. He's foolhardy, joyous, imaginative and grateful, and none of the things you'd expect him to have become after a life of such abuse and humiliation. No bitterness, anger, or the need to exact revenge, but a pure heart who's thankful for what his life has become, and to have found true companionship and friendship.The way the film juxtaposes a scene in which John Merrick re-enacts a high society event, pompously cradling a luxurious walking cane and cigarette in his hands, with the contents of a 'beauty' and perfume set strewn across the bed, followed by the intrusion of the contents of the entire after-hours pub scene just for the sake of a nightmarish look and a laugh at Merrick's extreme expense, emphasises the brilliance of this film in presenting the horrific rags to riches life experience of such an innocent man living in the shell of hell itself.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Very, very moving. Very good film.","""The Elephant Man"" is easily the most emotionally moving film I have ever seen. I try to not take for granted all the fortune in my life. This film really made me realize how happy I should be. I should be incredibly blissful, every single damn day of my life. I should wake up and realize how fortunate I am compared to the rest of the world.And I don't say this to show off. I say this because its completely necessary for us more fortunate than others to never, NEVER take for granted every single, wonderful thing we have.Some people can work towards being fortunate, others can not.The Elephant Man can't. John Merrick is a very deformed human being. Let's say that in this case human beings are defined by how well they live their lives given their limitations, how they treat others, how they behave...etc. In that case, John Merrick is a human being in every sense of the word.But he is treated like a freak, a clown, a toy used for the benefit and entertainment of others. And that is sick. The thing that is so heartbreaking about this film is the fact that is based off a book, a true story. Even though the story has probably been a bit tweaked, the fact that there was once a man named John Merrick who was deformed and was probably treated unkindly and even sickly is disturbing.We make fun of mentally retarded people today. We make fun of people who look or act strange. Is this human nature? I suppose so...but can we really call it human? The human race doesn't consist of all bad people...not at all. We have people working in charities, donating money, trying to find cures for terrible diseases. We aren't all bad. But please, realize that if you are a well bodied, adept human being, don't take for granted that their are many out their who are less fortunate, and can't do anything about it.This film changed my life.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Watch the women...,"The Elephant Man is simply one of the most beautiful films ever made.  I dont normally make such generalizations, but I have seen this film more than I have seen Star Wars and it moves me to emotion every time.  The most important thing that I have found about this film is its portrayal of the women in the life of John Merrick.  Lynch is often portrayed as a misogynist in the media and I really believe that one can gain a different perspective on his view toward women by interpreting his female characters through this film.  Only the women in the film empathize with Merrick, they are the only ones that can truly understand him and love him.  The scene where Mrs. Treves breaks down after Merrick tells her about his own mother is simply beautiful.  You can read it all in her eyes, as she thinks about her own children and feels genuine empathy and love for Merrick.  Bancroft's reaction is also without judgment and is purely love, as is the nurse (even though she may have disdained him at first).  I beleive that this film gives one a deep insight into the female characters in Lynch's other productions and is necessary viewing before any attempt to understand his art can begin.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Classic in many ways,"This is straightforward Lynch a la The Straight Story (1999), but with a keener, more epic and visceral directing. This was setup to be classic material from the start. The retelling of this popular, grotesque and intriguing tale, the deliberate use of Black & White, the extensive makeup, the complexity required on the actors. Well, Lynch didn't flinch.The people that got involved in the project were extremely talented: from the arts department to Freddie Francis chosen to do the B&W cinematography to fine British actors Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt (from ""I, Claudius"" fame). Lynch exploited this for all its worth and provided a beautifully made film with visual aesthetics, captivating lead performances and a story that seems to tell itself in a seductive, self-revealing way.Slightly uneven at times, the meticulousness of the picture always refocuses the attention to the story, the man, the monster: The Elephant Man.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Perception beyond face value...,"The skin at face value most certainly isn't everything, and Lynch's The Elephant Man wants one to be very aware of this. There are many different facets/attributes that make up something that is beautiful. It encourages one to think outside of the box when encountering something within reality. The soul is more than the shell. Digging deep under the skin could bring great rewards. Perhaps after watching this film you will see people, and creatures in general, in a different sort of way. Perhaps reality will unfold into a new light.This film is one of the most emotionally exhausting films I think I have ever seen. It is presented in stark black and white which fits quit nicely with the industrial landscape and subject matter. Without spoiling anything, the end had me entranced and in complete awe. It's probably the most riveting ending I have ever seen in a movie. After the movie had ended I sat in complete silence thinking about it all. It was extremely powerful. I felt emotionally drained but also enlightened.The Elephant Man is far more straightforward in comparison to other Lynch films. However, there is still Lynch's surrealism thrown into the mix. For instance, the industrial landscape of the town. I thought the cinematography and layout very pleasing.In closing, it's raw and it's powerful.

John Merrick's struggle for dignity,"How do we accept people for who they are and overlook appearances. These usually get in the way of how we judge other human beings. In the case of John Merrick, the visual reality was, to be honest, hard to overlook. A severely-disfigured face and body resulted in sneers, taunts and cruelty from ""normal"" people. It speaks volumes for director David Lynch that he took on the task of making this film, which he handles with great sensitivity.John Merrick was a man of keen intelligence and sensitivity, as Dr. Treves (played by Anthony Hopkins) was to learn. Anthony Hopkins is excellent in the character of Treves, the polar opposite of Hannibal Lecter. Treves initially dismisses him as an idiot but soon finds out that nothing could be further from the truth. Merrick shows his intelligence when he spontaneously recites the 23rd psalm. If this is true to life, it is incredible that Merrick, portrayed by John Hurt, did not carry a burden of bitterness and sadness. He was forced to go out into the public with a hood covering his head, which had grown to grotesque proportions over his short lifetime.It speaks volumes for the men and women who took him in, gave him shelter and tried to restore dignity to his battered psyche. Beneath the exterior was an extraordinary man, who drew strength from the memory of his mother. This inspirational figure from his past allowed him to survive the cruelties he had to endure, including a stint in a carnival sideshow where he was exhibited to paying customers.The staff of the London hospital where Dr. Treves practiced thought highly of John Merrick and they did everything they could to protect him. The characters from the hospital include Wendy Hiller and John Gielgud, stalwarts of the British stage. There is an interesting cameo by Princess Alex, the Princess of Wales, who intervenes on behalf of Queen Victoria to keep Merrick at the hospital. The princess is played by Helen Ryan in a role she has played in other British dramas.The most heart-warming of all is the role of Mrs. Kendall, played by Anne Bancroft (late wife of producer Mel Brooks), who becomes Merrick's patron and most ardent admirer. Her introduction to John Merrick is a moment of total graciousness towards John Merrick, which we feel that he so deserves. There isn't a hint of the awkwardness from Mrs. Kendal that others display.The harsh industrial background of Victorian London and the plight of the working class who exploit John Merrick are realistically woven into the movie. Interestingly, it is the other sideshow ""freaks"" who understand his plight and come to his rescue at a very moving point in the movie.Social realism, for which British cinema and literature are well known, is a hallmark of this movie. But there is also a counterbalancing of hope and kindness that gives this movie its real strength.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A masterpiece,"The Elephantman, a film by David Lynch from 1980, is a masterpiece of cinema. Based on the true story of Joseph Merrick, a man with severe physical deformations, the film tells the moving story of a man who was rejected by society and yet distinguished himself by his humanity.The film begins with the discovery of Merrick by the doctor Frederick Treves, who tracks him down in a freak show tent. Treves is immediately fascinated by Merrick and decides to free him from the care of the circus and take him to a hospital to help him. The film then shows Merrick's slow integration into society and his relationship with Treves, which deepens over the course of the film.What makes this film so special is the way it shows the humanity of Merrick, despite its physical deformations. John Hurt, who plays Merrick, is incredible in his portrayal and manages to portray the emotions of the character in a way that deeply touches the viewer. The mask he wears to portray Merrick's deformations is also remarkable and gives the film incredible authenticity.The direction of David Lynch is also remarkable.

John Hurt's Amazing Performance!,"""I am not an animal. I am a human being."" These are the heartbreaking words that John Merrick says when he gets fed up with people gawking at him and comparing him to an animal. David Lynch's The Elephant Man is a hard-hitting story about a real-life person who is an outcast due to his deformities. However, Lynch who also wrote the script, portrays this subject matter in a more positive light. Themes of courage, and the fact that everyone is human no matter the circumstances are brought to light here. Prepare to bring the tissues, because this story is an emotional story and I can guarantee no one will have a dry eye when the end credits appear on screen.I will go right into the thick of the story. John Merrick (John Hurt), nicknamed ""The Elephant Man"" is a man with a wonderful personality, but is hated by the English society because of his deformed body. He was discovered at a freak show by a kind doctor named Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), and Treves gives Merrick the life and the treatment that he has never received before.The true story is a tragic and a heartwarming story. It makes you lose your faith in humanity, but then you believe not all hope is lost. There are caring people out in the world and the film gives you prime examples of these people. In addition to Treves, we have Carr Gomm (John Gielgud) who is Treve's understanding superior, Mrs. Kendal (Anne Bancroft) who became a wonderful lady friend to Merrick, and Mothershead (Wendy Hiller) who took good care of Merrick in the hospital.David Lynch is a great director who is known for directing very strange films. When the film opened, and the disturbing montage of elephants and Merrick's mom giving birth appeared, I became worried that the movie would end up being some odd take on this story. Fortunately, this turned out to be one of Lynch's more straightforward stories he told on the big screen. He took a difficult and odd subject matter, and turned it into one of the most emotional stories I have seen.The performances are fantastic up and down the board. The one standout is John Hurt's mesmerizing performance as John Merrick that garnered him an Academy Award nomination. He was always a committed actor, and that really shows in this film. In addition to his wonderfully horrifying makeup work, you believe that you are watching ""The Elephant Man."" You feel his pain and his emotions as he tries to live with his deformities in an era where people like him are not accepted. Anthony Hopkins also delivers a strong performance as Frederick Treves. He came across as aloof, but kind-hearted enough to help Merrick. The film does a good job highlighting the relationship between these two characters.If there are any criticisms I had to make, it would be with pacing. The film portrays Merrick as a man who can hardly speak then in the next instant, he would be quoting Shakespeare with exact precision. I had difficulty keeping up with the timeline, and it caused some confusion at times.The Elephant Man also made some history. People in the industry were angered because the film didn't get the proper recognition for its makeup. That caused the Academy, in the following year, to create a category for makeup. The makeup artist, Christopher Tucker did an amazing job creating the real, authentic look of John Merrick. The work put into the makeup was grueling, and John Hurt has been quoted saying this is the film that made him ""hate"" acting. That hard effort paid off! This movie is a wonderful, emotional true story about the man named John Merrick who went from a freak show performer to a man being recognized for the person he is with the help of some very good individuals. John Hurt's performance is one for the ages, and he has a bunch of wonderful supporting performances to work with. I liked Lynch's idea to film the movie in black-and-white. Freddie Francis's camera work is put to fine use in the movie. In a world with increasing darkness, The Elephant Man gave me a little hope.My Grade: A-",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Incredible, Unmissable true story!","I can't believe I haven't seen this one until today, especially since it's also staring a young Anthony Hopkins, in an age he wasn't yet certain he's as brilliant as he is. One of the best dramas I have ever seen, if not the best. I can't remember one in which I cried more than to this one, except the anime Little Princess Sara (ShÃ´kÃ´jo SÃªra) and La Rose de Versailles (Berusaiyu no bara). And I think I would know because drama is my favorite genre! But those 2 anime weren't stories captured in 2 hours, but in more than a dozen!It's made in the crude ways of the 70's but even so, it's eviscerating at times. The most eviscerating fact is that it's made after a real story!! What!? Yes. A real story. Google wikipedia: Joseph Merrick - and you'll find it! Not that wiki can be considered fact but I don't think it lies in this particular matter. This is a man who's life needs to be investigated, and not for money. A little quote from wiki *Merrick left school aged 13, which was usual for the time. His home-life was now ""a perfect misery"", and neither his father nor his stepmother demonstrated affection towards him. The Autobiography of Joseph Carey Merrick: ""I was taunted and sneered at so that I would not go home to my meals, and used to stay in the streets with a hungry belly rather than return for anything to eat, what few half-meals I did have, I was taunted with the remark-'That's more than you have earned."" *The 1st time I cried in this movie was right at the beginning when he 1st sat on a bed for years and I realized he doesn't speak because he is afraid. I wonder how many people realized that before it was obvious. What's obvious is that this is a masterpiece people have forgotten, the most terrible sin of cinematography who's supposed to keep it alive forever.A beautiful poem written by this wonderful person, Joseph Merrick - The Elephant Man:'Tis true my form is something odd, /
But blaming me is blaming God; /
Could I create myself anew /
I would not fail in pleasing you.If I could reach from pole to pole /
Or grasp the ocean with a span, /

A Moody Masterpiece,"Am I wrong or is this David Lynch's masterpiece (which was only the second movie he directed!)? Many have commented on the great qualities of this film but I want to add one comment about one of the actors: Freddie Jones who played the evil freak show ""owner"" of John Merrick. Among movie bad guys, he stands out as the personification of evil for the sake of greed. An actor of lesser skills playing this role would have done an injustice to the entire film. Bravo Freddie! With this flawless production, one can feel the moodiness and dreariness of Victorian England literally dripping off the screen. Add to that the acting of John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins plus the supporting parts of John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller and the aforementioned Freddie Jones and The Elephant Man is one for the ages.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
unfortunate son of England,"When the dwarf said to John Merrick ""Good Luck, and who needs it more than we do"" it is a message that goes out to all who don't fit the standard norm society has set. Even today there are many John Merrick's who have no desire to leave the house in fear of being laughed at. Another movie displayed it quite well, namely Gilbert Grape. In this time and age when women strive to look like models and men toned products of the gym with perfect rippled torsos, maybe we should be more understanding and caring to each other and learn that every human is different. This is a movie who's message should be taught in school.My hat off to David Lynch.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Everyone must see this movie,Words can't describe my feelings after I saw the story of Elephant Man - I cried almost the whole movie. As I know the whole story is true - there is almost no fiction in it (as in Braveheart for example). John Merrick is simply beautiful. This is the most touching story ever filmed and it changed me a lot. I highly recommend it to everyone. 10 out of 10.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
About humans,"What Lynch does so well is that he makes you feel much more uncomfortable about all the other people than about the Elephant Man. This film is, yes, about human nature, human behaviour, love and acceptance, but even if we have a great perspective and really touching moments from the main subject, it especially says a lot about everyone and everything around him.John Hurt is totally unrecognisable and does a very, very good job, but what impressed me the most was the controlled performance by Anthony Hopkins, especially when he starts interrogated himself if his actions are not an extension or something similar to what ""bad people"" have been doing to Merrick.All the technical elements work very well with the story. The make-up is totally in your face, but all the visual elements are on a very high level and there is a strong and uncomfortable score marking the pace of this uncomfortable story. And if we talk about story, what a screenplay, with some unforgettable lines.If something doesn't work so well here, it's that I felt the first act didn't have the strength of what comes next (especially when we start having real interaction from both sides) and the script takes some safe and predictable directions at some point. However, it is never comfortable for the viewer.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A very moving story,"I think even I fell in love with the elephant man. To be so disfigured and yet so kind. I cried when the Jerk let his friends ""view"" the elephant man at night when they picked him up and twirled him around and threw liquor down his throat. And yet he never defended himself. John Hurt was magnificent as John Merrick (elephant man), and Anthony Hopkins played his normal, calm, cool, and collected role as the Dr. I also like the head nurse, because although she wasn't thrilled about him at first, she grew to care for him a great deal, a must see movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Beautiful, Haunting, Compassionate And Thoughtful","I approached this film with a bit of caution, knowing a lot about it and its reputation. I think I feared a shallow, 'we're all human at the end of the day' type of thing that would skip across the depths - a habit which has infected many an awards-laden film over the year.My fears were unfounded. I loved the remarkable cast; I loved the use of horror and science-fiction conventions to convey a story with so much humanity at its heart; I loved the film's willingness to allow strange, surreal sequences; I loved the allusions to pipes and steam and engines and the like, suggesting to me an idea that the more technologically advanced we become, the less human we are; I loved the reminder that Anthony Hopkins can act with restraint - a skill which he has seemed so reluctant to embrace since Silence of The Lambs (no criticism of that film, incidentally - more of a reflection on how he allowed himself to slip into roles written with less room for silence and subtlety); I loved the patience of the film-making.I found myself reflecting on my sense of being an outsider - a sharp issue for me; and also on my own tradition's (I'm a Christian pastor) habit at times of making a show out of 'healing', of treating a condition or a problem and not a person - an issue at the heart of this film in terms of how John Merrick is treated both by many in science and in wider society.A beautiful, haunting, compassionate and thoughtful triumph.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A great movie experience,"This is a very sad, uplifting movie. At points it makes you ashamed to be a human in seeing how we treat each other but in the end leaves you with a good feeling through watching the friendship between Doctor Treves and John (the elephant man).In the beginning we see images of a woman, we hear screaming and an elephant. Then there is great anticipation as Dr Treves is on his way to see what appears to be the main attraction of the freak show as people leave that direction in horror. I couldn't wait to see what it looked like, it seems as though i was no different then the freakshow attendees.When i saw him i was quite simply shocked. I'm not the only one, when the doctor sees him a tear rolls down his face. John can barely speak when the doctor takes him to the hospital, over the movie we see great growth and change in both the characters.However, the change doesnt happen with everyone. Most people still dont see him for anything more than a freak, and there are those who still try to profit from him, and abuse him. Eventual John stands up for himself, probably for the first time in his life.Later on we once again hear a screaming woman, etc. At this point i was wondering why it showed it. This just goes to show that over the course of the movie you get to know John and you completely realize that its not what he looks like, its who he is.This is one of my favorite movies because it looked spectacular. It told a very nice, and moving story. And it had some of my favorite scenes (when John breaks down crying and explains that it was the first time an attractive women was nice to him, and when he calls the doctor his friend).All in all, john is the ultimate example of someone who has been picked on. You really feel changed after seeing what he had been through, and how we treat people who may appear different.",,Anonymous,Biography
THE ONLY D. LYNCH MOVIE WORTHY OF VIEWING,After bad mouthing Mulholland Drive I guess I felt the necessity to provide at least one positive comment on an offering by David Lynch.

Although I had only seen it once, I must say that this movie had stayed with me ever since in my heart. It has haunted me, yet as a child it has introduced me to the notion of compassion in the best form possible. I remember crying through out the entire movie. Now, 30 years later, I decided to watch it again. Nothing has changed. It's almost too powerful to watch. I well up every minute. Finding out so long after that A. Hopkins is one of the lead character and that Lynch was the director is just a cherry on the cake. Never a movie has stayed with me for so long, and I am certain it will stay for ever engraved in my memory and my heart. Unforgettable.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unmissable...and heartbreaking,"A biopic of one of the most tragic people to ever exist, THE ELEPHANT MAN is a heartbreaking example of cinema at its finest. It's a film that uses the subject matter at hand to explore the human condition in all of its forms, so we get to see characters who are empathetic and selfish and everything between at various stages.This utterly poignant film - and believe me, you'll need to have tissues to hand when watching - is directed by David Lynch, who may just be the most obscure choice for a director that there could have been. Nonetheless, aside from a couple of book-ending arty shots, this is very well directed indeed and Freddie Francis's crisp black-and-white photography is something to behold.As with all good films, much of the success comes down to the actors. John Hurt is the real star here in a moving role that even outdoes his one in 10 RILLINGTON PLACE. He's unrecognisable throughout, and doesn't put a foot wrong. Anthony Hopkins is also very good, although as he commented his character is a little dull and doesn't have too much depth. There's also a nice bastardly turn from Michael Elphick, but really this is a film where everybody from the cast and crew is on top form.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
the elephant man,"David Lynch always used to be one of my favorite directors even if most of his movies leaves me puzzled. Perhaps ""The elephant man"" is his most easy one as after all Lynch only tells you a heartbreaking story. The elephant man is in fact John Merrick (John Hurt), a man who has been trampled by elephants and due to this, he is totally deformed. In the Victorian London he's a freak who's been used at carnivals for people to have a look at. One day Doctor Frederick Treves sees the man and decides to take care of him. John Merrick got a room in the local hospital but soon we'll see that the doctor invites all types of persons from the high society who want to see the freak, even if they all can cover it up like some tea-parties. Anyway, it looks like John Merrick got a sort of life in where he seeks the little pleasures of life. The real tragic is that there is a sort of battle going on who owns the freak, is it the freak show-owner or the doctor? What Lynch is showing us is to see who actually the freak is : the poor creature or the crowd who are so curious that they forgot there is actually a human being behind the tragic body? One of the more accessible films by Lunch for sure that got the full support from the public who were falling for this tragic story.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

I like many others in 1980 were just curious to see what this monstrosity of nature looked like. After I saw it with several friends, they all left in tears and talked about it for days. David Lynch does not borrow from the stage play in any way, but brings to life the clinical biography of John Merrick by Ashley Montag. 19th Century Victorian England is vividly brought to life in every detail from its smelly wharfs to dingy brick buildings.

Great lessons to grasp,"David Lynch's ""The Elephant Man"" is a masterpiece that evokes powerful emotions and empathy. By delaying the reveal of John Merrick's physical appearance, Lynch skillfully builds anticipation and sympathy in the audience.As we watch, we develop a deep connection with Dr. Frederick Treves, played by Anthony Hopkins, and through him, we come to pity and respect Merrick. Lynch raises important questions about our morbid curiosity and whether our pity is genuine or superficial.The film is technically stunning, with crisp black and white cinematography that recalls the classic films of the 1930s. Lynch's use of surreal dream sequences adds an extra layer of depth and emotion to the film.Every moment of ""The Elephant Man"" is heartbreaking, yet Lynch demands that we respect Merrick's humanity, rather than simply pitying him. This is a film that challenges us to confront our own emotions and biases, and to consider what it means to be human.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

David Lynch's perspective on human nature,"This is my first David Lynch movie and after watching it I was so moved, that I felt like writing about it The movie follows the story of an extremely disfigured man named John Merrick, who, managed by his proprietor Bytes, goes from carnival to carnival as a special attraction whom people would pay good money to see. After years of torment by Bytes, finally he gets the attention of medical surgeon and professor Frederick Treves(Anthony Hopkins), who takes an interest in him as an interesting medical case that he could examine to gather knowledge. Treves ends up moving John into a hospital freeing him from the clutches of the abusive Bytes. From here the story follows how John's life begins transforming as he comes in contact with more and more people and the people come to know that there is more to this ugly freak of nature than meets the eye.The setting of the movie is hauntingly beautiful. Most of the scenes are very dark and grainy adding to the atmosphere of the film with an apt soundtrack. The shots of the carnival, where John is with other disfigured people are very dark and have a negative vibe to them. The makeup on John is surprisingly well-done, so that you wouldn't have a hard time believing the reactions of the people seeing him for the first time. The story is at all times believable and never goes over the top. I personally found the story incredibly painful and was brought to tears at many points. The direction seemed flawless. In fact, after watching this I am going to look for other works by the director.At the core, Elephant Man is in many ways symbolic to actual life. It points out how being ugly is almost considered a crime in today's society and how everything and everyone is taken at face value. You can't be the strong and silent type if you are not good looking, then you are just a loner. It shows how people need to pity and laugh at other people in order to feel happy and to feel secure themselves. This movie shows the true and unchanging nature of the human mind. It shows how all individuals who are part of the society are the same in one way or another. Treves rescues John from the carnival just to put him on display in a bigger one. In that essence, he is no different than Bytes. In fact, every person shown in the film had something to gain from the freak and in that way they are all the same. The only exceptions are the poor disfigured people of the carnival. What they did for John was out of pure compassion and not for any personal gain. The movie makes it abundantly clear again and again that no matter how they tried, those freaks can never REALLY be a part of our society. This is the question the movie presents. Are they the ones who are the freaks, or are we?",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good but also disappointing,"My Rating: ***1/4 out of ****.David Lynch is a director that I am not a fan of, but he can make a good movie. The Elephant Man represents one of his better films. Theres no doubt The Elephant Man is a good movie, but I found the pacing to be quite slow. There were scenes that were quite interesting and sad but I couldnt help how slow the movie moved.However, I could look over the slow pace and see the strength of the acting. Anthony Hopkins is very good here, as a conflicted doctor. John Hurt is excellent as The Elephant, he was able to show emotion with all that make-up on too. Anne Bancroft gives a credible performance. The rest of the acting is good.The Elephant is well-written and technically stunning. The Sets, Cinematography, and Costumes are all great.

One of the saddest films ever,"Very few films leave me weeping like a baby, but The Elephant Man is one of them. It is about John Merrick (played by an excellent John Hurt), a man whose deformities are so great that he is even banned from the freak show at the circus. He is extremely badly treated by his ""owner"", but eventually ends up in better hands, with the doctor Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins).However, the film also raises the moral aspect as to whether Merrick is actually better treated in high society than he was at the circus. Indeed, some of the scenes where he is introduced to noble people are just as heart-breaking, and you can really question Treves' motives, but in the end there is no doubt that he is better off. Nevertheless, John Merrick remains somewhat of an exhibition item, which is part of why the film is so sad. Most people treat him kindly, but you can see that they are disgusted by his presence. In fact, every scene that Merrick is in hits the viewer like a punch in the stomach.There is something inherently symbolic about the character John Merrick. He doesn't just have an ugly face, but it also represents the ugly way people treat him. The hood over his head is not just a shelter from his face, but also the way he is sheltered from the rest of the world. And when he builds a small cathedral in his room, it is a fine representation of the way people built a fake world around him. At one point, the model is destroyed, and so is Merrick's sense of security.David Lynch has made many fantastic films, and I would be lying if I said that this was his best one, but what I admire about The Elephant Man more than any other Lynch film is the sense of judgment he displays. The film is of a quite sentimental nature, but not once does it feel overwrought or manipulative, and I give Lynch's direction most of the credit for this. Moreover, there are many gruesome scenes in the film, but he never indulges in them; they always seem to add something to the depth of the film. If I have to say something negative about the film, it is that the second half drags a bit at points. The terrific ending more than makes up for that though.Finally, one thing I have to mention is the cinematography. It is shot in stark black and white, and every frame is truly a wonder to behold. This, along with the superbly powerful portrayal of John Merrick, makes The Elephant one of the best films of the eighties.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Cinematic Verse,"The trials and tribulations of the elephant man, John Merrick, are ably exploited in this Mel Brook's produced film directed with style, insight into character, and humanity by David Lynch.  The film is a masterpiece of scenes that are woven together to display the polarization of humanity from the brute carnival ""owner"" of Merrick, the night porter that brings drunken friends to see the ""hideous"" nature of this sideshow sight, and all the other uncaring, unfeeling people in the world that show nothing but contempt for someone that is markedly different to the other side of a doctor that genuinely cares for Merrick, a hospital administrator and staff that work to make life easier for their patient, and an actress and her society friends that show compassion and friendliness towrd this physical deformity.  The Elephant Man is made in black and white, and this move is a stroke of genius as it is exactly the right medium to show the seediness of like in Victorian London.   No colorful streets laden with shopkeepers and the like as you might find in an adaptation of a Dickens work or a Sherlock Holmes film. Here we see the brutality of existence.  The drunken jobless people who delight in watching physical perversity.  The soot-covered streets lined with thieves and other denizens of law-breakers.  Lynch creates a film that can terrify you by showing us a side of humanity that we know is there.  He makes us not very proud to be a human being i his portrayal of the harsh, cruel treatment of David Merrick.  But humanity prevails in the end.....and Merrick's situation is resolved with dignity if nothing else.  I loved this film.  The acting is superb.  John Hurt gives easily his best performance as a man fraught with physical degredation and societal humiliation.  Hurt brings so much heart to his role that only the most cold-hearted will not be affected.  Anthony Hopkins gives another restrained yet brilliant performance as the doctor responsible for bringing Merrick to the hospital. Other notable performances come from Freddie Jones as a brutish master of Merrick, Wendy Hiller as a hospital matron, and a real nice performance from John Geilgud as the head of the hospital.  Each of his scenes is a showcase for his incredible acting ability.  The Elephant Man was very deserved of winning an oscar for best picture.  It's that good!",,Anonymous,Biography

Personally I cried...What is the worst, I feel, is that not so many things have changed since; we're still not accepting ""different"" people we've just become more subtle in our ways of showing it. Although there's no circuses anymore where you can see ""monster humans"" that doesn't change the fact that if the Elephant Man would live today his life wouldn't be a bit better than then. Maybe materially but he'd still be subjected to redicule and disgust.

I disregarded such descriptions and came to start watching ""The Elephant Man"" for pure enjoyment. Though what I quickly realised throughout and by the end of the film was this was a piece of art, a masterpiece, that was not supposed to be made for one's own entertainment. It personally made me question the ideals of society, even though the film was during Victorian times, it made me question the curiosity and harshness of current society's in their upfront disgust to those who are different, and not considered 'normal'.

This highly commendable effort results in a very unusual biopic, following the true story of John (originally Joseph) Merrick, who lived in Victorian England of the 19th century, severely deformed from birth on. The picture steers a highly emotional course. For one it shows Merrick's life as a human curiosity, exhibited and exploited for his abhorrent looks, with his abnormality being celebrated, his helplessness greeted with violence to make the caged animal obey. Degraded to a mere creature, the abuse is physical and mental. But we also get to learn about a person named John, his other side, as one among others, who earns our respect as every human being does, regardless of race, belief, deformity, or any other prejudices. As with similar films where the horror is not merely a fantasy of its creators (take for instance Tod Browning's ""Freaks""), ""The Elephant Man"" is serious material one cannot recommend enough to watch, as it will undoubtedly leave an impression. The way the soul of John Merrick is carefully unwrapped is just heartbreakingly executed, helped tremendously of course by the endearing performance of John Hurt. Anthony Hopkins as the doctor who harbors the unfortunate Merrick, fully delivers, as do Hannah Gordon, Sir John Gielgud and Anne Bancroft, who complete the supporting cast. There are very few movies out there which can offer you life altering experiences. ""The Elephant Man"" might be one of them.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent drama,"An excellent movie, though not exactly my taste in movies, it is unforgettable and a pretty strong movie. It's basically a movie about human suffering and how an individual can be completely excluded from society merely because of his/her physical appearance.It tells the factual story of Joseph Merrick, a man born Victorian Britain that began developing physical deformities when he was about five years old. By his late teens, his physical deformities prevented him from working as a factory laborer and instead he had to make out a living by selling himself as a curiosity. By the later years of his life he moved to a hospital and died there, at the age of 27. The movie begins by showing how terrible was Merrick's job as a living curiosity and proceeds to show how he moved to a hospital, which became his last place of residence.One can be deeply moved by Merrick's terrible life experiences in late 19th century Britain and France. Despite being a bit clichÃ© driven, I would recommend this movie for everyone which is not very weak of heart, however, as this movie is heartbreaking.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
One Of Us,"Last Thursday I was at a film class at Edinburgh Uni where the subject was the filmography of David Lynch. I'll spare you all the negative details but INLAND EMPIRE was a film so poorly regarded even its title would have made even the most cowardly reactionary in to a rabid anti-imperialist while I described Lynch as ""The windsock director"". Not to be too negative I did add at one point that I liked THE ELEPHANT MAN a lot. So I thought I'd watch it again to see if it was as good as I remembered. I was not disappointed by this tribute to the triumph of the human spiritMawkish ? Manipulative? Yes but also magnificent. I'm always the first person to be fuelled up on outrage when a film based on real life events has to constantly embellish things in order to make a ""better film"" but this film is so hauntingly beautiful on both a narrative and aesthetic level that any and every dramatic airbrushing is justified It's impossible not to feel sorry for the plight of Merrick .One should perhaps feel sorry for the film itself since it- BAFTA wins aside - was rather unrewarded upon its release . 8 Oscar noms but no wins. In 1980 Hopkins was a name actor but almost 40 years later his performance as the humane Treves remains a career highlight. It's impossible of course not to mention the brilliant John Hurt who as in THE NAKED CIVIL SERVANT brings a supernatural empathy to his character and manages to convey this character to the audienceI should also praise director David Lynch. Pithy , biting remarks in film classes is sometimes justified but one can't fault what Lynch has done here and thankfully he holds back on some of the abstract pretension that often dominates much of his work. He does bookend the film with this type of arty imagery along with the theatre montage sequence but this only adds to the story instead of overwhelming it. His talent seen here is amplified by the cinematography of Freddie FrancisIt's probably not all that difficult to make this big boy cry but it's not often a film brings tears to my cheeks. This is down to the mind-set I have of ""It's only a movie"" but THE ELEPHANT MAN achieved this which says a lot to its haunting powerful beauty",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lynch's Best Work in a Serious Vein,"A Victorian surgeon (Anthony Hopkins) rescues a heavily disfigured man (John Hurt) who is mistreated while scraping a living as a side-show freak. Behind his monstrous facade, there is revealed a person of intelligence and sensitivity.First of all, Mel Brooks produced this? And was able to convince the studio to let it be filmed in black and white (which was a great choice)? Well played, Brooks. You deserve far more respect than you are already given just for this.Second of all, John or Joseph? The film calls him John Merrick, but apparently his name was really Joseph Merrrick. Why the discrepancy? Is he called John in the memoirs? This is confusing, and strange that (probably because of the film) he is now universally remembered as John.While this is not Lynch's masterpiece (that has to go to ""Blue Velvet""), it is possibly his best work critically. Obviously the Academy thought so. And apart from the fact it features a deformed man, there is nothing strange about the plot or themes. This may be Lynch's most ""real"" film, as even ""The Straight Story"" is pretty odd in a number of ways.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

If You Like Movies About Humanity,"I saw this film on video in the summer of 1985. Anthony Hopkins had done many things, mostly in Britain, but I remembered ""The Bounty""(1984 with Mel Gibson) and ""Peter and Paul""(1981 TV) and knew about ""Magic"" (1978) and ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame""(1982 TV). He was not yet a big star, but you'd never know it from his high calibre work. He gives one of his best performances of his distinguished career in ""The Elephant Man,"" regardless of his later Oscar-winning roles.David Lynch seemed to be making a movie about people, rather than just a strange story (as in almost everything else he's done before or since). Shooting it in black and white gave it both an odd feeling of authenticity, and a surreal artistic look. These are words and worlds Lynch is famous for.The movie is based on the play by Bernard Pomerance, which remains one of the most moving pieces of genuine theater there has ever been. Since the story of John Merrick is mostly true, with some dramatic license added, of course, it affects us even more. We can't imagine having to live a life with such deformity. We can't imagine how he did it. The film moves us by showing that there was a real human being much like ourselves in the body of a side show freak.In the play, the title character is performed without the aid of make up. Slides are shown of what he actually looked like, and we use our imaginations from there. In this movie, John Hurt is in full make up and prosthetics which is eventually shown on screen. Until then, we only see the other actors' reactions to his looks, which builds tension and piques our curiosity. Amazingly, both actors have an incredible task: Play a freak in human form, and to play a man in freakish form. Each calls for an actor of immense talent. You will not be disappointed.",,Anonymous,Biography
Useless Opinion #390,"Okay. Let's make this perfectly clear. If an elephant screws a human woman, the woman will die. Why?  It will crush her loins to death. Comprehend? Goooood. The Elephant Man is touching movie and all that garbage. It's not David Lynch's usual style which Is surrealism and complexity as it's more straightforward and is sort of shot like a 1950s movie. It does have surreal moments but they are very minimal. I like this one because it shows that despite being so hideous and so un####able a freak can still be just as normal in both character and looks. And the elephant coerced coitus scene was funny. Dumbo got his freak on. Yo yo yo.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
I'm so obsessed with The Elephant Man,"I so loved this movie and it will forever go on!I really hope that they would renew it, it would be so awesome! I know a lot of kids these days don't know about the Elephant man and need to know. He needs to regain his popularity back! I'm just saying it would be so so awesome! Perhaps they could do with a little vengeance, action, and sincerity in the new film. I'm just wondering who would play him and who could maybe produce this in the future. I know anyone who loves the Elephant Man would insist on this. It just needs to be brought back, some good old time movie but with a new presence of today's society and what other people go through now. There have been lots of body shaming and bullying, you name it. Just something to think about. I think this movie would just make a great impression on those.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A masterpiece about the triumph of a man against society,"This movie is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  It is the story of John Merrick who was severely deformed.  His deformity is a deformity of appearance and stature but not of the heart and soul.  This movie should remind everyone who watches it about the prejudice and ignorance of society.  Personally, I thought John Merrick (John Hurt) was more beautiful than any of the people who laughed at him and made fun of him.I knew this movie was going to be great from the beginning when Dr. Treves (Anthony Hopkins) first sees him in the shadows.  It shows a close-up of Anthony Hopkins' face and shows a tear form.  This may also have been a foreshadowing to how much I would be crying throughout the entire movie. Superbly made in every possible way, The Elephant Man will stay in my memory for many years to come.

The Elephant Man: A David Lynch film about the eternal triumph of inner beauty.,"It can rightly be said about ""The Elephant Man"" that all those viewers who did not get a chance to see this film in 1980 when it was released will surely have troubles trying to ascertain its sense of purpose if they decide to watch it in the present era.This because these days it is difficult rather impossible to find even a single film which has attempted to portray the difficult life of a man who was mocked by all and sundry solely due to an inexplicable deformity of his face.By making this film,American director David Lynch has hinted at the concept of inner beauty which counts more than anything else.This is the reason why the high society of ancient times wanted to be in the company of ""The Elephant Man"" as he appeared to them as an absolutely normal person who revealed more of his inner thoughts in order to lead a normal life.The Elephant Man is not an entertainment film if a viewer is able to read between the lines.It is a more of a social document about hideous old times which were truly horrible in which a human being had no qualms about making mockery of another human being for commercial,monetary gains.It was a tough time for mankind as people were always curious to know more about phenomenon beyond their control thereby wallowing in morbid curiosity Ã  la high society.The Elephant Man is a hard to categorize film which needs to be seen more than once to explore its hidden meanings and motivations.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Reminds me of the Humanity this world can possess,"Outrightly David Lynch's mind for cinema can be extremely gratifying and seemingly endless with oddball visionaries and tales of preferrably forgotten underbelly members of society.But with all the style and general controversy his films exude,There is no denying that he is responsible also for a film that contains the most realistic display of the brilliance of human kindness and humanity ever seen.I of course am referring to the amazing ""Elephant Man"" a film with dazzling acting (Especially that of John Hurt - Perhaps almost the greatest ever seen) and of direction (David Lynch - such style to burn)No film has ever made my emotions into a rollercoaster the way this film did in chronicalling a young mans disability and indifference (Particulary in Cruel unassuming Victorian London circa ""Jack the Ripper"") and the whirlpool of life's seemingly new and vast openings in portraying him as the most humble and truly admired character of the screen.Merrick's brave determination to defeat his bitter side showmans offences and become accepted and embraced into a class of his own deserving is a rewarding experience to behold.His Charisma and the impact he has on all around him make for him a true gentleman and hero,none of the likes of which i have ever seen.The scenes of stage reciting and the intimate partakings between Treves and Merrick are of high impact.Only those without a heart could not be warmed by this film.Anyone who has put down on those different to them and having viewed this film will certainly never feel well enough to raise their head again rest assured.John Merrick was not only a hero of his time,but a character who's spirit lives on 100 years later.This film and book should be compulsory study matter for schools worldwide,So many new understandings could be developed.Behold!!",,Anonymous,Biography

Timeless masterpiece of compansion and humanity,"David Lynch's ""The Elephant Man"" is a masterpiece of cinematic storytelling, a poignant and powerful exploration of humanity, dignity, and the transformative power of compassion.Based on the true story of Joseph Merrick, a severely deformed man living in Victorian England, the film is a deeply moving and thought-provoking portrayal of a life lived on the margins of society.John Hurt's performance as Merrick is nothing short of astonishing, a tour-de-force of physical and emotional acting that fully captures the complexity and depth of this remarkable individual. His Merrick is a being of immense dignity and courage, a man who despite being subjected to unimaginable cruelty and exploitation, retains a profound sense of humanity and compassion.Anthony Hopkins is equally impressive as Dr. Frederick Treves, the surgeon who rescues Merrick from the clutches of the cruel and exploitative Bytes (Freddie Jones). Hopkins brings a sense of quiet introspection and moral authority to the role, perfectly capturing the complexities and nuances of Treves's character.The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances from Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Kendal, the actress who befriends Merrick, and John Gielgud as Carr Gomm, the hospital administrator who helps Treves care for Merrick.Lynch's direction is masterful, using a combination of stark realism and poetic symbolism to create a dreamlike atmosphere that's both haunting and beautiful. His use of shadows, lighting, and camera angles is bold and innovative, perfectly capturing the mood and tone of this remarkable story.The film's themes of compassion, empathy, and the transformative power of human connection are timeless and universal, raising important questions about the way we treat others and the importance of dignity and respect for all individuals.The cinematography by Freddie Francis is stunning, using a combination of stark realism and poetic symbolism to create a visual landscape that's both haunting and beautiful.The score by John Morris is equally impressive, perfectly capturing the mood and tone of this remarkable story.Overall, ""The Elephant Man"" is a masterpiece of cinematic storytelling, a poignant and powerful exploration of humanity, dignity, and the transformative power of compassion.

Hurt is perfect,"John Hurt gives one of the greatest performances ever captured on film as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.

A Dr. Treves(Anthony Hopkins) sees him at the show and takes him to London Hospital for medical study. The deformities are so horrific that Merrick wears a mask in order to appear in public and the doctors who at first believed that he also suffered from mental defects are astounded to hear him reciting the 23rd psalm. While at the hospital, he reads and proves to be a talented artist, drawing sketches and even building a beautiful replica of a church. He eventually becomes so well known that Queen Victoria is told of his plight and arranges permanent care for Merrick at the hospital.His caretakers take him to an opera house to attend a musical and when he is introduced to the audience, they give him a standing ovation.

One of the most beautifully moving dramas of modern cinema.,"A modern masterpiece of style, grace, and thoughtful film-making; The Elephant Man is one of David Lynch's finest works.In Victorian England, a doctor discovers a terribly deformed gentleman being used as a side-show freak and takes in him hoping to give him a decent life in society.The Elephant Man is one of those rare films that actually reaches an emotional level with its viewer. Lynch makes this film with a truly dark and even bleak atmosphere, but this atmosphere gives birth to a kind of hope only the human heart could produce. Its sounds weird to describe a Lynch film in this way, but The Elephant Man differs from the stories of some of Lynch's more terrifying thrillers. Director Lynch does give this film some of his trademark surrealism, as well as some nicely hypnotic sequences. The style of this film is lavish, even as it's filmed in black and white. John Hurt's makeup work is astonishingly convincing. The music score of John Morris is beautiful and haunting at the same time. The conclusion of this film is one of the most elegant and solemn of cinematic history.The great Anthony Hopkins is terrific as always as the doctor that wishes to save the title character. John Hurt, even under a ton of makeup, is excellent as the films sympathetic and tender-hearted subject. The late Anne Bancroft appears as a theater actress who becomes friend to John Hurt's character.A magnificent film, quite unlike any other, The Elephant Man is a must see for all cinema lovers - the tender hearted of which will likely need tissues before the movie ends.

The touching story of a freak,"The elephant man is only the second film by David Lynch, but you can already breathe perfume of masterpiece. The Elephant Man (real name John Merrick) is played by John Hurt (1984), who uses his voice only: it's really unfair he didn't get the Oscar for this performance. The story of this man hideously deformed is touching and makes you think: who's the real monster, him or us? Can he be considered like a monster, he so delicate and appreciative? Or we are the real monster, we that use his hideous malformation to get money, or we that can't understand he's an human being? It's all more shocking because it's cinematographed (by Freddie Francis) in a violent black and white, full of shadows and twilights. Maybe, it remembers the shadow part of everybody. The cast is completed with Anthony Hopkins (who plays the doctor who saves and studies the Elephant Man), John Gielgud (the hospital manager), Anne Bancroft (the actress who grows attached of the Elephant Man) and Freddie Jones (the circus manager who beats and takes advantage of the Elephant Man).

One of the Best Movies Ever!,"""The Elephant Man"" is one of the most touching, beautiful, best movies ever made. It tells the story of John Merrick, called The Elephant Man because he had a facial deformation, and his quest to be accepted as a normal human being. The screenplay is wonderful; it shows two amazing leading characters, that face real problems realistically, a great storyline that evolves naturally, and lots of pain and happiness. The lines are very poignant and beautiful, too, as are the moral implications of this movie. The way this intelligent, kind, cultured man can't be accepted is painful, because you want him so much to succeed.Great part of the success of the movie is because of the actors. John Hurt gives a mind blowing performance, and one of the very best I've seen; his kindness is real, the way he talks is real, the way he walks and gets into the character is just unbelievable. You can actually feel his pain on your skin, such is the streght of his performance. His breakdown scene in the train station, is just a cry for freedom; and it sounds so truly a cry for freedom, that you can believe this is actually happening. Anthony Hopkins is very good, and he has a very good chemistry with John Hurt, that evolves during the movie. I think he underplayed is character, but it worked and let us focuse on John Hurt. The supporting cast is all very good, even if out shined by John Hurt.The soundtrack is haunting. It perfectly sets the dark, dramatic tone of the movie, and makes the movie have more impact on you. The editing is good, particularly in some of the scenes. The make up is the best I've seen; it's believable, and it must have been tremendously difficult to do, but it's simply amazing. Lynch's direction is original; I don't think he was trying to pull the tissues, if you know what I mean, but to show a touching story just focusing mostly on the actors, which works. I loves some of his shots, like the part in which John Hurt is humiliated by people in the hospital; it just shows you all the confusion and pain of the moment. The black and white color is dark, and it makes you just think about the story, without lots of color to distract you.This is a simply flawless movie that everyone should watch; it has an important message delivered without being sappy, great performances, direction, music and editing. If you haven't, go watch this right now. 10/10",,Anonymous,Biography
Powerful and just a dash of Lynchian Strangeness,"The Elephant Man is a powerful film. Photographed in dramatic wide screen and sharp black and white - it is visually stunning. It is dripping with period details, excellent costumes, and fantastic makeup. It also has incredible sets and location shooting that brings Victorian London to life.Some of Lynch's best visual material is here with an engaging but restrained camera that glides down hallways or sweeps along alleys. The stark black and white brings out the excellent lighting, and the rainy chill of the exteriors are particularly lovely.The sound design and music are excellent as well - Lynch always has a beautiful and evocative pairings of image and music. The smoke and fog of London, along with the clang and clamor of the industrial age create an atmosphere both hellish and haunting. You can see the leftovers of Eraserhead here.The story has to be one of Lynch's most sentimental. Besides a strange and surreal opening and ending moments (the most Lynchian pieces) - it's also his most straightforward. I suppose that may say something about what I like about Lynch that this one might be my favorite of his. At least it's up there so far of the 6 films I've seen. I think one of his best and most underrated strengths is believable sentimentality. That was some of my favorite stuff in Twin Peaks as well - when he dipped into the good vs. Evil and the quiet and quaint heroism of the small town.Here also is John Merrick's heroism quiet and affecting. It's a simple story of a man's dignity and perseverance in the face of an uncaring and cruel world. Hurt and Hopkins performances are measured and beautiful. They both deliver a lot of emotion through small measures that add up to an extraordinary effect.It's very strange for a Lynch film as it feels like perhaps his most commercial. Yet it retains his artists touch, a light dash of his surrealist dreamlike atmosphere, and his incredible eye and ear for putting sound music and image together in a mesmerizing and engaging way.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Shocked by the story,"The Elephant Man is a 21 year old boy with a lot of physical deformation and with a bad health condition. The boy is owned by Brutish Bytes, a person who uses it for financial benefits by presenting it in the circus as a freak, but in fact he is a freak itself. After a lot of suffering he has also some mental issues. But luckily Dr. Frederick Treves, manages to take him in care at the hospital where he works.This movie started for me with a lot of disappointment to humanity. The way John Merrick was treated was a shock to me, how animal people can be sometimes! Not only Brutish Bytes made me feel bad, but I couldn't believe that nobody at the circus didn't react.After Dr. Frederick took him under care, and after the way they treat him, a way that every human being deserve, bring us a different picture of John. In fact, the most touching part starts after the best treatment toward him. The way he reacts after the happiest moments of his life, made many wounds in my heart.The most touching movie I have ever seen. I have never been more disappointed with humanity. But when I reminded myself that this is based on a true story, I was shocked for 124 minutes.John Hunt had a great performance, too bad that Robert DeNiro had lifetime performance on Raging Bull that year.

You should try this!,"""David Lynch's 'The Elephant Man' is a powerful, poignant tale of humanity and acceptance, with John Hurt's haunting performance leaving a lasting impact.""A Timeless Tale of Humanity: ""The Elephant Man"" ReviewDavid Lynch's 1980 masterpiece, ""The Elephant Man,"" is a cinematic experience that continues to captivate audiences with its poignant and powerful storytelling. This film is a testament to the human spirit, exploring themes of identity, acceptance, and the complexities of the human condition.A Haunting Performance
John Hurt's portrayal of Joseph Merrick, the severely deformed ""Elephant Man,"" is a masterclass in acting. His physical transformation, achieved through elaborate makeup and prosthetics, is nothing short of remarkable. However, it's Hurt's emotional depth and vulnerability that truly bring Merrick to life. His performance is a nuanced exploration of a man trapped in a body that is both fascinating and terrifying to those around him.A Story of Contrasts
The film's narrative is a study in contrasts, juxtaposing the grotesque with the beautiful, the cruel with the kind. Lynch's direction masterfully balances these opposing forces, creating a sense of tension that underscores the entire story. The cinematography, handled by Freddie Francis, is equally impressive, using shadows and lighting to emphasize the film's themes of isolation and acceptance.The Power of Human Connection
At its core, ""The Elephant Man"" is a film about the transformative power of human connection. Merrick's relationships with Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) and Mrs. Kendal (Anne Bancroft) serve as a catalyst for his growth and self-discovery. These interactions, though often fraught with tension and misunderstanding, ultimately reveal the deep-seated humanity that exists within Merrick.A Commentary on Society
Lynch's film is also a scathing commentary on the societal norms of the time. The character of Bytes (Freddie Jones), Merrick's exploitative and abusive caretaker, serves as a symbol of the cruel and inhumane treatment of those deemed ""other."" The film's portrayal of the medical establishment's fascination with Merrick's condition raises important questions about the ethics of scientific inquiry and the objectification of the human body.A Timeless Classic
""The Elephant Man"" is a film that continues to resonate with audiences today. Its themes of acceptance, compassion, and the human condition are timeless and universal. Lynch's masterful direction, combined with the outstanding performances of the cast, makes for a cinematic experience that is both haunting and unforgettable.In conclusion, ""The Elephant Man"" is a powerful and poignant film that explores the complexities of the human condition. With its outstanding performances, masterful direction, and timeless themes, it is a classic that will continue to captivate audiences for generations to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Nothing will die.,"This is an excellent film. Set in the style of _Murder on the Orient Express_ this Tudor movie is a classic of XX Century cinematography. Director David Lynch known for _Eraserhead_, his first cult film, is at his best in this affective tale of a deformed man of aristocratic origins. He goes to the Opera, the Ballet, the Teatre, the Modern Dance production and meet many people on his way to the Patis M'etro. This film in B & W is affective: Effectively, it is smash, a hit in tenderness, a success in cash. You will love it. The other productions of Director Lynch, _Dune_, _Paris, Texas_, _Blue Velvet_ are masterpieces: Anne Bancroft, of the Bancroft family of New York City, is in her best role as the Opera singer: Not to be confused with the Hitlerian singer-machine from the State of Vaticano: You will fly away in it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful and educative,"David Lynch's 1980 film ""The Elephant Man"" is a masterpiece of cinematic storytelling that continues to captivate audiences with its powerful and poignant portrayal of humanity. This beautifully crafted film tells the true story of Joseph Merrick, a severely deformed man who was exploited and mistreated in 19th-century London.John Hurt's performance as Joseph Merrick is nothing short of breathtaking. His physical transformation is astonishing, and his emotional depth brings a profound sense of dignity and humanity to the character. Hurt's portrayal of Merrick's struggles, from his physical pain to his deep-seated desire for connection and acceptance, is both heartbreaking and uplifting.Anthony Hopkins delivers a superb performance as Dr. Frederick Treves, the physician who rescues Merrick from the clutches of the cruel and exploitative circus owner, Bytes (played by Freddie Jones). Hopkins brings a sense of compassion and empathy to the role, and his character's complex and often conflicted relationship with Merrick is both fascinating and deeply moving.The film's cinematography, handled by Freddie Francis, is stunning, capturing the bleak and unforgiving atmosphere of 19th-century London. The production design, led by Stuart Craig, is equally impressive, recreating the squalid and cramped conditions of the circus and the hospital.One of the most striking aspects of ""The Elephant Man"" is its exploration of the human condition. The film raises important questions about identity, dignity, and the nature of humanity, and it challenges the viewer to confront their own prejudices and assumptions.The film's score, composed by John Morris, is equally impressive, perfectly capturing the mood and atmosphere of each scene.In conclusion, ""The Elephant Man"" is a timeless and deeply moving film that continues to captivate audiences with its powerful and poignant portrayal of humanity. With its outstanding performances, stunning cinematography, and thought-provoking themes, it is a cinematic experience that will linger in your mind long after the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Sensationalism across English class society,"Yesterday I reviewed ""Spartacus"" (1960) and noticed that this was a rather conventional film (his last) in the oeuvre of Stanley Kubrick. The same is true for ""The elephant man"". This is also a rather conventional film in the oeuvre of (this time) David Lynch. The narrative is easy to follow, unlike for example in some of his other films such as ""Mulholland drive"" (2001). The black and white cinematography of Freddie Francis is in my opinion very beautiful. It creates the ambiance of Victorian England, without the nostalgia so typical of a Charles Dickens adaptation by David Lean.The story is about Joseph (not John) Merrick (1862 - 1890), a man with severe deformities. At the beginning of the film he is exploited as a freak in a carnival, until the surgeon Frederick Treves takes an interest in him.There are numerous films about freak shows, the primal one being of course ""Freaks"" (1932, Tod Browning). Also worth mentioning are the two versions of ""Nightmare alley"" (1947, Edmund Goulding and 2021, Guillermo del Toro). Each film has its own nuances. In ""Nightmare alley"" the freak is not born that way but the result of a degeneracy of his own making. In ""Freaks"" the freaks ultimately take revenge on their exploiters all by themselves.In ""The elephant man"" John Merrick (the film calls him John and he is played by John Hurt) is, as alredy said, saved from his exploiter by the surgeon Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins). John.One of the questions of the film is if John Merrick is treated fundamentally different in his new environment? In other words how much sensationalism is still lurking behind the scientific interests of Dr Treves or the tea visits of the well-to-do bourgeoisie? This question is made explicit by the head nurse (Wendy Hiller) and after that lingers on in the head of Frederick Treves himself. I think Mrs Treves (Hannah Gordon) got it right when she remarks that (despite the sensasionalism that me be involved) John Merrick is much beter treated then he ever was.Despite the remark of Mrs Treves Roger Ebert has a point when he noticed that the relation between Merrick and Treves is rather one dimensional, sometimes verging on sentimental. There are other films in which similar relationships are portrayed as much more complex. I am referring to films such as ""L'enfant sauvage"" (1970, Francois Truffat) and ""The enigma of Kaspar Hauser"" (1974, Werner Herzog).",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The Elephant Man, a classic timeless film","David Lynch's ""The Elephant Man"" is a poignant and powerful tale of humanity and compassion.

Excellent!...,"Filmed entirely in black and white I found this quite an interesting take on John Merrick's story. Of course a lot of poetic license is used, but the essence of the man and his story are there. I have to admit I love John Hurt's performance; I can't imagine anyone else getting that much emotion through so many prosthetics! Of the other performers, I thought Freddie Jones as the side-show entrepreneur was excellent also. Over all, although it does have its faults, I did enjoy this one; it's quite poignant in places and you find yourself really touched by John Merrick; a little over-long, but well worth a look.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.1/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Stunning but VERY depressing,"Movie based on the life of John Merrick (John Hurt). He was a hideously disfigured man in a freak show treated like a dog. A kind doctor named Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) sees him. He wants to teach him how to talk and behave and be accepted by society.David Lynch's second film as a director and it's incredible. It's easily his most accessible film and along with cinematographer Freddie Francis presents us with a gritty and grimy Victorian England. It was shot in black and white which fits the story perfectly. Hurt is wonderful in the title role. He was buried under tons of makeup but he still manages to convey what he's feeling. John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller and Anne Bancroft are wonderful in supporting roles. Only Hopkins was bad in his role.Nominated for eight Academy Awards and it got none. A great film that is rarely shown these days. I give it a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
We could learn a lot from John Merrick,"This is one of those movies that makes a person yell or talk to the television screen. I am normally a quiet person in class, but sometimes words find their way out of my mouth. When Mr. Bytes told Dr.Treeves that John Merrick fell down a flight of stairs I could not help saying out loud, ""Sure he did."" It is the type of movie that makes a person want to get involved. He/She wants to reach into that screen and punch the mess out of the people that are being pernicious to John.As the group of people in his hospital room made fun of him he looked dead and one would assume he felt that way. Yet, it is amazing, how in one part of the movie he says he feels happy ""every hour of every day."" When a person is having a bad day if they think about all he went through, what he/she is going through seems minute compared to the conundrums he had. Of course I know it also depends on the problems that person is having,but my point is, there is always someone out there who has it worse than we do. It doesn't mean our problems aren't valid problems, just means that there is someone out there who has it worse than we do.He wanted to be normal, but when it came to emotions, he was like everyone else. We all have insecurities. We all want to be loved and accepted. A lot of people have the fear of being abandoned, as he probably did. We're also eager to please the ones we love, like he was in the movie when it came to being good hoping that he might find his mom some day.I'm not trying to be heretic either, but it seemed to me there was an allusion to Jesus in the movie, where he says after completing the cathedral ""It is finished."" I believe we could learn a lot from John Merrick. May he rest in peace.",,Anonymous,Biography
A must seen touching film,"This is a brilliantly done film. It is quite raw and blunt about its subject matter, however, so it should not be viewed for ""entertainment"" purposes, thought he story is inherently intriguing. We must just sit and watch in curiousity and amazement, but in concurrence with extreme sorrow, as we are shown the brutality that john merrick must face as his reality. A smile from another human being, or even a pleasant greeting (which is something that we all take for granted), is treated by this man as the highest form of complimentary behavior possible.One of the best films that i have ever seen. It wouldnt be called a top 25 of all-time film by the public (though i may place it there), however, based solely on the fact that it, as i mentioned earlier, is lacking in terms of typical ""entertainment"" value. Even though you will certainly be immersed the entire way through. Ah, who knows! Im not expressing myself very well. Make it a priority to see this film.

Lynch Transforms a Great Book Into a Great Film,"The biographic drama The Elephant Man is directed by David Lynch and stars Anthony Hopkins, John Hurt, and Anne Bancroft. The film takes place in nineteenth century London.When Dr. Frederick Treves (Hopkins) goes to a circus, or to better say it a freak show, he stumbles upon an act that is titled the Elephant Man. He discovers the most hideously fascinating human being he had ever come upon in his entire life and wanted to study the deformed human to discover why he is the way he is. The owner of the man, Mr. Bytes, claims that his mother was raped by an elephant and that is why the Elephant Man is so monstrously deformed. Treves makes an agreement with Bytes to take the Elephant Man back to the hospital to do research on him so he can make a presentation to build his medical career for the Pathological Society. But as time goes on Treves realize that the Elephant Man is not an animal, he is a human, a human named John Merrick (Hurt). Merrick can speak, and read, and do anything mentally that a normal person can do yet his deformities make him unable to function in society. Can John Merrick live a happy life where he isn't abused, or will society not let him? The screenplay by David Lynch, Christopher De Vore and Eric Bergren was superbly crafted and very loyal to the book by the same name. The film is just a fascinating biography about someone who suffered so much in their life and how I as an audience member just want John Merrick to experience just a shred of joy in his life. The characterization of both John Merrick and Frederick Treves were brilliant, by the time I was half way through the film I knew each character and that allowed me to feel for them. There is really nothing wrong with the screenplay at all, no complaints here.David Lynch ploys his crazy directing style from the second the film starts with a flashing screen of a woman being raped and elephant sounds being heard. Personally I believe that Lynch is one of the greatest directors of all time and he definitely proves it yet again with this film. I love the way he takes simple shots of a street, it looks like a photograph that would be on a cover of a magazine. What is also great about Lynch's style is that if someone put a film in front of you within moments you could tell that he directed it because he is one of the few directors that have such a noticeable style. Alright, I sound like a little school girl. Besides the brilliance of all the shots in the film Lynch got great performances from his whole cast. Yet again, Lynch proves he is a directing force to be reckoned with.The editing for this film by Anne V. Coates I have some likes and some dislikes. Let's start with the likes. I really like the sounds put over the film to add an effect of creepiness to it, they appear in many of Lynch's films and I always love them. I think the way all the shots are organized is great but there are too many fade to blacks in this film. It sort of segments it and makes it tiring to watch. After every scene about there is one and it just doesn't feel necessary, a simple dissolve or another technique could be used that does not push the viewer out of the film.The acting in this film is very good, with a great performance from John Hurt. Hurt received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor which he very much deserved. If this movie came out in a different year he probably would have won it but he unfortunately was up against Robert De Niro in Raging Bull who delivered a masterful performance. Hurt played John Merrick brilliantly moving and sounding like he was deformed and while doing that he made it so he was a lovable character besides his hideous deformities. I love the scene where he meets Mrs. Treves, it is just so heartwarming and perfect. David Lynch does not make scenes like that anymore. Anthony Hopkins gave a strong performance as Dr. Frederick Treves who wants to be successful while not wanting to take advantage of Merrick. Treves struggle is not as major of an issue as it is in the book but still plays a significant part in the film and Hopkins could not really have done anything to improve it. Anne Bancroft played Mrs. Kendal, an actress of the theatre who visits Merrick in his hospital room. Bancroft plays the part fine but it is nothing too memorable, when thinking about the performances of this film the only person that will be remembered is John Hurt.Overall I give this film a 9/10, it is definitely a great film and one of the best of the 1980's. I would recommend it to anyone who likes David Lynch, moving stories, biographies, the 1800s, never mind I recommend this to everyone. It is always fun watching Anthony Hopkins not be evil. I guarantee that if you enjoy films that are not pure entertainment you will enjoy this masterful piece of art.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Beautiful film to watch,"""The Elephant Man,"" directed by David Lynch, is a profoundly moving film that masterfully explores the themes of compassion, humanity, and the struggle for dignity. Based on the true story of Joseph Merrick, portrayed beautifully by John Hurt, the movie delves into the life of a man who, despite his physical deformities, possesses a rich inner world and an indomitable spirit.From the very beginning, Lynch's distinctive visual style captivates the audience, immersing them in Victorian England's stark contrasts of beauty and horror. The cinematography, haunting and evocative, complements the poignant score by John Morris, which enhances the emotional weight of Merrick's story.John Hurt delivers a phenomenal performance, capturing the vulnerability and intelligence of Merrick with such sensitivity that audiences cannot help but feel a deep connection to his character. Anthony Hopkins also shines as Dr. Frederick Treves, the compassionate surgeon who becomes Merrick's advocate and friend, portraying a complex character who balances professional curiosity with deep empathy.The script is rich with thought-provoking dialogue that encourages viewers to reflect on societal perceptions of disability and the essence of humanity. The film doesn't shy away from the cruelty Merrick faced, yet it also showcases the kindness of those around him, delivering a powerful message about acceptance and love.""The Elephant Man"" is not just a film; it's an emotional journey that invites viewers to confront their own biases and consider the true meaning of beauty and worth. It stands the test of time, resonating with audiences on various levels, making it a cinematic masterpiece that should be experienced by all. This film is an unforgettable testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the importance of seeing beyond the surface.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of a kind,"Painfully tragic yet ... painfully beautiful. John Hurt plays Merrick as a dignified, gentle soul and Anthony Hopkins as his compassionate, paternal-figure doctor. Both profound as is David Lynch's direction and heart.There were some scenes that were quite confronting to watch but were needed to understand how badly he was mistreated.I'm curious if the real Merrick ever left a journal? Online it states that ""he managed to teach himself to read and write. But he wasn't able to speak due to his facial deformities"". I'm glad though that he did receive a permanent home and the protection of London society at the end of his life. He deserved this at very least. May he rest in peace.Edit: After this review, I did find a short transcript written by Joseph Merrick with a glimpse into his life.",,Anonymous,Biography
The Evils That Men Do,"Years ago, I saw the movie ""Mask"" about a boy named Rocky Dennis who had a congenital disease that disfigured his face. It was a touching movie and a bit sad. Elephant Man was more touching and sadder.The Elephant Man in this movie was a man named John Merrick (John Hurt). He was a circus attraction for the financial benefit of the proprietor and the morbid curiosity of the paying viewers. That is where Dr. Frederick (Anthony Hopkins) found him and took an instant interest in him. Dr. Frederick took him from the circus to care for him at London Hospital. But, were Dr. Frederick's actions altruistic or just as selfish as the circus proprietor?That's what ate at Dr. Frederick and it is something that has probably plagued everyone of us at some time or another. How many of us fixed our intentions upon doing a noble deed then reaped some worldly benefit from it just to then be conflicted about what we appreciated more from the honorable action. The heart is like that-- it sways to and fro and it takes our wants and desires with it.Naturally, in ""The Elephant Man"" we see unspeakable cruelty from incorrigible profiteers and ignorant jerks. It was something he would never be free from as long as he lived. But we also got to see true love and kindness that warms the heart and restores hope in humanity.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
an absolutely wonderful and symbolic film,"Joseph Merrick, commonly referred to the media (this film included) as John Merrick, was a highly sympathized and intelligent man of the 19th century. He was notorious for the extreme disfiguration of his body. It was almost sickening to look at his bulbous head, arms where one was large and the other slender, and the horrible bumps down his back, as well as many other deformations in his skin. Yet, underneath, he was actually one of the most respectable and wise gentlemen of his age. David Finch's ""The Elephant Man"" is a somewhat fictionalized film that overemphasizes the suffering that Merrick went through during his career as a sideshow attraction, but still maintains the point that you should not judge a book by its cover, or in this case, judge a person by his appearance.John Hurt was perfectly cast as Joseph Merrick. It's hard to see any real expressions in his face, because enormous quantities of makeup was put upon him every day of shooting. And it was true in real life that Merrick could barely even talk, or make facial expressions. All of the acting comes from John Hurt's voice. But he does it magnificently to make the film version of Merrick a lovable character. Anthony Hopkins was appropriately cast as the quiet, intelligent, and respectable doctor Sir Frederick Treves, who found Merrick and offered his services. There were a few other characters who were made to be antagonists for the film and did not, as far as history can tell, existed or at least, interacted with Joseph Merrick. But they were necessary additions to keep the story rolling.The film is entirely shot black-and-white, despite being shot at the dawn of the 1980s, but it almost seems appropriate. I myself cannot put my finger on why it works out so well. Maybe to make it all seem ancient? To make it look like all the black-and-white photographs of Merrick, who died long before color film ever came out? Maybe it was just a creative idea by the director or cinematographer. Whatever the case, it makes the film seem even more flawless and dramatic. The opening sequence did not make a whole lot of sense to me at first and I still don't quite grasp what Finch was trying to show, but once it get pasts that, then the whole film is understandable and magnificent. The final sequence of the film is one of the most dramatic one-character scenes in any movie I've ever seen.It is a shame that Joseph Merrick had to die so young, but maybe then again, it was his own choice to die at his age. Whatever the case, David Finch's ""The Elephant Man"" is a truly remarkable achievement and although not entirely accurate, is a film that shows us to respect a person based on their moral values, not on how they appear. Because even a person who was, no offense meant, as physically hideous as Joseph Merrick, they could be, as he was, a person of sensitivity and intelligence.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

It hones in on the fragility of an artist and lays open wounds that are hard to is driven but vulnerable and s set up to succumb to her art. Of course, rivalry is a given, and her rival does everything she can to put the screws to her. Unfortunately, the questioning of her own talent is going to show at some point.

A true gem in cinema history,"The elephant man is an almost immediately engaging movie based almost entirely on true events and people (and is fairly accurate as far as my knowledge of the actual story goes). The story is indeed quite a sad one which the fact that it was shot in black in white, and just the overall feel of the movie doesn't help. If you upset easy have tissues handy. I thought the acting was right where it should have been and was overall really good, especially for the elephant man. The only thing I could be somewhat skeptical on is that for some it may seem to move a little to slow and not really pick you up as the movie does draw a lot on having empathy and sympathy for John Merrick (the elephant man). Its a very emotional movie and to me you kind have to be in the mood to watch it. So if your not up for an emotional drawing movie it may not be for you, or at least not at the time. The meaning and undertones of the movie is a statement about society and how we react to things, the true meaning of beauty, how we think of things, and to me how terrible people can be to others who are different. It simply is a great movie, a classic that really should be sat down and watched at least one good time.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Character is the entire study in this film (apart, I suppose, from Mr Merrick's biography). Probably my all-time favorite movie, there is nothing Hollywood about it.

To this end, the movie seems quite bent round its script, which is an uncommon power, mature, and marking the limits of language with repetition --but in more graceful modes than the great woes which would bring Shakespeare to repeat a verse...

Humanizing the Elephant Man,"David Lynch and Mel Brooks sound like a cinematic partnership that teeters on the edge between the surrealism of a Lynch film and a gag from a Brooks film. Nevertheless, these two would work together in 1980 on Lynch's second feature, The Elephant Man. Simultaneously, yet separately, both Brooks and Lynch had interest in seeing The Elephant Man, a script written by Eric Bergren and Christopher De Vore based on the novel by Sir Frederick Treves. Treves book highlights the heartbreaking existence of John Merrick, whose severe disfigurement relegated him to a near imprisonment as a circus freak show exhibit. After making a film as polarizing as Eraserhead, Lynch wasn't exactly having to sift through many offers for work. Thanks to Stuart Cornfeld, a film producer who enjoyed Eraserhead, he picked a project that he thought Lynch might be interested in. After Lynch confirmed interest, Cornfeld, who was also an associate of Mel Brooks, took the idea to him thinking it would be a good venture for his newly founded Brooksfilm production company. Needing to be sold on the relatively unknown David Lynch, Brooks was advised to watch his debut feature, Eraserhead. Perhaps surprisingly, Mel Brooks took enough from his screening of Eraserhead to hire Lynch on the spot and put his full confidence in him to direct The Elephant Man. The chance Brooks took with David Lynch was monumental and put Lynch on the map. The Elephant Man was a huge success, nominated for eight Academy Awards, paving the way for Lynch to be able to continue his career in filmmaking. The partnership with Mel Brooks also allowed Lynch access to such a phenomenal cast including John Hurt, Anthony Hopkins, John Gielgud, and Anne Bancroft, Lynch had come a long way from selling newspapers to pay his cast. Despite many Hollywood producers being ill-prepared to properly respond to a film like Eraserhead, the artistic integrity was not lost on all, and the opportunity for David Lynch to flourish had just begun.One of the many positive qualities of David Lynch as a filmmaker is his ability to humanize even the oddest of his protagonists, thereby fostering an emotional connection between the audience and the characters in his film. Even the more minor characters in each of his films are given a human touch by David Lynch. Whether it's a distraught movie director who's casting decisions are being forced upon him, or a lounge singer embroiled in a kidnapping plot, each inhabitant in David Lynch's world is compassionately treated and given such human qualities, it is difficult to not become invested in the worlds he creates. Even in characters with such sparse dialogue as that of his feature film, their emotional essence is beautifully captured by Lynch. The audience is taken through a 14-minute trip before a word of dialogue is heard in Eraserhead, and after that, it's sparse until about the 30-minute mark. We are shown two socially inept individuals that seem to have little contact with the outside world. Despite their handicaps, however, Lynch shines a light on the aspects that make them similar to ourselves. We root for Henry and Mary, or at least want to see their suffering end, and that is credited to Lynch's ability to emotionally commit us to his characters. Lynch's gift of making such introspective cinema that allows the viewer to see at least aspects of themselves, in seemingly unrelatable characters, is invaluable. In The Elephant Man, Lynch's human touch was needed in multitudes to polish the animal-like John Merrick, who was routinely disregarded by those around him.I often think of The Elephant Man as Lynch's most human film. Perhaps that distinction should be shared with The Straight Story, the other linear oddity of David Lynch's oeuvre. Maybe it had to do with the plot-driven ""normal"" timeline following of these two films that kept Lynch from going too far out into the weeds. Whether it was due to the structure or perhaps the source material, Lynch didn't seem to hide the fact that he was putting a passionate, deeply moving bend to the story of John Merrick. In the first meaningful experience the audience shares with Merrick, played expertly by John Hurt, we see him isolated and alone, kept from having any interaction with people, only to be gawked at as the imprisoned sideshow oddity. Merrick is treated as property, solely because he looks different. He is completely commodified for someone else's gain because it has been decided for him that he couldn't possibly have anything meaningful to contribute to society. By expressly showing us the disregard of Merrick, Lynch sets the tone for Merrick's retribution that is to come. By the time Anthony Hopkins' Frederick Treves happens upon John Merrick, Merrick has been conditioned not to trust anyone, as every person in his life has abandoned him, beaten him, or gawked at him. Treves, however, is committed to helping Merrick, so committed that he brings him into his family's home to the shock of his wife. Treves creates the most comfortable environment he can for Merrick at his new residence in the Royal London Hospital. Lynch utilizes several long takes, focusing on Treves' face, to show the audience the depth of his humanity, and his desire for Merrick to be treated as a person rather than some sort of freak. This focus on Treves humanizes him, making his character another humanly in-touch addition to the compassionate world Lynch creates. There are a number of key scenes throughout the film where Merrick is seen constructing a model of the cathedral that he can see the top of through his window. As more people that come into contact with him ask about his model, Lynch creates a beautiful moment wherein he highlights the importance of each person's individual perspective. Merrick can only see a portion of the cathedral, just like those who interacted with him could only see a part of John Merrick. No one would have expected that Merrick had the soul of a poet or a depth of feeling that he shared for those important to his life. Each person only saw Merrick's disfigurement and assumed from his appearance that he could not possibly possess a great capacity for thought. Of course, this was wrong, but Lynch exposes the reality that no one knows all parts of anyone else. Just as the window blocked the view of the lower half of the cathedral, there is in each of us aspects of our being that are unable to be seen by others. Creating an opportunity for self-reflection, Lynch again successfully adds a richly human element to his film. In many ways, I was reminded of the ways people would interact with Dougie in Twin Peaks: The Return. Like Dougie, John Merrick was shown heart and affection by those close to him while being blown off or gawked at by strangers. This similarity goes to show that, despite there being 40 years difference between the two works in Lynch's filmography, he has maintained a commitment to highlighting and respecting the emotional elements of humanity.I have encountered many people who look down on The Elephant Man as ""lesser Lynch"", due to its coherent storyline and structure. It's not that these people don't care for the film, they just don't see as much of David Lynch's influence as in his other films. I've always been puzzled by this claim, as I see plenty of Lynch's touches throughout the film. The film is full of extreme close-ups of eyes, just like we see in Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive. The opening of The Elephant Man is incredibly similar to that of Eraserhead, both in sound design and sequences of overlaid images. The camera lingers, often longer than the audience thinks it should, which is something Lynch has done in just about everything he's done. What stands out the most as uniquely Lynch, however, is the nightmarish sequences of Merrick's abuse. Lynch is a master of the nightmare, creating terrifying, unnerving sequences that stand from all of cinema. Lynch also cultivates an environment of isolation, of characters that are always, even if slightly, trepidatious of the world around them. Like only he can do, Lynch creates a world that is ugly on the outside, but beautiful within, echoing the mindset David Lynch seems to apply to all of his films, that ""people are frightened by what they don't understand.""",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Truly outstanding piece of work.,This is David Lynch's most mainstream film but it still has many characteristics that can be found in his later films. The sound editing brings to life Victorian London and the black and white cinematography is also incredible.John Merrick played by John Hurt is a Victorian carnival freak attraction who comes into the care of Anthony Hopkins playing Dr. Treves who starts to question his own integrity as he feels that he too is exploiting Merrick's disfigurement for his own gain.,9.0,Anonymous,Biography

An unlikeley yet compelling follow up to 'Eraserhead.,"This tells the devastating yet highly rewarding tale of John Merrick, a child born with a deformed physical disease on account of his mother being attacked whilst impregnating him, and consequently earned the nick name Â‘the Elephant Man.' David Lynch's directorial follow up to Eraserhead couldn't be less predictable- this is every bit a mainstream film, with the occasional flash of stylistic Â‘Joi de Vivre' that occupied the entire narrative of Eraserhead (industrial noise, abstract/nightmarish imagery of deformed faces).  The film loses a hint of perfection on account of its' slightly choppy editing (and too many fade outs) which makes it feel incomplete, but otherwise, this portrayal of a human being doomed to a constant Â‘freak show' attraction by exhibitionists (those who care for him are just as guilty as those who don't) is likely to reduce the most hardened viewer to tears 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

this movie engaged me deeply,"First I'd like to say that this is one of the best and most engaging movies I've ever seen. There were many scenes in which I was close to crying and my eyes were wet during about half of the film. This movie was for me very sad. It made me feel sad and I felt much pity for the character of John Merrick , the elephant man. The main reason I think this movie is a great movie is because we have much to learn from it. It teaches us a lot about people in general, about the values of society, and if we think hard enough about it, it teaches us about how we can improve as people and as a society. I think that this movie is a sad movie primarily because it depicts our society as valuing people based almost entirely on their appearance. Very little of the value we bestow upon people is based on their character and personality. To me, these days it's even more accurate than it was back when this film was released. We have much to learn from the movie the elephant man.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of Lynch's best films,"David Lynch's finest film, alongside with perhaps Mulholland Drive. John Hurt, under tons of makeup, stars as David Merrick, the real-life grotesquely deformed individual of Victorian England that was better known as The Elephant Man. Merrick is the virtual slave of a brutish man (a great performance of Freddie Jones) that parades him as a carnival freak until he is rescued by the sensitive doctor Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins). Treves decides to put Merrick in a hospital room, winning over the initial skepticism of its director, John Gielgud. In the hospital, Merrick will start to talk for the first time, begin to regain his dignity, and eventually will become a curiosity of high society before his premature death. Shot in a delicate and expressionist black and white, the only flaw in the movie might be the performance of Ann Bancroft (producer Mel Brooks's wife) as a stage actress interested in Merrick's life. Except for the surreal opening and closing scenes (in which Merrick is born and dies, respectively), here Lynch is relatively restrained, opting for a style that could be called poetic realism. The film earned eight Oscar nominations in all, but left that race empty-handed, an earlier indication that Lynch's films would not be the typical Academy material.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

The humanity behind the vanity,"The Elephant Man by David Lynch is the voice inside all of us that tells us that no matter how much pain, suffering, turmoil, and abuse that we experience and endure, we can still remain beautiful and sincere even though the world is not sometimes. To me this film is a plea to see the humanity behind the vanity, to question what is humanity and compassion, to see beyond appearance and society's image of beauty and recognize the most important type of beauty which is inner. This is definitely my favorite film of all time, I do not know if any film can ever transcend it, it's even beyond a rating system. This film can be extremely painful to watch, David Lynch wants the viewer to experience what its like to be neglected and repeatedly abused and to stop its occurrence whenever we can, but sometimes the pain become unbearable, as in John Merrick's case. This film shows a man's struggle to remain himself, to not become cruel and disgusting like many people who treated him. Anthony Hopkins character goes into question if a human being can be completely altruistic, and not exploit for personal gain, and to question your intentions, and to know another person's integrity is worth more than all the achievements and publicity that one can fathom to hope for. John Merrick you are my inspiration for hope in humanity and David Lynch has made that inspiration a reality at least for me and hopefully for you.",,Anonymous,Biography

Morally Important and Deeply Moving.,"David Lynch's poignant and touching drama is a emotionally-draining true story of acceptance and suffering set in Victorian Britain. Personal to Lynch and exploring his key themes of dreams and the effects of society on the individual, The Elephant Man is a beautiful, haunting piece of film-making. Although a simple story on the surface, as expected of Lynch films, it is also psychologically complex. Here he explores the effect of industry and class in society and draws on dark themes deriving from Bakhtin's notion of Carnival in his exploration of the marginalisation of difference and the quality of life in the developing post-Industrial Revolution world. The script is both heartfelt and precise and Lynch's direction remains taught and accomplished, enhanced by some beautiful black and white wide-angle cinematography and effective linear editing. The acting, particularly from John Hurt, is completely faultless, with every emotion hitting home. A important, masterful work of significant moral importance, that is both historically aware and ambiguously complex.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Elephant Man: 7/10,"It's pretty hard to find a more eccentric director than David Lynch. Of course, he's known for making such films as Blue Velvet and Mulholland Dr., but people tend to forget about The Straight Story and The Elephant Man, two of his most touching films. And it's hard to grasp how he made Elephant directly after he made Eraserhead, considering basically the only similarity is that they're both shot in black and white.The Elephant Man stars John Hurt as the title character, real name John Merrick. He has been physically deformed since birth, and spends his life in a freak show around the turn of the century. One day, Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) takes him to his hospital for examination, and realizes that there's more to this person than just his extremely deformed body, from which he gets the name ""Elephant Man"". Some people, however, aren't ready to believe that he's not just a sideshow anymore.It's hard to know where to begin when writing a review for a movie like this. I suppose I'll begin with Lynch's directing. I liked how we weren't able to see what Merrick looked like until a half hour into the film, even though he was an intergral part. The black and white photography, however, didn't really seem to work, because a movie like this could be more expressive, although perhaps the makeup used was oddly colored. Some of the symbolism he used was obvious and a little strong, especially at the beginning.I can't go on in this review without talking about the makeup used on Hurt. It took 12 hours every day to apply, but from the black and white photography, it was hard to tell whether the makeup was extremely good or extremely fake for most of the movie. Near the end, though, I was able to tell how extraordinary the makeup was, helping me feel with the main character more.However, for a lot of the movie (mainly the middle), the plot goes from the examination of Merrick to Merrick talking with regular people. Emotion went with the original plot there, but soon after, quite possibly the most emotionally harrowing scene in the history of movies comes. Hurt does an amazing job as Merrick, and Hopkins puts in a good job as the doctor. Those are the two biggest characters, but the movie revolves around them. Overall it's a very good movie, with some great moments, but some other things fall apart.My rating: 7/10Rated PG for thematic elements.",,Anonymous,Biography

This movie is in black and white, so people might think it is boring because it is in black and white. But if you have any common decency, you won't care about the graphics.

Humanism and Voyeurism,"Shot in gorgeous black and white, The Elephant Man is a masterclass in visual atmospherics. The story centers on John Merrick, a grotesquely deformed man getting by rather miserably as a spectacle in a carnival run by a vicious proprietor. His intrigue piqued by the news of the eponymous elephant man, a London physician named Frederick Treves pays for a personal viewing and then pays more to examine Merrick at the hospital. Soon after, Treves rescues Merrick from the carnival life by admitting him to the hospital as a patient, where Merrick is revealed to be a gentle soul of sophistication and intelligence.One can read the movie as a humanist endeavor, with a core message that there's an intrinsic worth to people notwithstanding their illnesses or deformities. The movie's also a case study in human cruelty and spectacle. Treves is professionally interested in Merrick because of Merrick's unusual deformities, and the ""discovery"" and ""presentation"" of Merrick to the academy bring Treves significant acclaim. Later, Merrick's position improves when an actress takes interest in his condition, prompting high society to come visit him.Throughout the film, we're treated to intensely emotional scenes of Merrick attempting to lead a good life despite his condition, while those interacting with him most often do so because they want to get something for themselves: the experience of seeing a hideous creature; social cachet; professional advancement; or even, most simply, money. Even by the film's end, when it is apparent that Treves has formed a personal bond with Merrick, we're never quite sure whether it's an authentic friendship from Treves's perspective, or whether he still views Merrick as something of a case study.Although the artsy scenes at the very beginning and end are quite odd and, I think, detract from the movie overall, The Elephant Man is a beautiful, wrenching film that packs an undeniable emotional wallop.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lynch was both the right and wrong director for this,"This is a deeply engaging and emotionally draining film. I think the film manages to make every salient point about Merrick-and how *everyone* treated him-that should be made. The film is even smart enough to suggest that it too exploiting the man because of his deformities. Add in that it is a stylish, moody period piece (thank God they filmed in black and white) powered by two exceptional performances and this is a great film to see. Only a person of Lynch's care and intelligence would have rendered such a nuanced film.But the more you look at it the more of Lynch's odd obsessions and parts of his personality come through. The opening sequence-and the bizarre implication for Merrick's mother-is probably the most telling sequence for this. I don't think it is needed for the film; moreover, the scene's sexualized subtext is very off putting. Lynch is too much of an auteur for a message movie.And that's the rub. This film is a prestige film made by a singular weirdo. It's an unstable mix.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Touching,"David Lynch has an fascinating track record - ""Blue Velvet"" is a good example.  It is truly a remarkably interesting film, with lots of things to say, and yet it is vaguely repellant.  Not, as is pointed out in Lynch's excellent ""The Elephant Man"", for ""women or nervous persons"".  Interesting, then, that Lynch should choose a subject that mirrors most of his films almost exactly.The film tells the real-life story of John Merrick, born with a deformity that most people treat as something to ridicule, profit from, or be terrified of.  He is rescued by young surgeon Frederick Treves, who sets about rehabilitating him, much to the interest of Victorian-era London society, and the anger and contempt of certain members of the hospital board.  In addition, we see Bytes, the man who has been exhibiting Merrick in his freak shows, and many people who want to meet him (for a number of reasons).  All of this provides an interesting backdrop to the rise and decline of an extraordinary young man.The film is shot entirely in black and white, and the attention to Victorian era detail is marvellous to behold: great quantities of steam, many gaslights, the costumes are perfect and even the accents have a plausible Victorian lilt to them.  Without resorting to obviously faked running scratches on the film itself, the period is clearly and brilliantly set. Similarly, the lighting and cinematography is meticulously crafted.  A special mention must also go to John Morris, who composed the score. Without being too intrusive or distracting, the music gently accents the beauty that the film has to offer, and conveys a sense of wonder at the appropriate moments.It must be pointed out, however, that the film progresses far too slowly in places, and a substantial part of the responsibility for this must go to Lynch for his fanciful dream-like sequences and unnecessary shots of (exquisite, certainly) sets.  It can be argued that we learn a lot of Merrick's history and the era in which the film is set through these sequences, but the acting, effects, screenplay and directorial talent elsewhere do more than enough to convey this, and the rest of it just comes across as inconsequential episodes which weigh the rest of the film down.All actors and actresses imbue their characters with the dignity, helplessness, terror or aggression that they require.  Freddie Jones is excellent as the pathetic yet frightening Bytes: it is refreshing to see a character portrayed so well with a dual sense of helplessness and power. Similarly, John Hurt does a marvellous job as John Merrick - especially beneath the weight and restrictive nature of Christopher Tucker's spectacular make-up.  He manages to give Merrick a very real sense of dignity and humanity (surely the point of the film), and it is very possible to see the pain and humiliation in his eyes at certain points, a well-nigh-on impossible task given the nature of the make-up.  Hopkins is good as Treves, (although it is not his finest hour), and the performances from Anne Bancroft and Hannah Gordon are also very well done.To conclude, ""The Elephant Man"" is a very touching and moving film, in turns fascinating and upsetting, but certainly overblown in places.  If you can get past these minor quibbles, however, ""The Elephant Man"" is definitely a good film to watch, with much more to say than the average blockbuster.",,Anonymous,Biography
The Need to Go On,"This is a masterful portrayal of one of the most interesting characters in history, John Merrick, the Elephant Man. Through the incredible performance of John Hurt, we get to see this as a person, not a sideshow freak, although that element was always there. As the movie evolves, he becomes more than we think he will, actually attaining celebrity. But, like Eric Stoltz, in ""Mask,"" society is there to pull him back. He can't be what he wants to be, try as he might. There is rampant cruelty throughout the world and Merrick lived it every day. I know that Roger Ebert leveled a charge of manipulation and sentimentality against this film. This is probably true. Filmmakers can't seem to resist the rather trite emotional tricks at times. The fact that Merrick was rebuilt to some extent for the film may be worthy of criticism. Maybe they did him a disservice by making him a bit more palatable for the movie audience. I don't know. We create fictions in film all the time. If we have a cancer patient, should we show them with pustules braking on their bodies. Perhaps we should to create an accurate portrayal. Perhaps today, the Elephant Man may be more graphic, more difficult to look at. Perhaps that would make a better film. I just know that sentimentality aside, this is a pretty good one.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A heartbreaking and profoundly human story of empathy and acceptance,"The Elephant Man (1980), directed by David Lynch, is a deeply moving and visually stunning exploration of the life of Joseph Merrick, a man whose severe physical deformities led him to be exhibited as a ""freak"" in Victorian London. The film portrays his journey from the cruel exploitation of his appearance to finding compassion, understanding, and dignity through his relationships with those who see him as a person, not just a spectacle.John Hurt delivers a breathtaking performance as Merrick, capturing the complexity of a man who, despite his monstrous appearance, possesses a gentle and intelligent soul. Hurt's portrayal is both heartbreaking and inspiring, as he conveys Merrick's internal struggle to be seen for who he truly is. His performance is nuanced and empathetic, making the character's pain, isolation, and eventual moments of hope deeply affecting.Anthony Hopkins plays Dr. Frederick Treves, the Victorian surgeon who rescues Merrick from the life of a side-show freak and attempts to integrate him into society. Hopkins' portrayal of Treves is equally compelling, showing his complex mix of genuine compassion and the limitations of his understanding. The dynamic between Treves and Merrick forms the emotional core of the film, highlighting themes of human dignity, empathy, and the often fragile nature of self-worth.Lynch's direction and the film's cinematography are masterfully executed, with stark black-and-white visuals that heighten the sense of alienation and isolation that Merrick experiences. The use of shadows and lighting contrasts the harshness of the world around him with the quiet tenderness that exists within Merrick's soul. The cinematography also emphasizes the contrast between Merrick's grotesque physical appearance and the beauty of his inner character, deepening the emotional resonance of the film.The Elephant Man is not merely a biographical drama; it is a timeless meditation on the human condition. The film explores themes of acceptance, the value of human life, and the power of kindness in a world that often values superficial qualities over inner worth. It's a film that challenges societal norms and invites viewers to reflect on their perceptions of beauty, humanity, and compassion.Rating: 10/10. A profoundly moving and visually captivating film that explores the complexities of human identity, dignity, and compassion with heartbreaking depth and empathy.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Terrific Movie!,"Why are people afraid of the 'unknown' ?I was very touched. I liked it the acting of Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt very much.

"Beautiful examination of the ""appearence"" social stigma","Lynch's second film succeeds on every level it intends to. It is a bleak and uncompromising look at how society judges others based on appearance, or really based on any social stigmas. Being a Lynch film, there is the classic Lynchian dream sequence, as well as flawless cinematography and great performances. John Hurt plays the ""Elephant Man"" perfectly, and the makeup effects are truly haunting, while at the same time evoke pity and strong sympathy for how this man is treated by society. There are plenty of insane, morally revolting characters, as is common in many of Lynch's works. At the end of the day, this may be the most sad and powerful Lynch film. As while his other works may examine the human condition very successfully, none come close to the uncompromising cruelty and mean spirited-ness as seen in ""The Elephant Man."" At the same time though, there are genuinely good people that want to help improve his life. All in all, the film is a phenomenal expression of the human condition, and should be taken as a warning to avoid applying social stigmas and barriers to individuals.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Reflection on Conditional Acceptance and True Humanity,"David Lynch's The Elephant Man is a hauntingly tragic exploration of what it means to be ""accepted"" by society. While it may seem like an outlier in Lynch's filmography, lacking the overt surrealism of his other works, it carries the same unsettling power, forcing us to question not just how we see others, but how we allow them to exist.The film follows John Merrick, a man whose severe physical differences make him an object of both horror and fascination. But what struck me most wasn't Merrick's condition itself, it was how those around him responded to it. The film makes a deliberate choice to delay revealing his face, mirroring how society hesitates before confronting what it deems ""abnormal."" And yet, by the time we do see him, our perspective has shifted. We're no longer looking at a ""spectacle,"" but a person. That moment alone is a brilliant subversion of expectation.But the real horror of The Elephant Man doesn't come from Merrick, it comes from those who claim to accept him. The most disturbing scene isn't his early mistreatment in the freak show, but later, when drunken intruders violate his space, turning his existence into their entertainment. It's here that Lynch exposes the cruelty not just of the obvious villains, but of society as a whole. Because even the ""good"" people-the doctor, the nurses never truly free Merrick from being an object of curiosity. Even when he is honored, even when he is applauded, it is still on their terms. He remains something to be looked at, rather than someone to be known.This idea of conditional acceptance resonates far beyond the film. Society often claims to be progressive, to be welcoming of difference, but that acceptance is rarely unconditional. People will ""support"" those who are different, whether in terms of disability, gender identity, or any other marginalized identity, as long as it doesn't disrupt their own comfort.It's the difference between clapping for Merrick in a theater and actually sitting with him at dinner.It's the difference between saying ""I accept you"" and simply treating someone as human without needing to declare it.And that's why the ending is so devastating. Merrick, after being used, pitied, admired, and displayed, finally makes a decision for himself. In a world that will never allow him to exist on his own terms, he chooses the only form of autonomy left to him. It's tragic, but it's also the most human act in the entire film.Lynch leaves us with an unsettling truth: acceptance is not the same as belonging. And as long as we continue to see people through the lens of difference first, true equality remains out of reach.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A heart stopping drama.,"I expected a heck of a boring time with this movie when I first saw it on T.V. But I was caught off gaurd by the supurb performances and story. It's an emotionally charged drama that deserves a lot of credit. Hopkins is a Doctor who comes to care for a freakshow feature nick named 'The Elephant Man'. This man whose real name is John Marrick is nicknamed 'The Elephant Man' because of his severely disfigured appearance and speech. All performances are expertly performed that makes the viewer's throat tighten with sadness. Anthony Hopkins showed a great character in the doctor and John Hurt was spectacular as the disfigured elephant man. he was so convincing through his costume and voice, he WAS John Marrick for a few hours. This is a great example of what a dramatic Hollywood movie should be. out of ten : 9.1. Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,Biography

A Tortured Soul Comforted by Compassion,"In 1884 Victorian England, renowned London Doctor Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) attends a carnival side show to view a ""freak"" managed by slimy Bytes (Freddie Jones). The anomaly in question - the ""Elephant Man"" - 21 year-old Joseph ""John"" Merrick has a large and deformed head, a twisted spine, enlarged and nearly useless right arm, a twisted foot, and numerous scale growths on his back.Bytes continually mistreats his meal ticket, and sadistically beats him without mercy. Treves first ""borrows"" Merrick to use as a model for his lecture before his academic colleagues. Then he decides to rescue him from Bytes but still believes that Merrick is a mental idiot who (thankfully) does not realize his plight. Treves eventually convinces Mr. Carr Gomm (Sir John Gielgud), House Governor, to allow Merrick to have residence at the local hospital. Treves wants Merrick to be used as a source of study. Over time Merrick and Treves become friends and the latter soon realizes that Merrick is no idiot. Not only can he speak, but also is a sensitive, gentle, and intelligent individual. Even the staff begins to respect Merrick. Ultimately though, his life would not be a long one.In the surreal opening scene, a dreamlike sight, elephants are in motion and one attacks a woman. In reality, when Merrick's mother was pregnant with him in 1862, she was knocked down by a fairground elephant. Apparently - and not explained in the movie - both she and her son thought that the confrontation was the source of John's disease. This concept of ""maternal impression,"" that emotional experiences of a pregnant woman could have lasting effect on unborn children, was seemingly a common belief in the 19th century.A touching moment occurs when Merrick weeps when he is in the presence of Mrs. Treves (Hannah Gordon). He explains that he never had been in the company of such an attractive woman. Also note his most sincere appreciation when he receives a grooming kit as a present. Another impassioned scene occurs near the end when John proclaims to the crowd at the train station, ""I am not an animal.""""The Elephant Man"" is based upon Dr. Treves' account and not upon the play of the same name. Liberties have been taken, especially with Bytes' character. The Elephant Man's real name was Joseph Merrick, not John. Dr. Treves somehow had a mental block about Merrick's given name. Shot in crisp and appropriate black and white with smooth editing, the movie by David Lynch is well-filmed. Note the dark undertones of human misery in 19th century London. The music score Adagio for Strings is lovingly played and is so apropos. The acting is great all-around, including that of the supporting cast. Anthony Hopkins as the good doctor very well plays the part of a compassionate man who had to question himself of his ulterior motivation. Freddie Jones is appropriate as the sleazy Bytes. John Hurt is totally unrecognizable and outstanding; it took seven-eight hours daily to apply his makeup, and two hours to remove. I don't know how he accomplished his role so well.""The Elephant Man"" is the second best movie of the year (1980) after ""Raging Bull."" See both.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Dare I say, I believe this to be the best film of all-time.","Although I am reviewing this movie after numerous others on IMDb, I viewed this film for the first time, and had to give my input. This film is truly remarkable, to put it simply. I believe this is David Lynch's best film, and as I stated in the title, in my opinion it is the best film of all time.The Elephant Man is a throwback film that shows us the life of a man that has been judged his whole life on his abnormal outward appearance. I could break down the plot and messages of this film, but that has been done numerous times in the reviews on IMDb. What I will say is this; The Elephant Man is timeless, and even if you don't like older movies or even any of David Lynch's other films, give it a chance. I had this movie on my ""watch list"" for a very long time, and for whatever reason decided to put off the viewing until recently. Whatever is holding you back from watching this beautiful film, forget it. I can almost certainly promise you will not be sorry.In summary, this film should be considered as one of the best of all-time, and left me speechless when it ended. I give this film a 10/10 and move it to the number one spot on my own personal 'best films' list.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
My Fair Elephant Man?,"This film is very different from most of Lynch's work and is beautifully filmed. As I watched it, I could not help seeing parallels to the infamous story of ""My Fair Lady"". Dr. Treves as Henry Higgins, takes the circus freak, teaches him how to speak politely, dresses him in nice suits, and makes him presentable to society. The Elephant Man is even allowed to attend the theater. The only problem is, as the film reveals, his life in society is not that much different than when he was in the circus--either way, because of his deformities, people want to come see him because of their curiosity. He is still viewed as a freak of society. Very few characters in the film really seemed to care about John Merrick, even though he seemed to believe that they were all his ""friends."" Everyone seemed to be using the Elephant Man to advance their own careers, or to make money. The only character, besides Dr. Treves, that seems to really be interested in the Elephant Man as a person is the actress, Mrs. Kendal. There is a fabulous scene when she comes to visit John Merrick in his room at the hospital.There are many heartbreaking scenes in the film and it really makes you think about the true nature of unconditional love and how we, as a society view people, especially those who appear different on the outside. How we are so quick to judge and how even the most grotesque looking person can be so beautiful on the inside. Very highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"""I am a human being!""","In what may be the ultimate Hollywood film about dignity and triumph over all evil, David Lynch directs the story of a disfigured man who gets brutally tortured and sold for laughs.

But I wasn't overly impressed with his style. I found too many scenes to be cut away far too soon. This story has several moments of great emotional impact, but when the scenes are cut to a different area it loses the gravitas.

"Probably, this is the saddest movie I have ever watched.","It is based on the true story of Joseph Merrick who suffered severe deformities which his doctor found shockingly impossible to treat and cure, especially his abnormal facial growth, curved spine, and enlarging skull. Given his abnormal tissue growth around his neck, he could not be able lie down to sleep, due to the suffocation risk. So, he forced himself upright before starting to sleep. Also, he struggled to eat any food. It was so horrible to see him being cruelly treated by thoughtless and ignorant people, especially his uncle, because they labelled him a monster and 'The Elephant Man' - dehumanising, distressing, and unforgivable.Psalm 23 is his favourite bibical psalm (The Lord is my shepherd). He loved making a replicate of his local church. I think he had an extraordinarily beautiful soul during the Victorian period. It is said that he was kind and gentle to those who knew him. Fortunately, he experienced some comfort and peace at his hospital during his final years. What an unforgettably sad movie. I admire his psychological endurance in what he went through.It is amazing to see modern-day people who make some silly complain of their minor skin issues such as wrinkles and perhaps freckle skins, especially cosmetic treatment. Michael Jackson's plastic surgery failures would probably be a perfect example in this regard. Today's society is definitely contrasted to Joseph Merrick's time.

But it's doubtful many people would have anticipated the rare maturity he exhibits here, a combination of forthright compassion with an admirable sense of understatement. Lynch presents Merrick as the ugliest duckling ever, cultured and polite beneath his grotesque appearance, but resigned to a life of misery before his rescue from the freak show by Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) and his eventual introduction to London society. The true story may not have been so poignant, but this is still a striking film, with its empathetic cast, evocative music score, atypical editing scheme, and magnificent black and white photography (courtesy of old pro Freddie Francis), capturing all the soot and steam of England's Industrial Revolution.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of Lynch's best,"David Lynch never ceases to amaze. The Elephant Man is his second feature film and it is indeed one of his best. It is more accessible than most of his films, but it is undoubtedly Lynchian with all of his style and substance rolled into one hypnotic experience. This movie is a biopic of John Merrick, otherwise known as the Elephant Man. He was a man who suffered from severely grotesque deformities. The movie opens with a doctor named Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) stumbling upon Merrick at a sideshow circus where Merrick was one of the attractions. Hopkins manages to get Merrick out of the circus and to a hospital where he is cared for. From there he makes his way into London society, proving to be intelligent with a great personality. This movie is such an excellent portrayal of what it means to be human and how we perceive being human. It is a heartfelt tale told in the most unique form possible a la David Lynch.The Elephant Man has a sort of dream like quality to it. This movie is doesn't lack the surreal quality which Lynch laces his films with. The movie is hypnotic in its development of its characters and storyline. It helps that the entire film is shot in black and white, giving it a much more dramatic overtone. It is a very serious film, but not one that takes itself too seriously. It's not pretentious. Instead it's beautiful and enticing. Instead of being melodramatic, its heartfelt and sincere. It's a masterpiece in surreal filmmaking as well as dramatic realism.What really drives this film are Hopkins and Hurt. Their performances are tremendous and Hurt earned a nomination for his heartwarming performance as the most grotesque physical perversity of mankind. Hopkins' performance was somehow overlooked at the Oscars, yet he delivers the most driving and powerful performance of the film. And it is particularly interesting to watch the relationship between him and Merrick evolve as he realizes how human Merrick really is, and that he is a real human being, not some sort of grotesque science experiment. It is truly beautiful to watch these two characters grow and become more human than you would have ever expected.The Elephant Man is a masterpiece. It is just simply a remarkable film that will change the way you look at yourself and those around you. It's a movie that teaches us things about the human race. Things we don't want to know but have to face. These are the things that John Merrick knows very well and they are the atrocities that he must face every day. This is a movie that will leave you thinking long after you see it. It is an emotional triumph and one of Lynch's greatest films.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A remarkable film that should not be forgotten!,"Sometimes the most obscure people can be immortalized for their greatness of simply Â‘being.' We are all flawed persons in our own ways. But as we struggle with our own failures at not meeting our own expectations, we forget about the people who have existed, or now exist who suffer greatly, or have been given an unfair lot at life. One such individual was a man named John Merrick who lived in Victorian England. Merrick was born horribly disfigured-his spine crooked, large tumors all over his body, but most noticeably, a large protruding skull. It was this last characteristic that would coin him as the Elephant Man.It was not until 1980 that a motion picture would be made to examine Merrick's life. Starring John Hurt as Merrick in a performance that could move the heart of the hardiest person, along with Anthony Hopkins as the doctor who would show pity on a soul that most would seek to ridicule, `The Elephant Man' is a remarkable film that should not be forgotten! 	`The Elephant Man' examines Merrick's life from the perspective of the doctor Frederick Treves (Hopkins), who would save Merrick from the freak show where he was tortured and jeered at. Treves takes Merrick to London Hospital where at first, he seems to stick out like a sore thumb, but where he would eventually learn to find his dignity. 	`The Elephant Man' is a truly unique movie that avoids conventional filmmaking techniques and relies upon its set design, excellent performances, and strong direction from a young up-and-coming filmmaker, David Lynch (`Mulholland Dr.'). The film is shot in black and white to create a greater sense of authenticity for the time. Furthermore, the black and white was used as a medium to hide any imperfections within the makeup design for Merrick's face, which was actually modeled upon the body cast of the real Merrick. 	The actors perform with absolute truth and bring dignity and greatness to the real people who lived to see this incredible man rise above his place in the world. Hopkins is outstanding as Treves, and quite convincing as he portrays his emotions in the film. In the scene where Treves first sees Merrick, a solitary tear runs down his face in pity towards another person who had never been shown any prior to that moment. Hurt's performance as the tortured Elephant Man is one of great inspiration. We first find a person who is forbidden to have a voice, but gradually gains the strength to take pride in his natural humanity, regardless of his physical form. (In actuality, the real Elephant Man could barely speak due to the bone structure of his mouth). Hurt also does a great job at presenting the natural conundrum of Merrick's life-his mother died when he was born. He has no direct family relations-no one can love him in such a way because they are not of the same bloodline. What's more, Merrick's mother was a very beautiful woman, and yet Merrick was horribly disfigured. He feels shame and regret for his very being and wants nothing more than to be something special for her. `The Elephant Man' is a reminder of the greatness of the human spirit. Amongst a world filled with despair and grief, this one man was shown a little bit of pity and found a person inside himself that could be proud. Furthermore, he was given the chance to live as normal a life as possible, with a real home and most importantly, real friends. ***1/2",,Anonymous,Biography
Heart Warming!,"True stories are always something good to watch. ""The Elephant Man"" is one story that shows a lot of heart of a man who sees the beauty of life even though his appearance in unsightly. John Merrick(John Hurt) is a victim of sideshow exploitation who is later rescued by a kind Victorian Doctor(Anthony Hopkins). His loyal kindness, and understanding makes Merrick more of a man than a monster. All of a sudden, he hears John recite, ""The Lord is My Shepard, I Shall Not Want...."", Dr. Treves(Hopkins) is surprised. Being a Christian that he is, John Merrick is a amazing. He meets a variety of people in London, including a dancer named Mrs. Kendal(Anne Bancroft). This woman saw through his visage, only to find a very kind heart. Merrick is an artist as well. His works are a true classic. When the cruel Mr. Bytes(Freddie Jones) claims him back, everyone in the carnival, turned on him and helped Merrick back into society. It was a very strong point where John lashed out at the crowd saying, ""I am not a monster! I am not an animal!"" ""I am a human being!"" He proved his point down outright! At the night of the concert, he not only got total acceptance from the audience, but honor as well. The movie sends a message, and it's very educational as well. A strong must have! 5 stars!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
This Is Perhaps The Most Emotionally Moving Movie Ever Made,"Watching this movie is a powerful emotional experience. In an era in which movies are increasingly appreciated more for their action and special effects than anything else, here we have a simple human drama drawn from real life - the story of John Merrick (whose real name was Joseph), known to late 19th century England as ""The Elephant Man."" As is perfectly normal with this type of movie, the story uses dramatic license in some things. In particular, there's apparently no evidence that Merrick ever met ""Mrs. Kendal"" (played by Ann Bancroft) although she did take quite an interest in his case. Basically, though, this is a reasonably accurate portrayal of Merrick's early life as an attraction in a freak show, and his later life in the London Hospital, his friendship with Dr. Frederick Treves (played by Anthony Hopkins) and his growing acceptance by London's high society, including the Princess of Wales (played by Helen Ryan.)The movie is moving. One can't help but be saddened by the conditions Merrick (who was played brilliantly and sensitively by John Hurt) had to live in and by the way he was treated by many of those around him. The movie also raises a lot of thought-provoking questions. The nature and role of freak shows is front and centre in the first half or so of this movie. We in the modern world think of such exhibitions as repulsive, and yet in the context of the times they did provide a way for those who were ""different"" and likely to be rejected by society to survive and earn some sort of living. And while the movie depicts Bytes (Freddie Jones) - the operator of the freak show - as an entirely unpleasant character, Tom Norman (the real name of the freak show operator) denied this, and there's some question about how Merrick was treated in the show. There's also the question of his acceptance by high society. Was this acceptance sincere, or was Merrick simply transformed into a somewhat higher class freak show for the satisfaction of the rich and powerful? Probably the answer was a bit of both.The most unsettling scene in the movie is probably that in which the Night Porter at the hospital brings a bunch of his pub friends to get a look at Merrick (after charging them a significant fee to do so) and the hideous way in which he's treated during that encounter. That may have been more dramatic licence (and therefore, because of the response it brings forth, a bit manipulative.) Merrick's ultimate death (he either asphyxiated himself or died of a broken neck while trying to sleep lying down like ""other people - he had to sleep sitting up because of the weight of his head) is extremely sad.This is a first-rate movie. The performances from everyone were superb and the decision by director David Lynch to film this in black and white reminds us that these events were from a different time and seem to re- enforce somehow the emotional power of the movie. Excellent work - a must see movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Hard to Critique.,"David Lynch's unorthodox direction (Oscar-nominated) and the highly dark black-and-white cinematography are the main attractions in this over-rated would-be-masterpiece. A circus freak with Proteus Syndrome (Oscar nominee John Hurt) is living a life that is much like a wild animal's, but in spite of his appearance he is a sensitive and very intelligent man. Victorian doctor Anthony Hopkins tries to save him from a life of misery. The film struggles for greatness and almost succeeds, but the movie's odd tone does not help its case in the end. Anne Bancroft and John Gielgud seem wasted in supporting roles. Good, but far from being excellent. Still one of Lynch's most interesting works. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Biography

Above average movie with an exceptional performance and make-up,"A pleasant film lifted to new heights by the exceptional performance of John Hurt and the beautifully crafted make-up of Christopher Tucker. One should watch it simply for those two aspects alone. Hopkins puts in an average performance as his character feels far two dimensional even with the depth they try to give him. Lynch does Lynch things when it is unneeded, though at the time they would have looked avant-garde today they are Lynch things meaning someone who tries to be different but ultimately keeps doing the same thing. Thankfully he did not do too many of them and the movie keeps a steady grasp on reality. The script seems a little heavy handed in its sentimentality, it also feels like it was punched up so that the audience does not ""get bored"" which ultimately leaves a piece meant to discuss the nature of humanity but a brief glimpse at the strength of the human spirit.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
... who is the real monster?,"The dramatic content is obvious in this movie; a major departure from Lynch's original style (remember that this is right after ""Eraserhead""). While ""Eraserhead"" is nightmarish, cold, highly disturbing and surrealist, ""The elephant man"" is dramatic and more stylized; and very dark; a somehow rare combination: dramatic and dark; it aimed towards a totally different direction - drama and biography. In ""Eraserhead"", Lynch shocked the audience with unreal nightmarish images and events, cold and emotionless characters and dystopian-ish images; here, his purpose was to leave the audience drowning in tears - there are characters full of emotions, emotional scenes, extreme sadness, sadness and again sadness and everything is marked with stunning and exquisite imagery related to the industrial revolution (+ symbolic imagery).
Probably Anthony Hopkins' first real big performance; John Hurt has also done a really good job here.

Captures the heart,"""The Elephant Man"" is not a regular film. It achieves something that not all movies are able to achieve. It gets under your skin, makes you feel powerless as the audience and leaves you wishing you could go back in time to the 19th century and be a source of comfort, a friend, a companion to John Merrick, cruelly termed 'The Elephant Man'.The film, based on a true story, shows us the life and ordeal of John Merrick (John Hurt), a 21 year old man whose face is severely disfigured as a result of a progressive disease, so much so, that he has to wear a hood and a cap when he's in public. He earns his living for himself and his ""owner"" by being displayed at various freak shows. It's clear that everybody wants to see the deformed man, but, nobody wants to understand him, rescue him and treat him like a normal person. But that's where Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) comes in. He discovers him in one of the freak shows and takes him to his hospital to look after him, thus giving him a second chance at life. From then on, John Merrick is introduced to a new world. Watching John's life changing is truly moving and touching and makes you realize that people like him should not be shunned upon but instead, deserve to be loved and cared for because that's all they really want and need. The film works on all levels with excellent acting and direction and a fine screenplay.I will say that the movie is disturbing and difficult to watch at times but I won't say that it isn't for everyone, because everyone's eyes should be opened to the inexplicable realities of life, which is portrayed so well in this film. It captures so wonderfully the life of John Merrick and reminds you how grateful we should be for a normal life.Bottomline: The Elephant Man is one of those rare films that cannot and should not be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A movie everyone should see.,"I never heard of this movie till 2006.And I'm surprised I never did before. This movie is very moving and very under rated.Elephant man takes place in England during the late 1800s. A surgeon portrayed by Anthony Hopkins finds a sideshow featuring many freaks. But one of them caught the surgeons attention. The Elephant Man, a deformed human born with an unbearable face that made him inhuman.At first you'd suspect he's an abnormal monster that should be killed. But deep down he is a sensitive man named John Merdick, 21, and very well educated.Over the years he's been living it rough with his condition. He's been beaten and treated badly ever since he joined the sideshow. John only wishes he can walk in daylight with everyone else. The surgeon does not find John to be a freak of nature. So he gives him care at the hospital he works at. Only problem is John is incurable. So it's merely impossible to change his face no mater how professional a surgeon can be.With a bit of hope and care, people of England will soon see John Mereith as a Human like them.This movie has a great morale to it. And it will change the way you think of people with deformed features. Just because of their looks doesn't mean they're not human. If you get to know them more you'd find out what they're really like. Because I'm sure you'd feel the same way if you were in their shoes and face the same music they do 24/7.This movie deserves more and wish it was more well known to the public. I'd put it in any greatest drama list. It's worth seeing for those who haven't seen it or aren't familiar with the story of John Merdick.

Delicate and Human,"It is an incredibly heart-wrenching movie with delicate direction from David Lynch. The human experience is central is this biopic of this unfortunate person. But, what he wasn't gifted for the outside, he was blessed with on the inside.John Merrick is an incredibly human soul. The living symbol that body and soul are two separate entities. That what matters inside and how you treat other people is most important in this world.To see him turn from a life of strife into a distinguished gentleman is one of the greatest transformations put to film. It is such a delight that all the bad things that have happened to him have had no influence whatsoever on his personality. He does not turn bitter or angry. Instead, he takes the kindness that is offered to him with utter gratitude. Still, he feels like he is not deserving. That he is but a monster.How John Merrick starts to dream of things he didn't dream before, to finally be human in the face of such inhumanities. The braveness to deny his visage. To keep going when he is judged by his exterior. To turn the guilt others feel towards him and returns kindness. He turns into my favourite character on the screen and is a testament for how one should treat another, no matter how they look.I wish I had paid better attention to this movie before.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

See this one!,"You could only see his eyes behind the layers of makeup, but those expressive orbs earned John Hurt a well-deserved Oscar nomination for his moving portrayal of John Merrick, the grotesquely deformed Victorian-era man better known as The Elephant Man. Inarticulate and abused, Merrick is the virtual slave of a carnival barker (Freddie Jones) until dedicated London doctor Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins in a powerfully understated performance) rescues him from the life and offers him an existence with dignity. Anne Bancroft costars as the actress whose visit to Merrick makes him a social curiosity, with John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller as dubious hospital staffers won over by Merrick. David Lynch earned his only Oscar nominations as director and co-writer of this somber drama, which he shot in a rich black-and-white palette, a sometimes stark, sometimes dreamy visual style that at times recalls the offbeat expressionism of his first film, Eraserhead. It remains a perfect marriage between traditional Hollywood historical drama and Lynch's unique cinematic eye, a compassionate human tale delivered in a Gothic vein. The film earned eight Oscar nominations in all, and though it left the Oscar race empty-handed, its dramatic power and handsome yet haunting imagery remain just as strong today.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

An ordinary but moving film from Lynch,"Personally, I've never been a big fan of Lynch's movies. The reason lies in the fact that his style was too strange for my taste. I didn't know what to expect from this movie. That's why the film pleasantly surprised me. The film is actually technically just plain, looking at Lynh's standard style, that's probably why it stands out a bit.I really liked it, even though it was a difficult film. Hopkins and Hurt are a great on-screen duo, each in their own role. In a way, this story is a criticism of society that was valid at the time, but unfortunately it is also valid today, we have not made any progress. There are almost no unnecessary or bad scenes, everything makes sense and contributes to the story or character development. The film evoked some emotions and sympathy in me, and that's why I think it succeeded in its intention. The ending may not be spectacular on the level of the rest of the film, but it is certainly satisfying-",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Heartbreaking,"This film really shows off David lynch's versatility as a director, it is both heartfelt and disturbing in it's brutal cruelty. John Hurt is amazing as John Merrick, he injects so much innocence into the character, His first words on screen will absolutely melt your heart. It is a dense film, with some areas hard to sit through, but it is well worth it. It also cleverly layers themes of vanity and the concept of true beauty into the people outside Merrick's world. Hopkins is also brilliant, displaying a great deal of subtlety. The Black and White photography is beautiful and perfectly compliments the story.

****1/2 out of 5,"As painter one must devistate yet captivate an audience so that even though people walk away not knowing what to think they still want to come back for more. Maybe it is this fact that David Lynch has been able to breach a gap between his paintings and his films, or maybe that is why he, in my eyes, is not a director at all, but more of a captor of emotion that gives meaning even to the unexplained. For this I have come to believe he is one of the smartest men in film and also for this I also believe he is one of the greatest misunderstood talents we have. Lynch doesn't let anyone off easy in this tale so devistating that it is, at times, almost unbearable to watch but still we can't help but find ourselves staring with wide-eyed fasination at what will happen next, the movie is kind of like driving by a fatal car accident, you know that what you will see is probably wrong but you can't help but look anyway. From birth John Merrik had been a terribly deformed human being. We see him humiliated in public as a side show freak, we see him beaten and we see him treated like an animal. But still underneath all this misunderstanding lies a soul so kind, so gentel and so innocent that you can't help but feel your heart turn in knots everytime he speaks. Merrik is then taken in for examination and is befriended by Dr. Treves who helps to expose John as a human and not some freak of nature. John Hurt is absolutly magical in an Oscar worthy performance as Merrik and Anthony Hopkins is a joy to watch, as always, as Treves. Where a lot of films today like Simon Birch, Life as a House, I am Sam and the Mighty are just sad for the sake of being sad, Lynch's characters are so human that you can't help but feel their pain. Lynch also shows us that even people who don't look the same as everyone else are just as entitled to be called human as you or I. It also shows that sometimes we are so blinded by pride or greed that it is really we who are the animals that we peg people like John of being. It sure is hard to fins a film in this day and age that is this honest and even though it horrified me at how cruel we can be I must give Lynch credit for being so brutally truthful in a genre that has become so candy coated and sappy it is almost sickening. A word of advice, don't forget the tissues, you will need them.",,Anonymous,Biography

One of Lynch's Most Mainstream Films Is Also One of His Best,"This lacerating film about John Merrick, a man in 19th century England who suffered from a terrible physical deformity and was treated as a circus sideshow by a public who did not understand his condition, proves that David Lynch is as adept at mainstream, linear storytelling as he is at putting miraculous fever dreams on the screen. I experienced ""The Elephant Man"" as something physical; my heart literally ached while watching this profoundly sad yet oddly exhilarating film.People may not think of Lynch as an especially emotional director; his experimental approach at film-making may leave some feeling detached. But the more I see of his films, the more I come to appreciate that all of his films have a strong emotional core to them, so it doesn't surprise me that he would do so well with this story. He films in beautiful black and white, which gives the film an old-fashioned look that feels right for its time period and subject matter, and he makes use of a brilliant musical score. All of the actors are terrific, but especially John Hurt, who is able to act through heaps of prosthetic makeup (the actor himself is completely unrecognizable), to deliver a powerhouse performance. I defy even the most cold-hearted cinephile to watch his final scene and not have to sniffle back at least a tear or two.What a wonderful, wonderful movie.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Exquisitely writte, crafted, and performed; a must-see classic","Even when dealing with straight drama, David Lynch has a curious knack for introducing a sense of the fantastical and otherworldly into his films. Nevermind dashes of outright surrealist imagery, or the subject matter: subtle touches like Freddie Francis' vivid, smart black and white cinematography, the director's particular, mindful orchestration of shots and scenes, and the vibrant, rich performances of the cast are the real source of that feeling of the extraordinary. The exquisite production design and art direction feed into it, as does the stirring, original music of John Morris. Before we even properly consider the core of 'The Elephant Man,' this is a very pleasing, rewarding experience. Consider the real-life story within, and it's no wonder that the film has been regraded so highly all in this time - this is a beautiful, warm, heartfelt piece that's as sad and tragic as it is inspiring and hopeful. And frankly, it's a must-see.In part one could safely say that this shares the common problem of many biographical or historical films in terms of trying to condense a lifetime into a finite length, let alone all the questions and ideas that follow therefrom. There is also the matter, perhaps, of deliberately tugging on the heartstrings - or is it that the story of Joseph Merrick (here named John) is just naturally prone to reaching us on a personal, intimate level? I don't think there's any arguing that such is true, whether it's specifically to the undue advantage of this feature or not. Merrick's life was remarkable, and in turn both heartbreaking and heartening. Screenwriters Christopher De Vore and Eric Bergren, producer Jonathan Sanger, and executive producer Mel Brooks took utmost care to treat his tale with all respect, spotlighting both the terrible cruelty and the immense kindness with which he was greeted, and how very gentle a soul he was. With the ingenious vision of Lynch guiding the production, the result is title that manages to feel like much more than it is: both biography, and narrative fiction; an exemplary, sincere portrait deserving of many awards, and a pecuilarity that in other ways looks and feels quite like the filmmaker's first full-length work, 'Eraserhead.'It can't be overstated how much incredible hard work went into this; not one dime of the independent financing was wasted. It bears repeating that the production design and art direction are exquisite, and Francis' cinematography simply superb. The costume design is lovely, and the hair and makeup work are truly exceptional, in the most literal sense of the word. Even Anne V. Coates' editing readily impresses, and De Vore and Bergren's screenplay is tremendously well-rounded and balanced, very full but never feeling overstuffed or excessive. Morris' score adds fabulously to the power of the story; while I'm given to understand he was displeased with the choice of using Samuel Barber's famous ""Adagio for strings"" for one critical scene, and I understand his reasoning, I don't think the employment in any way undercuts the momentousness of the occasion. And from one to the next, every actor herein gives a performance that, if not the performance of a lifetime, will stand forever after as one of the greats, and highly memorable. John Hurt could easily carry this movie all by himself, let alone Anthony Hopkins, John Gielgud, Hannah Gordon, Anne Bancroft, Freddie Jones, Michael Elphick, or anyone else in front of the camera.At length, what we have is a picture that is both the singular portrayal of one unique person, and also an obvious reflection of harsh truths about society, whether Victorian or modern. Even now those with disfigurements and disabilities are treated just as Merrick was, and other demographic minorities including the transgender community and more. 'The Elephant Man' is specific, but in some ways pointedly universal, adding still another idiosyncrasy to its long list of unlikely conjoined traits. No matter how one wishes to dissect it, however, the undeniable fact remains that this is a stupendous film, and one that still rather seems underappreciated even for all the praise it has garnered since its release. It is as flawlessly complete and absorbing as any work one could name, and not just entertaining, and satisfying, but rewarding. For as long as the medium endures this will be well worth seeking out for one and all; if you have the opportunity to watch 'The Elephant Man,' this earns my highest, heartiest recommendation.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Lynch gradually lets us creep under John Merrick's disfigured skin,"There's a great sadness running through this story about John Merrick, a man born with severe physical deformities for which he was ridiculed and exploited in the late 1800s, and director David Lynch isn't afraid to let us wallow in his subject's misery. The Elephant Man is far removed from the trademark visual and narrative extravaganza of Lynch's later career; his only indulgence here is the choice of black-and-white cinematography. What he does exhibit, however, is a deep understanding of the humanitarian aspects of the story, and your sympathy for Merrick grows stronger as Lynch gradually lets you creep under his disfigured skin. The film uses clever, almost sly techniques to evoke emotion, but it still feels warranted and well-aimed. John Hurt's performance is so full of physical effort that it almost feels as though he has lived and experienced some of Merrick's hardships himself. His cumbersome prosthetics give his performance weightiness - literally. Also with fine supporting work by Anthony Hopkins, Anne Bancroft, and John Gielgud.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Forget Titanic and Star Wars...,"Want to see a real movie? See this one. Truly, The Elephant Man is one of the greatest films ever made and yet it is so unrecognized. Anthony Hopkins and superb, as is John Hurt with his moving performance as John Merrick. I have never seen or felt such a film that touched my heart so much. 10/10",,Anonymous,Biography
a priceless gem...,"Definitely an exquisite piece of cinema, one of the most harrowing, engrossing and poignant movies in motion picture history. No gargantuan budgets, no Hollywood hotshots, no special effects, no violence, no sex, no long-legged chicks, even no colors!. This is PURE CINEMA where both elegance and substance are blended into a perfect mixture of intensity and integrity.It is beautifully shot black & white on purpose. Although filming B&W was very expensive process at that time, it was a right choice by director David Lynch and producer Mell Brooks because it fitted perfectly with the eerie mood and sinister ambiance of the story.Visually it drags the viewer into dark, gray, filthy, haunting and suffocating PHANTASMAGORIA of INDUSTRIAL WORLD where cruelty and self-interest overwhelm kindness and compassion. Soggy streets, foggy alleys, smoky steel mills, and crummy crowds are all the elements of Lynch's SYMBOLISM used to portray very sharply the psychological turmoil of John Merrick - a physically plagued & horribly abused soul with massive deformities throughout his body Â– while being constantly bombarded with inhumane indecencies. So, this is the story of that hapless and hopeless man's arduous journey to return in humanity and dignity in a world full of real freaks and two-footed beasts. Highly recommended...",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
EXCELLENT YET SAD...,"The Elephant Man is, by far, the saddest movie i have ever see; but at the same time extremely well made. The acting was superb. Anthony Hopkins gives one of his finest performances. The fact that this is based on a true story is what makes it so amazing. I enjoyed every moment of it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best movie,"One was to turn on David Lynch's The Elephant Man midway through, without knowing what it was, one might be startled at the appearance of the main character. One might even be tempted to make fun of the character. But if one was to watch the film from the beginning, one's sympathy with John Merrick (John Hurt), 'The Elephant Man,' would be strong enough to deny that the former situation was ever a possibility. Lynch does not allow his audience to glimpse Merrick sans mask until his appearance has been built up substantially. When we the audience are at our zenith of anticipation, we see him-no dramatic music, no slow motion; a simple cut and he's there. There he is. And it's no big deal.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Though it may not perfect, it is truly a heartbreaking movie, and lives up to its source material.","With amazing performances, makeup, and a haunting and admittedly sad ending, The Elephant Man remains a classic. The acting, especially the performances of John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins, make this movie stand out.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Aww, poor man.","Considering this film is based on the real life story of Joseph Merrick, the severely deformed man otherwise known as the Elephant Man, some things were changed from real life to give it fictional flare as well as Joseph Merrick's name being changed to John Merrick which I heard is an incorrect mistake. But what matters is this film is based off a real man who suffered with his tumour deformity who was mistreated and displayed at a freak show until one kind man, Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins) took an interest in him and bought him into his own care at the hospital. Some parts were very disturbing and a lot of times you'll feel really sorry for the poor man being bullied by the wrong people but it's nice that there are people like Frederick who will give great kindness.Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt did a tremendous job playing their parts so well done to them. Now one would wonder why the film is in black and white, well I believe it was done this way for an artistic effect and it really does pay off, I suppose the film wouldn't be the same if it were in colour.And then all a sudden, the ending, I won't spoil what it is but it's one of the beautiful endings I've ever seen in my life and it made me cry. I don't normally cry when watching a film but I was truly deeply moved by this film which is rare for me and for doing that, this film is a true cinematic masterpiece. An absolute must see, just beware to have the tissues ready if you plan on watching this.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Greatest Example Of Courage,"I have always had unusual fascinations, and Joseph Merrick is no exception. At the time the film was released in 1980, I was but a mere second grader. I was enthralled by the mystery and spook factor of such a dark and dreary film. Today, I am a film student/director. My films are mostly in the style of David Lynch, David Fincher and Ridley Scott - dark and eerie. The mood which low lighting creates is unsurpassed in its ability to create a dreamlike atmosphere. Furthermore, the majority of the stories I write and the films that I intend to make one day, all revolve around persons whom have had to overcome seemingly insurmountable struggles. While as a boy it was the esoteric 'creepiness' which interested me, I look back upon such experiences as being instrumental in shaping me artistically. I feel there is no better story to tell than that of people who live in a world of intolerance and have the ability to create for themselves a life despite their outcast status. My compliments to you as well for dedicating yourself to such an endlessly interesting subject as Joseph Merrick. His is a lesson to be relished not only from the perspective of disabilities, but from one of self-respect, steadfastness and determination; Very unique characteristics in a situation which might daunt the average man.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very difficult viewing,"This was a film I decided to watch due to a desire of mine to start watching a few more 'serious' films, being sick with all the dross that is routinely churned out these days. It's fair to say that the film delivered in this respect! I can honestly say that this is the most harrowing film I have ever seen, and at points I found it almost unbearable (the BBFC's PG certificate for this film is frankly mind-boggling). The fact that this film is more unsettling than some of the most violent horror films is testament to the power of the story and directing, but in a way this is where I would criticise the film; I can't help but think that Lynch pushes his audience a little too far.Whilst many will describe this film as 'sad yet uplifting', I simply found it sad yet.....well, sad. The film conveyed to me mainly that a man such as Merrick could never live a normal life because society will never really change in its attitude towards such people, and, perhaps worse than this, conveyed the idea that even compassion can be a strange new brand of exploitation in its own right.This is an interesting film, and one which will get a debate going - something I always love in a film, but if you already know that every human deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and already know not to judge a person on appearance, you may not find that you learn all that much from this film.And if you don't know this then you won't even bother watching. Will you?",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent,"I think it's a pity David Lynch abandoned the path of a traditional screenplay in his following movies. ""The elephant man"" is like ""Eraserhead"" with the benefit of a realistic pattern. Basically what happens around John Merrick is a process of cleansing. At the beginning he's dirty, oppressed and isolated. Then he gets through a recovery period, while he receives assistance and increases his knowledge. At some point of the story (more or less 30 minutes before the end) he's left alone in order to double-check his new abilities. Then, obviously, we end up in a triumphant happy ending. I wish to see a film like that, instead of another ""Inland empire"". I've heard that it was considered a sort of sequel for ""Mulholland drive"", but I slightly disagree with this view. If you don't have a character, you don't have a story. If you don't have a story, you have an artworks gallery. That's what David Lynch is when he writes his own films. ""The elephant man"" is the only David Lynch movie I wanted to watch again.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
David Lynch's finest work,"The Elephant Man is one of David Lynch's finest films. The focus on how John Merrick, the elephant man of the title, touched the lives of those he met, from nurses and administrative staff at the hospital to the upper-class members of London society is what gives this film such power. David Lynch does some of his finest work in this film. Sparing use of music, quietly restrained cinematography and the subtle use of sound effects to create atmosphere allow the remarkable performers to shine.The cast includes some of the 20th century's finest actors; Anthony Hopkins, John Gielgud, Anne Bancroft, Wendy Hiller, and John Hurt. Each member of Mr. Lynch's acting ensemble gives a stunning performance but it is John Hurt in the title role whose performance is most remarkable. Despite layers of makeup which render him unrecognizable, Hurt conveys a man of remarkable innocence and dignity. The supporting cast is also extraordinary including Hannah Gordon in her one scene as Hopkins' wife and Lesley Dunlop as a nurse in the hospital. The film is compassionate and moving Â– a testament to the human spirit.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
