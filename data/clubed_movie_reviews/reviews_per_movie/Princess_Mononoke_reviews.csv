An extremely good movie that superseded my preconceptions about the animation style it is presented in.,"A few years ago I would have tossed this film into a collection of movies I like to call the rubbish pile. Recently, however, I have forced myself, with great difficulty, to open my mind and look at the entire picture. Instead of focusing on one or two aspects of the movie I do not like and formulating a biased opinion based on my hasty and clouded notions, I can now decipher both the good and bad points of a given flick. Upon watching Princess Mononoke, I must say I first thought it would be very difficult to look past the animation style and see it for what it was- a dynamic film directed be the highly acclaimed Hayao Miyazaki. After about ten minutes of dwelling on the follies (and there are, in my opinion, many) of the ""anime"" style of art, I became enthralled with the quickly unfolding plot and the subsequently dire fate bestowed upon Ashitaka, the protagonist of the film. After Ashitaka leaves his village to search for a treatment to remedy his affliction, I no longer cared that this was an animated feature; I was on the edge of my seat, wondering what would happen next. I no longer disliked that every character had abnormally large eyes (though not over-sized to the point of utter absurdity) or that the English overdubbing was a little choppy. In fact, I even began to enjoy the accomplished yet subtle computer generated effects interspersed throughout. By the last half hour I was hooked to the screen, eagerly awaiting the conclusion I wanted so badly to end the bitter conflict of the plot. By the end, I realized that this movie carried a powerful moral with it: man's continuous tampering with nature brings about as much savagery as it does progress, as much suffering as it does good, and that a sound compromise must be struck between nature and civilization. I do not harbor any negative feelings towards those who rated this movie poorly, as I used to be one of those people. All I have to say to them is this: look at a both the visual and symbolic attributes of a movie before rating it harshly. If, after observing all these features and idiosyncrasies, you still wholeheartedly hate the film, then by all means give it a one. After all, what would the world be like if we were all did not criticize or question our surroundings?",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Palm Oil Forest Demons...,"... and arable desert dust bowl aliens. It seems our intent to unbalance, upset, bias, distort and thoroughly irritate Mother Nature knows no bounds. I'm curious of the curses and phantasms this great animator would conjure against Homo Ignorantia in todays world, spectral beasts perhaps, to unite alongside the current pandemic sent to warn us off the path we're so resolutely set on taking.As engaging a narrative and animation as any you'll come across, with enough to keep you pessimistically in despair of the curse the people of the world are to the lifeforms we share resources with on this planet we call home.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Studio Ghibli Fest 2018,"I'm so thrilled that I decided to watch Princess Mononoke for the first time ever on the big screen. Studio Ghibli is just nonstop in terms of their animated quality (leaving most animated studios in the dust) even in times like the 90s when this film was released. The action sequences are crafted with such care and such brutality that it's hard not to be remarkably energized by them. The characters surrounding the movie are so engaging and iconic which immensely supports a deeply fleshed-out and powerfully thought-provoking story. Princess Mononoke is a breathtakingly painted tale of a man on a quest to balance two opposite ends of a war filled with hatred, greed, and violence. The conflict of siding between two teams is quite apparent in the film, and it's resolutions are as beautiful as they are significantly important in the real world throughout human history and especially today. (Verdict: A)",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Allegory on the balance between humans and nature,"This seems to be Miyazake's most personal work, clearly a serious design. It is set in an imaginary time which blends the time of the ancient gods (Shinto style, gods of place and nature) with the settlement of humans and the coming of metalworking and war.  The world is not in balance, and a distant conflict between industry and nature has wounded one of the gods of the forest, which is then killed by a sentry boy as it rampages into farmland he guards.  The evil controlling it transfers to him, beginning a slow takeover, and he must journey to the origin of the conflict to find a way to cure himself and incidentally, as he will learn, to try to restore balance.  But this is not a simplistic tale, he finds there are other characters in play, and there is good and evil in everyone, and no easy balance.  The Princess (Hime) of the story is a mysterious human who has been raised by wolves (which are themselves powerful forest gods, a little reminiscent of the Amerindian Coyote myth), who becomes both his ally and his enemy.  The story is not easy to understand.  It has many Japanese mythic elements but even then, it is a work of Miyazake's unique imagination, and is not intended to be simple or to have a clean resolution.The animation is spectacular, and unusual, with new elements even for Miyazake and marks a new departure for style which you can see continued in his next film, Sen to Chihiro - more nature, more wild, more jamming on elements from Japanese myth and folklore.  And, continuing the trend to be more personal, concerned with ethics and character, and less sci-fi. There are at least half a dozen well developed characters threaded through the story, and their animation is wonderful in displaying subtle character.The original Japanese soundtrack has some amazing singing and draws upon some of the best talent available for voices - in Japan, Miyazake is universally known and this was a masterpiece carefully crafted.  Japanese television documented a lot of the production.  The English translation drew on some good talent but they seem not to have ""gotten it"" quite so intensely as the Japanese crew.If you haven't seen Miyazake, give it a try (but maybe look at Sen to Chihiro first, or even Laputa or Kiki's Delivery Service, for easier and lighter introduction to his work).  Some say he is the Japanese Disney, but I don't like that.  His work has a depth and sophistication that goes beyond Disney cute.  There is no other animation like it.  This is truly an adult work: children might like some of the visuals, but I doubt that many kids below teen age will have any idea what it is all about, and even adults will get more out of this each time you see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A true work of art that takes animation to an entirely new level,"I saw Mononoke Hime on its USA release back in late December 1999 under its U.S. title Princess Mononoke.  I had read quite a bit about this film and its director but was still totally overwhelmed by the beauty and brutality of this movie.  The complexity of this movie is something never seen in the United States in an animated movie and even exceeds that of most live action movies as well.  It combines love and hate, war and romance, nobility and deception in ways rarely seen in movies today.  Lines of good and evil are anything but clear cut and in the end is hope but no guarantees, no promises.  This is truly an adult movie but my children, ages 12 to 15 all loved it and talked about it for days later.  Even my wife who holds a strong prejudice against Japanese animation enjoyed this movie.Go and see this movie.  You won't be disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Very touching movie!,"The first time I saw Princess Mononoke I was completely moved and surprised. Since it was a Studio Ghibli film dubbed by Disney I liked the fact that it wasn't a ""they all lived naively ever after"" film. There were no complete ""good"" or ""bad"" guys. Even Lady Eboshi the most antagonist character in the movie had a reasonable motive for trying to get rid of the animal gods and cutting down the forest. Although it her actions were environmentally damaging and wrong in general, she did it to help her people survive which is what all the species on Earth strive for. Another wonderful aspect of the plot is that it sends a message - Protect the Earth and all will survive in peace - a message either discreetly or strongly portrayed in many of Miyazaki's films. Perhaps the portrayal of this message (and the tiny hint of San and Ashitaka's romance and Moro's views on nature) was what made the film so touching to me.Like many Miyazaki movies, the animation (as always) is wonderful and nicely detailed which is also another quality that genuine Disney films lack (thank goodness for Studio Ghibli). The music was beautiful and well suited to the movie.The only predicament to the movie is that it is a bit downbeat and does not contain much happy laughter (oh well, I can watch My Neighbor Totoro - also a good movie - for happy laughter.).10/10 - And my favourite movie of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
one of the best films i've ever had the chance to see,"Princess Mononoke is, without a doubt, one of the best films I have ever witnessed. There has never been an animated film even close to this -- I kept thinking after I left the theater, how can Disney even have the guts to make another film after seeing this? Even live action movies pale in comparison to Princess Mononoke. There has never been a film to pay such close attention to details. Watch for the magnificent and subtle flying insects throughout the film, especially in the ancient forest, where bioluminescent dragonflies glide gently around the screen. There are thousands of subtleties such as this. You'd have to see it a dozen times to appreciate this film fully. Aside from it being the most beautiful film I've ever seen, it also has an enormously powerful script. The characters are some of the the most well rounded in all film. Ashitaka especially, the main character of the film, is so nuanced that he has become in my mind one of the great characters in film, up there with Charles Foster Kane and Jake LaMotta. I would compare him to Freder, the main character of Fritz Lang's Metropolis. His role in the film is a mediator between the forces of humans and the gods of nature. Both sides comment several times that Ashitaka must be on the other side, when he is trying desperately to convince everyone that there are no sides. Peace is the way. There is a little to be desired in the American voice talent. Claire Daines was certainly a wrong choice for San (Princess Mononoke), and Billy Bob Thornton just could not hide his southern accent, which made the character of Jigo seem more comical than he was probably supposed to be. Gillian Anderson's voice clashed with her character, the wolf god Moro, a bit. It hardly affected my passion. The film was so spectacular and beautiful that James Earl Jones could have voiced San and it would have detracted little. Definitely, though, I'm praying that they release the DVD with subtitle options. Anyway, Princess Mononoke is the best film of 1999, the best film of the 1990's, and, in my personal top ten list, no lower than #5, but closer to #2. 12 hours later and my heart is still beating with the power of Princess Mononoke!

Stunning and sharp (in any language),"I saw this film in Japan, in Japanese with no sub-titles, I don't speak a word of the language and I was still enthralled!  It is Miyazaki most visually intense (surpassing, at long last, Nausicaa) and is alive with color and movement the like not yet seen in anime.The story is complex, and after talking with Japanese friends, it is clear that much of it went over my head (particularly that relating to specific Japanese myths), but the important elements came through. Miyazaki's long infatuation with technology verses nature and man's relation to God (or gods) weave throughout the film as does his trend for strong women characters.Even with the language barrier, the film is of such intense emotion that it caries you through to the end. The change in dynamic between the crashing fight scenes and the quiet scenes of healing by the lake is so broad and so well paced that I can't remember a film where my emotional state was so expertly varied.If you have a chance to see this film, in any language, I recommend you do.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Japanese JEWEL,"Fantastic film! It makes me speechlessly. Good dialogs, beautiful soundtrack,incredible animation effects (take a look at the rain, at the movement of the grass, hear the sounds of the steps) and interesting characters,who are everything but ordinary. Ashitaka is captivating (what a strength, what a heart, what a soul!); San (the Princess Mononoke herself) is intriguing; and Lady Eboshi is ambiguous -is she the villain? I don't think so. After all, who can blame her? Don't let the over exploration of themes related to ecology discourage you. Go ahead and watch Mononoke. It's a totally new way of treating the conflict between men and nature, which is far from its ending.

"NOT the ""Star Wars of animated features""","No matter what the New York Post said about it (as is recorded on many of the DVD editions of the film), this is definitely not the pinnacle of animated films, nor even of Miyazaki's own work. I really, really wanted to like this film more than I did. I am a big fan of Miyazaki and this is supposed to be his masterpiece, but I'm just not able to go that far in my own assessment of it. It was complex, and beautifully animated (as you expect from Miyazaki), but it left me a bit hollow. Part of it was the incredible violence in the film (NOT for children under 13, IMO), and part of it was hearing Billy Bob Thornton's drawl as the voice of Jigo, but a big part of my reluctance to rate this film more highly is that it felt a bit like Miyazaki was reaching for something that he had already grasped. I think he addressed almost identical themes in a much better way in Nausicaa. Princess Mononoke seemed uncharacteristically ""preachy"" and heavy-handed, in contrast with Miyazaki's generally subtle style. I know it's super popular and has a stellar reputation, but I just can't recommend it when there are so many other great works available from this true Artist of Anime.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

His animation style has the best ""flowing motion"" I have ever seen.The American dubbing team, whoever they are did an excellent job picking voices, they got top notch actors to do the job right (unlike most animes today). They even took on the hair-pulling task of RE-ANIMATING the mouth movements to match!This is by far one of the best films I have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"One to convert the sceptics, a rich, thoughtful and charming animation","If, like me, your heart sinks at the prospect of another pious, sanctimonious, tub-thumping eco-fable, give ""Mononoke Hime"" a chance all the same. It does have a distinct, and far from subtle, ecological message, of the ""can't we just live together?"" variety, but on the other hand it's far from clear that the answer the film suggests is ""yes"", and there are plenty of nuances and subtleties along the way. More to the point, there's a proper story, well-conceived and well told, there's a memorable, beautiful and violent world, credible characters and a good deal of charm.The animation is mostly very fluent and careful, though not flashy in the way we're getting used to in this CG age. (""Mononoke"" uses cgi, but subtly and with restraint, so that the feel remains that of a group of traditional craftsmen under one guiding hand). Quite often one finds that there are more static elements in a tableaux than you'd expect in a Disney animated feature, but I think this is an aesthetic choice rather than a mere economy: it stylizes and formalizes, while focussing attention on the important elements in the frame. But there is occasional jerkiness, though not enough to detract seriously, and perhaps it wouldn't trouble audiences whose frame of reference isn't so western as mine - I'm not sure.Talking of the western and eastern sensibilities, the Region 2 DVD which I'm reviewing gives you a choice of English and Japanese dialogue, and though I watched the American dub first, I'd generally prefer the Japanese version, for the key roles of Ashitaka and San. Billy Crudup is appealing but too low-key, and Clare Danes strikes me as badly miscast: she sounds a bit too old, and altogether too urban to bring out the core of wildness or the steely sense of loyalty to her world. Like other reviewers, I have trouble with the Texas drawl of Billy Bob Thornton, which is just too regionally specific to match the look of the character (please understand that I'm not suggesting the cast should all have done fake Japanese accents!). On the other hand, it's pretty much a toss-up between Yuko Tanaka and Minnie Driver (who's very closely attuned to the aesthetic of the original) as Eboshi, and Gillian Anderson and Jada Pinkett Smith are just right. Still, overall you get more vividness and conviction from the original voice cast.  Oddly, the lip-sync seems more approximate in the Japanese version, perhaps a fault in the synchronization on the R2 DVD.  The subtitles unfortunately but understandably come from Neil Gaiman's adaptation of the screenplay rather than re-translating the Japanese - one's aware, for example, that Gaiman has added bits of extra, explanatory dialogue.With all that out of the way, let's concentrate on what makes the film work: it delineates a world that's at once mythological and believable, and refuses to sentimentalize or simplify (even if it occasionally allows itself to preach).  There are feuds and failures of trust not just between the humans and the animals, but within each world - and the animals seem as ready as the humans to exclude the other from their world. Indeed the conceit of the film seems to be that language, rather than being a product of distinctly human evolution, was originally shared among mammals at least, and it's as the war with the humans goes on that the animal kingdom becomes more brutish and less coherent. For all the prince's idealism and the delicate rapprochement some of the characters inch towards, one gets the impression that the logic of conflict will be hard to resist.Perhaps the most appealing and intriguing element in this world is the kodoma: the little, voiceless tree-spirits seem to be a cross-between a mushroom, a toddler and a rattle, and I defy anyone not to be captivated by them.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Night Walker Texas Ranger,"I have to admit one of the big holes in my cinematic appreciation is for the films of Studio Ghibli. Admittedly I haven't seen a lot of them, largely because the ones I have seen I haven't enjoyed that much. I watched ""Princess Mononoke"" as it's a DVD that ended up in my collection, and I'm watching them out the door in the direction of the charity shop. It wasn't the one to finally win me over.Infected by a demon, Ashitaka (Billy Crudup) travels to the West to see if he can find a cure. He becomes embroiled in a battle between in the residents of Iron Town, led by Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver) and San (Clare Danes) a human girl who rides with the pack of the Wolf Goddess Moro (Gillian Anderson). Ashitaka comes to learn that Iron Town has opponents on all side, primarily as they're clearing the forest in order to create iron ore.It's not like I can't appreciate the effort that goes into making a feature length (mostly) hand drawn animated film, I can. I just can't get on board with this aesthetic, I appreciate that, like all animation, it takes a lot of skill and time - I just don't .... like it. I can't explain it any clearer than that.Given that I'm sure I've already earned your downvote, I might as well double down on it and say that I also found the film dull, and too long. I understood and appreciated the environmental themes but as the story widened out, I found myself less and less interested in what was taking place. I broke my usual rule and watched the dubbed version too, rather than a subtitled one. The performances from the English dub cast are generally quite flat and lifeless too - perhaps by virtue of picking Hollywood stars for the roles, rather than specific vocal performers - which is why someone like John DiMaggio stands out.I'm going to have to keep going with them, as it must be me that's the problem - but I've never warmed to Miyazaki's work, and this hasn't changed my mind.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Absolutely breathtaking!,"Princess Mononoke is one of the best animated movies I have seen in a long time, and is up there with Studio Ghibli's best along with Spirited Away. I will say I am probably biased, as I am a huge Studio Ghibli fan, and love all of their films, I even like Cat Returns, which along with PomPoko is considered as one of the weaker Ghibli efforts. The animation in Princess Mononoke is absolutely stunning, with rich detailed backgrounds and brilliant character animation. The image of the Stag actually made my jaw drop. The music is fantastic as well, and although environmentalism is a subject matter very difficult to get right, what the filmmakers succeeded in doing was making a highly intriguing story that was not only original but succeeded in not being preachy at all. The film is also helped by the high calibre vocal talents of Minnie Driver, Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton et al (voicing quite remarkable characters) and a strong script. True, some of the images like the Demon Worm, may frighten younger viewers, but it is fair to say they were very powerful. All in all, Princess Mononoke is breathtaking and I recommend it highly. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Enthralling and Artistic,"Studio Ghibli has been Japan's leading anime Production Company since the 1980's, when legendary anime director Hayao Miyazaki released his first feature film ""Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind"" (1984). From the very beginning, it was clear that the Japanese director had a fantastic flair for animated film, and the uncanny ability to engross his audiences beyond the normal movie-experience that makes him the King of Escapism. Over ten years later, it seems that Miyazaki is still just as good, if not better, as he invites the world into his latest visionary fantasy, the cult classic ""Princess Mononoke"".The film is set in Japan, during the Muromachi Era, and begins in the quiet peaceful township of the Emishi tribe, when young Prince Ashitaka (Yôji Matsuda), the last of the Emishi royalty, is wounded slaying a demon in an unexpected attack. When the tribe's wise-woman tells Ashitaka that the wound is a curse of hatred that will eventually kill him, he sets out on a journey to the west to discover the origins of the demon. What he finds is a war being waged between the villagers of Iron town, an industrious Iron-works fort led by the ruthless Lady Eboshi (Yûko Tanaka), and the beasts of the forest, represented by the beautiful Princess Mononoke (Yuriko Ishida), a human girl raised by wolves, with whom the cursed prince falls in love. Soon Ashitaka's efforts to make peace are put to the test by each side's bid for allegiance.""Princess Mononoke"" is a fantastic work of art on many fronts, and arguably Miyazaki's best film to date. While some of his other projects have had the same enchantment and excitement, ""Mononoke"" has an intriguingly dark and infinitely more mature feel, established by the bloody battle-scenes and sensitive color treatment, and solidified by a complex plot and rich, interesting characters. The most obvious illustrative trait of the film is the ambiguity of the characters' nature; the lack of distinction between good and bad. The ruthless lady Eboshi, while caring nothing for the forest or its inhabitants, is very compassionate towards the underdogs of her own community, such as the brothel girls and the lepers. And the wild wolf-princess, while desperate to defend her fellow forest-dwellers and protect the forest spirit, has a deep-seated mistrust of humans that even steeps into self-loathing at times. These interesting character traits make the film a lot more rewarding than many of Ghibli's other works, which were aimed mostly at children.Of course, all these intriguing themes and characters are only a part of the film's wonder, because Miyazaki's true gift lies in imagery. The detailed animation of ""Princess Mononoke"" is astounding, drawing its audience into its environments, from lush forest to open fields to crowded marketplace and more; the team of animators that poured their hearts and souls into this film should take utmost pride in their accomplishments. Using minimal and tasteful CGI, the movie stays very warm and inviting even when the subject matter and mood is less-than-friendly. This is also owed to the audio aspects of the picture; the voice talents involved are highly engaging and enjoyable, even in the English dubbed version, which features such big western names as Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, Billy Crudup, Clare Danes and Gillian Anderson. Joe Hisaishi's music is also a rather splendid complement to the film.Overwhelming success of the anime production in Japan alone stands as a testament to its fine quality. Breaking a 15 year record held by Spielberg's ""E.T."", ""Princess Mononoke"" became Japan's No. 1 movie of all time in the year of its release, as well as taking the title of best-selling video/DVD of all time. It is also the most expensive animated Japanese feature in history, reaching a budget of 2.4 billion. Outside of its home-country, however, the film continues to inspire and engage audiences from all corners of the globe, taking a well-deserved place in the list of cult-favorites for film-lovers everywhere.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Yet another job well done!,"This is one the best movies Hayao Miyazaki has ever made. Absolutely wonderful job. The plot was at first a bit confusing, this is a movie that you have to watch more than twice: Its hard to get at first.With beautiful backgrounds, carefully chosen seiyuus, Mononkoe Hime entertains both adults and kids.The first time I watched Princess Mononoke, I was a bit confused about the characters.

Unlike some other anime movies I've seen, Miyazakis characters are more easier to read. And this is where the difference of reality and cartoons steps in. Its easy to overdo your characters expressions, and so spoil the movie, and make it look stupid, even childish. This isn't a mistake that Miyazaki would do.

One of the best in history,"When I first saw 'Princess Mononoke' on Christmas eve back in 2006 I was 10 years old and couldn't really follow the story since I was quite disturbed from the explicit graphic content. Especially the giant pig suffering of a demonic disease scared the hell out of me back than. But never less is knew that this movie is something special, something I have never seen before. Since then I became a huge fan of Studio Ghibli and watched nearly everything they have produced. But still 'Princess Mononoke' stands out to me as their best work and to me is Hayao Miyazakis masterpiece. The topic of this movie is just as simple as complex. It's the fight between human culture coming with the technologic industry versus the nature and its variety of animals living in it and to this day it's a pretty relevant topic. The way both sides are portraied in this movie is just beautiful. Miyazaki manages to show both sides with all their strength and weaknesses. There's no good side or bad side. Instead every side can be understood by the viewer and even if you don't agree with their opinions you still are able to see why each side acts like they do. The visual work is top notch like always with Studio Ghibli. I love how they create a feeling for nature as one whole organism. I really recommend everyone to go watch this movie. To me this is one of the best movies ever created.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Not perfect but still wonderful,"When he is touching by a demon while defending his village, Ashitaka is sent out to the West, from where the crazed demon originated, seeking a cure for the demon infection that will otherwise kill him.  However, in seeking the domain of the gods he walks into the middle of a three-way battle between the samurai, who want Iron Town's iron deposits; Lady Eboshi who rules Iron Town and is stripping the forest of it's trees to mine it out; and finally the animals and spirits of the forest who must defend their homes, fighting for them is the human Mononoke, a young woman raised by the wolves.It is hard to top Spirited Away, and it is maybe unfair of me to come to this film after I had seen that.  This film cannot match the sheer wonder that I felt when I saw that film but this is still an accomplished film who's story is it's strength and weakness.  The story is a pretty good tale that paints a reasonably good picture of this far off land, although some elements of the plot are a little thinner than I would have liked (namely the samurai).  However it still manages to be engaging despite this - although of course it was never going to be as personal a story as Spirited Away.  The obvious message of peace between man/industry and nature is more than just the usual one; where Lord Of The Rings was very much nature good, iron bad; this film is a lot more balanced and doesn't look at either badly.While this runs in the background everything is fine but, when the film has to tie everything up it doesn't quite manage it.  The ending is strangely very fast in happening and it ends on a morally good solution but one that I found to be emotionally quite unsatisfying.  I must admit that the final 5 minutes left me feeling a little abandoned by the characters.  However other than this the story is pretty exciting and the two hours go by pretty quickly.The characters are interesting but I never managed to really get behind anyone other than Ashitaka.  Eboshi was too unpleasant to relate to while Mononoke herself was too distant despite the occasional times where I felt for her.  Part of this may be down to the voice cast in the US version. In Spirited Away the US cast fitted the film really well, here it is less the cast.  Crudup is, ironically, one of the best voices in the cast.  I say ironically because I couldn't place him in comparison to the more famous cast.  Driver is OK but her character wasn't.  Danes is pretty good and I felt that her character improved due to her good voice work.  Anderson was miscast and her voice simply didn't fit her character at all (even with the echo added).  Thornton was good for the more comedic role but slightly took away from the dramatic impact of the samurai.  Pinkett-Smith brings her attitude to the role well and both she and Keith David are funny.Visually it is as impressive as you would expect from Miyazaki.  It all looks great, the whole land is filled with detail and it flows so freely. The spirits and gods are imaginative and very well drawn and the people show up just how basic stuff like Pokemon really is!  It is a little too gory to be for kids (even though it is rated pg in the UK) but the vast majority of it is as detailed as you wished more kids' animation was.Overall I really enjoyed this film but occasionally found it difficult to get past some of it's weaknesses.  The characters are not all as strong as I would have liked and some of their voices aren't that good.  The ending is a bit of a letdown as I was hoping for a more emotionally satisfying conclusion to the story.  Despite this, it is still a wonderful film and easily one of the best animations I have seen.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Japanese Cartoon Classic,"On a journey to find the cure for a Tatarigami's curse, Ashitaka finds himself in the middle of a war between the forest gods and Tatara, a mining colony. In this quest he also meets San, the Mononoke Hime.While Americans rarely see much for cartoons beyond the world of Walt Disney (or perhaps Don Bluth), we can thank fantasy author Neil Gaiman for getting this Japanese film properly released in the states. Between ""Princess Mononoke"" and ""Spirited Away"", there is much to be seen in the way of Japanese animation beyond the omnipresent anime.Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called Princess Mononoke ""a great achievement and a wonderful experience, and one of the best films of the year."" He is not alone in that sentiment. Almost twenty years later, the film has not decreased in its critical praise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
mind-shattering anime; my favorite of Miyazaki's films,"Some might watch Princess Mononoke and find ambiguity at times. It's goes beyond formula into something that challenged me, the interplay between the forces of nature where sometimes the seemingly 'good' side is not what it seems, until the bigger, darker picture comes into view. It's a purely imaginative effort, with a level of dramatic- more over cinematic- power that I'd compare with Kurosawa on a level. Princess Mononoke, in its uncompromising way, details the violence without pulling away while also being rather anti-violent in the process. It is also hard to pinpoint on any one level.Visually it's got so much going on to practically experience the abstractions that Hayao Miyazaki folds up into the rest of the story. The story itself trails along with the best of epic fantasy, with this crucial, earth-shattering quest that works on that level of action-adventure (possibly more for adults despite the PG-13 rating here in the States) as well as the mythological side of things. Some have written that it is a bit of a complex film in structure and storytelling, bordering on confusing. I would disagree, though I can see what they mean- you have to pay closer attention than usual of more American films. But on a more profound level, if one could call it such, it's really not hard to follow.The hero of the film, interesting enough, is the type of tragic hero, though with one clear sight amid the chaos on the two sides he encounters- peace. He is cursed by a sort of wormy-jelly demon that runs unyielding in the darker recesses of the world. He searches for something to rid him of his scars while on the human side at some points (mostly dominated by the women impressed- or against- his skills), and with those of the wolves on the other side. The title character is part of the latter, though also human, bringing a little more of the underlying symbolism with a character. Then there are also the boars ready to destroy the humans, even to their demise. Amid the battles that rage on, leading to the significance of a certain 'Deer God' as the centerpiece of the balance of the forests and civilizations, not too much is made explicit. At the same time, the side taken by the cursed hero is even questioned by one character, and with that part connected with the others the story trumps what could have been a kind of smothering over-symbolic representation into what is necessary and spectacular about the film.In fact, I would estimate on just the near bravery of what Miyazaki is achieving in the film, it's one of the best films of its kind. And 'of its kind' in this case is the animated film that breaks conventions and the typical 'good vs. evil' logic. Many times the suddenness of things had me wide-eyed, and each creature or little variance on the creations- both good and evil- are elaborated with out compromise. The digitally-animated worm-Jelly type monsters are some of the more memorable ones, to be sure, as they book-end the picture in different extraordinary ways (the climax in particular probably ranks with the best of the last decade or so). The tiny bobble-headed alien creatures are also a delight as they rattle and gather and multiply and flee all around; this is the kind of scene that is dream-like to a truly weird and bright sensibility. And many scenes that have more of that samurai-movie quality to them (again, Kurosawa) are extremely well-done on their own as then they become mixed around again with the fantasy elements.To say that the film is really a 'family' film might be not entirely accurate, as some of the battle and attack footage is pretty graphic in its own ways, if not as much as other more adult anime like Fist of the North Star or Ninja Scroll. There are even moments I would say that, had I been little and watching some of the more twisted and macabre scenes, I might have cried from it. But this is a credit to Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli; for older kids this could mark as something that is, indeed, foreign to their expectations, at least American ones. It is a work of art, not just animation, that takes chances and isn't afraid to go for the right twists and leaps of creation and at the same time keeping its message noticeable but not overbearing. It's a film I can't wait to see again, and likely my favorite of the filmmaker's too, with the same cinematic drive as in the other works I've seen but reaching the ambitious heights it intends.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Riveting and marvelous cartoon movie by the genius Hayao Miyazaki,"This magnificent cartoon movie concerns Japanese legends , it begins when Ashikata, a prince warrior is wounded by a cursed giant boar . He attempts to encounter some way to heal incurable curse inflicted . Ashikata saddled in his red deer goes to the east, where finds the Iron Town , ruled by Lady Ebosi confronting Sam , the princess Mononoke, a human girl raised by wolves . Ashikata encounters in the middle of fighting among the forest animals : large wolves, giant boars and humans : emperor Mikado soldiers , Lady Ebosi soldiers and Shogun army . Furthermore, in the forest finds the deer god and spirits called Kodamas .This wonderful film is plenty of fantasy , adventures, drama, spectacular combats and with ecological message . The picture is narrated with sensibility and sense of wonder and quite entertaining, though isn't apt for small kids but contains graphic violence . It's a deep critical about nature exploiting and killing the forests for the encroaching civilization represented by an iron mining town that cause a damage environment . This stunning film, though a bit too long, converted the first of any kind to gross over the box office in Japan and around the world. The motion picture was splendidly realized by Hayao Miyazaki , he personally corrected or redrew more than 80,000 of the film's 144,000 animation cels . Being accompanied by sensitive music score composed by his usual musician , Joe Hisaishi. Miyazaki also directed other excellent cartoon movies as ¨Howl's moving castle¨ , ¨Chihiro¨ , ¨Porco Rosso¨ and ¨My neighbour Tororo¨ . Rating : Sensational and fantastic , it's a masterpiece cartoon movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
So breathing taking and so meaningful in this animated movie,"I just thought its just the another kid stuff before I saw that movie. But I am really in shock and all my attention sink to the movie when I watch it . I drop my mouth down and I really can't speak while I was watching this Mononoke and Ashitaka nightmare adventures until the end.After enjoy watching the movie, I got many thoughts, philos and knowledge of what we are living for and what we believe in. In this movie, for my point of view, nobody is a bad guy and a good guy.Everyone live on what they believe in and express on they are living for. All the characters have different strength and different way of living but they all are same in just one thing, its called ""HOPE"".They live what they hope for and eager on what they believe. I would nearly cry as the climax is on way too high and after that this story of all meanings is about war and peace, love and hate, positive and negative. Its totally what its called ""master-piece of ART"" and many appreciate to everyone who create this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Princess Mononoke is Miyazaki's masterpiece.,"I've found it, I've finally found it. Studio Ghibli's magnum opus. The greatest anime feature film I've ever seen. Possibly the best fantasy film I've seen as well. This, this is absolutely incredible. Flawless. The story involves a young warrior who is injured with a supernatural curse. He leaves his remote village in search of a remedy but is caught in the midst of a battle between humans and divine beasts. Depicting the clash between the natural ecological system and the modern urbanisation of mankind. Two opposing ideals and environments that struggle to cohabit in unison. An important environmental statement: be good to nature and nature will be good to you. A fundamental statement that doesn't at all feel preachy, but yet it's ever so present throughout every artistic scene. Strip away the fantasy elements and you are still left with a poignant plot that consistently engages throughout its runtime. Every scene matters, every scene builds upon each other like a stack of bricks to then culminate for an epic third act. The animation is stunning. A work of art. The imagination and creativity that is portrayed on screen is a wonder to behold, and will appeal to everyone. The English dub was well done, all the voice actors suited their roles. San's voice did take some time for me to warm to, but by the end I was on board. Surprisingly, this is an emotional journey. Towards the end where there are a few deaths, I actually felt saddened. The biggest impact of them all was actually the destruction of the environment, Miyazaki somehow creates a personality out of the forest to which I connected to it on an emotional level. Masterful work, it really is. Also, the musical score was mesmerising. Slight warning, its rated a PG but I think it will too much for younger viewers. Lots of severed limbs and bloody imagery that I'm sure will invoke nightmares. Princess Mononoke is the best Studio Ghibli animation I've seen, it's an epic masterpiece that everyone should watch. For that reason it gets the perfect rating.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of Miyazaki's best,"Fun info: This is Miyazaki's first forgo into computer animation, used in the dark ""snakes"" near the beginning and a few other scenes and is also one of his most violent films. It also has a solid English dub.It concentrates on a different type of character than most of his films, a young man, Ashitaka, rather than a young woman. His quest does not change him like in many other films but rather he changes many others. The film leans just enough on environmental issues to show a cause while allowing the graphics and story you desire from a Miyazaki film. Special note to the soundtrack which is one Ghibli's best. It concentrates on an iron-works and the battle between various factions of humans, the beasts, and others.I don't plan on spoiling much else as the films plot speaks for itself. My only complaint is that certain scenes drag a bit too long and if anything a bit too much blood spills at a certain part of the film. Otherwise, this film is excellent and one of his best.9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Film Animal Lovers Will Love: Respect Nature For It Can Destroy You.,"Princess Mononoke is a grand, beautifully animated, heartfelt epic. It's a historical fantasy adventure, it's a melodrama, it's a race against time. Its pace is wonderful, taking us climactically through the all-embracing, outspread scope of the story. It has heart, it has violence, it has visual beauty, it has internal conflict.What I like the most about Princess Mononoke is beyond all of these wonderfully delivered elements of a great movie. It's a movie about compassion and understanding towards animals. Yes, these animals are represented by gargantuan, violent beasts, but the movie is about human headstrong influence vs. animal outlook, sense, and behaviorism. It's about how astonishingly much more acute and attuned an animal's understanding is of the world's natural order than that of a human's.I think Princess Mononoke, while being a beautifully made action-adventure, it's an important film, especially for Miyazaki's younger fans. It's important that they take the message of the film seriously.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Landmark in the World of Animation. An Essential Treasure of World Cinema.,"This was just... Wow. I'm still mesmerized by the incredibly dense cinematic experience this anime provided from start to finish & I'm still collecting my thoughts on it. Because Hayao Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke isn't just one of the strongest feature films put out by the artistic filmmaker or Studio Ghibli as a whole but is a landmark in the world of animation whose quality story, thematic elements & breathtaking on-screen execution makes regular animated flicks look like the works of amateurs.A period drama infused with elements of fantasy & set in early centuries of Japan, Princess Mononoke tells the tale of Ashitaka; a young prince who after saving his village from a rampaging boar-god/demon is stricken by a deadly curse & journeys to the forest of the West looking for an answer, only to find himself involved in the struggle between the supernatural guardians of the forest & the humans who are consuming its resources.The title refers to a young girl who was raised by the wolf-goddess & has a strong hatred for mankind. Written & directed by Hayao Miyazaki, Princess Mononoke is arguably the creative height of his illustrious film career & presents him in complete control of his craftsmanship. The 2D animation is absolutely dazzling, the supernatural creatures as well as forests are vividly imagined, the voice actors have done a fab job & music elegantly moves its story forward.The main theme this film deals with is the effects of industrialization on nature, deforestation & how it affects the species who've inhabited these places long before man's greed laid its eyes on their lands. On an overall scale, Princess Mononoke is an expertly crafted, deftly envisioned, gorgeously photographed, swiftly paced & masterfully composed work of art & entertainment which transcends the confines of animation with its complex story, strong characterization, adult themes & makes its statement heard rousingly clear.A standard of 2D animation, a treasure of world cinema, and arguably the pinnacle of Studio Ghibli's creativity, Princess Mononoke (Mononoke-hime) is strongly, extremely & one hundred percent recommended to each & every film lover around the world.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Wonderful!,"I have never been a big fan of anime, but two weeks ago i saw Spirited Away on television. I can admit that i was stunned. It was so much more beautiful then the Disney/Pixar movies. After i had seen Spirited Away i tried frantically to find Princess Mononoke on the internet.Princess Mononoke is a story about a prince named Ashitaka. He goes on a journey to find a cure for Tatarigami's curse. On the journey he finds himself in the middle of a war between a human Iron-town and the gods of the woods. He also meets Princess Mononoke, a girl who is raised by wolves and is filled with hate against humans.I think Princess Mononoke was even better than Spirited Away. It outclasses its Hollywood-synonym, Lord Of The Rings. The plot is very good. The soundtrack is amazing, it's a shame that the Academy Award didn't notice it. The animation is beautiful, especially the characters. The only thing i can complain about is the English dubbing. Billy Crudup does a splendid job as the voice of Ashitaka, but they could really have chosen a better alternative than Billy Bob Thornton as Jigo.Overall i give this movie 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Subtle and mature in moral content.  Excellent movie.,"This is such a wonderful movie from the cultural viewpoint.  Unlike American attempts at morality, it raises questions for children, and adults, that show conflicts in moral issues.

Princess Mononoke loves nature and animals, but hates people.  Things are not simple.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Starts off great but loses its way,"I'm not a huge fan of anime, so I'm not the best person to review this film. Nonetheless I found myself watching it to find out what all the fuss was about.Initially, I found the film gripping. The old-fashioned animation felt fresh and I loved watching the colourful panoramas play out on screen. The early scenes involving the terrible forest monster chasing the film's hero were vivid and exciting; then Princess Mononoke is introduced.Gradually, I lost interest in the film. I found the story far too slim to support the lengthy running time. Myriad characters are introduced and underdeveloped, and the emphasis seems to be on repetitive action involving the different factions battling each other. Certain sequences are certainly captivating on the animation front - especially the huge, translucent forest god creature - but the story just didn't keep my attention.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A beautiful blend of an adventure and fairytale.,"You really don't have to be into anime to appreciate some of the movies that the genre has to offer. Some of them are being simply so good and captivating that basically everybody should be able to get grabbed by it. And I feel that this is one of those movies, that is being a great blend of adventure and fairytale elements.It's really a movie that speaks to your imagination. It's set in a fantasy world, that still feels and looks a lot like our world and the movie is literally loaded with some great and impressive looking fantasy creatures, with the one even bigger and more amazing than the other.In essence this is a mankind versus nature type of movie, in which nature does a lot of fighting back! I can definitely see how ""Avatar"" got 'inspired' by this movie and it features some similar themes and at times also a similar type of atmosphere in it. And I should say though that I liked this movie far better than ""Avatar""! The themes worked out better and were overall more effective and as a whole the story of this movie worked out more pleasantly.I should admit though that the movie can get quite hard to follow at times, will all of its things that are happening and characters that are in it. But this is a 'problem' I have with basically every anime and it very rarely ever ruins the movie experience for me, so it's no complaint or problem really.The movie has some great strong characters in it that can hold their own, amidst all of the great and powerful looking creatures in this movie. And there really are a whole bunch of characters in this movie but this never becomes anything distracting and the movie also never looses its focus. All thanks to some great storytelling skills of course, by Hayao Miyazaki.The animations are absolutely great looking and help to give the movie a great and effective fantasy atmosphere. What I also like about it is that's being such an easy thing to exaggerated things when your animation it, especially all of the action but everything in this movie feels 'real' and doesn't goes over-the-top with things, despite the presence of lots of fantasy elements and characters in it.Another thing worth mentioning is the musical score by Joe Hisaishi. Some great stuff!Whether you like anime or not, this is a great fantasy-adventure movie for everybody, everywhere!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.nl/",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Brilliant stroy backed with stunning animation,"Princess Mononoke was on may radar for some time before I first saw it. Hearing that it was a 'Miyazaki master piece' but not really knowing what to expect. However as I started to watch the opening of the film I could tell from the amazing musical score and the breathtaking animation that I was watching a truly captivating film.As the story progresses you get a more three dimensional look at the characters in the film looking from all points of view seeing whats everyone wants. In particular you get a good look at the main character Ashitaka(voiced by Billy Crudup) as he tries to stop a conflict between San(voiced by Claire Danes) ,a girl raised by wolves, who is helping lead the wolves and other Forrest creatures up against Lady Eboshi(voiced by Minnie Driver) the Head of a village who are gradually destroying the Forrest for the resources the land has.Compared to other films Princess Mononoke should rank among the best animated films as it have a level of grandness that could only be matched by films like The Lord of the rings. Over the years this film has also been compared with other anime films however this film has a completely different tone to most of them as you don't get a shonin vibe or a high school romance. Overall I think that This one of Miyazaki's best films and probably one of the greatest animated films ever. That's why I'm giving it a 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

A fantasy fix you simply won't get any other way,"No one tells a more imaginative, original story than Hayao Miyazaki. While fantasy is a genre with limitless potential, there's still nothing like one of Miyazaki's animated fairy tales and ""Princess Mononoke"" is one his finest.The story follows a young warrior named Ashitaka who gets bitten and cursed by some sort of forest demon. The wound is surely fatal unless he embarks on a journey to find a cure. In his travels, he stumbles across a town of iron miners who are seemingly at war with wild animals, namely a pack of wolves and their princess, San. Ashitaka must try to play peacemaker as the forest's deer god--who both sides seek out for different reasons--might be his only means of a cure.The animation that brings a world of fantasy but also of feudal Japan to life is excellent. So many of the creatures are transparent, the large demons and gods are drawn of individual organism-like things that all move on their own while also making up a whole. The work must have taken forever. The nature backgrounds are also beautifully drawn. While most of the work and figures are in traditional anime style, the magical creatures will amaze you and the action is particularly well-directed to enhance the visual experience.""Princess Mononoke"" is a film for those who either have an appreciation of anime or more simply, an appreciation for imagination. Miyazaki's deer god sweeping through the land, his forest demons consuming people, Ashitaka's living scar, etc. are all things that simply inspire the imagination in everyone.While the film leaves its biggest impression as just a one-of-a-kind fairytale, there is some definite effort made to show that this battle between the humans and the wild animals is representative of man's struggle with nature. It is a fantastical dramatization of how we often upset the balance and harmony between the two. For people who have been exposed to nothing but Western film with Western ideas, this is quite a refreshing theme rooted in Buddhist philosophy and other Eastern religions, but certainly one all cultures can understand.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
excellent animation,"This animated Japanese-style film follows a young boy through the forest to rid himself of a curse. The film is about Nature and humans and the gods of all things. The young boy tracks down Princess Mononoke to help him. The film is beautifully animated and enjoyable. It also has some good insights about the culture and showing the important balance (or imbalance) between humans and Nature. It has some good lessons to learn here. This is a film that can be enjoyed and sets itself above many of the other animations coming out these days. It's serious, yet it is refined; it does have a refined sense of humour in a couple of places. I recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Missing Out on the Smaller Moments,"This feels like a back to basics for Miyazaki, his second film (Nausicaa in the Valley of the Wind) was in a wholly original world but the following few were all our world with a touch of magic. Here the world is full of strange creatures, giant boars, deer with the face of god knows what and weird demon monkeys. This film descends into some pretty trippy stuff. Sadly while these weird creatures are fun I think going whole-hog (pun intended) with the fantasy ends up with us losing out on some of the more intimate human elements and small character interactions. They are still present but not as numerous as in his other works which is a shame.The animation is as always delightful, every subsequent film he makes, the animation just gets better and better. The creature and costume designs here shine through as otherworldly, the star being the spirit of the forest. It's difficult to describe but it's a bit like a deer crossed with a baboon. The main protagonist, Ashitaka is likeable, San, the wolf girl, is fine but it didn't feel like I knew enough about her to become attached. My favourite character was this weird ugly short fella, Jiko-bo. At points it's unclear what he's trying to do or why but he's funny to look at which is enough to please my simple brain.This film is good, but for me it never quite lands the with the same punch that films like Totoro, or Kiki's Delivery Service do. This film feels like an attempt at a slightly more grown up tale, showing us blood (surprisingly) and war, and while it's central message of looking after the environment is good. I think this is one of Miyazaki's weaker films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Not as good as advertised,"I suppose I am a glutton for punishment. I've had a love/hate relationship with anime for quite some time now. Despite being disappointed more often than pleasantly surprised. I keep coming  back for more for some reason. I suppose it's because I hope that sometime someone will get it right and finally mix stunning  visuals (of which there are plenty in the anime world) with a coherent plot, and an interesting story (of which there are woefully few).Princess Mononoke fits into this category quite nicely. The visuals are absolutely breathtaking. I would rate it in the same  category along with other fantastic anime like Macross Plus, Ninja Scroll, Ghost in the Shell, and Wings of Honneamise. The framerate was better than average for most anime. The only place I think they could have improved was on the behemoth night-walker spirit, which seemed a little choppy at times.The soundtrack is one of the best you'll hear. The musical score in particlar excels right through to the end of the movie. The sound effects were outstanding also. If a soundtrack CD is offered for this movie, I'll buy it in a heartbeat.Where the movie really disappoints is with the storyline. This is tragic too, because there are so many good characters on which to develop and plot devices (the tree spririts were fantastic) to use. After the first 30 minutes or so, the plot becomes incoherent, with no clear direction, and the characters sink into the not necessarily good/bad roles that has become the norm for anime.I feel that Princess Mononoke scores highly on technical merit, but really lacks when it comes to an involved, entertaining storyline. I hope that anime studios will learn from this, and in the future hire some talented writers to match their artists.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The most beautiful movie I have ever seen,"I haven't seen this movie in a long time, but I still stand by my choice as this being the best film of the 1990s (that I saw anyway). This was simply the most stunning and beautiful animation I have ever seen. Disney wishes they can make a movie that looks this good. From the opening scene in Ashitaka's village to the forest of the gods, and even the factories of Iron Town, Miyazaki never lets up on creating a wonderful piece of cinematic beauty (He drew over half the frames himself). Also his attention to detail with how the rain falls and hits the ground, how characters move and talk, and flies buzzing in the background. Hell, live action movies wish they could do something this good.All that is worth two hours of your time, but now we add a complex story where there are no good guys and bad guys just people. There is a lot of action in this film which is unusual for a Miyazaki film, but the plot calls for it, and it doesn't detract from the character development. Each character is well defined and has real depth. The screenplay is powerful and emotional. Most live action films can't achieve the complexity of Princess Mononoke, and it would have to be even harder for animation to convey real life feelings, but as I watched it, the script and beauty kept drawing me in further and further.The voice acting was OK for the US version, and outstanding for the Japanese version. Billy Bob Thorton was completely wrong for any part of this movie (a southern accent in Japan?). The other American voices were all adequate. Interesting note, the voice for the wolf god that Gillian Anderson does was done by a male for the Japanese version. The music was as breathtaking as the animation, and was a perfect match, especially at the end during the restoration scene. This is one of the best musical scores I ever heard, and I'm surprised it didn't get the recognition it deserved. Anyways, the song (Japanese, not American) was also beautiful. 10/10 for both US and Japanese versions, but watch the Japanese version if you can.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
How does one act in the face of unsolvable problems?,"This is a sophisticated film with complex cultural, political and personal themes which just happens to be animated. As in real life, each character has parts that you love and parts that you hate. Ashitaka's impassivity in the face of his fate seems beautiful and noble at the beginning of the film but becomes frustrating, even enraging at the end. Eboshi destroys nature to rescue humans on the brink of destruction. Nobody apologizes for their bias, just like in life. Some critics have accused the plot of being driven by the stupidity of the characters, but this critique holds them to the standards of current US society. Nineteenth century Japan was a society strictly regulated by traditions, traditions that were being threatened by Western incursions into Japan. The characters act the only way that they can act - they do their best in an incomprehensible, unsolvable situation. Personally, I sided with Mononoke, but Ashitaka acts with honor in every situation that he faces. I hope that I would have his inner strength in the face of such problems. Things are not neatly wrapped up at the end. This is only one battle in the war between burgeoning Japanese industry and the ancient gods. The war still rages on in Japan as it does in the United States. Oh, the animation is superb. And, for goodness sake, watch it in Japanese with subtitles.

A return to epics,"Miyazaki makes his return to creating epics with this film. While I can't say I like it more than ""Nausicaä,"" I can definitely understand why this film was as popular and successful as it was.Let me just say though, it's probably Miyazaki's darkest, and most pessimistic, film. Severed heads, severed limbs, and a surprising amount of blood amd gore are featured in the film. No problem with this really, but it can be shocking coming off films like, ""My Neighbor Totoro.""Miyazaki counters this pessimism with his usual happy ending though, and it makes great use of his two major themes. Love, and respect for nature. In fact, the respect for nature theme may come off as heavy-handed for some, but it never bothered me.The film also has a wonderful English dub. A classic for a reason!

Possibly the best film by Hayao Miyazaki,"I have a long history with this movie. When I was about 7 I caught it on tv late at night and was interested but didn't know what was happening. I was traumatized by the violence and scary images. I legitimately had nightmares! So I avoided this movie for years. But, nearly 15 years later and I am a big Studio Ghibli fan. I knew I had to watch it. I was not disappointed.
The story of the movie has the feel of a Tolkien epic. A prince goes on a journey to lift a curse off of him. He meets spirits, gods, a town of outcasts and more. The plot is brilliantly put together and tight. There is no wasted moment. The characters are all well written and developed. There's a lot of ambiguity in the film. No character is a stock character and their motives could be easily commended or condemned. I think this leaves the viewer to interpret how they feel.
The animation is so beautiful. Over 100,000 drawings were used in the film. It's colorful, vibrant and feels alive. It screams animated masterpiece.
There's something about Ghibli films that give you a certain feeling. Kinda like what you get when you watch a great classic Disney film. I can't quite put my finger on what the feeling is. Not quite nostalgic, but it's a good feeling nonetheless.
There's so much to talk about. If you love Japanese animation, or just animation in general, then this is a must see! Be warned though! This can be a very violent movie. If you want your younger kids to see a Ghibli film then try My Neighbor Totoro or Ponyo. But once their older, show them this film.

So me gving this the credit it deserves, is not even close to me dishing out critique on others.Especially not because of the content. While I do love it when there is an eco message in the movies (and that's another thing with Studio Ghibli, or rather was, since they retired), it doesn't mean I can't enjoy a silly animated movie too (whatever it may be, Pets, Despicably me and so forth). Having put that out of the way, there are so many things included here, that even if you didn't know it was from Studio Ghibli, they have their way of telling stories, of animating them, of putting characters into them (and into peril). Mostly with a lot of innocence, but also a lot of violence too. They don't shy away from showing certain aspects of life (like death, the circle of life, with blood and all).So if you can bare that, the struggle is real and it is very well made.

His travels lead him to the unscrupulous ""Lady Eboshi"" who has developed a smelting process that enables her to make guns - giving her not only advantage against the other local clans, but also helping her on her quest to kill the gods and the wolves lead by the Princess Mononoke whom they have raised from infancy. The story is great, the colourful and detailed animation moves the fable along well and excitingly with plenty of solid characterisation and action a-plenty. As ever with Miyazaki, there is a moral to the story - and the last twenty minutes exemplify that beautifully. The English language dubbed version has a good cast injecting personality and an extra degree of emotion to the characters too. I did find the forest sprites just a bit too twee, but otherwise this is a great marriage of creativity and legend - and I really enjoyed it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"Tale of Tribes, Iron, Wood, War, and Life","Lots of great film elements. Animation is excellent, directing is well done, scenes are epic, characters well developed, voice acting is spot on for dubbed. There's a sense of tension nearly throughout the film, drawing the viewer into this incredible, weird world that looks strangely familiar. Some comical elements thrown in for fun to break up the heavy theme.Despite all the fantastic studio work and bang-up start, it seems the story & writing begin to unravel a bit, wandering, getting lost in the woods. I've seen the film a pair of times, and the end seems to finish with a shrug. It may be a commentary on the reality of mankind and nature, but needed some kind of anchor or point to making the film for it to earn a re-watchable rating.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Entangled in its own ambitions,"The underlying message conveyed in the film is praiseworthy, as it promotes the idea of establishing peace and harmony among long-standing adversaries. It also advocates for harmony and coexistence while addressing the pressing concerns of deforestation and animal cruelty.However, the delivery of this message falls short of its intended impact, often becoming entangled and trapped within its own ambitious scope. It seems as though the authors desired it to serve as a messenger for every conceivable issue, ranging from mysticism and spiritualism to the preservation of nature and tribal conflicts.Regrettably, the narrative fails to prioritize any one aspect, resulting in my inability to fully engage with the story and its characters as I typically do with similar narratives.And thus I find myself dissatisfied with the overall outcome.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The Defying Creation about Deified Creatures...,"I saw ""Princess Mononoke"" twice the same weekend but I'm not sure I grasped half of what makes it such a great movie. Even 'great' is too vague a word; so many 'great' movies are not one-tenth the film ""Princess Mononoke"" in style, content and universal implications.Even after two viewings, I can only provide a superficial overview on the story and a meager but enthusiastic review of what constitutes one of the best animated movies of the last decades. To think that the same year, Disney came up with ""Hercules"" gives you an idea of where the real magic of animation operatedthanks to the most imaginative creator and most accomplished artist of his generation: Hayao Miyazaki. Indeed, imagination and artistry never got along so well since Walt Disney. Now, to the story.Although set in medieval Japan, ""Princess Mononoke"" ventures between the realms of history and fantasy, in a universe where the spirits of a God-like Nature govern the lives of (precisely) all living creatures: animals, plants and even men, they all coexisted in harmony until the age of deforestation. The film opens when a wild demonically possessed creature attacks the village of Ashitaka. And the tone is set from the start: the monster looks like a giant boar recovered by a sort of tentacles looking like writhing snakes, the drawing dwarfs any CGI abomination. You might as well compare a Rembrandt with a 4-year old kid's painting.The film was made in the late 1990's at the dawn of the CGI frenzy and when 3D animation would drive half the box-office grosses, but all the special effects of the world will never hold a candle to the power of hand-painting. ""Princess Mononoke"", the highest-grossing movie in Japan but soon-to-be dethroned by ""Titanic"", required a level of precision that couldn't do without traditional drawing. Miyazaki resorted to computer for a few hundred shots, only 1% of celluloid, but it says something about the man's pragmatism as he could also embrace technology to keep a fair balance between his stylish and narrative visions.And it works. When Ashitaka defeats the monster, everything looks real and the injury resulting from the fight doesn't have the contrivance of a 'magical' plot device. Ashitaka's arm is infected by a mysterious curse that will ultimately cause his death although giving him temporary superpowers (like decapitating someone with his a simple arrow shot). The village's wise woman tells him he must be exiled for his own good, to save his arm with the help of the Gods of the forests. Then starts the heroic and epic journey of the young Prince.From what I read, a few words were mistranslated, he's not actually a Prince and the girl who gives him the talisman isn't his sister, they're actually lovers. It doesn't undermine the comprehension of the story but it shows that the film is impregnated by Japanese culture and some idioms might be lost in translation. Even the title is misleading: Mononeke doesn't refer to the name of the Princess, but her status as a ""possessed monster or outcast"", this description, from human perspective, isn't objective but it reflects her status as someone between two worlds. Her real name is San and she was raised by the Goddess-wolf.San is like a counterpart to Ashitaka, both human protagonists deeply related to the animal world, one by choice and one by fate. While San resents humans for their destructive actions and their effects on animals (we'll learn later that the boar-demon was cursed by a bullet lodged in his body), Ashitaka is a collateral damage of men's actions but he's incapable of hatred, and empathize with both animals' and men's pleas. As usual with Miyazaki, this is not your typical ""good vs. evil"" story. The closest character to a villain is Lady Eboshi, the chief of Irontown, and she cuts trees to make iron and build the fortress where many social outcasts, ex-brothel workers and lepers work in exchange of food and protection.Eboshi has understandable motives and she's also a powerful woman respected by men and therefore, needing to assert her authority. Even the main antagonist, Jiko-bo, a sneaky monk, has a mission: taking the head of the Forest Spirit for the Emperor, he's like a government worker, so to speak. Ashitara is like the centerpiece of an arena where creatures struggle to find peace and harmony; even the Gods Animals are unequally pacific. The environmentalist statements aren't spoken at the expenses of realism. We do root for Nature and accept Miazaki's protection of environment but there's the idea of people defending their own interests, for their own survival. It's not realism, but lucidity.But lucidity doesn't undermine the dazzling visuals: the forest looks majestic, the wolves have that furry amplitude that shows how determined they are, and the magic displayed whether to convey a sense of danger or beauty is hypnotically beautiful. But that's only the tip of the iceberg, there's more to see in the film. Even the romance between San and Ashirata is handled with a sense of maturity that respects the coherence of the plot and our intelligence.""Princess Mononoke"" surpasses everything Disney made in the last years before and everything Peter Jackson will make, CGI can look fine but you're always tempted to cheat with it, computer does the trick. There was a screen writing manual titled ""Save the Cat!"" and explaining how most movies, especially on the field of animation and fantasy / sci-fi journeys were based on the same structure. I dare anyone to find a usual pattern in ""Princess Mononoke"", this is a film that defies all the conventions and where every frame is original and surprising.To put it simply, ""Princess Mononoke"" is a great animated film with a great story, can you ask for more?",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Life-affirming art,"The magnum opus of director Hayao Miyazaki and one of the if not the best animation movie ever made. A film that children can watch no doubt, but which still deals with the themes of loss, sacrifice, the non-existent line between good and evil, war, death and the dying state of divinity and spirituality. It's a heavy movie, yet it's never so excessively dark and brutal that you couldn't show it to a twelve-year- old.For me, this is one of those perfect movies that you have the honour of coming across every once in a while. Because it's really hard to find any faults in this movie.The animation? Superb, mind-blowing, unbelievably beautiful from the very first shot of mountains covered in mist to the last shot of the great forest reaching for the heavens.The music? Haunting, soul-altering, beautiful beyond believe. The main theme has had a spot on my daily playlist ever since I saw this film.The characters? Magnificent. Detailed, fluidly animated, easily having more depth than most live-action characters ever created. I also love how this movie has no clear bad guys. The clash between the spirits of the forest and the civilization of man is the central focus of the film, but you very quickly realize that neither of those sides is in the wrong. They both have reasons for their actions, for defending what they see as theirs. The methods of both are at the same time commendable and questionable. Name one other movie where you've seen anything similar. I bet you have to think about it for a while.If you had to point fingers and say that those are the bad guys, you probably would go with the bounty hunters. But even they're rather likable as characters and are only doing what they're doing because it's their job. So yeah, not even them.And sure, the movie has flaws. No film has not. The eponymous Mononoke is not all that central to the conflict and is easily the most boring of the main characters. The deer god does look silly. Don't act like he doesn't. Other things like that. But they're all really minor. Nitpicks, if even that. Because the film is just that good.Princess Mononoke renews my hope for life every time I see it. It hasn't lost even a hint of its beauty, splendor and impact over the years. If you're ever going to see only one Japanese animation, see this one.

We're presented the whole connections between the forest's gods, its tribes and its leaders in their attempt to stop the greedy humans from destroying everything in their blind quest for fortune.

Just beautiful,"""Princess Mononoke"" is a beautiful anime from the one and only Hayao Miyazaki. This is a superb movie with great characters, wonderful animation and music and it also has many important messages for its audience. Characters are not like your black-and-white disney-like stereotype where all the characters are as good or as evil as they can possibly be. No, all characters found here appear to be more like a human being, where everyone possess good as well as evil qualities.  Philosophy also plays an important part here, where one of the movie`s strongest themes is mankind`s relationship with nature. Miyazaki delivers once again a mesmerizing tale that possess both the power to entertain but also to make us think about our role in the world.10/10",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"I'm sure you're very good at what you do, Doctor Fell","Disney animation has linear detail, economical drawing, and extremely sophisticated motion.  In a word, it's classical.  Japanese animation has vertical detail, heavily etched backdrops that verge on being overdesigned, but rudimentary motion.  Japanese animation is baroque.  (Disney cartoons tend to have better draftsmanship, but this is inessential to the difference in style.)  The styles could hardly be more fundamentally opposed, and you like either one or the other.  It's hard to have a strong taste for both. To lay my cards on the table, I like the Disney style: I consider it more subtle and versatile, and at its best it lives and breathes like no other kind of animated image.  Still, the Japanese style has its strengths.It's essentially a static art: silence and stillness are what it conveys best.  It's interesting to compare ""Mononoke"" with ""The Emperor's New Groove"".  The latter film is unusual for Disney in that silence and stillness are used with surprising frequency, but the effect is always unstable: stillness is a kind of dissonance, something requiring resolution. The moments of silence and stillness in ""Mononoke"" are consonant and complete in themselves.  There are some lovely static tableaux in which the dialogue - if there is any - has as much time as it needs to breathe.The Japanese style is also good at conveying a sense of place.  (Disney can do this also, but neither as quickly nor as economically.)  Usually it's an urban place.  Think of definitive anime, and most Westerners think of ""Akira"" and ""Ghost in the Shell"", which are very urban indeed.  (My personal favourite in the genre is ""The Crimson Pig"", which, if not quite so urban, is heavily technological.)  ""Mononoke"" is different.  Most of the action takes place in the untamed, and I mean untamed, wilderness; now and then we enter a village.  Surprisingly, even these settings are solidly realised.  A single drop of water falls from a pine tree and lands on someone's face, and at once we feel that we are in the middle of a dense, damp, green forest.The story is deeply weird, in the best Japanese tradition - in particular, in the tradition of this particular director - and intensely sad.  The hero's quest is fulfilled, in a sort of a way, but the film does not end in triumph.  Instead of thinking ""good, X happened"", we think, ""oh well, at least X happened"".  -I must admit I was surprisingly unmoved.  Something about ""Mononoke"" distanced me; it may have been the facelessness of the central hero, it may have been the overall style; if the latter, it may have been entirely my fault, which is why I'm unwilling to commit myself to any kind of criticism.  All I know is that, much as I admired parts of ""Mononoke"", I am unable to love it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Oh--My--GOD!,"Okay. I'm not a big anime fan. I can't stand the ones that look like Dragon Ball Z. I despise the ones that look like Ghost in the Shell. Pokemon is silly. Sailor Moon turned stupid. And so far, the only show that looks decent is Escaflowne. And Pokemon the Movie was the worst animated movie I've ever seen. I didn't even bother seeing the sequel. I was also slightly disappointed by Grave of the Fireflies. But this. This is something else. This is something magical. It's probably the only anime movie worth watching, although I could be wrong. First the positives. The characters are realistic and well developed. There are no true ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"". The story is also great, sometimes sophisticated. Although the premise has been done to death, this is more than just your average environment movie. Finally, there's the animation. It's beautiful and breathtaking, especially with the backgrounds. The Nightwalker sequence is probably the one of the better animated pieces in history. Now the negatives. While the movie is wonderful to look at, the animation technique is still anime, which drives me crazy to no end. Those used to Disney's fluid style of drawing and animating will find the hyperactivity and shortcuts of anime a tad unrealistic and maybe even cartoonish. The movie also tries to do too many things at once, and as a result, certain parts look unfinished, rushed, or unpolished. Some parts even seem unnecessary. Finally there's the ending. Do all animes end in a wimpy, ambiguous note? Because I'm not used to it. These flaws aren't enough to make it a bad movie. On the contrary, this is a fantastic movie. However, this won't receive a perfect 10 from me, just a 9.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"Perfect, but...","... despite much has been made of Neil Gaiman's dubbed lines, you should absolutely watch it in Japanese with subtitles. The dubbing actors seem not to completely understand the intonations their characters' lines require, which, to me, made the first 20 minutes rather confusing. It was only when I switched to Japanese that it all seemed to make sense. Don't ask me why, like I said I guess it's intonation. Furthermore, it's always daft not to see a movie in its original language. And that goes for anime too, unless you still believe it's not real film.But this is! OK, we've seen the story about nature vs humans before (after all, is that not what the Arthur / Merlin / Morgana / Mob legends are all about?), but what makes this one stand apart is 2 things: 1. no one is all good or all evil; 2. the visuals are stunning and testify of an imagination unbound by logic. These 2 points are crucial, for it is there that most Disney films or plain Hollywood films go wrong - one could say that they're made by 5 year olds. But no, it's just the reverse! Most Disney animation and Hollywood stuff is made by 'soundly reasoning' adults with an emotional life not reaching beyond love and hate, motivational insight not going beyond revenge (or getting laid) and an imagination enslaved to logic. This film isn't, and as a consequence some call it 'difficult'. And not suitable for children. Let me tell you, 5 year olds have, with their boundless imagination, no difficulty getting into this.This film is just so good it's hard to believe someone just sat down at a table, wrote the thing and then drew it on a piece of paper.** Addition ** I've recently read the Nausicaa anime, and it becomes even clearer now that Mononoke is Miyazaki's re-take on his Nausicaa film (which was premature even in its full-length format), with Nausicaa split in two over Ashitaka & San. However, though this is obviously Miyazaki's second best (after Laputa), it remains difficult to pour all the complex musings about man's relationship to nature in 2 hours (the Nausicaa manga is over a 1000 pages long and took him 13 years; when it was finished he made Mononoke). Hence, some things (like Ashitaka helping out Eboshi even after she's done such evil deeds) have left some viewers bewildered. In all, I found the persona of Nausicaa (in the manga) more fit, in her responsible role as a princess, to convey The Message than the split version here. Still, the very idea about man & technology vs. nature and the question of ""is anything ever over"" (ewige wiederkehr, the cycle of life) is at its most nuanced here. In any case, image-wise, I doubt you'll ever see anything as beautiful as this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

A beautifully executed film from Studio Ghibli,"Animals, their gods and humans clash in this fantasy adventure from famed Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki. Consequently, nature vs humanity is a strong theme throughout Princess Mononoke, meaning that this is an animated movie with a definite message. Most of the humans, after all, are from a mining village who rape the earth, while the sympathetic people are Ashitaka, a boy who fights to bring peaceful co-existence between the opposing forces and Princess Mononoke who actively sides with the animal world and lives amongst them. It's quite clear, therefore, where the film's sympathies lie, although the ecological message is never delivered in a trite obvious manner and there are many shades of grey throughout.The tone overall is decidedly more mature than most animation and is one of the films from Studio Ghibli that goes for an older adult audience as opposed to the usual family friendly one. It's even quite violent in places, including several decapitations. But irrespective of the darker material it resembles Ghibli anime quite clearly. In any case this renowned animation studio had already released adult fare beforehand, anyone who has seen the harrowing Grave of the Fireflies will understand this. But in terms of visual artistry Princess Mononoke fits right in to the whole Ghibli cannon perfectly. In fact, this one has to be one of their greatest achievements on this front. The forest scenery is stunningly rendered and the invented creatures are consistently interesting. Of note are the wild boars, the night monkeys and the wolf god Moror but most spectacular of all is the deer-like god Shishigami - the colossal nightwalker. This latter being stalks the land in the twilight and generates a strange atmosphere and ambiance all of its own. The scenes towards the end involving it, illustrate the sheer imagination that Ghibli is famed for. The plot-line is not especially great if I am honest but it allows for the film to cover its themes successfully, while integrating them into a wonderfully rendered fantasy world. Like all Ghibli, it benefits considerably too from evolving unashamedly and organically from Japanese culture and mythology; this ensures that from a western perspective, it consistently remains unpredictable and fascinating.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

The relationship between the people of the iron town, and the inhabitants of the forest show to the viewer that if we don't respect nature, then it will fight back, and we will not win.

One of the best films I've ever seen,"I was sick at home when an anime film began on TV.

This film says the opposite. When one believes something, one must GIVE in order to get the best solution to a conflict. This way of approaching a problem, cannot be better displayed than Ashitaka in the film. Wonderful. I've seen the film in Spanish so perhaps then sentence is different, but the one saying ""I've come to understand without being influenced by hate"" could be very profitable for human kind.After the film I watched all Miyazakies, and I must say that the only one that is almost as good as this one is Naussica.Regards",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
FilmCreature Reviews 'Princess Mononoke',"The first time I saw this movie, I was going to give it a 9/10, but now that I have watched it several more times, I see the epic scale of it all. The animation is just beautiful. Wondrous. Hayao Miyazaki is a genius. I love the story, it's like an ancient tale told through the ages.The story begins with Ashitaka (voiced by Billy Crudup) battling a giant demon. It turns out to be a huge boar covered with black, evil worm-like creatures. Some of the creatures wrap themselves around Ashitaka's arm, and he is infected. ""Though you cannot change your fate,"" he is told by the village wise woman, ""you may rise to meet it."" So Ashitaka begins a journey to be cured of this infection by the mysterious forest spirit, a glorious creature you must see for yourself. Along the way, he battles samurai and makes a stop in Irontown, ruled by the ruthless Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver), and encounters a monk named Jigo, who gives him advice and is friendly towards him.

It was suited the movie's story and themes certainly, but it sure startled me.But if you're not looking for a Disney flick, this is one impressive and wildly imaginative movie. Many scenes are absolutely amazing, and the last half hour is truly stunning.The attitude of the movie is very interesting. This is basically technology vs. Nature, but even though the film's sympathies lie more with living with nature, the technology side is not portrayed as evil but instead for the most part as good people with a different world view.

A not so royal princess,"Medieval Japan. Ashitaka has been infected with a strange disease when he killed a mysterious demon boar covered with leaches that attacked his village. On his journey to find a cure he meets lady Eboshi, a female leader of a town exploiting the forest and fighting with creatures protecting the nature. The leader of those creatures is San, princess Mononoke...When I first went to see ""Princess Mononoke"" I expected a gentle, romantic, dreamy fairy tale. Was I surprised when I saw the raw and brutal story! This is in my opinion Miyazaki's most violent film, but non the less, it really is an impressive anime. I wouldn't necessary put it on the 102. place on the IMDb's top 250 films, but I admit it has something in it that fascinates me.-------The most clever aspects of the story are the ones about how lady Eboshi is tricking her people into helping her exploit the Forest, while at the same time dismissing the wolf's revenge attacks as something illogical. Also, just watch the sequence where San is being captured inside a sea of red leaches on a demon boar: the part where Ashitaka jumps into that bunch of leaches trying to save San from them, but is being catapulted into the water, is pure dark poetry and romance in one. Also, there's the spectacular image of the gigantic deer god's body walking through the hills.Still, Miyazaki made a lot of mistakes. The middle of the film is repetitive and too long making only the end exciting, the characters are somewhat wooden and the whole mood of the anxious world is way over the top. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone younger than 16. Also, I miss a lot of humor Miyzaki had in his previous films. I got the idea he made ""Mononoke"" just because he was in his depressive ""I hate the world"" phase. All in all, the epic ""Princess Mononoke"" deserved it's success( it's average critic's grade on rotten-tomatoes.com is 7.7/10 ), but in the long term there was still something missing in it's story. What? Just watch ""Being there"" or ""The Graduate"" and you'll see what.Grade: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Mononoke Hime,"My favorite Miyazaki movie! Maybe not as good as Spirited Away, not as innocent as the Totoro movie and not as European as Howl's Moving Castle. Maybe that's why I like it! It's filled with excellent characters, beautiful music, outstanding animation, and so on. Sometimes less is enough. The other positives are maybe that it's cannot be fully understanded - that's what I love in Miyazaki. He never explains everything, never tells us what to think, but after one of his films, we always feel that we've learnt something very important. And the biggest positive thing in him: he still believes in hand-drawn animation, and all we should do is thank him every time he makes a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Jon Monsarrat review:  not bad considering its anime,"I'm not hostile towards anime, but neither am I an anime fanatic. I enjoyed ""My Neighbor Totoro"", ""Ghost in the Shell"", and ""Akira"", and have suffered through Tenchi Muyo, Ranma, Final Fantasy, and others.If you like anime, it's certainly worth watching. If you're a regular movie-goer, there is something lacking. There is a lot of complexity regarding who's who which is easy to miss. There's an interesting point to the film about how anger can just take over somebody and turn them into a monster. But I found the fantasy components to be a little too silly. Various gods have various powers and relationships for little reason.Who should see this film:-- adults who like anime, or kids-- fantasy movie goers who might dip into fantasy once in a whileI'll give ""Princess Mononoke"" a 5 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Well animated but tedious,"I rated this movie a 5 out of 10 purely because it is the only anime movie I've ever been able to stand watching all the way through.  It is so well animated that about half-way through, you even forget that it is anime. However, the story is boring and hard to follow.  I never figured out where this movie was headed, and in the end, I was disappointed and confused.This movie is too violent for kids, and too tedious for adults.  But if you want to prove that it is possible for anime to be done well, you might want to see this movie.  Otherwise, I'd advise not renting it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Holy sh*t!,"*Note: for fully imersing oneself in this film one has to watch it in Japanese. Do not watch in English unless you want to watch with with kids under the age of 10 (well, when I was 10 I was already watching everything subtitled, people should not be afraid of subtitles).The most powerful experience I ever had watching anything (be either a film, a TV series, theater or a show) was the second time that I watched this film.The first time I didn't really give respect this film deserves (I though it was a childish cartoon and I watching it for a guilty pleasure) and actually failed to really get it. After watching several other movies I remembered this film and I noticed it was truly better than anything else I had watched lately, so I decided to watch it again, this time really paying attention to it: The first few minutes were already better than the last five films I had watched put together. When it ended I cried and was unable to sleep for 5-6 hours, thinking about how freaking awesome this film was.This film features the most powerful score ever. I would call it truly a heavy score, like Black Sabbath, but more epic and without distortion. Most film scores are just background noise that serves to convey emotion, but here the score has a life of its own. Indeed, the score alone makes this film better than 90% of all other movies.Edit: Today a viewed this film for the third time. It became BETTER than the second time. I also viewed 2001: A Space Odyssey for the third time in the same day, and this film totally destroyed 2001 and I consider 2001 one of the best films ever made, but this film made it look like an episode of Family Guy by comparison.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Beautiful New Sylvan Mythology,"My daughter makes me watch these. Nine times out of ten I'm glad. This time I was ecstatic! Ashitaka's village is threatened by a demon boar. In killing the boar, Ashitaka's arm takes on the infection that has turned the boar into a demon. He must leave his village, knowing his fate, knowing that when he fully becomes a demon, he could kill them all.In his travels, he encounters a huge range of characters and situations, ending with what I can only call a great mythology. The movie is breathtaking.One thing I truly love about this show (I hope this isn't a spoiler) is that in the end there are no villains. There are antagonists and protagonists, but everyone is genuinely, sincerely doing what she or he thinks is the best thing. This is a great, artistic, true expression of how things usually are.

A masterpiece in anime,"There have been many times where after watching an anime, I have found myself seriously questioning the value of the medium. Whether due to misogynism, gratuitous violence, or tentacles, I walk away wondering what is going on in Japanese culture. Princess Mononoke, like Miyazaki's other works, is not a vehicle for shameless fan-service, nor does it rely on the tired and implausible concept of mecha as its selling point, unlike so much anime I have seen. Instead, it deals with the age-old tension between human attempts to shape the environment for its own ends and the life-and-death power of nature.Despite its clear point, Princess Mononoke does not stray into obvious lines of good and evil or try to drop the message on the viewer like an anvil. Rather, it portrays both sides of the conflict in a balanced manner, showing the good and the bad and depicting the harm brought by hate on both sides. Perhaps the only major flaw I can see is that Miyazaki's romanticized monarchism, which leads him to again bring out the decidedly clichéd heroic warrior-prince/princess.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Definitely Creative...,"STORY: The movie isn't really centered around princess Mononoke, so that's kind of misleading. It's more focused on a poisoned warrior who is sent away from his hometown. The whole movie seems to be a metaphor for deforestation, industrialization and environmentalism. While the movie gets the point across, it's a bit on the nose. Along the way, there is endless creativity with characters and scenery, which is refreshing and reminds me of the true capabilities of anime. Overall it's a compelling enough story but not really surprising or eye opening.ACTING: The English dubs of the movie were honestly my biggest qualm. I feel like Minnie driver and billy bob thorntons voices did not match the vibe of the characters at all. It was distracting. I recommend watching the movie in its original language with subtitles.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A whole life ideology based on a Japanes anime!,"There aren't words describing how much this movie means to me.

It shows in beautiful characteristics haw much damage mankind does to nature simply by being humans, and way to many! This story takes place in a time long ago when there were few humans and gods roamed the earth. now there are even more of us, and gods have become humble beast for us to kill, stalk and eat.

Highly Overrated,"Don't get me wrong, I love Miyazaki. But that maybe reason why I was disappointed by this one. It is a good movie but I guess I had too much expectation. I'd rate it towards the bottom of Miyazaki movies. My daughter also loves Miyazaki. Her favorites are Totoro and Ponyo. And this one was fairly highly rated so we watched it together. Well, this one is neither for kids or for adults. It's like adult story told by a kid.My daughter was mortified by all the brutal beheadings and body parts flying around. My wife didn't appreciate animated women showing off their cleavages and hitting on a child. And I didn't like how literal the storytelling was. It was basically explaining everything instead of implying it for viewers to think about.The basic plot was good. I even wonder if James Cameron got the idea for Avatar from this movie. The visuals are great and I loved how much detail he put into everything. But that's about it. This movie had so much potential.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Overrated,"This is one of the most overrated anime movies of all time. I think most of the high ratings comes from people who were either stunned by the animation or give it a 10 just because it's anime. If you don't believe me about the second part, just type in the name of any generic shallow shonen anime and I can almost guarantee it will have at least a 7/10 rating. *cue 1000 ""No this review was not helpful"" clicks*To get this out of the way: The animation is great and overall it's not a bad movie. It's worth a watch.However it's also really slow and dull in many parts plot wise. There are several times where I just wished it would get to the climax so the movie would end.The main characters are pretty 2 dimensional(San and Ashitaka) and I found myself wishing that the movie would spend time on the side characters who are more interesting. San is the heroine who was raised by wolves and hates humans. If you've seen any anime with a generic tsundere(Wikipedia if you don't know what I mean) girl then you basically know her character and everything she'll do right away. Ashitaka is the hero who really has no back story and has a painfully dull ""PLEASE EVERYONE STOP FIGHTING"" personality.The point of the movie, like a few of Miyazaki's other movies is that the environment is cool and we shouldn't burn plastic in our full size SUVs while spraying aerosol cans out the window. While that's not a bad message for a movie to tell, Princess Mononoke does it really heavy handedly and seems like it wants to make you feel bad for human progress.Anyway, most of this ranting is to offset the hundreds of ""THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST THING EVER"" reviews and I honestly don't dislike the movie THAT much. I just think it could be a lot better for what the hype surrounding it promises.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

The greatest animated film of all time.,"This film would be inside the top 10 films of all time were people in the west only more aware of it. In England we grow up on an unappealing diet of Disney tripe, but we don't realise it is so shoddy because it's all we have. This is because we don't have a strong animation industry of our own really, with the possible exception of Aardman Animations, and we are gripped by America's commercial stranglehold. The lower classes in this country love America and anything it produces, because they are ignorant, pure and simple. The sad fact is that the average person in the street has not heard of Studio Ghibli or Miyazaki. Consequently they think that Disney films are the acme of animation, and show their children Disney films and take them on holidays to Disneyland. It was such a revelation for me to see my first Studio Ghibli film (Spirited Away) and when I watched more of Miyazaki's masterpieces, most notably Mononoke-Hime, I realised what animation can and should be. There still persists in this country the idea that animation is somehow a lower art form than live-action films, but the more people see this film, the more things will change. Using animation allows a director to fly effortlessly into the realms of fantasy, and Miyazaki is masterful at it. It amazes me that although western animation has been commercially successful for so much longer, the greatest imaginative leap the directors seem to able to make is talking animals. Brilliant. The Studio Ghibli films, however, are not afraid to make films where almost all of the characters are people (Kiki's Delivery Service) because they are not afraid to take on live-action films on their own territory - they don't feel the need to retreat to the safety of talking animals, where live-action will not usually follow. But the thing about Studio Ghibli films is that they have people and fantastical creatures in the same film, and what's more, interacting with one another.But I'm speaking too generally. Mononoke is for me the best of the best - see as many Studio Ghibli films as possible, but I think this one is the most brilliant. Personally I prefer the Japanese versions of Studio Ghibli films with the subtitles which match the Japanese script, because the American cast are pretty poor. It is definitely the most beautiful film I have ever seen, fantastically well drawn, but it doesn't hide behind a pretty facade. The story is cracking, great action scenes mixed with truly poignant ones, and the overall environmentalist theme of the story gets more and more relevant with every 8-mile-to-the-gallon American SUV sold.In a word: stunning. In two words: see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Maybe the Best Animated Film,"I have always loved animated film and cartons, but this film truly blew me away. To me this film is the animated film version equivalent of Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings'. The film creates a world in such detail than the viewer feels as if he/she has been there. The film is beautifully drawn from characters to backgrounds. The characters are not as simplistic as one-dimensional cartoon characters, i.e. the hero is all-good and the villain is pure evil. The two main combatants, Princess Mononoke and Lady Eboshi are shades of gray, thought personally I love the character of Lady Eboshi. The ending also is not cartoonish in that everything is not tried up into a neat little package at the end.

"A very impressive watch, it packs a punch.","When I first saw this film in 1997, it was in its original Japanese version, I was blown away by the animation, but found the story a little hard to follow, my second viewing, featured the English voices, and allowed the pieces to come together.The animation, still looks incredibly fresh, twenty six years old, and still wonderfully detailed, bright and packed with detail, better than anything at the time. The music was equally brilliant.I am surprised still that it hasn't been adapted into a live action movie, the story is a truly brilliant one, it's entertaining, moving, exciting, but it doesn't at any point preach at the viewer, it isn't heavy handed, but it does deliver a pretty big message.It's the perfect mix of art and entertainment, a few sequences make me think it's suitable more so for a mature adult, some scenes may be upsetting for younger children.In terms of the voices, I really liked Claire Danes and Gillian Anderson, I was a bit mixed with Billy Bob Thornton's voice, I'm not too sure it worked with his character.Overall, it was excellent.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

I know that some anime fans hate this movie saying that it is overrated and that ""Akira"" is a much better movie, but I don't agree with that. Don't misunderstood me, ""Akira"" is a excellent movie, is just that ""Mononoke Hime"" is a completely different anime, and the style, story and characters made by Miyazaki are quite different of the ones created by Otomo. Unlike many animated films, that are aimed to children, ""Mononoke Hime"" is a epic story, filled with elements of tragedy, adventure and heroism, and all beautifully told by one of the masters of the animation that is Miyazaki. Every single frame of this movie has a unique beauty, and all the characters, humans or animals are very likable and interesting. This movie isn't overrated.

Wasted potential,"The movie had some pretty big potential. Which it didn't use. In the beginning the story seemed very compelling.

Ashitaka got the same curse from him and now he's supposed to find a way to lift it. He meets princess Mononoke, lady Eboshi and so on. Then the plot gets rushed, boring and uncompelling. I didn't feel any kind of connection with any of the characters, didn't empathize with them, root for them or found them interesting or relatable at all.

"Touching And Beautifully Animated,","Princess Mononoke is a brilliant movie with a fantastic story,nothing like any movie I've seen before,the animation of the movie is also brilliant and is still today considered one of Hayao Miyazaki's (the Walt Disney of Japan) finest work.I don't know if there is an English version of this movie,but the one I was watching was only subtitled,at first I was considering changing the channel because I didn't think id be interested,but it started off so promising,and I decided the subtitles isn't a very big deal.A hunter is bitten by a demon and is now cursed.He must leave his village and find a cure,and he ends up getting involved in a war between the demons and the gods.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Not what I expected,"When the young warrior Ashitaka protects his village from a Forest-God-turned-demon, the curse that had gripped it infects him, threatening his life. For the protection of his kin and in order to revert this process, he leaves on a journey. He finds a young woman running a lead mill crafting rifles, with ambitions of rule and no care for the damage she does to nature(and he is suffering some of the consequences). And thus we get the not-so-subtle message(hint: she represents mankind). ""Can't we all just get along"" is the idea, but it does actually take the problem more seriously(with a mature sensibility) than other of these, such as Dances With Wolves, Pocahontas, and most recently, Avatar. This also gets into the theme of anger and hate being self-destructive, not only harmful to one's surroundings. There are a lot of concepts in this, and fully comprehending and following it may require several viewings, time devoted to piecing it all together, and prior knowledge and understanding of Japanese culture. This is not for children, or even teens, but adults, setting it apart from every other Miyazaki production I've seen, which is nearly all of them. The acting is very good, and I urge you to watch this with subtitles, not dubbed. I do wonder why they did not sync up the animals, unlike the humans. The animation is excellent, with memorable designs, and mood expertly built by, among other things, the right amount(and tone, nuance) of light and dark(it also knows when and how to use sound, as well as silence). There is a bit of action, and it's intense, visually appealing and well-choreographed. Sans credits, this is 124 minutes long. The DVD comes with trailers for Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbour Totoro, Porco Rosso, Ponyo, this and Howl's Moving Castle, 2 Promos(coming to a running time of 8 minutes), 3 teasers(2 minutes put together) and 6 TV spots(totaling at 2 minutes). There is a lot of disturbing content, and, what seems somewhat gratuitous, a little violence, blood, gore and hints of sexuality. I recommend this to fans of Anime and those who want films that deal with the environment. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"A brilliant work of love, fantasy, and adult animation.","Can an animated film get any better? The only other Japanese animated films I can think of that I love just as much as this are GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES, AKIRA, SPIRITED AWAY, and GHOST IN THE SHELL. PRINCESS MONONOKE is perfection. The film is simply flawless in it's storytelling, it's animation, it's characters, and it's emotion. The film is about a boy who is cursed with a sickness that will kill him but, at the same time, gives him superhuman abilities. He ventures out of his hometown to find a cure. In the process of finding a cure, he is caught in the middle of a war between animals and humans and gets involved by the leader of the animals, a human female named Princess Mononoke. The film is an epic work of fantasy. Out of all the Fantasy films I've seen in my time, this is probably my favorite. There is so much imagination at work here with the characters and the action. At times things become overwhelming due to the epic scale and the emotion evoked in the storyline and the action. Some of the images in this film are so strange and indescribable that I can easily recommend it on the note that there are sights that you will never see anywhere else, but I don't want to make it sound like a freak show. What makes the film's bizarre images even greater is how the strength of the animation alone can carry it along with the plot in such a elegant and masterful way. It's wondrous when a person can create such images full of beauty and bizarre otherworldliness. I always love when filmmakers do that. The fact that this is animated allows these images to absorb the viewer in much simpler and extraordinary ways. At times the film is so astonishing in how it's able to carry this stuff that it is emotional. I love the film because it reminds me that the human race is capable of creating the most astonishing things.

Anime at its best,"I first saw this film some years ago and it instantly became one of my favorites. It simply has one of the most beautiful plots. I am truly fond of Miyazakis creation and Princess Mononoke is by far his greatest film.The ""ground-breaking motion picture"", as it is described in the trailer, is about a young prince, Ashitaka, finding cure to a deadly curse put on him by a giant demon boar. On the road to salvation he meets Princess Mononoke (San the wolf-princess) and Lady Eboshi the mistress of the Iron town, who is on a campaign to destroy the forest gods for richness in the ground. As Ashitaka is torn between a brutal war between the forest and humans, he tries to make the right decisions and falls in love with San. The film is really about the conflict between nature and civilization. Somehow i feel that Mononoke has such a great story and that Mr Miyazaki has come up with something absolutely extraordinary.The animation itself is beyond doubt, exceptionally amazing. The little details of the forest and its creatures, the whole nature, is just astonishing. Disney and Pixar have a lot to learn and bow down to. The character development is pure and believable. There is no clear villain: everything has both evil and good inside, and that's what makes the story so good. You watch the movie and its magic just absorbs you into the films depth. The soundtrack too, is great and flows with haunting beauty.I truly believe that Princess Mononoke is the best animated movie of all time, it is just so good.

Lovely but not for everyone..,"I don't understand what all the commotion is about with this film.. Yes, it is beautiful to look at and has great characters and artistry, but it's so hard to follow!  It suffers the same deadfall that many, perhaps MOST anime films do.. The plot is just too confusing.  It starts out ok, even the middle of the film is engaging, but by the end of it there is utter confusion:  Too many characters fighting for too many different reasons.  I am even a science major, an adult, and an animation connoisseur, and this film stumps me.  There are all of these different parties going after the forest spirit, but also fighting eachother.  The forest spirit is ambiguous itself, friendly one moment, and then dangerous when its head is cut off. Warriors want to keep the head as a trophy, so they're stirring up trouble for everyone. There are the metal workers who are doing their own thing but inadvertently creating demons when animals get shot.  Sometimes.  Depending on the species of animal which is infected with the bullet. I think.  Then you have the boar people who are fighting everybody and trying to protect the forest.. And the princess and the wolves, who are really aloof and not on anybody's side.  And then there's Ashitaka, who is mixed up with all of them and has the demon infection himself and wants to find a cure. And we have to hurry up and reunite the forest spirit with its severed head, or we're all doomed.Get all that?  Lovely artwork from the characters to the landscape to the action... Breathtaking scenery and mysticism, but a little too muddled to come off triumphant.  This film would be excellent if it were more explanatory, or just had its plot streamlined a bit.  Anime fans may get it, but I think the average American viewer will be up the creek without a paddle.  Or maybe on the shore WITH a paddle.  Anyway, I'm getting dizzy just trying to sort it out.

Humanity...for the good and for the bad.,"One of those movies you don't see every day, month or year. The story is simple, modest and at the same time, groundbreaking and epic for its mix of reality and fantasy (actually the premise is very similar to Nausicaa's). The characters are also very simple.

The visuals are simply stunning, I will go and say: the best the 90's anime have seen.

I mean it's not scary or disgusting it has a gripping effect.The story of love and hate, war and peace, nature and darkness...I saw Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle before and I gotta say this is more realistic than both of them.It is true that tribes of intelligent boars,Kodamas(spirits) in the Deer God's forest, apes, and wolves, along with San (the mononoke princess of the title) who was raised by the wolves looks so mythical but one can evaluate the movie as an environment flick rendered in Japanase mythology.It can be viewed by anyone no matter how old one is!",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"First of all, this film has beauty to break your heart...","...Second of all, there is a LOT of blood in it.You get swarms of blood-engorged maggots, dismemberments, festering wounds, and rivers of black ooze.  You also have the unfortunate victims of demon attacks, who resemble mobile corpses in varying states of decay.Don't get me wrong!  This is one of the most visually stunning and compelling films, animated or not, I have ever seen.  It will stay with me for a long time.  I just wasn't quite prepared for all the gore.

Wonderful!,"More than 20 years after the release of this work, which I had the opportunity to watch thanks to Netflix, which is making all the films of this wonderful studio available.Certainly Princess Mononoke is among my favorite films and along with Spirited Away are my favorites at Studio Ghibli.Those who have not yet watched, give an opportunity to watch this marvel of animation !!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The best anime I have ever seen!,"Seriously, this is the only anime I can say I have seen and liked.The only animes I am familiar with are Dragon Ball, Sailor Moon, Pokemon, etc. You know the television shows. I didn't really like them because they never seemed to take anything seriously. I always wanted something serious from the cartoons, because they were extremely stupid. This movie changed all that.One of my friends in school was telling me about this movie and I thought it sounded interesting. He let me borrow it and I instantly fell in love with it. Everything surprised me in this movie.First off it was extremely long. I mean it in a good way. That a movie over two hours can keep me entertained is something special. (Only movies that can do this are the LOTR trilogy) The art style also kept my attention. I have kind of liked anime art style, but it never seemed to take my breathe away. This movie did. The backgrounds were colorful and detailed, every character, no matter how small the role, had different facial features and depth.To finish this is the best anime ever. The only other anime that has almost held my attention like Princess Mononoke, was Spirited Away. If you like animes and you haven't seen this movie, it is a must.It's too bad I started out on the best anime ever made first.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Looks amazing. At least it has that.,"I like to imagine, 10 year old me, in an alternative reality where the manga style of drawing didn't totally freak me out, catching this movie during some flight to a far away land and being swept away by its strange rhythms and formidable tone.In practice though, I saw this at 16 when I was a lot more jaded. This movie is a stunning clash of positive and negative aspects. It's basically blockbuster syndrome where the whole thing looks and sounds stunning but upon closer examination is pretty shallow.Basically everything about this movie is amazing but its script. Visually stunning with its lush setting coming up against the forces of modernity. The sparing but startling usage of CGI to represent the unholy. The mood, switching from epic battle of man and crazed demon to quite reflection as a stone gets speckled in rain. It ebbs and flows from peaceful to fiery that is hypnotic and compelling. The score will be your new guilty pleasure too.I've seen both the original and English dub. It was back at a time where I struggled to rarely take notice of voice performance when I was reading, but the English dub is fine. It's a mix of tolerable performances (like Mononoke and the main guy) plus some rather enchanting ones (the lascivious guy with the wart plusthe sultry english leader of the human forces).Now for the script: it's sort of different to have a protagonist caught between two sides, neither of which is fully in the wrong but this grey-lighter grey-white morality gets pretty sickly very quickly. I liked the apes and the Kodamas, they were all cool. But the message about the poisonous quality of hate was naive.The protagonist is a one dimensional mouth piece for the writer. He experiences no character development and barely expresses any emotion. He just stoically accepts that he's been banished and does so. He gets a little passionate when he gives grand sanctimonious lectures but they have little nuance beyond ""war is bad, environment is good"". I can totally get behind this on principle but it gives me nothing on how to put this into practice.The title character doesn't really do much. You know that kid in school that chastized you for eating meat? She's that. They try to sort of make them romantic interests but...I don't care about either of them.It ends more satisfyingly that its writers movies usually do. I got real sense of high stakes and conflict that wasn't resolved by easy answers.Frozen is a movie for all ages. This was a kids' movie.See it, but but expect a movie by a master animator, not a master storyteller.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Long, dull, badly dubbed","THIS is one of the most popular Japanese movies of all time???!!! Yes, there's some excellent animation and enough plot for 7 films BUT, not all the animation is good, the plot isn't exactly interesting and gets real silly at times (I gave up when the tigers and boars started having conversations), and the film is WAY too long (130 minutes). Also, the dubbing of the American voices doesn't help at all. The only one who works is Billy Cudup who voices the young hero--his voice fits perfectly. Billy Bob Thornton is horrible--his Texas accent sounds a little out of place in ancient Japan! (Also his character makes no sense and disappears completely in the middle of the movie). Claire Danes makes the princess sound like a spoiled brat and Minnie Driver's English accent sound uproarious on an evil(?) Japanese queen. That's the problem, she reads her lines so unsurely I didn't know how to take them! This is definitely a movie that lost A LOT in the translation. Also there's some real gruesome violence, so this isn't exactly for the kids. A waste of time unless you're amine fan.",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Quick review,This is what I would call the anime movie of the century. It has amazing action and fight scene. It has super graphics and a great storyline its a must see for all movie and anime lovers out there. You can only compare this anime with Dragon Ball is the anime everyone knows and Princess Mononoke anime movie everyone knows Of all the movies I've seen that are anime base this is by far the one i can re-watch over and over again without ever being tired of it its a very memorable movie and i recommend all to give it a chance a must see for all age and sex. To miss it is to miss a chance to see a great movie favourite.,10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Princess Mononoke,"Beautiful. Honest. Startling. Those are some of the words that I would use to begin to describe this masterpiece. Princess Mononoke is a brutally honest look at human nature and man's fight against what we don't understand.This movie depicts our relationship with nature more accurately than I would like to admit. Eiter we want to own it or control it, or we fear it because we don't understand it. This is how we have always been, now perhaps more than ever before. We don't care what happens to what is around us as long as it benefits us. And if don't understand it we want to destroy it. Princess Mononoke is, of course, a fantasized version of that brutality, but it doesn't mean that the message isn't accurate.Although this film is full of ugliness it is also exceptionally beautiful. What has never ceased to amaze me is the feel of these films. Achieved with emotional and beautiful music and gorgeous visuals, it's hard not to love every moment and every scene. No matter how difficult or dark a moment in this film is, there is always beauty in it too.It's hard to find any fault in this film. Sure, the story might drag for a bit too long in the middle but you'll forget about that in no time. It's also quite a violent film. Something that might put some people off. Personally, I thought that it was necessary for this film and it drove the message home very effectively. That's something that I have always loved about Miyazaki's films. No matter how crazy or weird his worlds are, the message always shines through brightly. What's more, the message is always important and good.I'm by no means an expert when it comes to Studio Ghibli or Hayao Miyazaki films. I have seen some them over the years and they have always stood out to me from the sea of movies. They have always stunned me with their beauty and made me reflect on the message they convey. And Princess Mononoke is no different.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Truly amazing and inspiring,"This film works like clockwork and is spotless as a silicon chip in a vacuum-sealed semiconductor lab. Granted it's not as epic as ""Nausicaa"", the superb action sequences, the terrific accompanying score by Joe Hisashi, and the gritty harshness of its dramatic themes made ""Princess Mononoke"" a much tighter package, as well as a more elaborated version of the message put forth in ""Nausicaa."" I understand that Miramax's distribution and marketing of the film up to this point has been rather low-key, but I hope somehow this film will reach enough people to make a change in the mindset of the American public. A note to parents, this is not ""My Neighbor Totoro"" or ""Kiki's Delivery Service."" There is some violence in ""Princess Mononoke"" which may startle younger audiences.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
An incredible achievement in animation,"Not only better than anything you're likely to see from the Disney school of factory filmworks, but quite possibly THE best animated film ever made. The sheer imagination, artistry, and detail in every frame of this work is breathtaking. I applaud Miramax for leaving the American release unedited, both for length and content.Of course, serious fans of Japanese animation will be watching the subtitled version in the original Japanese language.  But given that the majority of American viewers will go with the default dub, a few comments on that version are in order.  The voices are a mixed bag; Danes and Crudup are merely adequate; nothing any competent voice-actor couldn't have pulled off, but a bit lacking in passion at times.  When emotion is expressed, Danes can come off a bit on the whiny side. Thornton's southern accent, though he tries to conceal it, is a bit distracting set among the visuals of historical Japan. Minnie Driver and Gillian Anderson are both quite good, however, and bring great gravity and dimension to their roles. Flawed as it is, it still stands as one of the best dub jobs imported anime has to offer (though not up to the standard of the excellent Akira dub on the special edition DVD).Thematically, this is like a return to Miayazaki's roots.  Its elements of man's declaration of war on the environment, and the environment subsequently fighting back are reminiscent of his first film, Nausicaa.  Of course, the animation, breathtaking background work, and sheer attention to detail bring a level of beauty that Nausicaa couldn't match in its day. Also worth noting is composer and longtime Miyazaki collaborator Joe Hisaishi, who presents one of the best works of his career here.For fans of Miyazaki, the brilliance of this film will not come as a shock, but for everyone else, it should be quite an eye-opener. Just don't show it to your children expecting a Happy Meal cross-over with cute sidekicks and musical numbers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Beautifully done.,"Another film by Hayao Myzaki, Princess Mononoke is a prime example of what a skilled animator can do at the prime of his career.Plot: Like the best of his work, with the execption of Castle of Calligostro, is based heavily upon Japanese Shintoism and Mysticism. Myazaki was enchanted as a child by the traditions of his island country, and it has been an endless source of inspiration. Although a monotheist and a Christian, I enjoyed the film because the god characters, much like the gods of Homer and Aesop, act upon such human feelings as blind hatred and jealousy. Though probably unintentional, Hayao shows what happens when imperfect beings try to create perfection: a god in their image, male and female. The rest of the plot is a standard Man-with-no-name wanderer-type story, whos travels to a mining town to find a feud he's caught in. More time could have been spent on the histories of Moro, San, and Nago, but in the end, Hayao creates an enjoyable time.Animation: For one of the first times, Miyazaki uses digital animation in his films, and very tastefully so. The forest is given his trademark another world look, which I cannot describe beyond it reminds of the Como Conservatory (minnesotans will know.) The Kodamas are adorable, and the animation of the Ape clan at night sent chills up my spine.Voice characterization: Like most translated anime, not perfect. Don't get me wrong, Billy Crudup is talented. Any Big Fish fan will tell you that. He just has trouble with pacing the translated script. He reads very quietly and quickly, lacking clarity sometimes. Claire Danes is slightly better, but still suffers. Minnie Driver, familiar with animation through Tarzan, is very good. The real gems, however, are Billy Bob Thornton and Gillian Anderson. Thornton, a musician, reads his script with amazing clarity and pacing. Jigo's, his character, mouth matches almost all of the time. Anderson, on the other hand, has one of the most beautiful voices of a animation vocal talent I've ever heard. Her haunting, slow reading of the words of the tortured wolf goddess Moro is perfect.Overall: Miyazaki has made family adventures with Castle in the Sky, growing-up films with Kiki's Delivery Service and My Neighbor Totoro, and even slick, 70s crime romps with The Castle of Calligostro. He successfully adds a Yojimbo feudal Japanese epic to his belt with Princess Mononoke.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
More American Blockbuster than Classic Miyazaki,"If there's one thing I've learned from watching various highly-rated IMDB titles over the years, it's that average score often doesn't correlate to my own personal feelings toward a film. I liken it to the Rotten Tomatoes RT percentage: most everyone may enjoy a film with a top-tier score, but to what extent would be unclear. Such is the case for myself with Princess Mononoke: an enjoyable film with easily identifiable flaws that, if you're anything like me, will diminish the overall viewing experience.Let's start with what is classic Miyazaki: the animation, sound, and presentation quality. Now in the year 2021, it's hard to appreciate just how impressive Princess Mononoke was in those areas back in 1997. Whereas Disney movies tend to overwhelm you with glitz, glamour, and use of motion Japanese films---particularly Miyazaki films---succeed with their use of quiet, highly-detailed scenes. This film is no exception. The background attention to detail is routinely jaw-dropping with repeated viewings mandatory to pick up on all of the little things you may have missed the first time around. But, make no mistake, the film isn't a slouch in the more chaotic scenes, either. Characters run, jump, sprint, and fight in extremely gratifying ways giving such scenes a well-paced flow. The soundtrack of the film is also a selling point, with the main sweeping score highly effective in conveying both scale and emotion.Unfortunately, that's where the Miyazaki comparisons end. The rest of the film features a shallow, predictable plot, underdeveloped characters, and a lack of subtly in messaging. Whereas other Miyazaki films ooze personality and charm, Princess Mononoke possesses little of either. The dialogue isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination and certain minor characters may elicit a smile from time to time, but I couldn't help but feel disappointed overall. The film doesn't just fail in these regards relative to other Miyazaki films; it fails on its own unique terms independent of its famous director and studio combo. This failure is made even more disappointing when you consider that the plot left room for the exploration of more complex moral themes, but never chooses to move beyond your standard allegory of harmony between nature and humans. A real missed opportunity.If you're someone for whom production quality alone would be enough to raise all tides, you are going to adore this film. But if you're looking for the charm of, say, Kiki's Delivery Service or characters/a plot with any amount of depth, be prepared for mild disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

A mature masterpiece,"Miyazaki-san has taken the soul of the Japanese landscape and its attendant Shinto mythos and spun a mighty tale.  It still has the wonder of his other features, but this one is different, mixed with a kind of Shakespearean grandeur and tragic intensity.  It's almost ruthless in its lack of sentiment, but because of this it achieves, at least to this viewer, a visionary breakthrough into unfamiliar territory.  This one will stay through the years and if you attend well enough, haunt your dreams.Kudos to Miramax for taking it so seriously and doing a good job with the dubbing.  Still, the American English just does not really match.  It is too laid back, softened and rounded.  It really dulls the impact of this film.

The Greatest Animated Film Ever Made,"This is one of the greatest movies created. If you need a film to convince you that animated movies are not just for kids, check out Grave of the Fireflies. If you need a film to convince you that animation is high art, check out this.There are four films above this on my list. But none of them strike me with the same sense of awe that this one does. You know that feeling you get when you watch something great for the first time? I get that feeling every time I watch this film.This was the first animated film to every win the top prize at Japan's equivalent of the Oscars, and that's not for a lack of there being great animated films. All film bodies seem to be biased against animation. So for a film to break through that barrier and win that grand award, it would have so be something really special. And this film is.It became the highest-grossing film in Japan ever upon release. Even after 20 years, it's still in the top six. The film in the top spot nowadays? Spirited Away.I love Spirited Away. It is one of the greatest films of all time. I will watch it twenty more times in the future, and if I ever have kids, I'll make sure to show it to them once they get old enough to appreciate it.But this film is better.Why? It has a lot to do with the kind of stories the films tell. They both tell their stories extremely well, but Spirited Away is more of a small-scale, conventional story about a girl finding her way home. Princess Mononoke is a grand epic about war, human nature, inevitability, resilience, philosophy, and culture.The best description I can come up with is that this film would Japan's version of The Iliad if The Iliad was as sprawling and beautiful as The Lord of the Rings. But that description does not really do it justice. This is a movie I can spend hours discussing and analyzing from every angle. Even if I saw it a thousand times, I don't think I'd ever get tired of it.Our lead is Prince Ashitaka, who in defending his village had his hand cursed by a demon. He must leave his people, who are rapidly dying out, and ride west to in an attempt to get his hand cured by the forest spirit. But there is a war raging between the forest and man, and he must attempt to negotiate a peace between the two sides if he hopes to get healed. He meets up with San, the titular Princess Mononoke, who was raised by wolves after being abandoned by her human parents. She has a nasty hatred for all things human, but she ends up falling in love with Ashitaka, and the two of them put their lives on the line to bring peace and stop man and beast alike from being torn to pieces.Technically, this is an environmental movie, but it's not preachy or one-sided or simplistic or even biased in favor of nature. It simply presents the two sides and lets the viewer think what they will. Even if this movie were bad, I would give it immense respect for that. Whereas lesser movies are afraid of nuance, this film is built upon it.The characters are a great example of this. There is no real 'bad guy' in this film, just forces and players and people with ambitions and people with understandable prejudices. No character is perfect, but every character is relatable, resulting in a piece of complex and nuanced art.And it is most certainly is art. If there were ever a movie that deserved to be calm, it's this one. The story is electric. The animation is gorgeous. The music is some of the best I've heard in any film. The emotions these 120 or so minutes evoke in me are so numerous and complex that I couldn't hope to list them here. This film would be worth traveling halfway around the world to see. That's not something I often say.This film manages to start out great, get better as it goes along, and finish out on a high note. The last twenty minutes are some of the greatest I've ever seen in any film. It takes all the energy and themes that have been present throughout the film and kicks them into hyperdrive. It's so overwhelming, I don't turn off the film until the credits are done rolling. That's how long it takes for me to even begin to unpack the rush that has unfolded before me.What makes it perfect is that the second credits theme, a replaying of The Legend of Ashitaka, is simply amazing. It a perfect piece of music. It's one of my five favorite pieces of all time. Whenever it randomly comes in my playlist, I get chills down my back. When it comes up in the ends credits, I collapse into a glorious fit of emotions and sensual overload and glorious euphoria.From its visuals to its storytelling to its presentation, this is the definitive animated film. It is superb. It is beautiful. It is a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Very interesting and relaxing to watch,"After watching Spirited Away by Miyazaki, I decided to check out some of his other work. I was not disappointed with Princess Mononoke. In fact, I was amazed by how many emotions this piece of art has to give. It is an interesting movie which offers much tensity through its story progression but doesn't lack relaxing moments either, thanks to its beautiful landscapes and music. Miyazaki, once again, doesn't cease to surprise with his detailed characterization. The story itself is, compared to Spirited Away, very easy to follow, as it doesn't contain so much symbolism and is interesting to watch all the way. All in all, very enjoyable and suitable for all group ages!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Epic about the struggle between progress and nature,"This epic film has the signature of the Studio Ghibli: beautifully animated, carefully working in each minor detail, with well developped characters and immersing spectator in that bright world. It is impressive how each Ghibli film has a deep and encompassing universe from its own. This one, different from others of their films, takes place in a fantastic Japan, not in a place ressembling Europe. In my opinion, this is not among the best Ghibli films (their average level is extremely high), as it is perhaps too long and sometimes seems unfocused, but it is still a quite good movie. What is its greatest merit, brilliant and unique, is its approach about the core issue: there is a metaphoric war between the modern/progress/industry/development and nature. Off course a balance between both is desirable but it is always hard to be measured and achieved. Exploiting nature is recurrently seen as evil, because of all evironmental problems we face. Indeed, greed and irresponsability are common traits of humans and they drove us to this situation. On the other hand, progress is not compatible not to change environment, and reactionary views on that usually do not care about poverty and inequality among people and countries. Nature is not only what gives us our resources, but is also brutal, dangerous, and challenges our survival when we are exposed. All that complexity appears in the movie in the shape of two opposite sides: humans want to destroy the forest motivated by greed but also by keeping their beloved community safe; the savage forces of nature led by Princess Mononoke and some entities want to preserve it untouched and to kill invading civilization. There is no manichaeism. Both sides commit mistakes, have good reasons, do not see the other side as an interlocutor, and may be ruthless. Indeed this is the most violent film by Studio Ghibli I have watched. To resume, this animated film establishes a wonderful ""mithology"" about the layered clash between progress and nature, in which the most they fight, the most both lose.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Not THE all-time best Anime,"I have seen plenty of Anime films and have mixed feelings about all of them. This one is no exception. Most Anime suffer from vague or erratic plots. Altho this film was actually relieving in that part, it still could have had a more tight plot because it was sometimes confusing, there were so many enemies the humans in the forest were fighting against. The animals, the forest spirit, the wolf girl, the demons, the other human tribe...a little bit more focus would have been nice. The movie is over 2 hours long, which is pretty exceptional for animated films, and in this case too long.Good about this anime was the a-typical hero who kept hoping for peace. Also, typically anime, no distinction between good or bad, just opposing forces who get in each others way. It's a good tale about the destructive force of hatred, in the form of leech-like demons. The animation is top-notch. Altho I'm not the biggest fan of the particular drawing style, it is original. No huge eyes or cheap, lazy animations here!I give it a 7,5/10",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

It payed so much attention to detail and literally you could feel it and get invested from the beginning. I love the connection to the natural world and the spirits. I think it told a beautiful story that showed bravery, loyalty and love for one another. My favorite part was the final battle scene where everyone came together.

One of the only Miyazaki films that disappointed me,"Every movie viewer has different tastes and sometimes a film appeals to one person and not another, or vice-versa. I know that this film set attendance records in Japan and is adored by many and I will admit that TECHNICALLY it is a super well-made film--with nice animation throughout--and in many ways better than the average Disney film. However, despite all this, I just felt very little connection to PRINCESS MONONOKE as the story didn't interest me very much and lacked the charm of other Miyazaki films. Apart from the cute little forest spirits, it was obviously a very adult film and was 180 degrees different from MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO, my personal favorite Miyazaki film. So, if you like the cute style Miyazaki films like me, you'll probably not appreciate this film as much as others who want a film with an agenda that focuses on nature and conservation. As for me, I don't want a message film--I want one that is just plain fun.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Animated perfection.,"It may be true that the only similar film I have watched is 'Sprited Away', but I think I can still say that 'Princess Mononoke' is something worthy of being called art.The plot simply glitters with such complexity, thoughtfulness, maturity and action, that makes even the best of Western animation seem like child's play. The story carries a powerful, yet not preaching, ecological message, asking the question of why the human and the animal worlds cannot live in peace with one another. And what is remarkable, is that there is no true villain: all the characters, as well as the storyline, are very ambiguous. Some of the film's beauty also lies in the fact that the action is NOT non-stop: it is often the quiet, tender scenes that capture the viewer's attention.The animation, being of course chiefly hand-drawn, is nothing short of exquisite. From the calm beauty of the forest pools to the smoke and grime of the iron factories, not a single minute detail is overlooked. The characters, be they humans, stately animal gods, cute but eerie tree spirits, hate-filled apes or simply mice, insects and raccoons, all possess a certain beauty and credibility that is not always easy to come by in this day and age.The soundtrack is spine-tinglingly beautiful. And oh, the power of the silence as the Forest Spirit approaches, plants springing up in his wake...However, I must add a word of caution: this film lives up to every ounce of its PG-13 rating. The story and visuals are dark, violent and disturbing at times: People and animals alike are slaughtered in vast numbers with arrows, rifles, hand cannons and mines; profusely bleeding giant boars are invaded by tentacled demons. Death, as well as rebirth, and the horrors of war, are recurring themes. And the film is over two hours in length, so some children may become bored and confused by the plot.But do not be put off by this: 'Princess Mononoke' is pure brilliance from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A must watch epic.,"Princess Mononoke, is for me an unforgettable and truly inspiring movie. I used to watch it when I was very young (born 1999), and couldn't remember the least about it until a friend brought up a bunch of movies he used to watch when he was younger. After having my memory jogged I tracked it down, not the least bit surprised to find it in the top 30 of a bunch of lists. Perhaps a portion of my affection for this movie is the nostalgic trip I went on through watching it recently. Regardless, I was only more awe-struck to watch it. It was everything I hoped it to be, an absolutely amazing story of good vs evil, man against nature and values clashing against values. Even if you're unfamiliar with Japanese animations, this is still a story not to miss. I only wish there was more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Miyazaki's Definitve Epic,"Complex, simple, emotive, stark, bleak and truly brilliant, Miyazaki's Princess Mononoke is a work, not only of animated art, but truly a landmark in cinematic achievement.Miyazaki, first bit the conflicted notion of human nature versus Mother Earth in his 1986 work of Nausicaa of The Valley of The Wind and truly brought this issue to the fore in many a persons mind. Mononoke, is the defining glory, capsulating over ten years of thought and hard effort. It is intrinsically deep, and powerfully moving, with the notion and human sensibility of love, being the driving force, and, like in many a Miyazaki movie, is the answer to the problems. Compassion and understanding, key humanitarian traits, that we as a species often take for granted, and fail to utilise.After suffering infection and contracting a fatal disease from a dieing Shisigami, or demon, Ashitaka our films major protagonist, sets off on a journey to travel far to the west, leaving behind his native clan and position of prince to discover the source and cause of an old gods transformation into demon. Driven by determination and honesty his search brings him to Iron Town, and a sacred Forest, where he must view an on going feud with ""unclouded eyes"" and bring peace to a region, so fraught with hate and war.Paragraphic summaries, however, do not credit this film nearly enough. It is a landmark film, and while Akira alerted the world to the presence of anime, it was Mononoke that smashed through into the mainstream to enable this joyous art form to be enjoyed in the West. Princess Mononoke encapsulates the very essence of what it is that makes us human, yet Miyazaki understands there are two sides to every coin. He does not skirt over the issue, that we as a race have the ability to destroy, to act for our own selfish needs, instead he forces the issue, while concurrently highlighting that we also have potential. The ability to make things right, is buried deep within our psyche, it is intrinsic to humanity and the differential between us and animals. He shows if we cling onto our ethics and morees we shall prevail. A must for any fan cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Everything a movie should be. This is true cinema.,"After the recent invasion of Dragon Balls and Pokemons, somehow i had in my mind the idea that this was going to be another commercial crappy manga for kids. Despite that i decided to go see it and check for myself why the movie reviewers where praising this movie so much, rating it FIVE stars out of five.Unfortunately, in my country, (Portugal), this movie is playing only once a day in the early afternoons. As usual in Portugal, animation is treated all equal. Animated movies >little kids, and so this movie plays here in the few theaters that bought it (4 ), right about after lunch in little children time slot. What is realy amazing, is that i´m sure the Portuguese distributors of PRINCESS MONONOKE even saw the movie, because if they did, they would notice, (or perhaps not), that this is not a movie for little children. First because there are some very explicit gore scenes, where arms and heads are chopped off occasionally  along the whole movie, there´s violence (and i don´t mean just action violence), reference to more adult themes, (plenty of the female characters are ex-prostitutes) and a few more details like this.I don´t have any problem in taking any kid to see a story like this, but i´m sure there are a bunch of conservative parents out there, that by this time have just forbidden their kids of watching Pokemon, thinking that somehow Mangas are all the same.But PRINCESS MONONOKE isn´t a kids movie just because of this. Above all ,it´s because of its plot and storyline wich gets to complex for little kids to follow. One thing that amused me a lot, was watching some kids in the front row, totally confused because they couldn´t figure out who were the bad guys ! Others were totally bored and only paid real atention to the movie in the action scenes complaining all the time the movie was boring and not very easy to understand.In fact, actually, this movie has probably the best screenplay currently displayed in any movie right now. I wish i could find a non-animated movie out there at this moment with a screenplay capable of touching this one in quality and complexity. Not Mission Impossible for sure. ( And then it´s the animation films who are considered ,stuff for kids ! :-) )I won´t get in the story of PRINCESS MONONOKE because part of pleasure of watching this movie, is going to see it without any clue whatsoever. I´m just going to say, it´s a very ecological movie, set in medieval china (i guess), and where spirits and anything magical, is treated like just another thing made by Mother Nature and not like some supernatural characters that we usualy find everywhere. There are no real heroes in here, and no real bad guy in sight. It´s a slow paced movie, with a brilliant animation, a very intimist plot, a little bit of crude violence (but depicted in a very ""natural"" way, not just there to show off), excelent characters, fantastic landscapes and a pretty good soundtrack that goes almost unoticed. And this movie is BIG. It´s not your regular 75/80 minutes for kids. PRINCESS MONONOKE plays for about 130 minutes.If you like Manga, (and i don´t mean Dragon Ball), real Manga like AKIRA, or WINGS OF HONEAMISE, you can´t miss this movie, because it´s actualy a brilliant movie. Definetely one of the best this year. If you are a fan ,of an old Manga movie called WARRIORS OF THE WIND, then PRINCESS MONONOKE is from the same director, and the style is more or less the same. I read this director is not going to make any more manga movies , (WHY?!!), and that this was his goodbye to animation features. :-(Well let me tell you, this is what we can call, going out in style ! Brilliant movie, (just not for every audiences).Don´t miss it.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Not among Miyazaki's best but still good,"Before I go into discussing the movie, I have to point out that before I saw PRINCESS MONONOKE I had never seen an Hayao Miyazaki before and I wanted to begin with this one. It's among his lesser movies but it was ok for me as an introduction.The movie is set in feudal Japan. In the beginning young prince Ashitaka protects his village and kills a huge demon spider. A injury infects his arm and so he has to travel for finding a cure and a monk talks about him of the great forest spirit. In the village he finds Lady Eboshi who is cutting down the trees and kills the forest's animals. Her major objective is to cut off the head of Okkoto, the forest spirit. She is opposed by the animals and by Princess Mononoke.I have seen the movie in the English dubbed version since I hadn't studied Japanese and for dubbing the characters they picked some famous stars of the 1990s-2000s' movies (such as Jada Pinkett Smith, Billy Bob Thornton, Gillian Anderson, Keith David who also narrates the movie, Minnie Driver and Claire Danes) and it has quite great animation for its time. However at times felt a bit too long and it should have been trimmed of at least 30 minutes as at times I even felt bored. But in the end, I kinda liked it mostly for its message.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Viewer Review,"I heard about this movie when Channel 4 (in the UK) did 100 greatest cartoons. Princess Mononoke nearly made it to the top 20 (21 it reached). I watched Spirited Away first but I decided to watch one of Miyazaki's earlier works. Boy, was Spirited Away 10x better than this. Though the opening was good but at some points the film tends to get boring. The intro of Ashitaka was visually great same with all the other characters except Lady Eboshi where she was introduced straight away. The reasons that Princess Mononoke could not be televised for kids was that it had 2 'B' words & 1 'P' words. Yes, swearing. Also the part where Ashitaka lets his arrow fly to stop someone where the victim loses his arms and one where he loses his head!!! Blood & Gore to top it off. However the animation was good to watch but the story was weak. Music by Joe Hisaishi is suited at all parts of the film and well deserved music. I like the Legend of Ashitaka which is brilliantly instrumented. Off course if the film didn't have gore and swearing then this would have been a great family program but otherwise don't let your kids watch this and learn bad words.

What Disney lacks...,"The king of Japanese animation displays his (as of yet) most carefully crafted work.  As in all his movies, the audience must be prepared to enter into a magical world, where the background scenes are beautifully painted in a realistic manner, but are imaginary and fantastic...  To be taken to a mythical Japan where wolves have two tails, where forests are inhabited by head-ticking spirits, and where boars can be cursed with hatred, seems at first to be an exciting adventure.  But we find that this world is all too real.  At the center of this epic is a battle between man and nature. People kill animals and trees... as well as each other.  Trees are burned for iron, iron is used for guns, and the guns are used for war.  People die, animals die, and spirits die.  But Miyazaki is a messenger of hope.  He claims to want to show children not how the world is, but how it could be. His characters are neither evil nor good, and so they allow for change. Disney could learn from this.  The magic of Disney lies in its abiltiy to tell happy tales of good people vs. evil people.  The magic of Miyazaki lies in his philosophy.  His love for craft, and his relentless passion for animation and story-telling allows him to produce movies that are original and breathtaking.  The effort that he places in the creation of his art guarantees that his work is worth watching, at least once.  And for that effort, we as an audience should put in the proper effort to try and understand what this director is getting at, as well as the effort of appreciating the animation itself.  There are scenes in this movie that Disney cannot do (at least not yet) simply because of the technique. Miyazaki deserves a place with the masters.  He has shown that animation is no child's play.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Not Everything Is The West And The United States,"The first film I saw from Studio Ghibli was this year and it was The Boy and the Heron
(2023) but I had a hard time understanding it so much that I decided that this year there would have to be more films from the director's studio so I could become more familiar with it. Before that I had only seen shorts or parts of the studio's films on social media or other Internet sites and that is the topic I want to focus this review on.I don't know if consciously or not, I had a certain aversion to Studio Ghibli films and I think also to Hayao Miyazaki's work because the stories seemed strange to me, in the sense of mixing the magical with the real but not in the way we are used to in the West, where the magical is special and happens in extraordinary situations or in places outside our reality, but quite the opposite. Perhaps because of their culture or context, the Japanese have a way of constructing these stories by mixing the fantastic with the real and everyday, in a way that I now consider good and leaves us with films like this one that, aided, but not supported by magical bases, gives us stories and messages to put together an excellent story where the mystical is just another tool at the disposal of the creator, just like cinematography, animation, music or any other that he may need.I remember a few months ago that someone who is dedicated to the film industry told me: ""To know more about cinema you must see many films"" and I had to see this film to understand why they are the way they are and with that understanding now I think I could enjoy these films more and understand them better. The next one will be Spirited Away (2001).",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

The qualities of a masterpiece,"A masterpiece leaves you with a sense of being filled up and flowing over. A deep well for your spirit to drink and be sated. A masterpiece is ineffable, much more than the sum of its parts. It's not that every part of it is perfect, far from it inevitably, but the whole is transcendent, and as such it transcends even its own limitations and problems. The characters in Princess Mononoke are living and breathing, full of life and profundity. It is partly in the characters themselves, and partly in the way the movie gives us to understand them. Through voice acting (the English version is marvelous, I can't speak for the original), music, dialogue, facial expressions and body language, and more. The imaginary world's symbolism doesn't let us down either, as do most. It is wonderfully coherent and rich.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
graphic artistry exceptional but story content weak,We felt privileged to be able to see this very artistic expression in our remote area.

visually stunning; spotty English-version voice talent,"This is perhaps Miyazaki's most visually stunning artwork. The visuals alone are worth viewing. The Nightwalker is particularly magical. Unfortunately, that's the best part. The moral carried throughout the storyline focuses on the battle between the natural environment and human's development of the environment; good enough so far. However, some of the English-version voice talent is lacking to awful. Billy Bob Thornton, to put it flatly, sucks. His voice doesn't fit the character and his delivery is annoying from the get-go. Every time is character appears, I cringe. Almost as bad are the anonymous voice characterizations of evil creatures. Its as if the talent were taken off the street, paid $50, then in post-production some cheesy sound effects were added to make the voice sound ""scary"". Simply awful! The voice talent is nearly saved by Jada Pinkett Smith's London-inflected, accurate characterization (I hope I got the correct actress).

A tree falls in the woods...,"'Princess Mononoke (1997)' is a story about humans vs nature, an age-old struggle here categorised by a literal war, that tries to implore a balance between the two intrinsically linked elements but never feels as though it's 'preaching'. The piece works as an epic adventure regardless of its real-life relevancy, chock-full of Studio Ghibli's signature strangeness and odd underlying charm. It's much more serious than the studio's usual stuff, though. Its beautiful animation is as often used to evoke fear as wonder, the piece being surprisingly heavy - and violent - for a 'PG' animated piece. This isn't a bad thing, depending on who you are, because it allows for a mature yet enjoyable tale. The thing is rich and exciting, building towards a genuinely tense finale. Its characters are also rather multi-faceted, never quite conforming to the expectation of their role. It's a really solid story with some great action, resonant themes and interesting animation. It's probably Miyazaki's finest work. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Fascinating Mythology,"A visceral story from the brilliant mind of Hayao Miyazaki, Princess Mononoke is a joyous ride through the eyes of Ashitaka, a brave warrior who finds himself caught in the crossfire of relentless humans and vicious creatures of the forest.Speaking of relentless, even at over 2 hours long, this film flies by with brisk pacing and gorgeous animation by Studio Ghibli. For an animation film, the runtime is unusually long, but the epic scope and beautiful storytelling transcend typical animations. One of my first thoughts while watching was how good this story could be in live- action form. Even if it's a television series, the lore calls for this to be adapted into live-action.The mythology is incredibly well-realized and thought out as well. Each of the several sides to this ongoing battle against the forest have reason for fighting. Yes, Ashitaka is the protagonist, but I wasn't necessarily rooting for any particular side to win. That's when you know the characters have plenty of depth.My only real complaint here is that sometimes the dialogue comes out a bit dull and lacks the gravitas that the very scene calls for. Of course, this may only be in the English dubbed version that I watched, or the script. Either way, the story is brilliant, but the dialogue just didn't match it.Above everything else, Princess Mononoke is a special film. It transcends the usual tropes of animated films by being a viscerally graphic war film with plenty of heart and thought provoking ideas. It's no surprise this is praised as one of Miyazaki's very best films.+So different than any animated film+Meaningful violence+Interesting mythology+All characters have depth87/100",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Problematic Epic,"Of all films directed by Hayao Miyazaki, there is no doubt Princess Mononoke is the highest regarded by his fans. Taking place in medieval Japan, it is the story of a cursed and exiled young prince involving himself in a war between man and the spirits of nature. The iron-producing town led by the strong Lady Eboshi is pitted against a mysterious young woman running with the wolves. Other cynical players enter the conflict for their own gain.The virtues of this movie are many: A largely credible set of ambiguous characters, a grand plot wrapped in a dramatic and moving story, a stunning soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi, an ecological message, as well as Miyazaki's famous attention to detail, which contributes to main as well as back story.The movie has a serious problem, however, which prevents this reviewer from ranking it among their top Studio Ghibli. The protagonist, in sharp contrast to the rest of this movie's ambiguous world, is completely faultless. Prince Ashitaka has got to be one of the most boring characters ever encountered in storytelling. Despite all his trials, he is never more angry than required, always courageous, kind, and ready to help. This deprives the story vastly of its sophistication.It is, nevertheless, possible to interpret this as another virtue. By seeing San and Lady Eboshi as the real protagonists, you can say Ashitaka is really a metaphor for new and progressive thought, the emergence of which makes it possible to mitigate deep conflicts. But whether or not Miyazaki intended it this way, it is hard to say whether such an interpretation is shared by the fanbase. Also, the movie strongly pushes Ashitaka as the protagonist, not encouraging the alternative interpretation.Also, keep some distance from the English dub. There are two reasons. First, Neil Gaiman, writer of the dub script, obviously saw Miyazaki's own sense of humour as insufficient, and decided to add some dialogue jokes on his own where the animation allows it - rather poor jokes. Second, Claire Danes' rendition of San is a painful experience. She makes the brave warrior princess sound like a whiny teenage girl, so much like those familiar to readers of Robert Jordan. Billy Crudup is not really helping either - his temperless voice adds to Ashitaka's infuriating lack of character.In short: Whether this is a good or a great movie really depends on your interpretation. And try to get a subtitled version.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Did not expect this from Ghibli,"Went into this movie expecting the same themes as the other films from the studio. Those themes are very much present.

It could have easily been a PG film. They utilized the gore, death and destruction to serve a purpose to tell a story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
My favourite film of all time,"When I was young, this film was more of a beautiful spectacle of animation rather than a interesting plot. The art to this film is beyond any doubt one of the best in animation history. This alone could make me rate this a 10/10 film, many could argue movies like your name or suzume could surpass the art. Hayoa miyazi prides himself in hand drawn animation, as seen in most of his films, and this to me brings this movie up a lot.Beauty of art aside, the plot to this film is insane. Though the only negative I would have is how slow the beginning is, putting a lot of people off. A plot where the character is neither in the ""good"" or ""bad"" and rather helps everyone and is then seen of a bad guy from both sides. The good and bad side is completely the choice of the viewer (though most would be on princess mononokes side).The antagonist to this film is arguably the most ambiguous character in the film. Is she really evil for the pain she has put on the land, or is she a good person for the service and valour she has given to her own kind?Hayao miyazi also produces well thought out, powerful female characters with faults and development that many films these days lack.There is so much to unpack in this film its ridiculous.I would generally call this film one of the best. And I recommend it 100%",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
* * * * for this gem of a movie,"Hiyao Miyazaki brings his poetic sensibility to `Princess Mononoke,' the latest from Studio Ghibi. The film is an ecological fable about the conflict between man and nature, but offers no solutions or preachy messages like most animated films. In addition, it doesn't provide the usual scapegoats or easy targets we are used to. The genius of the film lies not only in its pure cinematic excellence (each image is stunning in its beauty and detail), but its willingness to provide clear and understandable motivation for the consumers/exploiters.Lady Eboshi (voiced elegantly by Minnie Driver) runs Iron Town, a mining village which is reaping its raw material from the Great Forest, taking it by force against the will of the Animal Gods, who battle to regain control over their habitat. Traditionally, Lady Eboshi would be an unrepentant villain who needs to be taught a lesson: destroy the environment and we destroy ourselves. Easy to say, right? Try telling that to the women who work the factory, who were once prostitutes before the lady took them in to work, or the lepers, whom no one but she would hire. Suddenly, the issue becomes clouded. And we understand that technology is both a friend and an enemy. Where would we be without industrial progress? (Miyazaki himself has understood in other films the wonder and glory of these advances, having a fascination for flying mechanisms which runs through his entire body of work.)However, industrial progress comes with a price, and the film unflinchingly portrays Lady Eboshi's cavalier destruction of the forests and disregard for the lives of the Animal Gods who live there. The Boar Tribe is almost entirely wiped out. The Ape Tribe is afraid to plant new trees for fear of the fiery man made catapults. The Wolf Goddess is dying from a poisoned bullet, grimly accepting her fate.San (Princess Mononoke, voiced by Clare Danes) is one of the key defenders of the forest, raised by the Wolf Goddess to despise all humans. The iron bullets are transforming the Gods into vicious Demons, wrecking everything in their path, and the damage is going beyond the Forest and Iron Town, into remote villages throughout Japan.  The film's protagonist, Ashitaka (voiced by Billy Crudup) comes from such a village, attacked by a mad Demon Boar and leaving him with a poisoned wound which will slowly infect his entire body and corrupt him. Ashitaka rides into town and attempts to bring both sides together in a compromise.As you can see, the mythos heavy plot requires you to keep up, but the film is consistently entertaining.  It features epic battle scenes which rival those of the master, Akira Kurosawa (an admirer of Miyazaki's work), and an understanding of how animals behave which is believable throughout (in body language, gesture and, seemingly, in thoughts.)  The adaptation by Neil Gaiman is remarkably vivid, unlike most translations, which seem to lose something special from the source. The voice characterizations range from excellent (Driver, Crudup, Gillian Anderson as the quietly ferocious Wolf God) to questionable (Clare Daines is a bit too cutesy as San, and Billy Bob Thornton is at first seemingly a strange choice as Jiro, a sneaky monk, but neither of them are too distracting. Billy Bob actually grew on me.)`Princess Mononoke' was one of the finest films I've seen this year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Nature always wins,"Princess Mononoke was directed by Hayao Miyazaki and is the 11th film. It tells the story of a prince named ashitaka who after a cursed boar spirit attacks his village is cursed. Traveling east to find the source of the boar hatred. Ashitaka comes upon a town of outcasts and leapers lead by a woman name Eboshi. We learn that the humans of this village are at war with the spirits of the forests, humans are digging up iron ore and Desecrating the forest. As a result, it's weakening the spirits Resulting in many being turned into demons. Amongst these spirits is a human girl name San known throughout the forest as princess Mononoke raised by wolf spirits she aids them against the humans. The most notable aspect of this film is the amount of blood and gore as well the action. This is hands-down the studio's most graphic film with dismemberment, bloody wounds, and piles of corpses. It's rather serious essentially a war movie between men and nature. The overall tone of this movie is that there's not a de facto villain. It would be easy to pin Lady Eboshi as the villain that not entirely true. She's destroying the forest, she has a motive driven out by the Emperor. Caring for the lives of her people. She sees the forest as a new potential for them, willing to sacrifice to prosper. She's more interested in the money not knowing the consequences of her actions. Ashitaka is the Voice of reason stoic and Courageous he's trying to prevent conflict between the spirits and the humans so it doesn't lead to more suffering for others. You believe he's not afraid to die but he still fights to protect everything. Course the last major character is princess Mononoke how design is creative, her stories similar to Mowgli from the jungle book being raised by wolves. Similar to Nausicaa of the valley of the wind she's a warrior and she knows how to fight. Moving swift in the fight offers adrenaline. One of the small downsides is that you don't get much time to know her. The choice in scenery is an excellent choice before the tale of Princess Kaguya this was the only film set in ancient Japan so I always gave it a distinct personality. Playing off of the concept of nature and spirits the Settings are beautiful tons of landscapes panned over there show off the scale and effort put into this world. Huge amount of detail are put into the forest and the water. The design of the forest spirit & Kodama is creative. Princess Mononoke is action-packed and remains one of the best works in animation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Movie we need,"A true masterpiece that contrastes Miyazaki's genius. For me this film represents life with its ambivalence, like true life seen on a microscopic level there's no good or bad, no final Victim or offender since everything is a matter of perception. And princess mononoke shows this perfectly by not setting any true antagonists. Since all the sides of this film are doing what they're doing for a convincing reason, for their survival and ishitaka serves as the mediator in the middle of this storm trying to find harmony. It's also more relevant then ever because the way it addressed industrialization and its desastrous effect on earth, the human thrust for more resources will lead to his end, and our stiving to survive might be, ironically the reason of our extinction. The film is very savage, brutal and dark, it's definitely not a kids film because i don't see a kid comprehending it. Still the animation is stunning, the details, the colors the movements this movie is a work of art, and it's really a statement of how animation can provide a complexe and solid substance that live action features can't. This movie will wow you, and honestly we need it now more then ever before.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Minnie Driver was also a poor choice for the voice of lady eboshi.  so if you do watch this be sure to turn it to japanese with english subtitles.,,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Save the Nature,Well this is just awesome and it is different from other animated film and it is more serious and a beautiful film. It has some unique feature and story in it which make the film awesome. It is better than other film and it is not like childish film and one of the most beautiful animation in it. You can watch in dub the dub version is good. It is the story of today film like human development which effect the nature. It is true that is happening today we are fighting all together which only make the situation Worst. Fighting is not the solution. So watch the film and learn some thing that have been lost in you and find it. Well it is violence at some point but children also watch it. It is the most awesome animated film in history.

No!-No!-Noke-Hime😣,"Mononoke-hime is kind of movie that I usually don't comment. But since this is a review, I have to tell you about my thoughts and general opinion. From Studio Ghibli, this is a very bad movie. From the beginning, I didn't like it, in the middle, I didn't like it, and the ending was just something that was a big disaster, really disappointing movie. It tells us that we have to protect the forest and that when you fight with a team, it is better than fighting alone. I think the message that they tried to show us, was good. The music soundtrack and a few of the action sequences were good. But about the bad sides, well, badly introduced characters, I couldn't enjoy them and learn more about them, they just went right in. The animation was poor, and believe me, I think anime animation is good, but in here, it felt incomplete and fast drawn without any potential. That annoyed me a lot, watching this poor animation. Generally, the action and the whole movie were too long, I really got bored the last 30 minutes or so. The animals, the voice-actors to the animals, were amazingly bad. Didn't fit the character's type and attitude. A movie that didn't entertain me very much. Very boring, weak animation, but some good action scenes and music sound were good. The moral about keeping and protecting the forest was good, But haven't we seen that before? Very weak movie, expected more potential, but got a big disappointed instead.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Complex and slow-moving battle between humans and the forest gods...,"1st watched 9/12/2009 – 4 out of 10 (Dir- Hayao Miyazaki): Complex and slow-moving battle between humans and the forest gods didn't really play that well to me. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I'm not that in tune with the Japanese culture, but I just have to call things as how I see them and this animated movie by famed director Miyazaki didn't cut it for me. I think the main problem is that he didn't make us care for the characters involved and any movie that misses this part, I usually don't recommend. Miyazaki definitely winds an inventive story with unique animation and interesting demons and creatures as he usually does but the heart comes across missing. The story is about a group of humans who want to take the forest back from the animal gods who currently inhabit it and sometimes cause havoc with they turn into demons. This situation occurred early on and the prince of the story becomes infected to the point of having a curse on him that will eventually cause him to die. He's sent west to a forest area to hopefully get cured by the Deer God. He then meets up with Princess Mononoke, who is a half-human, half-wolf protector of the forest and tries to combine with her to help the cause, eventually. Battles ensue, and we do end up getting a happy ending – which we knew we'd see eventually, but two hours of the preparation for it was too much for me. I think the purpose of the story was to get us to see how we need to protect the forest, which I think we know, but the slow moving narrative ruins the purpose. So, a beautiful film again by the director but this one didn't hit home.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
An All Time Classic,"I just saw Princess Mononoke for probably around the 20th time and I have to say that every time I watch it I am immediately drawn into this world in the same way I did as a child when I first saw it. It's story in very compelling in emphasizing on human nature. Each character had a clear goal and motive in their lives. It was clear that each character was true to their nature; even down to Toki, worker of the bellows in Irontown and husband to Kohroku. Most of the action scenes were animated so fluidly. It's always amazing to see the amount of detail incorporated into every character's gestures and movements. You never know what will happen next, from beginning to end. If I was to quickly jump from the first 15 minutes to the last 30 minutes, I'd think that I'm watching a completely different movie. The creativity involved in the story's setting still gets to me. Unlike most of Hayao Miyazaki's other films, this film certainly keeps to a more serious and darker tone which suites the subject but we still get that classic Miyazaki style with the Kodamas and the Forest Spirit. This will forever be one of Hayao Miyazaki's greatest films and should continue to be screened till the ends of time as it offers entertaining joy and very relevant subject matter.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Best animated movie I've seen and one of the best movies I've seen period,"Truly a fantastic movie. The visuals, the characters, the plot, soundtrack, all compelling. As I said, not only is this the best animated movie I've ever seen, it's one of the best movies I've seen period. Definitely a top 10 all time favorite for me.If any movie is proof that animation is a viable medium for serious films, this, along with Studio Ghibli's other great movie Grave of the Fireflies, is it. But not only is this proof that animation is merely viable - it is also a perfect example of how animation can sometimes be the better medium for a movie than live action. This would likely be cumbersome as a live action movie.Princess Mononoke is great because of its animation, not despite the fact that it's animated. The drawings of the wolves and landscapes and the Nightwalker are simply sublime. Add the fact that it's largely hand-drawn and it becomes even more awe-inspiring - this movie is art.I'd recommend this to any lover of great movies and would urge anybody with reservations about animation as a medium for serious, adult-skewing movies to give this masterpiece a chance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Still my favourite among Miyazaki's,"This film may not be as fun as Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi and Howl's Moving Castle, but it's still my favourite because of the great plot.The film started with the Prince who gets a curse from ""boar king"". He then leaves the village to find a cure for his curse. Coincidentally he arrives at a iron-mining town and later meets Princess Mononoke on animals' side in the war between animals and humans. At last, in revenge for the death of the boar king, the boar god starts the war.You'll see there's much Japanese mythical imagination throughout the film, but it may not be the kind of film for family as you won't find much or even any laughter in the film but the illustration of the devil, blood and wounds. Anyway, Miyazaki tries to remind us of the importance of environment protection. Humans' greed may get the life-taking deer god's revenge in return.The whole film runs very smoothly yet slowly, but what I like best is the whole theme and also the way it's presented. You'll just enjoy the film itself as a kind of imaginative story, or give it some more thoughts because it's not usual to find many in the industry comparable to the works Miyazaki produces.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A movie without resolution,"What first drew me to this anime is Hayao Miyazaki's epic manga work 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind'. It is there that I have surmised what Mr.Miyazaki is trying to tell us, that there is no distinct definition of good and evil; or in a much simpler sense, a term 'good' is a purely relative term.Because there was no 'evil' to relinquish to save the day, there was no clear achievement on the part of the protagonist. Hence, there was no clear resolution, and left me a sense of bewilderment and frustration. Particularly because there was absolutely no way for me to even 'imagine' any means of a definite conclusion within the world envisioned by the creative mind of Mr.Miyazaki. And Mononoke Hime is no exception.Perhaps as with the ilk of the movie such as 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', this anime will clearly pique the audience's interest by it purporting a sense of novelty. That the film garnered the most revenue next to 'Titanic' is more than willing to try to coax us to see what made the Japanese so frenetic about the anime.Clearly, Mr.Miyazaki's imagination is a vivid realization of pure enchantment. The forest is drawn with stunning detail and the surroundings of Japanese mountainside and its geographical features seem to take a life of its own. But it is a bit hackneyed, as he seems to be dependent upon his formulaic approach of rendering his characters (both storywise and graphically). Pricess Mononoke looks a bit like a cross between Nausicaa and Kushana, and Ashitaka resembles Asbel. And almost all the female bellow workers are rendered in a simple manner that seems to represent a cohesive and collective organism; a bit disconcerting at worst.If the viewers are not willing to partake in the vision that is defined with Miyazaki and view the animation with a stoic sense of poignant reality privy to Western mindset, this anime will be nothing but a haphazard and silly fantasy tale spun from the wildest of lunacy. Of course, the movie should confound many people who do not know anything about various Japanese mythos, barrage of which are included in the movie to perfect Mr.Miyazaki's vision. But Mr.Miyazaki cordially and humbly invites us to his world of medieval Japan in the conflict between humans and gods, and it creates a convincing suspension of disbelief.However. The biggest flaw in the anime would be that it is trying to enumerate almost everything that is Mr.Miyazaki's philosophy on life. One can only put so much definition in a two hour movie. Just like in his celebrated manga 'Nausicaa', Mr.Miyazaki dispenses with some definite references for evil and good. Therefore, his characters in the movie are both stunningly and horrendously static, no room for growth, no changes. Even after the entire Tatara Ba is destroyed, humans will forge another means of destroying the nature. It is bound to occur again and again and again, this pointless conflict between humans and nature. But what is 'pointless' if it is permanently embedded into human history or human 'nature'? Alas, even the relationship between San and Ashitaka ends in a blur of irrevocable end. The ending is rather quick and anti-climatic to grace the film of this much expense and scope.Mr.Miyazaki's works are not my cup of tea, plainly because of it is not a wholesome entertainment within the limits of its animation or comic. But I cannot help but be intrigued by his premise and pretentious approach of presenting his ideas in such a medium. Maybe I am just a nitpicky fan of Mr.Miyazaki, an accomplished artist, who completely altered my predisposition about the animation works in general. But the anime is plainly too subdued and a dawdle of a confusing adventure.Princess Mononoke is without a resolution. Therefore it is a depressing story mired by helpless and static characters only rising up to the occasion to resolve a circumstantial dilemma. I cannot recommend this anime with a full assurance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Much like Spirited Away however, Princess Mononoke is the most extraordinary one out of the ones I reviewed.","Princess Mononoke is one of the reasons why Studio Ghibli hit the mark on it's predecessor much like Spirited Away later on, this one is an absolute masterpiece and just when I am doing this review, I'm just gonna say that the director who directed before he directed Spirited Away, it is Hayao Miyazaki. He works for Studio Ghibli along with two others like Toshio Suzuki and Isao Takahata. They're the ones who are responsible for making animated films beautiful and impeccable entertaining those who are fans of anime. Now that I got that out of the way, let's continue on. An Emishi village is attacked by a hideous demon and the last of the Emishi who is a prince called Ashitaka, kills it before it reaches the village, but it manages to grasp his arm and curses him. The curse grants him superhuman strength, but it also causes a scar-like mark that will surround him, cause him pain, and eventually kill him. The villagers discover that the demon was a boar god and the wise woman tells Ashitaka that he may find a cure in the western lands where the demon came from, so he goes out on the journey to find a cure to cure his arm before he dies. Along the way he comes across a young woman named San played by Claire Danes, who was raised by the wolves and feels hatred for humans. Yeah, a woman who is raised by wolves and has hatred for humans. You can see where this is going whilst you kept watching but all I can say is, she's a human too. The only way he can get the cure from his arm is from the Great Forest Spirit who is a deer-like animal god. After the day I watched Spirited Away, I was actually going to go for the ones that are highly rated which of course being Spirited Away itself which is why it's being one of the more impeccable ones that are on that category. That being said is like I said before if you have your own account from many movie websites you will see many lists of highly rated movies you've seen and haven't seen. You cannot go wrong. Despite being a PG film, some of the scenes that can be quite brutal. Well, not to worry, at least they have their uncle's with them. Hahaha. If you're looking at the environment of the message that it contains and you're thinking the same thing like ""Did I ever hear this message before?"" Yeah, like you're thinking about man and nature. And like you're thinking the same story like thinking about this as the Japanese Pocahontas, the Japanese FernGully: The Last Rainforest, the Japanese Dances with Wolves and the Japanese Avatar. Well, I think you guys are having with your head. Next! To be very frank here, this is not the case. There is no character that is considered an antagonist. The way it tells the story is astonishingly extraordinary. Princess Mononoke is absolutely one of the more impeccable animated films and much like the ones I've seen so far when I was a kid and adult which are nostalgic and much like Spirited Away however, this is one of the more powerful films I have ever seen period and that's saying something. This'll be like Star Wars of anime even when you're looking at engaging characters, impeccably beautiful animation and an epic story. For any anime fan, animation fan and film buffs, this is an absolute must-watch. It has every right to be an epic masterpiece and so many who are looking for something powerful and something more engaging, then seriously go see this movie right away. It is everything you want in anime. As much as I love Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke is the absolute spectacle of animation heaven.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Liked it. Good, but not great.","Overall I liked the film.  It left me wanting to see it again just to capture all that I may have missed the first time.  The dubbed version with American actors was distracting as I kept picturing those actors in the parts rather than letting the story take shape.  I look forward to watching it in the original language on DVD.  The pace of the film is rather slow and repeated viewings is a must if you really desire to appreciate all that the movie has to offer.  In my opinion, it's not for the kiddies as the gore and blood may be too much for them.  Don't let the cover of the dvd fool you. I wouldn't call it ""Star Wars"" of animated features.  It may be ""Star Wars"" because some consider this film the best of animation.  I would consider it good, not great.  I only gave it a 6 out of 10.  See it for yourself and judge for yourself.

"Japanese anime: bigger, longer and uncut","Generally I am a real fan of animated films and since Hayao Miyazaki's films seem to be of very high quality I recently felt to give one of his films a try despite not being too keen on Asian anime. The only film I really liked was Vampire Hunter D to be honest and I can assure you that I've seen my share of Manga 'classics' (Akira and Ghost in the shell). I had a feeling though that Miyazaki's films would be more mainstream Hollywood style, since he has become something of a trade name since making this film and the academy award winning Spirited Away. After seeing this film, I was somewhat disappointed. Despite the fact that the film had some of the makings of a great adventure film, I just could not get used to the many fantasy; god/demon elements. From the start I felt that the films core the film had a dangerous equilibrium, which it managed to maintain during the first hour. The first hour was pretty exciting and interesting but in the second hour the weight on the 'boring' scale just got bigger and bigger. It was not as if Miyazaki did a bad job directing, but I felt that he put too much weight on the whole moral/mystical part of the film where more emphasis on the action would have made the film tighter. Maybe though it wasn't the emphasis alone, I also felt that some of the scenes were excruciatingly long. Or maybe it is safe to say that I'm not into the whole Asian 'spirit thing'. I mean I didn't like The Ring or Ju-On one bit and I didn't care much for this one either. The only thing I actually can appreciate in Asian (specifically Japanese) films is the amount of violence they use and the way in which it is often comic. There were a couple of instances in this film as well where I felt the violence was so over the top that it became funny. Too bad that isn't enough to keep a film interesting for 128 minutes. Miyazaki should have kept this one standard Disney-length (with a maximum of 85 minutes).5,25 out of 10post scriptum: the English subs were really bad, cause last time I checked 'arigato' meant ""Thank you."" and not ""Good luck.""",5.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Greatest animated film ever made,"I bought this film having watched Spirited Away and I would have been happy if I saw a mere shadow of that films story, characters and imagination. I was so surprised at how brilliant it was i had to watch it again straight away. Though on first impressions a children's movie its characters have a depth that transcend the works of comparable Disney films and even on occasion is shockingly violent with no distaste. What really makes this film beautiful though is the intricate story interweaving with the stories of the war between the people of Iron Townand the animals, the struggle to comprehend life and death and the impossible romance of Ashitaka and San. The fact that both the humans and the great beasts are shown to be both compassionate and ruthless shows a tragedy that human kindness and natural beauty may not coincide together and this is what gives the film its melancholic tone especially among its breathtakingly drawn action sequences and truly epic ending.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

And it is beautiful.The story reaches the viewer on many levels... forcing one to see each of the many points of view conflicting the story. The Forest Gods are dying off as the Iron Age takes over, as it must. Do they go to war because they have no hope, or because they must? The Iron Town must destroy the Forest Gods and use the environment if the people are to prosper in the evolving civilization. Do they kill because they are defending their way of life, just as the Forest Gods are? The Emperor wants eternal life, something that only the head of the Great Forest Spirit can give.

The artistry here is astonishing,"I guess you'd call what I'm doing a Studio Ghibli film quest, and ""Princess Mononoke"" was an interesting item to mark off. But it's not a favorite of mine.

And I think that that film is entirely more potent with a well-defined heroine. Here, there's a split between Ashitaka, Lady Eboshi and Princess Mononoke, and even though the tone is definitely more adult (with the violence to match), the prior movie had the more effective characters.

Miyazaki's Work on War,"This is my favorite of his many movies, well maybe second favorite.His best movie is brutal torture to watch, and you should only watch it if you want to understand the creator of so many powerful, beautiful stories better. Grave of the Fireflies is a rough one, and I will immediately go and write a review on it after this one. Anyway.Mononoke Hime is a powerful movie, and I have seen it countless times. Unlike Grave, it is extremely watchable and approachable. The story isn't subtle, but neither is it simplistic. There is no 'bad guy' in this story as everyone is open and upfront with our hero, an unbiased observer, we can quickly learn that everyone has relatively decent reason for what they do.Still everyone is consumed with the fervor of war that even poisons the land itself, and we the lucky viewer get to watch a man who barely remembers the war, but did know its effects. All of his best works speak on and condemn war, and I can respect a man who is so vocal and honest about the horrors and destruction it brings.Not his best telling of the story, but definitely the easiest and most enjoyable to watch.

Mature fairytale,"Princess Mononoke focuses on the same humankind vs nature story that a lot of Hollywood is preoccupied with. What makes this version unique is the amount of nuance in which it tells its story. Avoiding many of the mistakes others have fallen into by refusing to make its conflict easy and offering mature points of view.Youji Matsuda's Ashitaka is the ideal way into this world and war. He's headstrong and morally centred in a way that never wavers. Yuriko Ishida's San is equally headstrong with a mission she's determined to finish. The blossoming romance between them is allowed to take its time without having to commit to a true relationship by the end, which makes it even stronger.Hayao Miyazaki's direction inverts a lot of the usual ideas whilst still delivering pure imagination. There's definitely plenty of that trademark awe inspiring wonder but with a darker story there's also some disturbing imagery as gods morph into demons.

With Eyes Unclouded by Hate,"""Princess Mononoke"" is pure and simply a morality tale, presented in the finest tradition of Japanese animation with such detail that it almost seems real.  This 1997 film finally made its showing here two years later with the added voiceover of well-known Hollywood stars such as Claire Dane, Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, and Gillian Anderson.  So given that pizzazz, can a film with obvious Oriental themes - the dignity of nature and the consequences of its violation by man and the enduring spirituality that makes life timeless, work on an American audience?  Yes, because ""Princess Mononoke"" skillfully orchestrates the breathtaking outdoors with its mysticism as well as coordinated battles and other action scenes to tell a story both adult and children can understand.  No, because the simplicity of presentation makes some people think it is hokey.  Additionally, love relationships, whether it is between mother and child or boy and girl, are intentionally restrained by Western standards so we feel cheated when the best romantic scene is one where the Princess chews up jerky beef before transferring it to the mouth of her Prince.

Instead I got a boring but beautiful piece of work that honestly isn't worth watching.Characters - None of the characters have any personalities or depth. Everyone has one motivation to do a thing because of the plot. There are no complex relationships or interesting exchanges between the characters. The villain wants to destroy the forest because she wants to. The hero wants no one to die because that's what he wants. The creatures want to protect the forest because they want their home to remain. It's quite unfortunate that the writers just forgot that to make a story interesting, everyone needs reasons for doing what they do and not ""because movie.""Plot - this movie's story is a bit vague and pointless. Basically some people want the forest to die, the forest is against this, they fight, no one wins. It's pretty simplistic and uninteresting. There's a pointless romance thing in there and some other random story threads that mean nothing.Animation - this movie is absolutely gorgeous. I wish that the animators could've animated something good. They're clearly talented and it's sad to see such talent wasted on such a garbage and meaningless story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Amazing Animation with Incredible Story,"Don't mess with nature. Wow this movie really reflected the fame it got. In addition to the longest run-time compared to the previous Ghibli movies, the animation was also much more impressive and breathtaking. I was hooked from the opening, which showed an intense chase and fight scene. The story was intricate and made me want to see how it would all unveil. Unexpectedly, there were a lot of gore, which made the action even more thrilling. The theme about man versus nature and how nature can strike back were adamantly clear and impactful not only in 1997, but also now. For me, this is the best movie from Miyazaki so far and it was a phenomenal experience. 9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
:),"It was a meaningful movie. Although it was made in anime form, but the messages were still well-delivered. It was a movie about the equality values in city lives and jungle lives. It was a movie that made us ponder about our way of treating the wild animals. Human usually consider themselves higher and more developed than any other animal, but that isn't the alternate truth. Animals have developed the same society as us, but it is not yet discovered. We should stop putting us on the top of animal chain but learn to accept and to love all us equally. I loved the main girl, she's really brave and wise. after all it was great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A masterpiece of art and animation,"Wow. This movie blew me away, to say the very least. All of it was captivating; the animation, the characters, and story, all of it done to perfection. Hayao Miyazaki, whose work I'm only beginning to take notice of, is truly a genius in terms of bringing landscapes and it's many creatures to life.The plot revolves around Prince Ashitaka, who is told that he must leave his village and never return after he is cursed by a horrible demon. Ashitaka, along with his red elk, Yakul, sets out on a journey to ""see with eyes unclouded by hate,"" as he puts it and his journey brings him to see many things. He comes across a prosperous settlement that produces iron, fittingly named iron town, and its leader Lady Eboshi, voiced by Minnie Driver. Ashitaka finds that Iron town is at war with the creatures of the forest due to the human's attempting to settle in the forest to create prosperity, which of course the forest dwellers aren't happy about. Ashitaka later meets the princess of the wolf tribe San, who happens to be a human despite her title. Ashitaka becomes caught in the middle of a dispute as old as time itself, man versus animal.Several other characters are added to the mix; a strange little man named Jigo, voiced by Billy Bob Thornton, the lieutenant to Lady Eboshi Gonza, voiced by John DiMaggio (the voice of Bender), Moro, the god of the wolves, and Okkoto the god of the boars. These characters are all brilliantly written, and all have their own likability. One thing that this movie does well is that there isn't really any main villain. All of them have reasonable motivations behind what they're doing. It would have been so easy for this movie to throw in a tired message about how man is evil and how we should save the environment. Many may argue that this movie is trying to set up this message, but I don't think so. Lady Eboshi isn't necessarily a bad person. She's a strong person, who doesn't back down in times of adversity. She's a good leader who protects her people and only wants the best for them, giving a home to the lepers, fighting for the lives of her people against the boars, and sticking up for her fellow women's rights and honor. While on the other side the wolves aren't the villains either; only wanting to protect the spirits of the forest and their home from what they perceive to be their worst enemy, the humans. It's understandable why both sides feel this way, they all have a reasonable motivation and likability.The animation in this film is breathtaking, the creatures just fly off the screen with how they're drawn and how they move. The creatures in this world are all just so creative and beautiful in their designs. The Spirit of the Forest is one of my favorite designs in animation history, especially when the sun goes down. Even the designs of creatures that already exist, like the apes or the boars, all have a unique design and charm. This movie could honestly be watched on mute and still be thoroughly enjoyed.The story of this movie is unbelievably fantastic and deserves much more recognition than it gets in the U.S. It's a fantastic movie by a fantastic animator and is now, after seeing this for the first time yesterday, one of my all time favorites.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
a shock,"I have been studying Japanese for 4 years now, and mononoke hime is one of the reason i held on. I saw it just a few days after entering college, and i can clearly say i don't regret it. This is definitely the greatest achievement in all animation's history. And there is nothing more to be said about it. Some will precisely say it's annoying to watch a movie (almost) everyone loves, but nevermind. More than ever the message of it all is so strong, so deep no one could forget it: The spirit of Nature lies way above our comprehension, but we despise and keep on killing it slowly. Period. The movie lasts 135 min., and it feels  almost like it's enough. Those 2 hours and a quarter picture everything Miyazaki has been ""fighting"" for so far.

Loved it!,"9.2/10 I am one of the biggest fan of Miyazaki's work. This movie is also the one of the most interesting movie of his. I've watched this for more than 2 times, and what I've found out was that more and more I watch, more and more meanings I've found from this movie.After watching this, and while watching this I really had lots of thoughts of what is good and what is bad. In one person's view, something might be bad, but other might think that it is good. It had great lesson of people having different views of justice.This movie was very deep and really fun. It showed great views of human and animals. I really loved the ending of how everything that was destroyed recovered.The reason why this movie is one of my best movie is because it has great deep meaning behind just a kid movie. I guess this is the strongest skill of Miyazaki.I strongly recommend for people to watch this because I feel like there's lots to learn from here.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Elegy of and for the nature lover,"Warning to readers, this is not a feel-good movie, its hard-hitting. There is a general tendency among adult audience to not take animation seriously, but I would be shocked if this movie did not leave a huge impact on anyone. This is one of my first reviews on IMDb, this movie has to be watched and internalized by everyone who is concerned about her future. If anything can move humanity to not inflict further harm and damage against mother Nature, it is this movie. If mother Nature had a form,it would closely resemble what Miyazaki has created in this movie. Even the thought of this movie chokes me, the stark unending sadness truly captures what Nature's wildlife is going through because of human activities. If humans ruin the planet in the near future to the extent that it becomes unlivable for all, this movie has the exact elements which can guide us all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

This is the greatest film EVER MADE!!!! (in my opinion at least),"I began watching this film, not expecting it to be as great as everyone says, I was wrong. This film totally lived up to what people said it was. The emotions I got while watching this film made it definitely worth watching. I would recommend watching the Japanese version with English subtitles though, I tried watching the English version and it didn't really have good voice acting for certain characters, because of this I didn't get the same feelings I always got when watching the Japanese version. The soundtrack is the most perfect soundtrack I have ever heard, there was not one song I didn't like. The film is beautiful, the visuals have aged well too. Everything felt on point, as I said the film gave very good emotions as I said, but it was after the film that it completely hit me with emotions, and it changed my worldview, in a good way. Never has a film hit me with emotions as much as this one. The film sends off a very good message about hate and what it does to people. I swear if you watch this film you are going to have an extremely hard time finding a better one, it's just that good, the film is unique.I rate this film so high that it goes beyond the boundaries of this scale of 1/10 and reaches another scale of 1/10 in which it gets the rating 11/10.

Miyazaki's Fantasy Wonder,"Hayao Miyazaki isn't a name synonymous with fantasy epics grand and aggressive such as the Lord of The Rings, yet in a pleasant twist of fate it appears as if the renowned director has yet another genre wrapped around his finger, intertwining a vast yet personal epic with a profound message for the younger viewer in 1997's 'Princess Mononoke'.Suffering a cursed injury, Ashitaka, the last Emishi prince of the Emishi village, finds himself on a journey Westward bound to try and find a cure for his ever-worsening ailment. Along the way we meet a colourful cast of characters including the titular Princess Mononoke (San) and her band of wolves.Venturing into the wild Ashitaka discovers a town destroying the land around them, the home of the wolves, in order to develop iron, growing exponentially in power and wealth. Should this trope sound familiar to you it would be for good reason. For many years the issue of defamation of the natural world for the prosperity of humanity has been a frequently touched upon issue, yet from the get-go the beauty in this film is in its initial reluctance, and then outright refusal to take a side.The destructive mentality of the people of the ironworks is merely a community attempting to find its place in the world; they destroy to prevent themselves from being destroyed (as it is established clearly they are not the most powerful force in this world). They destroy in fear of being destroyed, in many ways a reflection of the aggressive animals they kill rather than a binary opposition. Following this train of thought, even the animals are not without fault. The forest is divided into tribes of different species, and amongst them it is clear that there is conflict. They bicker and fight all in a desperate bid to survive, much the reflection of ourselves.This conflict is centralised through our connection to Ashitaka whom from the first scenes retains a clear reverence for nature, smiling and gazing in wonder at its otherworldly beauty. He acts as us, the everyman, looking on in horror as two worlds that he adores and is familiar with crash together In fire and blood, a desperate bid for survival where no survival is guaranteed. He fits his role very well and plays off San well also, however if I did have one flaw with the film it would be that: in earlier scenes he seems to develop a connection with San that is only apparent to them and doesn't translate to the audience very well (yet one could always argue that the reason for this is as what they represent thematically usurps what they represent in emotional connection.)Speaking of fire and blood, this is by far one of the most unexpectedly violent Studio Ghibli films I have ever laid eyes on. From the first scene blood is abundant, limbs are lost and death reins over the land. However, unexpected as it threw me, out of place it was not. The violence perfectly reflects the theme previously mentioned; the disarray of the conflict at the centre of the film between the growth of industry and nature, senseless and heart-breaking.This profound melancholy surrounding the theme yet contrasts itself with joyous human moments sprinkled throughout the film in romance, friendship etc. all heightened by a mesmerising score and Ghibli's signature rich vibrant visuals, which both make the world we're exploring feel full, truly living and breathing.Princess Mononoke is a film which takes risks, hovering in-between the side of nature's right to rule and the roaring progress of industrialisation, yet never wavering in its resolve. It knows that the issue isn't black and white, with dynamic elements frequently affecting the actions of both man and beast, with violence resulting from confusion, and a sense of pensive grief hanging over the film. Through all this conflict, neither side overcomes in the end, with the beauty of life itself being the true victory, a truly profound message for both children and adults alike.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Transcendence over conflict,"""Nature vs. Human"" is one of the central topics of this film. What many people misunderstand is that, however, this ""human"" (symbolized by ""Jigo"") includes most of the ordinary people in the world who live in a wood-made house, drive a car exhausting gas, and use plastic-made goods, not only the hopeless money-driven people who typically make a golf-course by cutting woods.From the bird's viewpoint, modern capitalism or neoliberalism is coherently and thoroughly criticized, for San (Princess Mononoke) symbolizing ""nature"" is consistently not compatible with ""human"" until the end. Ashitaka intends to reconcile ""nature"" and ""human"", but unfortunately, his way is to accept the conflict and discrepancy of them with his endless struggle. So the dog-god Moro strictly advised him to ""live"" beforehand.In the mid '90s, a continuous economic decline, ""lost 25 years"", were just beginning in Japan when people committing suicide were increasing in the locked-up feeling. On the other hand, people who lived in the Muromachi era around 500 years ago always deliberated their views of life and death facing daily deaths. The strong and catchy message of this film, ""survive"", thus having a double meaning, must be widely accepted 20 years ago.After 20 years still in the economic decline and left behind the global economy, Japan rather seems to recover its harmony with nature and human or anti-capitalism compared to that time. So far partly and still fashionable though, no golf and no cars, increase in young people loving more rural areas than urban ones, development of ecosystem such as electric cars, the advent of minimalism and sharing economy... probably these new trends would be life sprouts after their economic death as if caused by Shishi-gami!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Lovely,"I've only seen a few of the director's films, but the ones I have (Spirited Away, The Wind Rises, My Neighbor Totoro, and now this) i have enjoyed immensely. They all have a certain sensitive demeanor and tone, a very carefully realized world in each one. As it is, it's always a pleasure to get lost within those worlds no matter the circumstances. Here, I saw this one in an English dubbing but it was pretty great. The voices really lend something to the proceedings that is not that easy to really get at by reading subtitles, even though that is always the preferred method.

Blessed with a curse,"The story was well built, i felt like it had a good purpose. It was about strength, peace, war and love for other creatures and as well hate.

The main character is a brave and honest young man, who is struggling to keep his strength up most of the time, but is burden by his curse.

But still this movie had these moment of greatness were you felt an big urge to pay even more attention to it and you forget how uncomfortable you lie in your bed. There are a few fight scenes that i thought were very well done, it was these sound effects other than the usual that made it spark a bit (not literally) and the fight were not too long or made you bored in any way. The music had a bit classic feeling, or kind of typical music in movies made by Asians, don't get me wrong i loved it, they made the music match well in to the movie.

Easily in my Top 5,"I remember the first time I saw it, it was right when this title came to DVD here in America. I wasn't yet double digits, and it was the first time I felt fear without having to look away or needing someone there near me.It was not a fear I had felt, and in fact calling it fear may be the wrong word, but to me moments got my heart racing, my hair rising on the back of my neck. It felt like there was a real risk within the first scene of the movie.There were so many things I didn't understand, but I remember the thing that stood out to me the most was there was no actual villain. The gods were killing humans to preserve their world. The humans were killing the forest to preserve their species. No one was 100% right nor 100% wrong. Even the worst person in the film was praised for seeing lepers as real people, for saving girls from brothels and teaching them to fight.I will absolutely be showing this to my children when they are around 8 or 9. I think showing them that in the real world there is no obvious bad guy is important. Everyone has a side, everyone is doing what they think is right, be it for their betterment or the betterment of those around them. We do not do things to purposefully take from others, only to give to ourselves. It's an important lesson and Princess Mononoke gives us this lesson in a movie with absolutely stunning musical accompaniment, some of the best animation I have ever had the pleasure of seeing, and great voice acting from people you might not recognize right off the bat.I'd recommend to absolutely everyone to see this movie at least once.

Beautiful and thoughtful tale of conflicting values,"A Prince, wounded and cursed while fighting a demon, seeks answers and a cure in the forests to the west of his homeland. There he encounters a feral young woman, the adopted daughter of a wolf-God, who is fighting to preserve the forest from encroaching human civilisation. Directed by Hayao Miyazaki, the film is a stunning example of anime, with a rich palette and striking, memorable imagery (I especially liked the 'kodama', the odd, endearing little forest spirits). Although a clear message is sent about valuing the Earth and recognising the dangers of exploitation, the story is complex and ambiguous (especially compared to the simplistic morality plays usually pawned off as 'educational'). The look is typical of Ghibli anime (except Lady Eboshi, who looks a bit out of place) and, although the voices in the English version I watched were a bit bland, I found the characters engaging and interesting (although always secondary to the imagery). The music was also compelling and well matched to the mood and action. All in all, an excellent philosophical fantasy-adventure from the incomparable talents at Studio Ghibli.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Disney wishes they could make movies this good...,"Yes, you read that right.  And the irony is that Disney brought it over.  It bombed thanks to them, because they realized that the movie was not typical kiddie krap-no songs, the cute creatures don't even talk (they click and fortunatly don't distract), and there's no hit-you-over-the-head moral in it.  Simply put, this is the best movie ever made, animation or otherwise, and Disney couldn't handle that.The characters in this film have incredible depth that even live-action films don't attain.  There's no characters that are outright good or bad. Eboshi at first glance would be the haughty villainess, but while she does commit evil by killing the gods, she also does great good by buying up the contracts of women forced to work in brothels and caring for lepers without even fearing for their illness.  San, whose name is the ""Princess Mononoke"" of the title (Trivia: Mononoke means ""Ghost"" a name that shows the depth that Hayao Miyazaki uses in his films), while she is trying to save the forest, is quite bloodthirsty.  The gods, who protect the forest, are also very warlike, and despise humans.  The fact that there is no real line of good or evil in the movie is what makes it so powerful.That is not to say the animation isn't impressive.  They pushed the limits with this one-the final sequence with the mutated Deer God is so real you forget that your watching a series of drawings that are only an illusion of motion.  The worm demon-gods would be impossible to create in live-action-only the realm of animation make them seem plausible.This movie proves what animation can do, and also shows a sad fact-while animated films have been around for about a century, their potential has been severely overlooked to the point where the most crude of drawings and pointless of plots are considered to be ""art"" and are relegated simply to the realm of ""mindless kids entertainment"" (or worse-EDUtainment:P).  Disney would do well to learn, but they haven't-they're still not releasing the other Miyazaki films they bought the rights to.  Perhaps they realized that if people saw how bad their own animation hsa become that they'd have to spend the extra time to make GOOD movies instead of the mindless drivel or pathetic made-for-video sequels (Little Mermaid II anyone?) they keep pushing out to us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Very Slick Anime Epic,"I have always been interested in the field of animation, but one major chunk of the industry has alluded me for quite some time. That would be anime, a genre of animation that continues to be insanely popular in the East but widely regarded as geek-fare over here in the States. My interest rose upon hearing about Hayao Miyazaki and his wonderful films that have broken box office records in Japan. The first film I saw that was directed by him was Kiki's Delivery Service, a charming movie with a leisurely pace and appealing characters. Princess Mononoke is a very different beast, however, and is not a kid friendly fable by any means. It's a very complicated war epic that combines mythology and politics to make one amazing adult film. Sure, there is some great comic relief, but there are also decapitated soldiers, demon boars who puke buckets of blood, and characters who get shot point blank. In short, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING YOU SHOW TO THE KIDS YOU'RE BABYSITTING WHILE YOU GO AND PIG OUT ON PIZZA HOT POCKETS. The only people I see watching Princess Mononoke are mature fans of animation who can handle some gore and a deep, convoluted plot. Your basic summary of the movie's story might go something like this: A prince kills a rampaging demon that tries to attack his village, and in the process receives a deadly cures that will slowly poison his mind and body. He must now journey deep into the forest and try to find a cure, but along the way he meets a large cast of characters who are at war with one another. There's the samurai, who want the ore of Iron Town, a soft spoken warrior who guards that town, and the creatures of the forest, who are led by Princess Mononoke. At over 2 hours long, you can trust that this is just a small piece of the complete tale. The ending is a classic moment involving destruction and rebirth, and is one that cannot be missed. My favorite character had to be the Forest Spirit, a creature with bird-like legs, elk antlers, and the face of a human. I won't say anymore. Just see it, and then check out other Miyazaki flicks like Spirited Away, My Neighbor Tortoro, and Castle in the Sky. ****/****",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

The animation may have been great but these days with computers helping them it's hard to be impressed by mere glitz.The scene near the end with the forest spirit turning into a headless monster gave me the feeling I was watching an animated variation on the Godzilla theme.Very run-of-the-mill overall I'd say.,3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Set in a fantastical world, it seamlessly weaves environmental themes into a rich tapestry. The visual splendor and profound message make it a must-watch, offering a thought-provoking journey that transcends conventional animated storytelling. ""Princess Mononoke"" remains a testament to Miyazaki's storytelling prowess, leaving an indelible mark on audiences with its beauty and depth.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Arguably Hayao Miyazaki's Definitive Magnum Opus,"While Hayao Miyazaki has a large caliber of phenomenal features, Princess Mononoke might be his most important masterpiece due to how much international attention it brought to Studio Ghibli. In addition to it garnering widespread acclaim and mass financial returns upon its initial Japan release in 1997, it became a fairly big hit in America following its English dub and is still highly regarded as one of the greatest animated features of all time. Perhaps being Miyazaki's definitive pro environmental film, this historical fantasy epic still remains incredible in both presentation and substance, and for good reason.Set in the late Muromachi period of Japan, the film tells the story of a young Emishi prince named Ashitaka who ends up caught in conflict between the gods of a forest and the humans who consume its resources. With the pretext of Ashitaka journeying into a forest that could cure him of a demonic curse, Princess Mononoke is primarily about the struggle between man and nature through the complications of life. Unlike a lot of environmental themed features of the 1990s, this movie shows how both prosperous natural and progressional prowess is needed in spite of their conflicts with each other, allowing the audience to empathize with the humans and animals in either case. The historical setting adds a lot into the themes of development versus preservation as nearly everyone is at odds with each other, from the hunted animals, to the struggling workers of Iron Town, and the opposing warriors. Seeing these unfolding events from Ashitaka's perspective allows him to be a strong mediator between destruction and resolution, especially in how his curse could destroy him.In contrast to Ashitaka's more peaceful approach to such conflict, San (Princess Mononoke) is driven by her hatred of humans despite being one raised by wolves, which leads her to reluctantly find value within the war and damage in spite of her mood swings. Although Lady Eboshi could easily be an antagonist due to her greed destroying nature to help Iron Town prosper further, her genuine care towards her people, including the women and diseased, shows how she is only doing what she can to survive during such a complicated war. Jigo himself is as focused and determined as he is seemingly schemish, but he's only doing what he feels is best for him and the people in the mind of a hunter. As for the nature side, Miyazaki cleverly depicted each animal species as their own tribes with the same intent on fighting for their land, including the aggressive wolves, the delusional apes, and the prideful boars. Regardless if the characters are humans or animals, they are all depicted as determined for their own kind, something we all need to remember in the meaning of life.As an environmentally themed pseudo fantasy feature, Miyazaki and the powerhouse team of Studio Ghibli knocked the beauty and scope of this feature right out of the ballpark. The backgrounds of nearly every setting are simply breathtaking to look at, from the serenely luscious forest, to the wide open rural plains, to the industrial refuge look of Iron Town. Despite taking place during a specific time in ancient Japan, the film gorgeously depicts the grounded historical elements with fantasy surrealness that still fit the story of life within all parts of land. The amount of detail in all the character, background and prop designs are insanely admirable when one remembers this was one of the last cel painted theatrical animated features to date, and the effects work within the creative fantasy choices may be some of Ghibli's most innovative work yet. The character animation allows everyone to move smoothly with grounded believability and surreal exaggeration, and the action sequences may be some of Miyazaki's biggest achievements in fighting he ever managed to do.Beyond extravagant art direction, the epic music score by Joe Hisaishi might be his most well known and harmonious. As this film is a visual showcase of nature's fluctuating growth in lieu of industrial development, the orchestral work is strongly conducted and each scene depicts different moods so well that even the quieter moments will fit the melodies seamlessly. The more horrific action packed scenes showcase possibly the most intense score work in any of Miyazaki's productions, and the epic scale adds into the thrill of the soundtrack extraordinarily. Lastly, while I did grow up on the Miramax produced English dub with Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Minnie Driver and more, the original Japanese dub is surprisingly quieter and less bombardment in vocal work than I had initially imagined. This is definitely quite the contrast, but it at least allows us as the viewers to take in the gracious surroundings with the respect and patience intended for all. I'm sure every distinctive viewer will prefer one dub over the other, but it's still interesting to compare the differences nonetheless.Looking back now, Princess Mononoke could arguably be the best animated feature that discusses environmental topics out there with its subtle yet powerful message, strongly nuanced characters, impeccable animation and phenomenal score. Regardless if you're a Studio Ghibli fanatic, average movie watcher or newcomer to film & animation, this film is a must watch for nearly everyone curious about how man and nature are more complex than we give them credit for (little children not included though). It has rightfully earned its milestone legacy over the years and I couldn't be happier to call myself a long time admirer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Princess Mononoke is one of Studio Ghibli's best and is one of cinema's finest fantasy epics.,"In a cinematic landscape inundated with sequels, reboots, and adaptations, it's refreshing to step back a decade or two and watch something wholly original and incredible. Princess Mononoke was Hayao Miyazaki's seventh feature film and remains the longest that he has directed. At 134 minutes long and with a story as grand as the world it depicts, Mononoke is far from the standard animated output of either the US or Japan. This one is violent. It is epic in the truest sense of the word. It shows us all the world in which we live, only completely different, and it does so brilliantly.We hear two distant drum blasts, and the film opens on vast, forest- covered mountains. Trees fall and plants die as a monster passes through the them. This, we learn, is an angry demon in the form of a giant boar, and it charges to attack a nearby settlement. Prince Ashitaka (Matsuda/Crudup) meets the monster outside of his village and defends his people from it, but not without sustaining a cursed injury. He must leave his village and head west to search for a cure.As he travels, he comes to Iron Town, which is under constant attack from the forest that it has been destroying. Leading this attack is San (Ishida/Danes), a human girl who was raised by a wolf deity and has vowed to kill the town's matriarch, Lady Eboshi (Tanaka/Driver). As the conflict escalates far beyond the town's mountain, Ashitaka must choose where his allegiances lies and how he can end the war.I consider this to be one of the few truly great, mainstream environmental films. Its treatment of the nuanced issues at hand is equally nuanced, and unlike the easy ""nature good/people bad"" moral of so many others, Mononoke is able to leave us with the message that there is a balance that must be maintained. Humanity will always develop and progress, but it must do so with the knowledge that our lives and our resources all depend on the world that we inhabit.This film pulls no punches. Limbs and heads are shot clean off, and hard questions don't get easy answers. Perhaps most challenging, though, is the character of Eboshi. She acts as the antagonist of the film but is benevolent toward those in her town, buying prostitutes out of nearby brothels and offering lepers employment and respect. She is destroying the environment surrounding her land but all for the sake of her people. The cultures and relationships depicted in Princess Mononoke are uncharacteristically real for a blockbuster release.Mononoke's animation is top-notch, even compared to Miyazaki's other works, as the landscapes, characters, and monsters are given incredible life and depth throughout. Joe Hisaishi's score is epic and has got to be among the greatest scores in an animated feature. The sound design as a whole is incredible; through it you can feel every arrow landing around you and smell the dust as it flies up from the feet of Ashitaka's elk. Princess Mononoke was supposed to be its director's last film, and while I am glad that he changed his mind, this would have made for a fine final work.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Japanime at its best,"When I was younger, I used to watch TV shows like Power Rangers, Dexter's Laboratory, and Swat Kats. So, Japanime isn't always popular with me, but I really like this movie. I relate to the main character because he cares about others and does what he can to help. And the movie showcases cooperation between animals and humans well... think horses. Yakul, Ashitaka's red elk, which looks like a Tauntaun from Star Wars, carries him from place to place. At the beginning of the film, actually, he is riding Yakul when Nago, a wild boar covered with a horrible spirit, attacks a small village. Ashitaka helps a small group of villagers escape from Nago, who looks like he is covered in a heavy, thick, amorphous black oil, but upon closer inspection, it looks more like a pool of worms. These worms shoot out of him like tentacles. A piece of the black spirit shoots out from Nago and strongly twirls, lightly grabbing Ashitaka's right arm. He pulls away. While a small amount of the sludge is on his arm, he is able to release an arrow into the monster's eye, killing him. After his first fight, as his arm rots, this wound glows and he needs help to heal it or else he will die. Find out how iron is killing the animals and see how Ashitaka helps save the forest while preventing his own death.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The most epic and action-packed of Miyazaki's films. A true masterpiece of the animation medium.,"""Princess Mononoke"" (Mononoke-hime), released in 1997, stands as one of the most powerful and unforgettable entries in Hayao Miyazaki's acclaimed filmography. Among his many masterpieces, this one is the most unique, combining breathtaking animation with epic storytelling, intense action, and a darker, more mature tone. It's also the first Miyazaki film to adopt the Jidaigeki style, immersing viewers in the lives and struggles of historic Japanese people.Set during the Muromachi period (between 1336 and 1573 AD), ""Princess Mononoke"" follows Ashitaka, a young prince cursed by a demon and forced to journey west to seek a cure. His travels bring him into the heart of a war between the industrialized forces of Iron Town, and the gods of the forest led by the fierce and enigmatic San, the titular Princess Mononoke. What unfolds is an epic tale of survival, coexistence, and the devastating impact of over industrialization on nature.Miyazaki's artistry is at its peak here. The lush forests, majestic creatures, and the intricately designed Iron Town with its many people are rendered with painstaking detail, immersing viewers in a world that feels as alive as its characters. The film's action sequences-whether it's Ashitaka's daring escapes on his elk, battles with samurai, or the ferocious clashes between humans and forest gods-are dynamic and pulse-pounding. Yet, even amidst the violence, Miyazaki maintains a sense of beauty, using the violence to heighten the emotional stakes rather than sensationalize or glamorize it.What sets ""Princess Mononoke"" apart from other Miyazaki films is the moral complexity of the story. There are no real villains here; Lady Eboshi, who leads Iron Town, is as compassionate as she is ruthless, while the forest gods, though majestic, can be vengeful and destructive to anyone who cuts down their forests or stands in their way. This nuanced approach to the screenplay challenges viewers to empathize with both sides, making the film as intellectually engaging as it's visually stunning. When I first watched this film at 15, I sided with the forest gods, believing it was their rightful home and that what the humans of Iron Town were doing was purely evil. My 15-year-old self was looking at this story very childishly and naively. Looking at this film now as an adult I see what Miyazaki was trying to say. Both sides have valid points, but neither is entirely in the right.The Jidaigeki influences lend a historical weight to the narrative, grounding the fantastical elements in a richly textured cultural setting. Joe Hisaishi's score enhances the epic scale with sweeping orchestral themes that evoke both wonder and sorrow. It's the most epic score that he has ever composed.For its unparalleled animation, morally complex storytelling, and sheer ambition, ""Princess Mononoke"" is one of Miyazaki's crowning achievements. It's a film that lingers long after the credits roll, offering new layers to uncover with every viewing. This is an absolute masterpiece that demonstrates the limitless potential of animation as a medium, showing that it's not just meant for children.Rating: 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A monotonous and not very original film,"I went to see this movie, because my friend recommended it to me. I was disappointed because it was a fairy-tale. I guess I am not very fond of this genre. Nonetheless, six years ago, I saw ""The Lion King"" and it was much better. In this film, the plot was too simple. I was particularly annoyed by the special effects during the transformation of the Shishi-Gami creature. I also hated the visuals. Probably the only good thing about the movie was its ecological message.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Nice,"The lessons are not simple and they can be understood in a sentence or in a moment, perhaps that is why it attracted many adults too; love, when it happens, does not become the main character of the story, leaving the cliché plot; and the characters are natural, they are not villains or good guys, but complex figures with real motivations.Film seen on the 14th to the 15th of November 2020.",6.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Beautiful and nuanced,"There's so much to love about this Studio Ghibli production, with its beautiful animation and messages of environmentalism and co-existence. It starts off seeming like it will be another fantasy involving a young man going off to fight essentially as good vs. Evil, but we soon see it's not as simple as that. In fact, the character is more often a mediator, so much in the middle that others wonder whose side he's on, which I thought was a nice touch. There are two strong female characters on each side of the conflict, and I loved the nuance in that of Lady Eboshi, the leader of an iron works. She rescues girls from slavery and gives lepers jobs, seemingly a virtuous character defending her operation from the animals which threaten it, but we find that she's also ambitious and her campaign of deforestation is done with ultimate goal of power. She's doing what people do but it's destroying the ecosystem, which is then reacting. Meanwhile there are conflicts within both sides, e.g. Samurai vs. Ironworkers, and apes vs. Wolves vs. Boars. That makes the plot probably a little messier than it should have been, and a film with more action scenes (and associated carnage) than necessary, but it underscores the message that conflict is inevitable, and that mediation is critical to allow both sides to live in harmony. It's all wrapped up in creative visuals done with a wonderful aesthetic, making for an appealing film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"8.4/10 - Nature Gives, Nature Takes","""Can nothing be done? To simply wait for death...""Princess Mononoke is the kind of film that sounds like a cool metaphor with an important message, but turns out to be much more when you dive deep into it.This movie tells the story of Ashitaka, a young warrior from a small eastern village. While defending his village from a mad demon-god, Ashitaka got cursed, and he has to travel far to the west in order to lift the curse, to save himself.But this is not what this movie is really about, and you probably know that. Princess Mononoke is about the relationship between humans and nature. It's also kinda about the climate crisis, but it's not the main thing so I'll leave it for now.Nature may bring life (""I neve knew that the deer god made the flowers bloom..."") or take them away. It may, and it does.And when we take, nature takes too. That's kind of how it works, and Miyazaki communicates this idea in a very interesting, subtler than expected way, on Princess Mononoke. The whole film is one big allegory, but the way that each character portrays a certain mindset, or the way that a single line of dialogue can add so much to this allegory is quite damn impressive.I think that the score here is solid too, the plot is - though slow a bit at times - quite interesting, and the final act is especially great. You know how much I love a strong ending.Oh, and the animation is decent too. I know that miyazaki went on to create stuff that's by far more impressive visually, but this film is still very well made, and for a relatively small budget this film looks really solid.Issues I take with this film - San's character is a little underdeveloped in my eyes. Especially her relationship with Ashitaka or Moro. Also, I feel like Miyazaki kinda shows a little bit of escapism regarding the climate change towards the end of the film, BUT. I do get that it may very possibly not be exactly what he was aiming for, and the message of the film is still quite important and is communicated in a deep way, and not through one pov only.So, that's it I guess. This film is pretty damn good, and though it has some issues it's definitely worth your time. The message is important, the allegory interesting and the film is very well made as a whole. Plus, a strong final act is alway great. I'm feeling an 8.4/10 on this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

An outstanding achievement in telling a long-narrated fantasy through animation.,"Princess Mononoke (1997) :
Brief Review -An outstanding achievement in telling a long-narrated fantasy through animation. Hayao Miyazaki Cinema has a separate fan base. Some of his films are hailed as all-time classics, and even though I disagree with it, I still found some of them really good, and some are very good. I don't want to get into the Miyazaki fandom battle and watch his films as a neutral because I believe I can't be stuck with one filmmaker and his style when I have 50 more and bigger legends from world cinema to explore. I won't even waste time mentioning his other movies and my views since I have already written separate reviews. Let's talk only and only about Princess Mononoke in brief. So, it's a long narrative, like I said, and that's what makes it different from other animated flicks. Hollywood has made us accustomed to 90- to 100-minute animated movies, and they have been highly impressive, especially Disney and Pixar. That's why Miyazaki cinema is different. He takes the story round and round, visits every corner, confuses you with over-the-head theories and numerous characters, and then adds human/animal emotions to it. Princess Mononoke is a fine example of that long and difficult storytelling. It's an outstanding achievement when it comes to execution and vision. The visual effects look real, not fiction, because the filmmaker has convinced you to believe in that fictional world. At the end, there are emotions that flow just the same through humans and animals' blood. It's a story of human vs. Animal, civilization vs. Forest, and it's all set in a fantasy world. The hero and heroine are both underage, which makes the story relatable to a smaller age-group audience. Despite the longer runtime and a few drawbacks in the climax, Hayao Miyazaki delivers an A-class product in his own genre. This one can be skipped by others, but not by those who love Hayao cinema.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Extremely overrated,"The animations are wonderful and epic, but the storyline seems to have been written by a drunk child. The film is super slow and boring and you'd have to search your whole life to find just a hint of dramaturgy. Nothing is established through storytelling and instead every character simply tells us out loud why and how things are and what they're going to do about it. Watching this is like listening to a badly told story about someone's dream. The main message, (we have to respect nature) is smacked right in your face from the get go and the rest of the film is just 2 hours long of the main character running through the woods and talking to people.",3.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"We cannot change fate, but we can rise to meet it.","Something is wrong. A shapeless rage and powerful demon appears on the outskirts of a small village. Animals as well as humans are poisoned and cursed at its touch. Ashitaka, a perceptive and valiant young man and peacemaker who is wise beyond his years, recognizes that this demon is blinded by its own agony. He attempts to quiet its rage and direct the sinister power away from the village. Despite his efforts and care to avoid the demon, and his success at saving the village, Ashitaka is touched by the curse. The village oracle encourages him to journey with unclouded eyes and open mind to the source of the demon's rage - a distant forest - where Ashitaka may be able to find a way to lift the curse. The journey takes Ashitaka to an ironworks encroaching on the forest, where people, animals and demons are at war with each other, and with themselves. As Ashitaka looks for a way to lift the curse and keep from harm, he uncovers secrets of the place and characters. This includes a mysterious and beautiful young princess allied with the wolves; Mononoke.Twenty years ago, in Georgetown, a Japanese embassy sponsored advertisement of the film caught my eye. I encouraged my fiancé to come. It was our first Miyazaki film and I was stunned by its insight, wisdom, artistry and beauty. It touched on some of my basic beliefs about human nature, love and the environment. A recent trip to Japan and the remote island of Yakushima (used as a model for scenes in the film) deepened my appreciation for Princess Mononoke.The artistic beauty is timeless and dazzling to the senses. Mist rises from the mountains and ancient forests of gigantic cedars. Rainstorms, shadows, clouds and rivers appear to rush over you as they pass on screen. The landscape character is revealed in the variable light of the sun and moon. The incredible attention to detail is evident in eyes that sparkle in the night, light and ripples on water, wind on grass, haunting bird songs, different shades of stone, the flash of gunpowder and a night sky filled with stars.There is incredible complexity to the characters; female and male, animal and human, earth and supernatural. This complexity is heightened by immersion in the Japanese culture wherein spirits and demons take human or animal form, or something in between - or even beyond - both. Twenty years ago, I ruminated about my fiancé and wondered what characteristics she shared with the fascinatingly intricate, attractive, stylish and spirited female characters. Mononoke and Lady Eboshi, both willful, fearless and independent, deftly navigate the male oriented world. The two are separated by belief. Eboshi is realistic. ""We have more to fear from ourselves than from demons or monsters,"" she wisely maintains. Mononoke is idealistic about the forest and, of course, wolves. Ashitaka, the peacemaker, is respectful and observant of others. He has the admirable ability to see through the eyes of strangers and understand how they feel. Tough and vulnerable at the same time, he helps others and shrugs off aggression.There are so many bits of wisdom scattered throughout the film and in surprising places. One important and recurring theme is the precarious balance of the natural world and our relationships to others. We are connected to the environment and others in all we do, and this film underscores this point. Destruction and violence just create more hatred. The film pushes us to be non-judgmental and hopeful like Ashitaka. New life is always on the threshold and within reach, if we allow it. We may not know what form it takes, but we must leave space for it to grow. We are alive, and we have each other. The film dialogue is delightfully intricate and unpredictable. The competing interests, changing circumstances and shifting balances of life are skillfully portrayed. We cannot change fate, but we can rise to meet it.The story is based in a time when Japan, 150 years ago, was suddenly transforming from the ancient ways, to iron, gunpowder and other technologies and beliefs. Listening to the film in Japanese, with English subtitles, adds another wonderful dimension to the film. One of my favorite films ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

At least anime fans will appreciate it.,"My first experiences of Japanese culture dates back to around 1987.  My Father, who speaks some Japanese, thought that it would be a good idea for he and I to take a Japanese language class.  He also thought investing in the Macheezmo Mouse chain of restaurants was sound financial advice.  At the end of the six week accelerated course I could only utter the phrase `ima nanji des ka,' or `what time is it now?'  Every other phrase I retained would only come out in stutters-like Porky Pig in need of subtitles. Because of this harrowing experience, I endured years of Japanophobia which would limit my exposure to anime (Japanimation) to reruns of the 1967 cartoon series `Speed Racer.'  Last week, however, when I was given the opportunity to review the Japanese import `Princess Mononoke,' I thought that it would be a good opportunity to see what I was missing all these years, and on a big screen, no less.The film begins at a quick pace with the invasion of a small village by a Boar God turned Tatari-Gami (Cursing God).  A young prince named Ashitake protects his people, but in the process is cursed to a slow but certain death by the giant boar.  He travels west in an `Odyssey' type journey in search of a possible cure from a Shishi-Gami (Deer-God).   He comes across a village of iron miners where an ongoing battle between the animal gods of the forest and the miners is occurring.  Here is where Princess Mononoke is introduced.  She is a human outcast raised by the Wolf God.  The other side of the conflict, the iron miners, is led by Lady Eboshi who has created a safe haven for and provided employment for women and lepers, but is destroying the surrounding forest.  Other players in the battle is a band of men, of whom the character Jigo is involved, who are after the head of the Deer God in a quest to gain immortality.While the `man vs. nature' theme is timeless and intriguing, the strong point of Princess Mononoke is the animation.  Imagine a painting with so much detail in the background that it takes five to ten minutes to fully view and appreciate it.  This is how nearly each of the 144,000 hand-drawn cels and computer-generated images can be described.  There is so much going on, the screen is so busy with detail, that my thumb involuntarily began to twitch towards a nonexistent remote control in order to rewind the film and pay more attention to the goings on aside from the characters in the foreground.One of the disappointments of Princess Mononoke is what I found to be a lack of character development.  The goodbye scene between Ashitaka and his sister didn't bring the slightest bit of sadness out of me that I believe it was supposed to because I didn't know enough about either character to give a damn.  The English screenplay by Neil Gaiman is good, but as voice director Jack Fletcher pointed out when he spoke to the preview audience at Lloyd Cinemas, Japanese animation doesn't rely so much on mouth synchronization and, consequently, American audiences may subconsciously lose involvement in the film.  Princess Mononoke starts off fast, but the rest of the film is slow and can at some points even slower.  Fletcher said that during the final editing of the film that executives at Mirimax wanted to cut about a half hour out of the film before its release, but members of the artistic side of the project wanted to leave the film intact, which is how it was released.  The result is a film that is two hours and fifteen minutes long that contains about ninety minutes of plot.  The film is rated PG-13 for images of violence and gore; Ashitake's arrows manage to delimb and decapitate every foe that they hit, and this is shown in the same chilling detail that is seen throughout the film.  This may make the film seem that it is unsuitable for children, but there is nothing here that they aren't seeing in their video games.  My first impression, though, is that this is a picture that is too gory for little kids, too slow for teenagers, and will most likely be truly appreciated by current anime fans.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
I fear humans more than demons.,"Ashitaka is a young prince who saves his village from a demon god, but he is badly injured during the attack, and the demon curses him. Unless he finds a way to lift the curse, he will die. In order to do this, he must journey to the far west where the demon comes from.And so Ashitaka's adventure begins. His journey takes him into the forest of the Deer God, filled with magical creatures. The Deer God is a mystical creature that looks like a deer by day, but transforms into a giant Nightwalker by night. In the forest, Ashitaka encounters San - dubbed Princess Mononoke - a young girl who's soul was stolen by the wolves. Now, she is nor human, nor wolf, and hates humankind.Nearby is Iron Town, where they mine for iron. Cutting away a great deal of the forest, they caused conflict with the boars living in the woods. The mining is lead by Eboshi, who was responsible for a giant boar, Nago, to turn into the demon god that attacked Ashitaka's village.As Ashitaka's injuries worsens, he is running out of time before he, too, turns into a demon. The film therefore becomes an exciting race against time.The film has a beautiful score and is wonderfully animated. It almost looks as if 'Princess Mononoke' could have been inspiration for James Cameron's 'Avatar'. As the film developed, it also felt like a 'Lord of the Rings' fantasy adventure. Japanese anime are nothing like Hollywood animation. Due to the film's violent nature I can't really recommend it for kids. This is also a long movie that might challenge a kid's attention span. 'Princess Mononoke' is for a mature audience.'Princess Mononoke' just gets better and better as the film progresses, and delivers a fantastic action-packed climax. This is an epic film well worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Humans and Wildlife,"Attacked by a wild boar and infected by the madness that drove the boar insane, a young warrior stumbles upon a war between human villagers and intelligent wildlife in this animated drama from the imagination of Hayao Miyazaki. The film benefits from having no clear-cut villains or heroes; both the humans and the wildlife merely want to use the same territory for their own means and the project as such comes with some positive ecological messages in terms of trying to be sustainable and live in harmony. The most fascinating character is the title one though - a human raised by wolves as one of their own. Oddly enough, considering that the film is named after her, the Princess is only ever a supporting character in the proceedings. Furthermore, the film only ever lightly touches on the intriguing personal identity issues that come with being raised as something that one is not. Fortunately, the infected warrior is a curious enough character with his resilience in the face of impending death that the film still chugs along well. It is also refreshing to see an animated fantasy film that dares to show graphic carnage in order further the story-line. If not quite as dark and impressively nightmarish as 'Watership Down', this Japanese offering certainly comes close to it. In short, this is a relatively engrossing tale if not nearly the best thing that Miyazaki has ever done.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"Best Film of 1999 (Yes, I think it's better than American Beauty.((Don't get me wrong, I thought American Beauty was a great film, but Mononoke was better))).","Princess Mononoke is the most breathtakingly artistic film I have ever seen. It ranks among Fantasia and Pinocchio as the greatest animated films ever made.  The story line is beautiful and complex.  It's not your normal, boring, conventional, and predictable Hollywood plot that everyone seems to want nowadays.  Some people had trouble with Princess Mononoke, I think, because there are no real good guys and bad guys.  You can't really take sides, every character has different motives with good and bad intentions. But that's one of the things I liked about Mononoke.  It's not the good old simplistic Disney tale where there is a definite good and evil.  Princess Mononoke is not about good vs. evil, or even man vs. nature, but about how we should all reach a certain compromise and try to work together and help each other.  You won't find too many themes like that in movies, especially animated features.  Princess Mononoke is not for small children, not just because of the violence, but because it will probably go way over their heads.  It is geared toward adults and older audiences.  The love story between San and Ashitaka is very subtle, moving, and even profound.  It's not conventional Hollywood.  Princess Mononoke is #1 on my ten best films of the year list because I believe it is a landmark feat in the animation genre.  I think it will eventually change the way Americans look at animation; that it's not just limited to the family and small children, but can be for adults and only for adults.  Mononoke shows that animation is just another form of expressive filmmaking, it can show things on film that could not possibly be filmed in live action.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"I was glued to the TV, mesmerized...","In the past I have felt I could admire Japanese anime for the effort it put forth but never was really a fan. The characters looked childish, stiff and jittery most of the time. From the limited ones I have seen they were quirky and too much ""in your face"". But Princess Mononoke, WOW! I was channel surfing and saw it on the Cartoon Network and I could not stop watching it. I even kept bugging my wife (NOT a cartoon fan) saying, ""Honey, you have to see this, just watch a little more!"" even when she was trying to make dinner. I won't take the time to repeat what others have said about this film (yes, I said film, not cartoon) but please read them as they are all very accurate. What I want to add is the ""feel"" of this movie. It takes its time very well. There are pauses that are very natural to human beings which allow you to feel the essence of the story. And the mystical moments of the film, and there are many, made you ""feel"" what the characters felt. It was purely enjoyable. The closest movie I can relate it too was the feel of some of the eerie yet mesmerizing moments in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. It has that tempo, that timing of a good Spielberg movie. I don't know how Miyazake did it. Nothing was rushed but it didn't feel slow, it felt perfectly timed. Well, that's all I wanted to add. Again, I agree with all of the reviews I read, even the criticisms of voice choices. Enjoy this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Possibly Miyazaki's best film,"""Princess Mononoke"" tells the story of a young man's journey to seek a cure for a curse that will eventually transform him into a demon. When he finds what he's been looking for he also finds himself in the middle of a struggle between the forces of nature and industrialization.The story is highly interesting and artfully told in a mature manner. The mythology makes for a highly imaginative story that is nevertheless eminently accessible. I have no idea what kids would make of it but, as an adult, I found it much more satisfying than the usual animated fare from America.I originally watched the movie with the English dubbing done by Disney/Miramax. At the time, my only complaint was that Billy Bob Thornton was badly miscast. Now, having watched the film with the original Japanese dialogue, I can't see myself wanting to go back to the English version. I watched a few clips afterward and the English dialogue just seemed forced and, at the same time, too Americanized.Visually, the film is splendid. The scenery is often quite beautiful and the action is generally well animated. Musically, the film is decent but not especially remarkable.In the end, when you consider the whole package (animation, voice acting, storyline, etc...) I think that ""Princess Mononoke"" makes a strong case for being Miyazaki's best film, though I admit that I haven't seen all of them (yet). This is definitely a must-see and not just for fans of animation.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"AVATAR was inspired by this classic, but is it better? Absolutely.","Princess Mononoke is one of those films that you don't hear much about, but one day you stumble upon it and you have the urge to watch that movie some time. Princess Mononoke is no exception to this kind of discovery. James Cameron got inspired by this movie, and then made AVATAR.The film is set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. Just kidding. It's set long ago in Japan when the land was ""nick-named"" the ""Land of the Gods"". The movie has an instant start. It's one of those good instant starts in a film; it doesn't rush itself.When I saw this movie on DVD for the first time last year, I was blown away by how unexpectedly good it was. Hayao Miyazaki has to be one of the film worlds top geniuses. I haven't seen My Neighbour Tottoro, but I plan to do that soon. This felt something like Spirited Away mixed in with Lord of the Rings, mixed in with a John Ford western.The main character Ashitaka encounters an evil god which he has to kill at the beginning of the movie, but the god wounds him giving him an infection that gives him mysterious superpowers. Later he encounters the titular Princess Mononoke, the girl raised by wolves. This movie shows A+ character development, drama and animation.That's all for the plot.

A Masterpiece,"Princess Mononoke is one of Studio Ghibli's most acclaimed films, only behind Spirited Away. And few films deserve so much praise. Princess Mononoke is beautiful, emotional, and surprisingly violent. When I first watched it at 13/14, it was like nothing I'd ever seen, and it holds up.Miyazaki's films, especially Castle in the Sky and Nausicaa, focus on man's relationship with nature. But in these films, its clear that the environmentally-unfriendly military men are the bad guys. There is little characterization to them. Princess Mononoke is the ultimate evolution of these ideas, where neither side is portrayed as good or evil. Lady Eboshi, the leader of the mining town, is callous towards nature, but kind to her people, taking in those society has thrown away. The gods and beasts of the forest exhibit similar love and hate. This balance makes the world more realistic, and the danger more terrifying. And while some sort of peace is made between the sides, Miyazaki doesn't force a perfect answer.But its more than environmental commentary. The animation is among the best. Combined with majestic backgrounds of nature and a dramatic orchestra score, only other Ghibli films come close to matching Princess Mononoke's beauty. The action is thrilling, with perfect dramatic tension and intimidating creatures to face against the humans. Its one of the hardest PG-13 films I've seen, so don't show it to underage kids.Princess Mononoke is an anime classic. Everyone whose a fan of animation has seen this film. I'm just another voice gushing over it. If you're not a fan of anime, I promise you it doesn't fall for its immature tropes.

Just a drawing...,"I'm not normally a huge fan of fantasy, or of animation; but I'm prepared to make an exception for 'Princess Mononoke'. And not just because it's absolutely beautiful; but more because it has a level of moral ambiguity not normally seen in either of its two genres. The story features a protagonist who spends most of the story watching events he can't control; a town inhabited by vigorous ex-prostitutes, lepers, and useless men, led by a fearless warrior queen but whose future depends on environmental destruction; awesome, but vengeful and frequently misguided gods; a girl raised by wolves who hates humans; and various squabbling animals. Even the villain of the piece (and this is surely an obvious parable for own own world) is less a figure of evil but rather a buccaneering adventurer who puts his own self interest above the greater good. At first, watching a version dubbed into English, I was put off by the non-Japanese voices; but in time, I fell into the world portrayed anyway.

sound both ways on DVD,"Watching this classic hit Princess Mononoke now (2009) means DVD. The Region 1 DVD has lots of choices for sound, so you can either watch the ""American"" version or the ""Japanese"" version (or watch both or even switch), perhaps depending on whether or not you're an anime geek. The DVD has both the original sound track and the ""dubbed"" English sound track (and a dubbed French sound track too). It has two separate sets of subtitles, one also called ""captions"" that matches the dubbed English translation, and the other also called ""subtitles"" that are apparently the original transliteration from Japanese to English. (Be careful though that although both original and dubbed soundtracks are on this particular DVD, this is not necessarily true of other DVDs. For example I've heard, although I haven't yet seen for myself, that the only way to get both original and dubbed soundtracks on the same media for Ponyo is to get the Blu-Ray version.)The dubbing is very high quality. Although there are lots of opinions about exactly how it should have been done (or even whether it should have been done at all), it's clear it wasn't done ""in a hurry"" or ""on the cheap"". Although various people take issue for different reasons with different voices used for dubbing, the appropriateness and quality of the voices seem good to me.The original English subtitles are severely abbreviated, almost schematic. Comparing them to other translations available on the web (I don't speak Japanese) shows they're invariably much shorter. They minimally sketch in the story line while letting the viewer focus on the visual.One even suspects the original English subtitles weren't given careful attention, as frequently they are a bit awkward or stilted, and it seems they don't even try to carry nuances. For example, the Emishi village is led by an old woman; she helps think for the village, and when necessary she predicts the future too. The dubbed translation calls her the ""wise woman"", whereas the original subtitles call her the ""oracle"". Surely a better word naming a leader than ""oracle"" was available.A definite plus of the original subtitles is they're very good at conveying the (assumed intentional) ambiguities in the audio. Sometimes words can be understood two different ways, and every once in a while it's not clear which of two characters in a scene spoke some of the words. For example ""forget it"" can mean either ""you aren't understanding me"" or ""don't remember what you think you just saw"" (or both). The original subtitles are very good at conveying this sort of thing.You can switch between the various subtitles with the usual DVD button. But for some reason you can't use the usual Audio/Language DVD button to switch between dubbing and original; you have to go to the Menu, change the Spoken Languages setting, then select the Return to Film option from the menu.The music is almost exactly the same (except for translated lyrics) in both original and dubbed sound tracks. My guess (I don't really know) as to how they did this is the creators of the dubbed sound track had the complete original score, and had the whole thing performed again. The sound effects are largely the same too, although in the dubbing the intensity and timing of the sound effects are frequently modified.The English dubbed soundtrack is not just a literal translation, but is slightly different in quite a few ways. (The very simplified mouth movements of anime characters make it easy to change words, or languages, or even to make a silent character speak.) Types of differences in the dubbed soundtrack I noticed include: perhaps most importantly, the plot and symbolism of the story is made plainer; some of the dialog is a little more colorful; simple cultural differences are bridged painlessly (by contrast, more complex cultural differences are wisely ignored); ambiguous language is made clearer; a sexual innuendo (the only one I noticed) is softened so much that it disappears; and sometimes elements of the story thought distracting are simplified.And a very few times it appears the translators just plain blew it (or tried to change something I don't think they should have). When in the Emishi village the girl Kaya calls the departing Ashitaka ""older brother"" and gives him her jeweled dagger, the dubbing just translates the words literally, which means treating the girl as nothing more than a little sister. As a result, much later when San is given the jeweled dagger, she can't say anything more than ""pretty"". The original term though is one of those words that has both an archaic and a modern meaning. The archaic meaning is something closer to ""respected elder"", making it clear the girl is not his blood sister but rather his village sweetheart. And her jeweled dagger is a symbol of ""eternal love"", like a gold locket to Americans. Thus Ashitaka later giving the jeweled dagger to San plainly states his choice of his one true love. Unfortunately the dubbed sound track misses all this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Beautiful animated film!,"From acclaimed animator Hayao Miyazaki (""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" ""Castle in the Sky,"" ""Porco Rosso,"" 2002's ""Spirited Away,"" the recent ""Howl's Moving Castle,"" etc., etc.) comes one of the late 90's most acclaimed films - ""Mononoke hime"" (better known by its English title, ""Princess Mononoke""). Taking place in Japan somewhere in the late medieval times to the early Renaissance in Europe (you can tell its time period since you see guns), this animated epic tells the tale of Ashi-taka, the young prince of a lost Emishi Tribe.The tale begins when Ashi-taka slays a boar demon and saves his village from that monster. But in slaying the beast, he gets cursed, and a wound appears on his right arm. In search for a cure, he journeys, with his ""red elk"" Yarraku, out from his village, never to return.He eventually comes upon Irontown, led by the feisty Lady Eboshi. He is welcomed in that town, and meets several people including Gozo, Eboshi's brute henchman, Toki, a feisty woman worker (like all the women in town, formerly a prostitute until Eboshi bought her freedom), and Toki's husband whom Ashitaka saved, Kohroku. It is in Irontown that Ashitaka learns that Eboshi was was the one who accidentally caused the boar demon to attack his village, since she shot the former animal god and caused it to become angry.Irontown is a modern town and its inhabitants produce rifles, cannons, and other modern weapons introduced to Japan by Westerners. Irontown, a symbol of machinery and metal, sits near an old forest inhabited by spirits and animal spirits, who constantly wage war against Irontown, whose citizens are constantly destroying the forest. It is in this forest that Ashitaka meets San, or, as the rest of Irontown calls her, Princess Mononoke. San was abandoned in the forest and raised by wolves, under the guidance of Moro, the wolf spirit of the forest. San hates human beings (even though she is one), and is determined, under the point of death, to protect the forest from human beings, who are constantly destroying it in an attempt to modernize Japan.San and her fellow nature-loving animals are at war with humanity. Amidst a series of events and many characters, lovable and loathsome, Ashitaka develops a close friendship with San and attempts to bring peace between man and nature.""Mononoke hime"" is a very complex film. Its script, handwritten by Miyazaki using his storytelling talent, is filled with many issues, mostly concerning the role of man in protecting and defiling nature. Although ""Mononoke"" may seem like a simple environmentalist film, its issues are actually deeper than that. The cast of characters is great, filled with lovable (and loathsome) people, all of which are three-dimensional. It's great that Miyazaki chooses to make his characters complex. There are no true good or bad guys in this story. Even the ""bad guys"" are have redeeming qualities. Eboshi, the leading antagonist of this tale, is actually a caring person and houses detested lepers, even giving them a life in Irontown.""Mononoke"" is a very fine film. The animation is gorgeous and beautiful to look at. While in the West, animators are resorting to CGI (i.e. Pixar films, and I love Pixar), Japan retains a traditional method of hand-drawn animation, and thank God for Miyazaki's genius! The score, too, is excellent, and the composer, Joe Hisaishi, is a genius. Combine the score with breath-taking cinematography, gorgeous hand-drawn figures, stylized action scenes, and a powerful story complete with memorable characters, ""Mononoke hime"" is a treat for every movie-goer. This is a mature film in terms of story and content. It even has a few (non graphic) be-headings and dismemberment's, earning it its PG-13 rating in the US.Originally released in Japan, this film featured Yôji Matsuda as the Ashitaka and Yuriko Ishida as the title character (Mononoke/San). It was translated into English, featuring the voices of Billy Crudup as Ashitaka, Claire Danes as San, Minnie Driver (in one of her few notable voice performances alongside Disney's ""Tarzan"") as Eboshi, Gillian Anderson (X-Files) as Moro, Billy Bob Thorton as greedy monk Jigo, and a large cast of English-speaking actors.

Of course, the Japanese voices are far superior to the English one, based on my personal preference. One of the things that Mononoke does best, is to tell the story in an epic way. We get to see animal gods and different points of view, from one conflict, without it seeming childish or stupid. This movie, is of my all time favorites. You just have to watch it. It's a true work of art. A hallmark in Animation and movies in general.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

An excellent animated epic!,"Miyazaki and Studio Ghibi have always produced fine work, but they've really outdone themselves with this wonderful anime epic. This movie is the kind of thing that Disney used to put out back in its glory days. Unique tale of man vs. nature stepped heavily in Japanese mythology. The characters are well realized and Miyazaki refuses to make them purely good or evil. They all posess shades of grey that you don't often see in characters in most modern animated fables.The English version of this movie is very well done. The translation is quite accurate and Neil Gaiman was the perfect choice for writing the English screenplay for a movie like this. The dubbing, which could've easilly killed this film, is good for the most part. The best performances come from Gillian Anderson (whose husky voice suits Moro perfectly) and Minnie Driver, who does such a fine job you don't even think about someone speaking with an English accent in feudal Japan.I'm glad to see this movie not only getting released in America, but actually being shown in theaters al well. This is a movie that should be seen on the big screen, as it best delivers the full visual effect. I really hope that Miyazaki makes another movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Better Quality Animation,"Films like these are certainly setting the mark very high for animation. The monsters, creatures, gods, demons, animals, backgrounds and what ever else I've missed are top quality. It certainly gives the feeling of an animated illustration.The story is good too. It goes back to the struggle of nature versus man. Throw in some gods, demons, curses and magic to create quite a spectacle.I found only two major weaknesses in the film.1) Some of the voices for the English version are horribly miscast. I would rather have heard an expert, non-famous, voice actor than some of the star-studded cast choking their way through the dialog.2) The ending was rather weak. It still didn't clearly wrap up the story and the destiny for each character. Some were clear, while others were not. I won't say more. I don't want to spoil it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A respond review.,"To mister taz1004,After reading your review called Highly-Overrated about the movie called Princess Monoke, I can't stop but say that how wrong you are about this movie. ""Princess Monoke"" has been one of the best animated movie created by Hayao Miyazaki with a strong message about the relationship between human and our earth. At first I too thought this movie would be like the other Miyazaki movies(Totoro and Ponyo) but these movies were base more on child-viewers unlike Princess Monoke which was base more on adult- viewers as this movie was intended to inform the grown-ups about the environmental issue of our earth through the director's creative way of showing it through the movie's incredible story.And if you check the rating's for this movie itself on IMDb, it has been rated PG-13; contains strong images of violence. So, obviously it seems like it was your own fault for showing this movie to your children without checking the content ratings for this movie and than you blame the movie by giving a bad review of being full with violence.If you really love Miyazaki as you said in the beginning, you must know that his animated movies are not like the Disney or Pixar animations. His movies are more mature and have more depth than a Pixar or Disney movies. I think you maybe confused between the Japanese way of animating and the more popular animations like Disney or Pixar, as they are solely different methods and different objectives. So I would recommend that next time before you show your kids any movies be sure to check the ratings and have more awareness about Hayao Miyazaki's work before stating bold statement against his movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Probably Miyazaki's best,"This was the second film in a double feature watched at my local cinema tonight, with the first being Akira. I think I may have preferred them in the other order? My general preference is to have the faster paced and/or shorter movie of the two in a double feature go second, but Princess Mononoke following Akira still worked alright.I do think this is Hayao Miyazaki's best movie, and I think at this point I've seen all the features he's directed, too. It's got those unique visuals and characters that only he could ever come up with, and it's surprising that such a rich and intricate world has only been explored in one movie (surprising in a good way. I think the fact there are no sequels or spin-offs or prequels make Princess Mononoke feel more special, and watching it today made me wonder whether the film would be left alone as its own thing, if made today).Miyazaki movies leave me a tiny bit cold when it comes to characters and story, but I feel that the least here. I don't think his films get to me as emotionally as they do other people, but Princess Mononoke is probably the one that comes closest for me at least. The story is well told and the environmental message really comes through, and even if the ending feels a bit rushed, it still hits hard and feels appropriate.It's also just a beautiful movie to look at and listen to, and much like Akira, the world is so awe-inspiring and an experience in itself to witness. Even if Princess Mononoke isn't one of my personal favourite animated films, I still really like it, and understand its status as a classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Odd and Unpredictable,"If you can look beyond the hype, this film is fascinating and radically different from its U.S. competition.  It's an odd rambling adventure, and contains a good deal of violence that makes it too strong for very young viewers.  I would recommend it for middle-school children, but for adults its chief charm is its unpredictability.What happens in this film is never what you might expect.  Standard Hollywood ideas of story development, in which bad behaviour brings about its own punishment and difficulties are valuable learning experiences, are largely ignored and the film does not end with all problems resolved. Most of the characters are not at all complex, however, and, with a few key exceptions, are relatively standard for contemporary Japanimation (anime.) There is nothing that could really be described as character development, there isn't really much of a plot, and the story just sort of ambles along to a puzzling ending.Other reviewers have encapsulated the story.  Prince Ashitaka is the beautiful, stern young protagonist standard for anime.  He rides a red elk and contradictorily fights with the power of hate, which provides the movie with some wholly unnecessary additional violence.  Princess Mononoke is the pretty teenage heroine likewise standard for anime.  She has been raised by wolves and consequently wears a fur stole (er - wolf fur?) and white jewelry.  The most interesting characters are the rascally monk/imperial agent Jigo, and Lady Eboshi.  Why does the emporer support Lady Eboshi in creating Irontown?  Why is she building up a powerbase?  Does she form a society of lepers and former prostitutes for humanitarian reasons, or for their loyalty?These and many other questions are never resolved, which adds some intrigue to the story.  However even the theme of the film, that humanity is out of touch with nature, is handled in a vague and contradictory way.  Are the humans supposed to embrace nature by putting on warpaint and riding wolves, or just not be in the forest at all?  Just how natural ARE boars that talk and wear warpaint?  Is the willingness of the wolves to let the boars die, or the attitude of the monkeys, meant to cast an ironic light on Princess Mononoke's faith in solidarity with nature?  The film also makes vague gestures in the direction of immanence but again, nothing is very clear.None of this is necessarily BAD, but it's hard to derive an ultimate meaning from all these tantalizing puzzles.  Still, it's a lot more intriguing than anything I've ever seen from Disney.",7.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Great film,"This is the third Miyazaki film I have seen (after ""Kiki's Delivery Service"" and ""Spirited Away""), and though I loved the other two movies, this one is probably the best. The animation, as with all of Miyazaki's films, is simply superb; the way that these drawings portray every aspect of nature is just breathtaking. An excellent feature of the storyline, I believe, is that there is no one character that represents evil; Lady Eboshi seeks to destroy the forest, but only because she thinks it will save her people; Jigo may be greedy and seeks glory, but not to deliberately hurt others. The environmental/social commentary throughout (particularly invention vs. nature) gives the story a depth that is almost non-existent in modern animated films. Overall, a truly great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Who needs Disney?,"Disney was never great but now they can't compete. I had purchased this on DVD a little while ago thinking it was something else.

A great watch for adults and children alike.9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
It still makes me cry.,"In ancient times, the land lay covered in forests, where, from ages long past, dwelt the spirits of the gods. Back then, man and beast lived in harmony, but as time went by, most of the great forests were destroyed. Those that remained were guarded by gigantic beasts who owed their allegiances to the Great Forest Spirit, for those were the days of gods and of demons.About 9 years ago, I saw this film for the first time in my life.My mind was pounded very harshly. With my only experience with manga or animé having been Dragon Ball Z and Pokémon, yes. It was definitely different. What struck me most about this was the sincere tone in which they handled the entire film. No exaggerated humour, no pop culture references.We open with a brief narration, after which we see a young prince of the Emishi tribe, Ashitaka, defend his village against a former boar turned demon.His arm receives a terrible curse, and he is to travel to the West to there see, with eyes unclouded by hatred, what caused this beast, that cursed him, to go mad.Riding his red elk, on the way he meets many figures among which being a monk named Jigo, a ruler named Eboshi who harvests iron for the sake of melting it into bullets so as to be able to expand her territory, and a mysterious girl who has sided with the wolves of that same territory.Each of these parties clash against one another often, while Ashitaka only wishes to stop the fighting, as demonstrated in a beautiful scene where he brutally interrupts a battle in the middle of an entire crowd.He seems to figure his own need to cure his own curse is irrelevant compared to the sake of ridding the present society of its own diseases.I feel no need to disclose any further details. Do yourself a favour. Watch this film. Watch it again. And again. Do it in an endless loop, if you will. I can almost guarantee it is highly unlikely that this one would ever get old.It could seem like an environmental message in disguise, but don't you dare fool yourself! It's truly much deeper than just that.It has never failed to make me cry. And I suspect it will always succeed at just that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"""Princess Mononoke"" - Wondrous, Magical, Mystical Storytelling","""Princess Mononoke"" is Japanese animation at its peak. It's full of dazzling visual delights, kinetic action, magic, mysticism, epic-level storytelling, and it is frankly quite difficult to not get swept up in it all. It made me laugh, it made me cringe, it scared me, and it moved me and it touched me, deeply. This is one of the most thematically deep and touching animated pictures I've ever seen. Lastly, it's also one of the most violent.Now I don't mean ""Princess Mononoke"" is violent in the same sense most Anime' is. This is not a 134-minute gorefest; it's ""PG-13,"" for crying out loud! But yes, people do get impaled, shot with arrows and bullets, forest animals transmute into swirling masses of life-sucking snakes and the blood does flow, but it is all done in a fashion that drives home the point of man's eternal conflict with nature.It helps to realize that Japanese animation is a lot more complex and daring than American animation cinema. The Japanese animators put forth enormous effort and strive for absolute perfection in their cinema, which places it on a level that will never be reached here in the United States.With that said, director Hayao Miyazaki, who is one of the most revered animators not just in Japan, but in the whole world, personally saw to it that ""Princess Mononoke"" made a successful transition from the drawing board, to the big screen, and finally to Japanese and American audiences. And in relaying ""Princess Mononoke's"" epic vision of man's conflict with nature to American audiences, comic book artist Neil Gaiman wrote the English script, and a fine cast of talented actors were brought in to voice the characters. Of course I'm talking about Billy Crudup, Gillian Anderson, Claire Danes, Minnie Driver, Jada Pinkett Smith, Keith David, and Billy Bob Thornton.Set in medieval Japan, the film opens (after a lengthy narration by David) at a small village that's fallen under attack from a mysterious creature that emerged from the dense forest outside its borders. The daring and heroic Ashitaka (Crudup) takes on the animal, a giant boar amassed by hideous snake-like creatures. It's defeated but in doing so, however, Ashitaka is wounded - his right arm badly scarred.The wise woman in his village reveals to him that he's fallen under a curse as a result of his battle with the boar. The boar, which was once a forest god, had been transformed into a demon as the result of being wounded by an iron bullet found in its skeletal remains; the bullet then drove the boar mad, sending it on a killing spree throughout the forest. And because he had fallen to the creature's curse, Ashitaka is forced to cut his top-knot and leave the village forever. His journey: to venture to a far off place in an attempt to find a cure for his curse.Accompanied by his loyal elk-like steed Yakkuru, he goes off. He stumbles onto Iron Town, a mostly female-run colony that serves as an iron processing station, and it's run by Lady Eboshi (Driver), who has a sort of trustful mother-like relationship with the women workers (many of whom are mostly former prostitutes) and an uneasy alliance with the male workers.Lady Eboshi is a strong and determined female, the likes of which is rarely seen in Japanese animation. She has surrounded herself with loyal workers that she treats with the utmost respect, and she commands enormous respect too. I really like Miyazaki's treatment of her character, and a great amount of admiration can also be laid upon one of her most trusted women - Toki (Smith).But Lady Eboshi is at war with the forest gods, in particular the wolf clan (which is headed by Moro - voiced by Anderson - and her adopted human daughter San - voiced by Danes) and the boar gods roaming outside the colony's gates. Her iron works is destroying the forest and the gods living there are angry. Lady Eboshi thinks it will all end if she is able to capture the head of the Forest Spirit, the spectral entity rumored to control all life in the woods where most of this conflict is taking place, and she aims to do it with the help of a lowly hunter named Jigo (Thornton), whom Ashitaka had encountered earlier on his journey to the colony.""Princess Mononoke"" is a wondrous achievement in animation. It's breathtaking, with an amazing story about the rise of technology, man's embracing of it, and the war it surely enough started with nature. ""Princess Mononoke"" carries the same weighted messages you might find at any ecological protest here in the U.S. but it's done in such an even-handed and fantastical fashion that you can't help but be taken in.The animation is flawless, as I read Miyazaki personally redrew over 20,000 cells. The voice actors do a tremendous job of translating Miyazaki's words and relaying it to us for consumption and comprehension. I first saw this film back during the summer of 2001 and I easily remember the feelings I had when I viewed it. It was one of the most stunningly realized animated pieces I'd ever seen, as it made me understand the true power of animation, in any form.It's one of my top favorite Anime' films, as Miyazaki would surpass it in 2002 with his superior epic ""Spirited Away,"" which rightfully earned the Oscar that year for Best Animated Feature. Hayao Miyazaki is currently one of the greatest animators, as he has made one of the most beloved Anime' films of all time. It's my thoughtful prediction that one day he'll make a superior animation piece that could be the one to top them all off...10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Imaginative Animation,"The version I watched was the English dubbed.  All the actors did a fine job.

Female characters wield a lot of power in this movie.The strength of the film is the animation.  The land was rendered lush and vibrant.  It made me pine for a planet covered in forest.

Among Miyazaki's Best,"A wonderful film, full of fantastic images, memorable characters, and strong independent women, as with all Miyazaki's epics. Great action and great drama, a well told story that makes Avatar look like a $300 million turd.

The world is believable and intriguing, the characters make believable decisions, etc.Its only real flaw is that it is just so similar to every other Miyzaki film.Even the American dub is wonderful, with a great cast.

A fantastic epic with a problematic second half,"If Studio Ghibli's fantasy films were a menu, Nausicaä and Laputa would serve as appetizers for the main course which is Mononoke. It is a grim, adult fantasy epic which deals with heavy themes in a mature way. It doesn't ask simple questions, nor does it give simple answers and its only moral shades are of grey. It is fantasy fiction at its finest, and magnificently realized.Which sadly makes the few flaws it has all the more apparent.Mononoke has a theme of man vs. nature. However, instead of going the Avatar route, Mononoke presents both sides as fully fleshed out, and neither of them seems better or worse than the other. This is perhaps Mononoke's greatest strength: real-feeling moral ambiguity where wrong and right are shady at best.Mononoke has also a multitude of other things going for it: the animation and art are gorgeous, and don't seem dated in any way. The music is among Joe Hisaishi's best, and that is not something you can say lightly. The action scenes are perhaps the most visceral and thrilling in all of the Ghibli films, and Miyazaki's imagination outdoes 99% of mainstream cinema.Mononoke has only two major flaws, but sadly they can't be ignored. The first is the main characters: they're believable and well developed, but there's an odd lack of emotion to them. Ashitaka, for example, doesn't seem to display much else than cold indifference or steely determination. I also would have liked the hinted romance to have been explored a bit more. It clearly is there, why not go for it?The second, and biggest, problem with the film are its around last 45 minutes. In short, the whole story and all plot threads are solved in one long, intense action sequence which takes up most of the film's second half. The intensity is kept high for the whole time with little pause for breath, and eventually it does get tiring. I think it could have been done better. Also the ending feels quite abrupt after the long action sequence, as the ""what happened next?"" question is answered with only a few short scenes, and then we cut to the credits. There could at least have been an image montage during the credits like in Totoro.Recommendation: Despite my criticisms, Mononoke is in the end a great film and practically obligatory to see for any who consider themselves anime fans. Must-see for Ghibli fans, heartily recommended for anyone else",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Mature Miyazaki,"Got a chance to rewatch ""Princess Mononoke"" after years thanks to the Japanese movie theaters initiative to bring back Studio Ghibli classics to the big screen. I was surprised to find it way more mature, grim, and violent than I remembered.The film deals with the relationship between man and nature as a problem that cannot be ultimately solved. Mankind's instinct is to progress, destroy and conquer, but is ultimately doomed to extinction like any other species, no matter how advanced their weapons become. Nature, represented by the gods of the forest, can be dominated and manipulated by mankind, but still remains the only irrational force that can give and take arbitrarily. Ashitaka's position is neutral, he is just doing his best to keep living aware of his condition as a human being and avoid conflict. None of the characters is truly good or bad, but conflict is inevitable as part of our nature (corruption even drives Ashitaka to unwillingly kill people).The art direction is flawless as always, this time focused on the equivalent of Japan's medieval age and its animistic beliefs. Every Studio Ghibli film has its own unique atmosphere, but the mystic, grim mood of ""Princess Mononoke"" is still unsurpassed. Joe Hisaishi's soundtrack also heightens the epic quality and intensity of the film, with some of his most famous compositions. Gives me goosebumps every time.My only complaint is that, like in most of Studio Ghibli's films, the ending felt a bit rushed despite the long, slow-paced buildup.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"not perfect, but pretty close","Action? Adventure? Romance? History? Sci-Fi? I think I know how to please all those tastes. Now,I'm not a fan of Japanese animation. I find the characters and stories of most anime movies quite over the top. However, this movie completely blew me away. I can sum up my perception of this movie in this sentence: It's not perfect, but it's not far from it either. Everything about this movie is astounding. The animation is an amazing, the music is beautiful, the characters are very interesting, but the story is by far the best feature of this film. I won't give anything away, because I just wouldn't be able to do it justice. It does deal with a lot of Japanese mythology, and that might turn some people off, but it didn't bother me, or take anything away from the movie. It's also a bit violent, so I wouldn't recommend it for young children. Another great aspect of this movie is that they got the voice's perfect. Voices are contributed by Claire Danes, Billy Crudup, Billy bob Thorton, Gillian Anderson, Minnie Driver, just to name a few. And it's done so well, you would never suspect that it was dubbed.This movie introduced me to Hayao Miyazaki, the writer and director. He's a legend in the animation industry, and almost a god in the Japanese film industry. It seems that Miyazaki just can't make bad movies. He was also responisible for Spirited away, and Castle in the sky, two anime movies that made quite an impact worldwide.

Interesting Watch,"I have to admit - the idea of this movie was a little too bizarre for me. Characters like a giant boar and a wolf god was kind of what set me off. I did enjoy the animation, however, and the meaning of the movie was great. The idea of nature versus the human world does tie the whole movie together and makes it rather enjoyable. There's a good message to be taken away from the entire movie. I do think that if anyone is a fan of anime or overall a strong animal presence in a film they will enjoy this movie. The female characters have extreme strength as well which is a nice change of pace from several other films. If you enjoy a strong female presence as well this is the film for you.",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Disappointed Miyazaki Fan,"Miyazaki is truly a genius and so is Jo Hisaishi.  But in this film their ambitious intentions get in the way of what usually turns out to be a moving, inspiring and beautiful film.Mononoke Hime fails in that respect because regardless of what people say about the film's ambivalent perspective on the characters/sides it doesn't really teach us much.  It merely shows it and that doesn't provide any sort of enlightenment any more than reading a horrific episode of war atrocities of a little known faraway land in the newspaper does.  It doesn't go an to emotional level that his other films do.  It merely sits at the ferocious level (or game face) of the characters.  Which is why we can't really cheer or sympathize with any of the sides.  This leads to an indifference regarding all sides and the ending turns out to be unsatisfying as a result. I never really moved by San and Ash, the townspeople, or the Gods. Surprising since I've found other Miyazaki films one of the most moving experiences in cinema matched by only a few films.The music while the most grand of Jo's works is forgettable.  I cannot remember what the soundtrack sounds like.  In contrast, I cannot forget the music of Nausicaa or Laputa.Again the intentions of leaving something unforgettable gets in the way of what these two artists were accustomed to doing and ultimately turns out to be this film's downfall.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
I loved it! One of my favorites.,"I recently bought and watched ""Princess Mononoke"", because I was familiar with a few of the other Studio Ghibli films by Miyazaki. I must say, just like the other films I've watched, I was blown away.It's an awesome movie with wonderful animation and a soundtrack that compliments it excellently. The story is also captivating and has a variety of different morals, depending on how you interpret it. And, even though I was surprised by some of the violence that's absent in most other Miyazaki films, it was still awesome because I love all that gory stuff. :-D Overall, I recommend this to anyone who wants to see a great story with deep characters, and such wonderful forest scenery and action that you almost forget it's animated.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The best animated movie I've ever viewed,"I've seen The Princess Mononoke from a taping on video of it's television screening in Japan (early 1999). Though I can't speak fluent Japanese yet, I found the movie to be one of the most captivating animations ever and a truly moving experience. The powerful imagery and heroic portrayal of the main characters San and Ashitaka lingered in my mind for many days after. With the aid of a partial Japanese and full English script from the net, I was finally able to fully understand and therefore appreciate the story.Mononokehime (original Japanese title) is truly a masterpiece from director Hayao Miyazaki, in the tradition of Nausicaa (13 years ago). Ultimately a love story (in my opinion), it also takes a look at a era when Japan was in a state of great change through technology (though not always progression), and parallels the fast and confusing state of the modern world. In these times, there are elements all trying to carve out an existence from a world of depleting resources.The humans in Princess Mononoke wish to create their own safe havens, in which they can live for ever (at the expense of the forests). The forest gods feel their territory ever-receding and wage war to reclaim it. Ashitaka seeks to free himself from a curse of death. San, the Mononokehime is the embodiment of the conflicting mind, torn between humanity and the forest. Through her we see that compromise is not possible, yet for each party to concede defeat is even less a possibility.The movie is so complex, if you wish to delve, but is also as an animation, the most visually stunning. The animation is flawless, and the backgrounds perfect and every attention to detail is given. After watching this film, other animated movies seem truly flat. The film is also violent, and I hope that no scenes are cut from it (I understand it is being distributed by Miramax), and also fear that hype surrounding the high profile voice actors might draw attention away from the true significance of this film.I look forward to watching it at the cinemas. If only I could find an Australian release date somewhere. This was written at the spur of the moment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Best movie ever made.,"Miyazaki is well known for his beautiful and in-depth creations. His movies hold sentimental value to those who watch them, highlighting inspiring concepts and issues of the world. Princess Mononoke is a magnificent fantasy tale of the ever battling dynamic between nature and industrialisation, man vs man, and man vs self; packed with spiritual ideas, demons, Gods, and curses. The main protagonist (Ashitaka) Is a prince who fights for neither side, only for the greater good. To him there is no evil, both sides fight for what's right for themselves, and fit together to create this world. This is the traditional idea of Ying and Yang; the good and the evil come hand in hand. There is a certain quote which resonates with me; ""To see with eyes unclouded by hate"" which I'll let you decipher yourself. To round off, this film has beautiful illustrations, a strong and inspiring message, and characters to entertain every aspect of your attention. Worth more than just a watch; worth being your favourite too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Truly outstanding...,"The first full length anime feature I ever had the good fortune to see in a theater, Mononoke Hime also stands out as the best... I (and the rest of the audience) sat stunned during the closing credits for what seemed like forever until everyone in the theater spontaneously rose to give the film a prolonged standing ovation.Miyazaki uses Japanese history and folklore to great affect in this terrific ""message"" movie and romance rolled into one neat package. Everything about this film is perfection, the script, the music, the voice acting (both in English and Japanese)...Having seen every Miyazaki feature at this point, I still believe that Mononoke Hime is the best work he has done to date, despite the fact that Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi (Spirited Away) won the Best Animated Feature Oscar... This is truly inspired work for aficionado and anime tyro alike. Must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
My favorite film,"I really can't think of anything to say about this movie.  It's almost too good.  I can never watch it without wishing we had someone like Miyazaki-sama here in the States, or that we had more of his films on DVD, or that this movie had gotten the mainstream theatrical distribution it deserved.  If Disney had been smart enough to release this film subtitled, with a real advertising campaign, it could have been more successful than Crouching Tiger.  There's a reason why this is the highest-grossing Japanese film of all time, and if its distributors had handled it better it could have won Best Foreign Film.  Hell, it should have won Best Picture for 1997, and Jo Hisaishi ABSOLUTELY deserved the Best Original Score award.But none of that happened.  And that's why it's so hard to watch.  Because Mononoke Hime is the best film of all time, and most Americans will never bother to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

pretty good,"i usually hate anime, and anything involved in Japanese culture, but i was fascinated by this movie from the first moment. it has a feminist-naturalist theme that intrigues me and i like the ending (which i will not say here). however, there are a few things i didn't like about the film. first off, i saw it in Japanese, and like i said, i don't like the culture.however, for those of you out there who like Japanese culture, you could find this movie very wonderful. i only give it an 8 out of 10 because it is Japanese, but what i loved was that the film was also good for adults, and it talked about things that most cartoons don't talk about. usually, its anvils and TNT, but this movie moved me to the depths because of the integrity of the characters. they all seem real and even the smallest character adds something very important to the story. in short, watch this movie even if you aren't and anime fan.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Quite Possibly the Worst Movie I've Ever Seen!!!,"Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm not going to even express my hatred for this stupid beyond belief anime. The animation is awful.

I can honestly say that with the right equipment, my best friend Ray and I easily could have done some of it. The plot is awful. I could (and have) come up with a better story than that. I don't know why anyone likes this movie. Maybe if all you had watched your whole life was Japanese anime, then maybe you would like it.Demosthenes",,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
This movie is the reason I love anime,"I first watched Princess Mononoke a year ago, when a friend of mine recommended it to me. I'd never really liked anime, but I gave it a shot anyway, because it looked interesting. Within in the first twenty minutes, I was hooked.The story takes place in an old-style Japan setting. It's about a young prince in a village called Ashitaka. One day he fights and kills a boar demon that was threatening to destroy his village, but in the process he is gravely wounded with a dangerous curse. The curse fills him with hatred; pain, a lust for violence, all this as it also slowly starts to kill him. Shunned by his village, he is forced to leave and search for a cure for the curse. He goes on a journey to the far-off mountains where the boar demon supposedly came from, hopeful for a solution to his problem. When he gets there, he discovers a town that is mining from the mountains and the surrounding forest, but they're slowly destroying the forest and all the creatures that live there. While staying in the village, it's attacked by a pack of wolves and a young girl called San, who lives with and was raised by the wolves. They're defending the forest and all the creatures that live in it, especially the magnificent forest spirit, which the villagers plan to kill in order to destroy the forest. Ashitaka decides to stop the villagers from killing the forest spirit because he knows the forest is sacred and beautiful, but he wants to avoid violence at all costs. Princess Mononoke has the title of being both the first anime film I ever saw, and also one of my favorite anime films of all time.The artwork and animation is gorgeous; the landscapes are beautiful and vast, the forests simply amazing, the characters excellently designed and the violent yet incredible battle scenes are drawn attentively, down to the last, tiny detail. For some anime movies or TV shows, I've noticed the English dub is poor compared to the original Japanese audio, but in this movie the English dub might even be better. The voices match the characters very well, even though they're speaking in American accents.The music is part of my main love for this movie. As a musician, I often listen more keenly than others to the background music for movies or TV shows. And I can say this movie has one of the best original scores I've ever heard. The music is oriental in style, as can be expected of an anime film, but the main thing I love about it is because it sounds so different to any other piece of music I've heard. With some American movies, the music is very dramatic and beautiful (think Lord Of The Rings), but it's still undeniably film music because it's predictable in parts. However, with Princess Mononoke, the music was unpredictable, but still brilliant, almost to the point of sounding like a piece of real classical music. The music suits every situation perfectly; it blends into the scenes so well that it almost seems to become part of that scene.In summary, Princess Mononoke is an absolutely brilliant movie, and one that should not be missed. I know that Spirited Away is considered the best of the Studio Ghibli films, but personally, I enjoyed Princess Mononoke more. It's darker, richer in music, artwork and is more adult than Spirited Away. It's one of the best animated films I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Some of the most amazing animation I've ever seen,"Mononoke Hime is not just another Japanese animation, It is a phenomenon. During it's box office run in Japan last summer it didn't only become the highest grossing Japanese film of the year. But the highest grossing Japanese film... EVER! And believe me, the film definitely does live up to the hype.The film takes place in 15th century Japan and opens with a warrior named Ashitaka in fierce battle with a Tatari Gama (a huge boar with worms covering it's body). Ashitaka kills the gama and successfully defends his village from it, but in the battle the gama came in contact with his arm, leaving a dark scar. The village doctor tells Ashitaka that it is a curse from the gama and is slowly killing him. Convinced that there must be a cure, Ashitaka leaves the village never to return.Ashitaka later comes to the great forest and finds an iron factory in the middle of it. The factory is run by Lady Eboshi, a woman who employs former prostitutes and lepers, giving them jobs that they would never have in the rest of society. She tells Ashitaka about the constant battle between her people and the gods of the forest, giant wolves, boars, etc that are trying to protect their forest from Lady Eboshi's desire to expand her territory.One night, the gods of the forest plan an attack on Lady Eboshi's factory. They are accompanied by a girl named San. San jumps into the factory and begins viciously attacking Lady Eboshi. San is injured and winds up unconscious. Ashitaka then feels sorry for her and comes to her aid... taking her unconscious body back to the forest. He then learns about San's past and why she is living with the animals instead of the humans. The two develop a bond as Ashitaka tries desperately to end the constant battle between man and animals in the great forest and at the same time, cure the growing scar on him arm.My first impressions after watching this film were disbelief that an animated film could have such an impact on me. The story is extremely well done and is geared more towards adults that youngsters (there is plenty of violence here) and the animation (oooh the animation) is SUPERB! I have never seen such beautiful images on the screen for a long, long time, animation simply does not look better than this. I was in awe that all of the elements that make up a great film were all present here... in perfect balance and harmony. It is so well constructed that at times, I totally forgot that what I was watching was animated and not real. The characters are so well written that you are absolutely convinced that they are real people.Disney and Miramax are planning to release this film here in the states sometime in early '99... I'll definitely be looking forward to seeing this one on the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Mononoke Hime is this centuries last ""5 Star"" anime.","Mononoke Hime is this centuries last ""5 Star"" anime. Its captivating story, amazing visuals, and intense characters are merely a cover for the true lesson being told. Its a story which forcasts the lifelong battle between our Earth and those who walk upon it. But even more meaningful, the battle every one of us fights each waking moment of our life deep inside as we struggle to find our place in this world.Each character in Mononoke Hime is facing these very same struggles. On one side we have those who want to improve themselves but feel it is necessary to destroy what is around them in order to achieve it. Then on the other side we have natures Gods which are fighting to preserve the origins of life but are laying blame on a single race when it is all who is at fault. Finally there is the man stuck between both, confused as to why they are fighting a war when they could simply just find a way to coexist.While simple at first glance, there is a lot of complexity to the movie in terms of morals and beliefs.

Simply incredible,"What else is there to say about this animated movie other than it's absolutely spectacular? Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke in the States) is the latest film from acclaimed director Hayao Miyazaki, and it somehow manages to top everything he's ever done (an incredibly difficult task, if you've ever seen any of his other movies). Where do I start? First off, the art is flat out jaw dropping. The backgrounds are incredibly detailed, the animation is always sharp and fluid, and the use of color amazing. In fact, I might buy this movie for its art alone, but then Miyazaki throws in an epic storyline and cast of interesting characters.The storyline echoes the environmental themes of Miyazaki's 1984 classic Kaze no Tani no Nausicaa, but handles it in an interesting way; rather than make the humans into the antagonists and the plants and animals into the protagonists, this film presents both sides of the story and there are no clear bad guys or good guys. Both sides contain a capacity for good and evil, and the object of this movie's lead character, Ashitaka, is to get both sides to settle their disputes. It proves to be intriguing for the entire movie, and this is a fairly long movie.If you've familiar with the world of anime, you'll know what a daunting task a good dubbing can be. Nevertheless, Disney has gone far and beyond what I would have expected and given this movie a truly first rate dubbing. The English dialogue was written by storyteller extraordinaire Neil Gaiman and English voices include such big names as Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton, Gillian Anderson, and Minnie Driver.I can think of only one possible complaint people might have about this movie: that it's too similar to its predecessor, Kaze no Tani no Nausicaa. That may be true, but I think with its interesting ambivalent take to sides and unparalleled art, Mononoke Hime is a must see for everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
what did they do?,"It was a lovely movie, but many of the voices seemed jarringly out of place. This seemed to be reinforced by the dialogue that sounded too contemporary. To me, this is a strong case against dubbed movies.

I had tried to watch part of the movie with those but it was too distracting that the spoken & written didn't match - a problem I don't have when the spoken language is not English.

This film is simply fantastic, it shows that no matter how far digital animation progresses it will never be able to capture the concept of humanity as Studio Ghibli's traditional animation does. The human characters seem more than human, despite all their physical exaggerations you forget that they are animated images and believe in them as much as any tangible actor.This film transcends the genre of animation and sits among the great cinematic works of all time.

A beautiful animated movie that looks into human nature.,"Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke in the USA) is an absolutely breath taking film.  I recommend this film to everyone, even people that normally would not like animated movies.  As a quick note, this is a MOVIE that is ANIMATED.  It is NOT a Cartoon, a cheesy Disney-esque animation or a traditional Anime (Anime is a type of Japanese animated feature).  Don't go to this movie expecting to see our hero break into song and dance, because it isn't going to happen.  MH is rated PG-13 for a good reason, there is quite a bit of animated violnce, but nothing really grotesque (thus it is not an R rated movie).MH's story revolves mainly around 3 types of people.  San, who is Princess Mononoke, was raised by the Wolf goddess Moro and is a defender of the forest.  San hates all humans (eventhough she is human herself) and is trying to drive the humans out from the forest.  Lady Eboshi is the self made master of Iron Town.  She doesn't care about the forest or the creatures that live there.  She is an indusrialist and pretty much wants to rule Japan.  Ashitaka is a Prince from a long since forgotten and nearly destroyed clan of Japan.  Ashitaka is the mediator of the conflict and fights for both sides in hopes that everyone will eventually get along. The whole story revolves around these 3 personalities and combined make an excellent movie.I have not seen the original Japanese version of the film, just the American dub, but for a dubbed movie, it is excellent (and trust me, I have seen a lot of anime and usually the dubbed versions are horrible).  Some people may be a bit upset with it, but anyone who can't speak a word of Japanese, I see no troubles.  A must see film in my book.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Breathtaking,"I was quite stunned at the animation here. I have only see a few of the anime films but am enjoying them very much. This is a great story of people versus nature and all that implies.

As he journeys, he is confronted by the most creatively formed beings. I will have to see this again because there are times when I don't really understand who the good guys and bad guys are. Even those who have chosen the dark side seem to at least have some sort of believable reasoning. I got lost at times in the world created and what they were trying to accomplish. That is, what are the rules they are playing by? Oh, perhaps it is a bit long. That's a tendency I see in some of these Japanese animated features.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Beautiful.  Absolutely Beautiful.,"I had heard so much about this movie that I traveled an hour and a half to Dallas with my friend to see it in the theater, and I can honestly say that it was a 5 hours well spent.  Hayao Miyazaki has created a true work of art in this film, and its questions will stay with you long after its viewing. Please do not dismiss its power on the basis of it being Japanese animation, long a realm merely championed of geeks and fanboys...This world is so completely realized that it gave me goosebumps on occasion. The plot cannot be summarised in a mere blurb-it involves an ancient curse, demons and forest spirits, society and modernization, greed and sacrifice. And that's leaving a heck of a lot out.  I especially like that the evil is so hard to define, kinda like real life, eh?  Who are you gonna side with? The forest protectors are violent and cruel, but what they defend is surely worth defending in such drastic means.  Irontown may be destroying the land thus, but those people have to work somehow, and Lady Eboshi's motives are humanitarian therein.  These are some of the conflicts the hero has to puzzle through, and you may find along with him that there is no clear answer.In short, I recommend this movie highly, to anyone who enjoys film that makes you think.  Sure, there's action, quite a bit of it too intense for children, but it's never wanton.  10/10, and a huge thank you to Miyazaki and his animators for this beautiful vision brought to life.  Oh, and the American voice acting's not bad at all either.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Mystical, imaginative and fierce: A mature Miyazaki","Princess Mononoke is another fantastic, magical and profound piece of work of Hayao Miyazaki.It takes you into a mystical world of Forest Spirits, ancient gods and despotic humans.In the land around a mystical forest different tribes of humans combat each other in greed for land and resource. A tyrannic lady doesn't even shy away from destroying the old forest with its ancient gods and forest spirits with fire arms. A young prince tries to interfere and reconcile the tribes. He wishes that animals and humans can live together alongside. But the war has already developed its momentum.Princess Mononoke is about the ancient conflict between humans and nature. Miyazaki embeds this story in a wonderful scenery, with all kinds of weird and mystical creatures. But in contrast to other Miyazaki-films is the style of Princess-Mononoke not that childish, the creatures and battles might be too scary and violent for under-13-year-olds, even though it's still animation.But the maturity of the film does good.Especially in the first halt of the movie, Miyazaki once again delights us with beautiful pictures of a magical scenery and a great soundtrack.First, Miyazaki shows us a beautiful and unspoiled forest and then we witness how human greed tries to destroy it. The presentation of such elementary contrasts works very good.The main advantage of every Miyazaki film is, as it is also in Princess Mononoke, the ravishment of the spectator into a wonderful and visually overwhelming fantasy world, but exactly here lies a flaw of the movie. The coexistence of the ordinary villages and the mystical forest seems a little bit overdone at times. Particularly the role of gods and demons and their transformation into each other comes across a bit too confused and fantastic. Miyazaki concentrates too much on a spectacular as possible finale, so that the film totally looses its magically calm atmosphere in the end.But anyway, Princess Mononoke impresses with beautifully breathtaking pictures an imaginative story and a great soundtrack.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

An epic tale to remember...,"Mononoke Hime (or Princess Mononoke) is one of those movies for which words are not enough, because its simply too beautiful to describe! As I'm writing this comment, I'm reminiscing on how I came to read of it for the first time, through a small review in a known movie magazine, where its critic wrote how the first ten minutes of Princess Mononoke were just breathtaking. That review stuck with me for some time, and was revived two years later as I went to the video store looking for something for my young brother (aged 11 at the time) to see in the weekend. To make a long story short: I was the one that end up watching it, at 2:00 o'clock on a Sunday morning. And what a surprise! I didn't knew who Hayao Miyazaki was, but I certainly got to Know him from that point on!The story is set in a fantasy like Japan, where the groundbreaking molding of iron was disputed by several feudal lords (and the emperor itself), and the forests were ruled by spirits and gods in the form of giant animal-beasts! In deed the first ten minutes of the movie are presented to us in over drive, as a former god turned demon rages in to the peaceful village of the Emishi tribe, leaving it to its prince, Ashitaka, to defend it . And so the movie gets started!In all of his previous movies Miyazaki had already presented us with the classical duel of Human versus Nature which is in the center stage here. The whole movie can be seen as a huge metaphor, exploring that very same theme, with characters depicting each side of the conflict_ Lady Eboshi and San _ that are everything but one dimensional characters, and can't be labeled as good or bad, as if Miyazaki is inviting us to make our own judgment about them; and of course there is Ashitaka, a fated prince that in his own search for peace of mind ends up being the leverage that tries to bring each side to a peaceful existence. In the end you are left in absolute awe, and questioning yourself how could such a masterpiece ever got to the finish line in one piece! Could it be the story and script on which Miyazaki labored for so long (story has it that he started developing the characters as far as thirteen years prior to the movie)? Is it the top notch cell animation technique, or the beautiful color with which the sceneries are depicted? Or is it the engaging musical score by Joe Hisaishi, that gives an epic feel to the movie as well as enhancing the more intimate side of it (I saw it yesterday and I'm still humming to every single tune there is in the movie)? Perhaps it's the sum of all in the end that make up for its magnificence and beauty.So if you are skeptical about such seriousness being presented in a fantasy-like animated movie don't be. Trust me! Just risk seeing the first minutes of the movie and you'll get hooked, for sure!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Huh?,"I just cannot believe this one got so many names. Billy Bob Thornton? Gillian Anderson? Minnie Driver? Were they all arrested for driving while intoxicated and had to do this as their community service?Seriously, the story and the characters are flawed. A demon that is the War God, surrounded by worm-like creatures that give it its power. While I am all about culture and learning, this made me less inclined to want to know Japanese mythology.I just had a bad time watching it.

Princess Mononoke is a stunning animation and a modern masterpiece.,"I would never believe any animation would surpass the magic of one of Walt Disney's earlier works. Animations that involved years of hard labour and revolutionised family entertainment. In all honesty, Princess Mononoke could hardly hold a candle to something such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. However, the lone fact that it even comes within a mile of that is justification for that failing.For Princess Mononoke is truly a masterpiece, a masterpiece of story, subtlety, and movement that is only superseded by few other films from the studio. It has a dilemma in a way, for it is not very suitable for children, whilst adults will probably be put off by the slightly surreal tale. However, stereotypes such as that can't explain why it was so popular in the first place. The story that depicts the struggle between humankind and nature masks what is really a love story of prince Ashitaka and the Mononoke-Hime of the wolf tribe. The alternation between these two arcs is superbly pitched, and adds depth to the otherwise fairly simple tale.Of course, despite how well paced and emotional the story is it's the animation people would be most interested in. In a generation where animated characters are typified by stiff, unconvincing movement, princess Mononoke is ultimately refreshing. Due in part to director Miyazaki's insistence on hand-drawn animation, and the obvious work that's been put into bringing every scene to life. It superbly captures the atmosphere of it's several locations, populating screens with noise and movement. The excellent use of animation and sound gives objects weight and realistic movements. The characters are expressive and filled with life. It truly is a sight to behold.In terms of English voice talent, Princess Mononoke is typically short of it. Whilst the majority of the actors' performances are adequate. The worst of all is probably Ashitaka (Billy Caldup's) half-hearted performance. The Japanese voicing is a lot better, and yet the subtitles aren't well translated enough. One thing to try is to watch the movie in Japanese without subtitles, and thus see how much you can discern simply from watching the films alone. Princess Mononoke is a stunning animation in it's own right, and simply one of the best movies I'd ever watched. I'd recommend it, but be wary that it isn't the kind of film to sink well with everyone.8/10 Exceptional",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
An amazing masterpiece by Hayao Miyazaki,"I have to admit, I'm not an anime fan, but I always make an exception with Hayao Miyazaki's films: they have a good story and are always visually stunning. And ""Princess Mononoke"" didn't disappoint either.The film is good in terms of plot, with a properly built-up story, adequate tension and drama. And also, the characters were brilliantly developed.The direction couldn't be better. Hayao Miyazaki has shown his talent again!The animation... well, maybe the best thing about the whole movie: the whole thing is visually stunning, with brilliantly drawn characters and amazingly good backgrounds.In summary, yet another brilliant film from Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
A Unique and Beautiful Story,"I watched an English subtitled version of this movie, and I often had to rewind the movie to read the subtitles.  Not because I am a slow reader, but because I couldn't tear my eyes away from the images on the screen.  I watched the movie a second time and ignored the subtitles, and the movie's impact was just as great. 	The film explores the theme of nature vs. technology much like many of Miyazaki's films.  There are definitely similarities between this and Nausicaa, but Mononoke Hime is much more serious and occasionally dark. Although the film does have moments of graphic violence, I would think that it would be very safe to bring an intelligent child of twelve or so.  The hero's attitudes towards violence are made very clear.  His most repeated phrase is ""calm yourself,"" usually yelled in an attempt to avoid bloodshed.This is a film that could not be made as a live action movie.  Fancy computer-generated creatures and live actors would make it seem less ""real."" (not to mention ridiculously expensive)  Miyazaki has always been careful in his films to create complete worlds with their own religions and mythologies, and he never oversimplifies his characters.  The heroes have bad traits and the villains have good traits, and we the audience are left to  figure out what makes the villains in the wrong. He also has a tradition of strong women characters which is very evident in Mononoke Hime. 	Computer graphics are used sparingly and never seem out of place or thrown in.  People who are not used to watching anime often jump to comparisons with Disney films because they equate animation with cartoons or children's movies.  For the most part, this is an unfair comparison, since the target audiences are extremely different both agewise and culturally.If I had to compare this to an ""American"" movie I would say that it's a less sappy, more realistic Neverending Story with hints of Braveheart thrown in here and there (primarily in the epic battles, setting, and the music). If you get a chance to see this on a big screen, no matter how horrible the dubbing or translation, please do so.  The visuals and story will still draw you in.  Bring as many friends as possible and send a message that showing anime in American theaters can be profitable.  If you like Mononoke Hime, Miyazaki's other films are of similar quality and are more suited for younger viewers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Holy $#!@% do I hate anime!,"Let me start off by informing you of my prejudice against anime.  I don't have any conceptual or philosophical differences with it, it just grates on my nerves.  Nonetheless, I felt compelled to watch this movie, given the rave reviews by critics, its acclaim by the film students I know, its notable American voiceover stars, and the fact that my stoner friends popped it in the DVD player so it was either watch it or leave.Well, several root-canal painful hours later I felt I could hate anime in a whole new light.  I came away thinking that the movie did indeed have impressive animation that I still find obnoxious and tackled some environmental issues in a heavy handed way.  I thought that if American drawn characters could have been put onto the lusciously drawn backgrounds and the shrill jeremiads the characters were always launching into replaced with more subtle dialogue then I could at least give it a 5 out of 10 for not completely p***ing me off.But lo and behold I was wrong.  Or so I was informed by some pretentious anime fan.  Apparently all the environmental subject matter is really just a Western construct being super-imposed onto the movie by audiences who don't understand Shinto mythology.  Well Lah-dee-frickin-dah.  You mean I didn't even understand it?  Excuse me for not having a degree in Asian studies, but I don't think that should be a requirement to see friggin cartoon.  Am I uneducated and insensitive to Japanese film making?  Have I misunderstood Kurosawa's movies all these years?  Was I suckered in by the lack of constant yelling and screaming?  Was I merely projecting Western values onto his characters?  Or was he really a genuinely good director who could make movies about people from another place and time that transcend seemingly disparate cultures?Luckily, I don't think this film will ever supersede cult status so the rest of us who are too ""mainstream"" won't have to suffer through it again. Call me crazy, but I like the Coen Brothers, Coppola, Levinson, Whit Stillman, and of course Kurosawa.",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The very best of anime...,"I have seen many animes, including Akira and Ghost in the Shell, which used to be my favorite two anime movies.  However, after seeing Princess Mononoke, it quickly became my favorite.  Miyazaki is a genius.  His ability to tell a story through art is overwhelming.  I would try to explain the story of Princess Mononoke, but it cannot be expressed well in words.I recently bought the DVD of this movie, and there is a feature that allows you to see the literal translation from Japanese to English.  I was very impressed by how well they adapted the final translation from the choppy, literal translation.For those of you that may have been turned off by the excess violence, gore, and nudity of other anime films, you can watch this without being offended by such scenes. The voices that were chosen for the dubbed English version were spectacular, Minnie Driver and Billy Crudup in particular.  If you like animated films and enjoy the art of Japanese animation, this movie is a must-see.  I rate it 10 out of 10 (I would rate it 11 if I could).",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of my favorite films,"This movie is one of my favorite films, - in my opinion, it is nearly perfect. (Maybe it IS perfect.

I don't know if ""silence"" is shown in any other movie,like it is shown in that ancient wood. Watching the film, you f e e l this silence. - I also liked the details - the plants, for example! Or the stones getting wet when the rain starts to fall. It is one of those few movies which can change the people who watch it. You can enjoy being in a wood in a new way, after watching this film. - By the way - The ""Emishi""- people really existed, and they were not the ""Ainu"". I heard, they lived in Hokkaido, too.

"Not just a great animated movie; a great movie, period!","""Princess Mononoke"" (Mononoke Hime) is supposed to be Hayao Miyazaki's last movie ever; may all film creators complete their careers with such a high note!  ""Mononoke"" is a visually-impressive film, with smooth animation, superb attention to lifelike movement and detail, and sympathetic characters who are never reduced to chest-beating heroes or cackling villains, but three-dimensional people with both good and bad qualities and believable motivations.  Like much of Miyazaki's better-known works, it's an engaging story about Man's struggle against Nature, with a poignant message that shines through the plot rather than becoming preachy.  This movie has all the technical excellence of movies such as ""Akira"" and ""Ghost In The Shell,"" but also has the soul that those two movies lack.  While the original Japanese-language version is excellent on its own, the English dub is one of the best treatments I've heard in translated anime.  All of the big-name voice actors do wonderful jobs - even Billy Bob Thornton's rendition of the monk, while completely different from the tone of the original Japanese casting, is well-done and fitting for the character.

There is absolutely nothing special about this movie!,"How this made it to #71 of the top 250 is beyond me. I don't have anything against any kind of animation. I don't dislike Japan. I don't dislike any of the voice overs. I don't think I had ever heard of it until I saw it in the top 250 list the other day. I thought it was going to be mind blowing given all the accolades and rating. In the great words of Ron White: ""I was wrong!"". It was the most pathetically average thing ever. Boooring story. Waay to long. Average animation. It has all the stereotypical characters one would expect to find in a much older American cartoon making fun of Japanese stories... right down to Japanese sambo. Completely predictable. Not something you'd want your kids to see, and something your adult friends would scoff at. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. A 30 minute Family Guy remake would put this to shame. I would have given it a 3; but feel it is my civic duty to make the rating less misleading.",1.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Not Devoid of Hope,"I know you'll probably never trust anything I say ever again, but I didn't care about ""Mononoke- hime"" (1997) when I first saw it some ten years ago. I have been, however, on a stroll through Miyazaki's body of work, and I've finally arrived at the princess's domain again.And all I can say is it's nice to be able to change one's mind. The beginning is fervent, echoing both the Narayama legend and King Lear, the former in the strictures of village laws, the latter in its apocalyptic hopelessness: ""this world is a curse"" and ""life is suffering and pain"" could be something uttered by the great old king, wearing his crown of weeds. Without question, then, this complements wonderfully not only Shakespeare but Kurosawa's ""Ran"" (1985), as well, with which it shares the epic of hopelessness. But Miyazaki's film is not devoid of hope altogether. The violence is cruel, the action aggressive and sudden, the sense of death billows over the green meadows. Yet the love burns, the strong impulse to do what's right overpowers, and through death there is life.The last thirty minutes are among the most exhilarating moments of animation I've seen, the sense of crescendo and climax so overpowering it's as if the whole film is about to crumble in its wake. There are small moments of anticipation, details that contain the whole story (the dripping blood at the gate, the bone at the bottom of the lake, the first drops of rain), and they find their counterpoint in the utterly uncontrollable jolt of the resolution. The pond itself is a magical place, cinematically speaking, and the Deer Good exhibits just the right kind of ambivalence. I'm not a person to throw around monikers, but this is powerful cinema in all respects.The name of the film is of interest. The word ""mononoke"" is a general term that means ""a spirit"" or ""a monster"". Thus it's not the name of the princess, as in the English translation ""Princess Mononoke"", but rather has the meaning that's close to ""spirit-princess"". Neither human nor animal.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Beautiful Animation and Rich Story,"This was a movie that I remember hitting the movie channels when I was a growing up. I would have been ten years old. I vividly remember seeing a character fire an arrow and rip the arms of someone. Up until this point, the only adult oriented cartoon I'd seen was Fire and Ice. It was one that I didn't fully understand so it isn't one I watched often. Jaime and I had this on a list of movies to see due to working through an Internet Movie Database poster of the top 100 films according to rating at that time. Jaime was leery, but we got to see this at the Gateway Film Center, so that added something for both of us.We start this off with a demon heading toward a village. Ashitaka (voiced by Billy Crudup) does what he can to save his people and in turn, he's cursed. He starts a journey to see why this demon was on the rampage. This leads him into the middle of a war between Lady Eboshi (voiced by Minnie Driver) and the spirit of the forest. The former is trying to make Iron Town the strongest and richest. To do this, she needs the forest and mountains around them. Moro (voiced by Gillian Anderson) is a giant wolf who has three children helping her. Two are wolves and other is San (Voiced by Claire Danes). There is also a corrupt monk, Jigo (voiced by Billy Bob Thornton), who is also there to defeat the spirit of the forest for the emperor.What I'll say is that I think that gives a nutshell recap and introduction to important characters. Where I'll start is that I enjoyed my time with this. Jaime did as well. Her biggest gripe was that seeing this on a Friday, after working all week and the theater chairs not being all that comfortable. She still thought the product was good. Then for me, I was just captivated to how great the imaginary and animation were. I'd get lost in it and forget I'm watching a cartoon. That's a credit to the filmmaking.There's also a great message here. Ashitaka is torn between both sides. He's a human so he wants to help Lady Eboshi, but not to kill the forest. There are evil samurai here so he fights against them. I'd say if anything, he's not on the side of the emperor and that includes Jigo. He falls in love with San, who even though she's human, doesn't see herself that way. She was raised by wolves. He fights for the forest. I love the message here about humanity and nature living in harmony. It is a battle to find common ground.I'd also say the different mythology we see is great. There are these cute little forest spirits that are also creepy. I want one to live in my house. We see the forest spirit as an elk with a human face. This entity also becomes a night walker, which was interesting to see. This forest also has talking wolves, boars and gorillas. This is supposed to have taken place in the past. It even feels that the events of this movie are the reason they no longer can. It is an interesting idea to explore.Now I've already said that this is expertly made. The version we watched was dubbed in English. It was jarring hearing Thornton, Driver or Danes say names like Ashitaka or Lady Eboshi, but I got over that soon after. They all fit their characters. The best being Thornton as it almost seems like Jigo is his Bad Santa character, just a corrupt monk. This is a movie that I'd highly recommend, even if you don't like anime. It is so well done and just toes the line of being out of the realm of believability. There's just a great story in my opinion that makes it come together.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

MY NEW FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL-TIME,"I can never give a good review of this movie without a)giving away the entire plot--don't worry, no spoilers in this one--or b)confusing the crap out of the reader.What can I possibly say about this movie that hasn't been said before?

Hayao Miyazaki is a genius...nope, that's been said too.Anyways, the reason this movie is my number one pick is because it so refreshing to get away from the predictable Hollywood plots, characters, and motives (i.e. to make money).  Also, it has an ending that Hollywood would never think to do.  Princess Mononoke is not just a great movie, it is a work of art.  Miyazaki's works are never simple, as with Mononoke.  A lot of thought goes into the making of this movie, and more importantly, a lot of thought goes into watching it.  It challenges you to think that there is no clear-cut good or evil.  Who exactly is the ""bad guy"" in this flick?  No one knows!  But that's the beauty of it all.......*echh*  I'm going in circles again...Simply put, check this movie out, even if you're not an anime fan.  You'll either love it or like it.

"Seen it, and it wasn't disappointingit was rather EXCELLENT.","Hayao Miyazaki's project never failed my excitement. He is totally different in the conventional art of 2d animation filled with so much story and detail. Though simple, it's packed with innovativeness and imagination. No wonder he deserves recognition and glory for his works. Mononoke-hime certainly warrants being included in top 250 of this site. The animated film, tells another enchanting story of forest gods co-existing with humans, and their conflicts with each other rising and remained unsettled. The main character in the name of Ashitaka (Yoji Matsuda), the boy residing in a village, who serves as a scout to watch for his village became the starting point of the story. Later the plot progresses into something complicated but nevertheless understandable in long run. I would admit that I'm being led to the idea that San (Yuriko Ishida) appears to be the antagonist, but revelations poured gradually all throughout the film.What's good about Hayao Miyazaki's project for Mononoke-hime as a successful animated film was he's unfailing creativeness and focus on the detail of the entire atmosphere of his story. The characters; both protagonist and antagonists, supporting characters, extra characters, the tree, the grasses, the sky, rocks, both living and non-living thing are given detail that doesn't only make their presence in the film subtle but significant and typical in their respective character. Unlike other frequent animations that only concentrate within the central characters moving and chatting and whatever they are doing. In this movie however, Miyazaki once again preserve the beauty of his work. What more I loved about this film is that it is not only filled with action, revelations, fantasy and creativeness, but along this primary qualities of a good film Hayao never fails to incorporate values and virtues on his stories. No matter how unbelievably unconvincing the nature of the film, he manage to create a system of the story on how characters reacts, acts and plays throughout.

Later on he used the story as a follow up to Nausicaä (the manga is probably the best ever written), a story about human courage and the pollution of the earth.

I found it worth seeing but a little uneven.Much of the artwork, especially of landscapes and atmosphere and weather, is stunning. Some of the artwork, to my taste, is too crude (e.g., as in the drawings of the wolf mother and sibs to Mononoke).Perhaps those growing up in Japanese culture absorb a supporting fabric that makes the story line more natural and understandable to them than to an American audience. I'm appreciative of the idea that it does not have to be Man vs. Nature (as some industrialists view it) -- that there can be a co-existence or maybe even a symbiosis? The storyline presented realistic conflict among the forces on both sides (nature & animal vs. man) but while the motives of the conflicts on the nature/animal side were understandable, those on the human side were far less so.*** WARNING -- SOME WILL FIND THE FOLLOWING SPOILS THE OUTCOME ***Generally, I often find story lines with supernatural forces are interesting, especially when they deal with moral issues as this does. I can accept that folklore has gods with different levels of power. But it did bother me that the supergod of all Nature, capable walking on water and special powers of healing, of transforming shape from day to night, of spreading out an ooze over the whole land that would injure humans, of living and functioning without a head -- that a god with such powers has a head that can be chopped off by humans and can not find it if humans keep it in a box.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

It's one of the best movies that I've ever seen (if not the best).,"When I first saw this movie, I was stunned by the beauty and depth of the animation and storyline.  Which really says something because during the movie, my eyes were frantically darting between the video screen and the printed translation in my hands... my Japanese is not quite up to standard yet.  Still, I was amazed by what I saw/heard/read.  The story kept me spellbound.I was first introduced to Hayao Miyazaki's works through the early english version of ""Kaze no Tani no Nausicaa"" or ""Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind"", a truly remarkable movie in it's own right.

Princess Mononoke - Review,"I'm not really into anime so my review won't be that passionate, but clearly this movie's awesome. The visuals and ideas which were born inside of Mijazaki's head are insanely interesting and nuanced and I loved it very much because we just don't see these kinds of movies these days. I like this movie a lot, it's just I couldn't connect emotionally to the characters, that's why my rating just isn't that high. For sure it's an extremely solid movie with likable characters and beautiful visuals, but I wanted a bit more of the story, I don't know particularly what, but these movies lack something I don't know how to describe. Maybe I just have to adjust to this way of storytelling and just enjoy it more, but you know it isn't that easy and I don't want to overrate something just because it's a classic. So that's that, I finally watched it and I decided to watch some more arty films so yeah.

Interesting,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I sat down to watch this film.  I love the style of anime art, but sometimes the stories are quite strange.  So in this movie you bring in Disney to help out.  I had read the reviews online saying that this is the greatest anime ever, its not.  It's ok, very watchable.  I expected a more western plot line considering Disney was involved.  It was not.  That is not necessarily a bad thing.  But the story was strange.  No more stranger than any other anime but still strange.  The art was pretty, but the four part Macross Plus series is still the best animated Japanese toon I have seen to date.  I liked Mononoke, but didn't think it was a wonderful movie.  The story was a bit lacking, and and the art work was not what everyone is making it out to be.  I have seen better.  I did find it funny though that Disney doesn't want to associate themselves with this cartoon here in America.  Apparently they are afraid it will hurt their image.

What a movie!,"I came into the theater with _soaringly_ high expectations for the film, and still found it to be a great work of cinema in the end.  The animation was absolutely brilliant and gorgeous to look at, and the visuals of the various gods and forces of nature were incredible.  The story is also far more complicated than anything American animation has imagined, illustrating the true nature of conflict and its resolution better than any of them.  It also features a truly great character in Eboshi, whose motives aren't as black and white as western animation might have made it.But most notable was the running time.  No, not how long it was, but how short it felt to me.  I really don't understand when others complain of it being too long.  To me, not only did it seem that every scene was significant, but it actually felt like it was 25 minutes _shorter_ than it actually was, because I felt so compelled by just about every frame of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Pure fantasy at is finest,"Returning to Miyazaki´s more adult try at an animated movie, Princes Mononoke still holds up in all the right ways. A strong political movie with a lot of moving parts that creates a great fantasy movie from start to near finish. While there is a few elements I personally don´t like about this movie they are small compared to the rest of what the movie delivers.After being cursed by a forest spirit, Ashitaka seeks a cure for his curse in the land to the west and find himself in a conflict between nature and industrial work.The animation is as always stunning. Some absolutely picturesque frames that might as well be in a museum. Full of colour and denseness. The colour green is utilized amazingly here and there are so many greatly designed elements, and characters. Everyone looks and feels distinct and it´s easy to tell everybody apart and learn from their looks what they are all about. The lack of colour can also be devastation, especially with the story in mind.This is a strongly political story where Miyazaki definitely has an agenda and a clear stans. The story about humans vs nature, the fact that the world is using but also mistreating nature. How humanity likes to think of themselves as the master of nature, but here we are not prepared for what nature can do back. It´s not black and white and that´s why I love the story. Ashitaka is the link between humans and nature, believing that they can coexist and they have too.A few elements I did not like is the rushed idea of romance and also the ending. This movie ends so abrupt it hurts and the people just kind of change their mind out of nowhere. A more graceful ending would have made this movie perfect in my eyes.Because the ""villains"" aren´t really villains at all. They are just people who are following orders, people who are finally being recognized and fight for their right, a lot of animals that don´t know how to communicate or harmonize well. The conflict are built on grey area people which all have their right and that makes the conflict so well done.The voice acting is really great. I watched it in the original Japanese. Everyone is giving a great performance that highlight their characters emotions and how they are perfectly. The spirits are also voiced interestingly in a way that is very fantastical.The score is incredibly beautiful but is used a bit too sparingly in my opinion. There is a lot of silent scenes here that could have benefited for just a little bit of score, but what we got is absolutely beautiful.I think this movie want´s to tell a lot of stories and do a lot but simply have to dense of a runtime to do it. Romance, nature, human, industrialization, spirits, war. There is a lot of moving parts here and while it works nearly to perfection, cutting a few ideas might have made the movie just clean.Princess Mononoke is such an incredible piece by Miyazaki. A just strong movie from start to near finish where so many elements just work and are incredibly well done. This is a beautiful and harrowing movie with a lot of war vs nature parts, from lush forests and spirits to dismemberment and a lot of disturbing imagery and concepts. This is a masterpiece no doubt.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

There's other films like Raiders of the Lost Ark that had horrifying scenes (the face melting scene) which still got it a PG, but the BBFC hadn't made the 12 certificate back in the 1980s, but in 1997 when Mononoke came out, they already had the 12 rating, but still gave it a PG.

"Behold, the Princess Mononoke.","If this can't be called the peak of anime art, I would like to say, ""Well, that's ridiculous."" By all means, Mayao Miyazaki gave the world a movie that's worth 100 viewings. And the achievement in the movie history already proved that.Check the IMDb plot keyword ""Epic"", and you will know Princess Mononoke is not the best animation movie, but also one of the best saga created in modern technology. The story involves a warrior, Ashi-taka, who had to leave his remote village for the the middle Japan, after he killed the enraged Mountain Pig and was cursed by it. Experiencing all the pains from the curse, he can't help being involved into the triangle conflict between the forest, the cannon-manufacturing city and the samurai......The movie had its own mythology, in which the forest was protected by the ancient beasts who are now called ""gods"" by other beings. The conflict between human being and the nature was a total war in every aspect. In the development, humans tried to destroy the habitant of the animals so they could derive all the necessary resources. The animals lead by their gods also tried their best to guard the frontier of the forest, killing as much human as they could. Does this sound familiar to you? I guess so because that's the very situation happening a thousand years ago and still happening now. The only difference is the nature only strikes at human in a larger scale in reality. So the movie is somehow unrealistic? No. Wait until the end to conclude. The whole script was so well thought out that every element, every single shot was legendary. You will remember the intense struggle to come to terms between Human and nature in both a symbolic way and a literature way. You will remember the holocaust created by human deeds. And, you will remember the visual style.Differentiated from all the other Miyazaki productions, Mononoke has an cutting-edge look that contains many bloody and gory scenes, decorated with the latest technology at its time. Though the technology it used didn't redefine the whole industry, it overwhelmed the whole movie industry, claiming the coming of an age that animation movies can carry great value like a real-set movie, and deserve more credits. Not after 6 years,an Academy Award for the best animated feature was delivered to Hayao Miyazaki, for his most famous production ""Spirited Away"". I believe without Miyazaki's effort, without the case of Princess Mononoke, we would never have such an award.10/10. I still gave more credits to it than Wall-E.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Superb Storytelling Meets Breathtaking Animation,"Princess Mononoke is the brilliant epic of a young prince, Ashitaka (Billy Crudup), who stands between the humans who destroy the forest for its wealth and the animal gods who would destroy the humans to save it. The animation in this film is superb; while most animated films of its time (and many today) lack detail, luster or realism, the master storyteller Hiyao Miyazaki ensured that every frame is beautifully crafted. From the wide-shot landscapes to the droplets of rain upon the grass, Miyazaki's attention to detail is evident.The score, prepared by Joe Hisaishi, is reminiscent of Howard Shore's Lord of the Ring's trilogy as it both captures and enhances the emotion of the film. Perhaps, what makes this film so fascinating is that Miyazaki has created a world that is at once, fantastical and yet grounded in reality.You may recognize some familiar voices as Minnie Driver (Return to Me and Phantom of the Opera) voices Lady Eboshi, the industrious leader of Iron Town. Billy Bob Thornton also lends his talent as Jigo, a greedy monk sent by the emperor to behead the great forest spirit. While the film was originally released in Japan, Disney has taken the initiative to make this and other classics available to a wider audience.The beauty of the story is that it can be enjoyed by all different kinds of people, due to its many layers, subplots and themes. While a casual viewer may simply see it as an entertaining adventure film, which it certainly is, a closer look reveals an insightful allegory about the good and evil within all of us and a call for introspection. In my opinion, what makes a story believable and captivating is when it portrays evil as it is generally found, as part of a good person who believes they are either doing the right thing - or at least not doing anything wrong. Lady Eboshi exemplifies this duality of the good and evil within all of us and demonstrates Miyazaki's unwillingness to settle for what some have called, ""simple evil.""Princess Mononoke is not a story of wicked people destroying the innocent and peaceful forest creatures so much as that of both sides striving to defeat the evil within themselves. In Ashitaka, we find the conscience of both the forest gods and humanity. I highly recommend this film for the aforementioned reasons, though due to certain violent elements and mild language, it may be best to adhere to the PG-13 rating when considering watching it with children.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

A great masterpiece for The Master,"This film is a project that comes from far away. Designed by Miyazaki already at the end of the Seventies, he prefer to it the also wonderful The Castle in the Sky. It returns in his hands at the beginning of the Nineties and he decides to make it, also facing a period of writer's block caused by too many similarities to films released in the twenty years in the middle, finally he decides to give the story an almost mythological cut, while inserted in a historical setting. Miyazaki starts the production, for the most part of it in traditional 2D animation with computer use in only two occasions: for five minutes of scenes particularly complex and 10% in the making of the color, the rest is all strictly made by hand. The Master has approved personally each of the 144,000 frames in the film, as well as he made the storyboard and the character design. Therefore from this great job it follows an impressive fantastic tale, one of the most ambitious works of the director, of strong moral rigor, that touches all of his big issues, all dear and always present in his filmography, lowered into the fascinating backdrop of medieval Japan (The Muromachi Period, ranging from 1336 to 1573 approximately). The film features the usual magical and indescribable aura that hovers over every work of The Master of Japan animation, capable like no one else to excite with a genre unfairly undervalued and often mistreated. Focuses on the struggle between humans and spirits of the forest, is the symbolic fantastic expression through which to pass a wanted ecologist message, so fundamental in every works of Miyazaki, in a fairy tale instructive, not boring or verbose despite the length, strongly influenced by Shintoism. The message, however, is not its only strength, as always also the backgrounds are of an unparalleled beauty, the characters have complex and multifaceted personality, there is no clear distinction between good and evil, the one is reflected in the other and vice versa, no one is innocent, nor among humans or among animals. All are fighting for a cause, right or wrong. Everyone has weaknesses. Are vital characters, some of the most beautiful characters in the filmography of Miyazaki.

Beautiful but boring and emotionless,"This movie is a beautiful animation considering the release year. A true gem in terms of visual quality. That's more reason for me to be disappointed by the quality of the story and characters.Each character was predictable from the first minute on the screen. The main protagonist and antagonist are boring robots whose motives are a mix of silly and cryptic. The main antagonist spends the 98% of the movie being a mindless killer drone built to appease to some tough girl fantasy I found no innovation in. The last 2% is spent making a complete U-turn in their ideology.The main protagonist is a perfect, enough so to appear mundane, hero who either knows or portrays neither negative nor positive emotions. I never felt like they were in danger nor their mission in any way contention, nor did I end up caring about their mission in the first place.The supporting protagonists were a mixed bunch. The movie namesake character seems written in one afternoon with a bit of one-dimensional savagery coupled with forgettable tantrums. Some of the animal spirits appeared original and interesting to me. I felt delighted when the spirits spoke, and less so when the humans did.Each supporting male character is either a bumbling idiot or another mindless killer. Few are also a bit of both but if we leave that out, it's the two categories that hold dozens of characters each that might as well be just the two. Once you've seen one of each, you've seen them all.Each supporting female character is an insufferable caricature of toxic femininity. Again, only one character was written despite numerous being present.The story is a classic tale of man versus nature that you've seen a dozen times, but with a bit of fantasy and mystery sprinkled in. It felt preachy and annoying the first time I saw it, and this time was no different. Some reviewers would tell you in cryptic words that there's a deeper meaning behind the movie, but to me it seems rather plain. It raises no questions, and almost no emotions. I would have preferred to watch a movie about the animal spirits and their daily lives instead.",4.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Wonderful!,"Wow, Mononoke-hime is really one of the best movies I have ever seen, chronicling the fierce protection the forest spirits and two humans have of a beautiful old forest from iron workers in 9th-century Japan.The great wolf-god Moro and her human daughter, San, have discovered the plans of Lady Eboshi and her Iron Town to cut down the trees and destroy their mountain habitat for the iron buried underneath. Not standing for it, they enlist the hekp of all the forest spirits to protect Shishi gami, the very heart of the mountain. Aided also by a wayward prince named Ashitaka, they try to topple Eboshi's plan.At first glance, this would be any other good/evil combat, but Miyazaki has really fleshed out the characters, and really there are no protagonists or antagonists, only people/animals trying their best to survive. The animals will die if the forest is destroyed (duh), but the inhabitants of Iron Town cannot survive without it's only means of acquiring survival goods.I very highly suggest you to rent this movie in either subbed or dubbed format.

Some flaw.  Some story element that just didn't click.  But it never happened.  The animation is incredibly fluid and conveys with an incredible amount of detail the personalities of the main characters.  The musical score is gorgeous, ranking up there with some of John Williams and James Horner's best works.  Neil Gaiman's translation is intelligent and natural sounding, and the voice acting is excellent.  It's not as quite as bloody as some people would have you believe, but it does have its fair share of violence.Actually, the only thing I found strange was Billy Bob Thornton's voice and the look of Jigo.  The voice just didn't match the face.  But that's not to say Thornton gave a bad performance.If this film is overlooked as just an ""animated film"", then  it's a true loss on the critics' parts.  It deserves a chance at ""Best Foreign Film"" or even ""Best Picture"".  This is a beautiful fantasy epic, and it's understandable why this was Japan's big money-maker.  I'm really pleased that Miramax/Disney brought this movie to America with the care that they did.  I hope to see more, and I can't wait until the DVD comes out. Recommended to fans of fantasy, animation, or people who just enjoy a quality movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Disney eat your heart out!,"Mononoke Hime is definitely the best fairytale cartoon I have ever seen. Not only is the animation outstanding, the story is beautiful too.  At last the viewer is treated with an intelligent cartoon, as so many are made and so few distributed, especially in Europe (shame on the film industry!).Miyazaki's style is wonderful.  I have enjoyed this film thoroughly three times.  It deals with the opposing forces of man vs. nature.  This fact gives the film an extra dimension.  Things aren't black and white as they are in mainstream American cartoons.Some scenes are pretty adult in the portrayal of violence (then again if your a Japanese kid, no harm done right?) and the philosophical layer the story contains.  At the same time it's plain fairy tale and warrior saga. Beautiful landscapes, amazing characters (don't you just love the little white silly forest spirits?) and exciting moments.I can strongly recommend this film to many people.  Some are hesitant about watching cartoons, they expect Disney style animation and storyline.  This film is on a much higher level though.  It deals with an element of human nature which has taken the worst of us.  The essence of Mononoke Hime is the inevitability of human development, exploiting nature and taking the earth's destiny in our own hands.  Hereby we have killed the forests spirit, as indigenous people's everywhere are very aware of.  They are dying with it.Take these dimensions of the film as you will.  If you just want to enjoy a great piece of animation, without bothering to see the deeper meaning, be my guest and see this film too!",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Scares with its beauty,"The first time I watched this masterpiece as a child, and then it made a huge impression on me. There are films that do not lose their relevance over time and this is the picture that will always be interesting. More than a quarter of a century has passed since the release of this tape and it is not felt at all when viewed. And the questions that are raised really make you think, they remain in your head and do not leave you. So far, when I'm asked about the best anime I've seen, I answer that it's Princess Mononoke.The human cruelty, pain and suffering shown in this picture first stupefy you, but then you begin to realize that everything is. Environmental problems are an important part of the tape, how people destroy forests to meet their needs without thinking about the harm that we deliver to nature, but here nature is in its own way, but it fights back, which cannot happen in real life. We see suffering that a small number of people can bring, but what enormous consequences can there be. Also, the topic of xenophobia is a very important part of the picture, people are not ready to understand and are afraid of what they do not understand while expressing huge aggression.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Miyazaki's Most Poignant Work,"While Miyazaki's other films may have more beauty and aesthetics, Princess Mononoke contains something special: Purpose. And a glorious purpose at that. Though slightly violent, Princess Mononoke teaches a valuable lesson to all children who watch it, and should be placed on a pedestal with other films like Requiem for a Dream. While some may scoff that films can't teach life lessons, Princess Mononoke stands out with its healthy, wholesome, and beautifully crafted message to our next generation. However, while the message deserves to be heard by all, and should be required viewing at schools, the film still has some imperfections. Though I am not usually a stickler, the love aspect and lack of solid good/evil is both a strength and a weakness. Too many decisions are left unexplained, and too many characters experience too many changes too fast. Regardless of its faults, Princess Mononoke is a beautifully constructed film, and should be required to be shown to all children.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
An Animated Masterpiece,"Whether you're into Studio Ghibli films or anime, there's something in Hayao Miyazaki's movies that'll melt even the coldest of hearts. And Princess Mononoke was no different. It is so full imagination, heart and fantasy that it's hard not to be swept away.The story is both imaginative and creative and has a pretty strong message about environmentalism which is seamlessly woven into the narrative. The world building is stunning, overflowing with fantasy and wonder. And the characters are endearing and full of depth. Though the story can get a little complicated at times but that's a minor issue.The animation is absolutely beautiful. Everything is so meticulously designed and detailed with a painterly feel which makes the movie look like a freaking storybook come to life. The action-sequences are great as well.Overall, Princess Mononoke is a landmark film for Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki that has something for everyone. With stunning visuals, enchanting characters, and the strong message about environmentalism, Princess Mononoke stands as a timeless classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"Creative, action-packed and with breathtaking animation!","I just watched this for the first time recently, and I loved it! i had only seen one other Studio Ghibli film (Spirited Away), so I'm relatively new to their films. But because I loved this film so much, and Spirited Away is one of my all time favorites, I can't wait to watch some of their other work (already watched ""My Neighbor Totoro"", and i loved it).It has a great and original story, which i wont spoil anything from. I went in knowing nothing about it, and I think it's the best way to watch it. It also has some great characters, and a great settingThe movies is filled with tons of creative creatures, and the world they live in is equally as creative. All of this is boosted by the incredible animation. Studio Ghibli is known for their incredible animation, and this is no exception. If you're expecting some cheap, lazy animation, you will be pleasantly surprised. It was surprisingly violent, and the action was directed very well. Funny how an animated film has way better action than most action films today.In conclusion, Princess Mononoke is one of the best animated I've seen in years. It's fast paced and action-packed when it needs to, and it's slow paced and emotional when it needs to. It blends action, emotion and comedy very well, and you should definitely watch it.Highly recommended for fans of Animated films, or just well made films in general.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
You better respect the spirit of the forest!,"Princess Mononoke is another work by Studio Ghibli's mastermind Hayao Miyazaki. Released in 1997, the film tells the story of a young prince who after facing a demon and being cursed by it, has to leave his tribe on a quest to stop the curse from killing him. The film explores themes such as sexuality and spirituality, but primarily the symbiotic and often chaotic relationship between humankind and nature.Mostly allegoric but visually impressive and action-packed, Princess Mononoke does not disappoint. The animation, score, and voice acting are outstanding - as to be expected - while the characters feel well-rounded and relatable. Another animation masterpiece worth watching and rewatching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Classic of animation,"I cannot possibly say enough good things about this film.  I'm really dissapointed Miramax isn't giving this film a wider release.  More people need to see this.  Even only having seen it on video (and a less than perfect copy at that), I find it to be a much more satisfying adventure than the last Star Wars film or the last Disney animated film.  I can see why this film is the top-grossing film to date in Japan.  I don't put this film in the same category as your usual ""Japanimation"", because I really don't see myself as a big ""Japanimation"" person, I just look at it as a very good animated film that just happens to come from Japan, much the same way I look at Miyazaki's other films, Akira, and the films of Mamoru Oshii.The film is written and directed by master animator Hayao Miyazaki, from whom I have yet to see a less-than amazing film.  The artwork and animation in this film are beautiful, and the film has a much more ""cinematic"" feeling than a lot of animation, Miyazaki could direct a great live-action film if he wanted to (some anime directors have also directed live-action films, like Oshii and Otomo).  One thing I like that that the CGI was used sparingly and effectively, not obtrusively like in a lot of animation these days.  The film also makes me think a lot of The Thin Red Line in it's depiction of nature balanced with violent conflict.The musical score by Joe Hisaishi is simply beautiful, I personally think it's one of the great film scores of all time, right up there with Ryuichi Sakamoto's score for The Last Emperor (which Hisaishi's score for this film reminds me of a little in parts).In short, an incredible film, if possible, see it in a theater, or, failing, that, video.  Just see it!  I'm purchasing the DVD the day it's released.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

I bet you everyone that are used to the American formular type of movie will watch this movie with their jaws dropped. The good thing about this movie is everyone came out of the theatre with a question mark. Well, isn't that somewhat similiar to the real world. There is no real hero in the film and no well defined good and bad guys. It's a complicated movie for a complicated world. The translaters must be given credit. They must have worked their head off trying to simplify the content. Want to understand this movie? Try not to see it in a western point of view.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Alas, a movie of higher quality than can sell to Americans.","The film that I most anticipated this year was Star Wars- Episode I. As some of you may have noticed, that movie was intensely disappointing. Perhaps Lucas got greedy, but I was turned off of movies for a time, until I learned that the best movies are frequently not made by big Hollywood studios. Do animated films from Disney seem simplistic? There's the strong, individual protagonist; the totally vilified enemy; the small, cute, funny sidekick; and the formulaic plot; not to mention the irritating versions of the songs that you will never avoid for the rest of the year. Or, do the romantic comedies leave you embarrassed for the characters and annoyed at the writers? Do action films leave you disgusted at the glorified violence? Predictability is a staple of big studio American films, and personally, I am no longer surprised that my two favorite movies this year came from overseas, Lola Rennt from Germany, and Mononoke Hime from Japan. We begin with a spectacular blend of detail and simplicity in the animation style, and we are drawn into the film with a village attacked by a demon, defeated at a cost for our hero, who is sent to find the evil's source-- and then good and evil fade in to shades of grey that are rarely seen in American films. Characters have too many dimensions for our country's movie viewers, and we are disturbed by the frustratingly unpredictable sequence of events. And yet one scene seems to follow naturally from the last. Virtually every aspect of the movie was astonishing, and almost all of those were pleasantly so. If only Hollywood would give us some credit.Of course, this movie is not for everyone. This movie wasn't sent to America for years because the Japanese creators of the film knew that true American movie themes were not honored very respectfully. Only after it became the second highest grossing film in Japan was an American release considered. If you find talking animals in an animated film disturbing, then you may find this one to be too much for you (along with most Disney films, which have little in common with Princess Mononoke in other respsects, which I'll get to next). If you want to know the end of a movie before it happens, or if you want to focus on the romance between the male and female leads, or if you want the bad guys to die and good to triumph in a blood bath, or if you love the countless other elements that thrive in American films; well, don't see Princess Mononoke. It's not for you. Otherwise, I'll see you at a film festival sometime.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Once in a lifetime, I am grateful that someone like Mr. Miyazaki fully awakened my inner child and totally had me absorbed throughout the movie with a world so rich in mythical wonder.  How many animated movies out there can make a fully grown adult fight back tears without any sentimentality?  The characters are all so down-to-earth and realistically portrayed, throw in a plot that is full of heart, and thank goodness for the top-notch dubbing done by top Hollywood actors. I can just go on ranting and raving about this movie until the cows come home.  In my opinion, it's SO good that no other animated films can ever hope to compare with Princess Mononoke.  Bottom word, it is a flawless masterpiece; a pure work of genius that deserves to be seen by many generations to come, both adults and children alike.

Sure, it doesn't delve into complex real-world social and political issues or use extremely subtle techniques to tell a story, as that would be stupid and ignore the main demographic. However, it is a nuanced narrative that doesn't pit strictly good against strictly evil, and shows no clear favoritism in a traditional ""humans vs. nature"" way. It is an exceptionally well done story that can be enjoyed by anyone, not just children. It isn't ""great for a kids' movie"", it's just great, period.The environment and fantasy world are absolutely jaw-dropping.

A Masterpiece of Animation,"Hayao Miyazaki, Japan's equivalent of Walt Disney, has given us some of the best animated films in history; including Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle. Princess Mononoke, in my opinion, is his finest creation. Princess Mononoke centers around the young and noble hearted Ashitaka, whom after being cursed by a demon, must journey to the sacred forest to be exorcised before the curse ultimately destroys him. On his journey, he encounters several forest spirits, a group of iron workers, and a mysterious girl raised by the forest's wolves. The story focuses on the constant clash of man and nature, and how both must make sacrifices in order to coexist. There are no heroes, and no villains. All shareholders have motivations that can be sympathized with, and some that cannot. The story is deep, compelling and flows very well. I will admit at times it can become moderately confusing, especially when elements of mysticism are introduced. However it's presented so well, I feel that the confusion is my fault, not the film's;. It's as if my insufficient mind isn't capable of grasping the magnitude of the plot. The characters: human, animal and otherwise are all well developed, multi-layered and interesting. The animation is the Miyazaki standard: very bright, very vibrant and always carrying energy and emotion. The action scenes are some of the best in all of animation and the entire film carries with it a sense of awe and wonder. The film even manages to take several actions that we would otherwise consider disgusting, and make them appear beautiful. The music corresponds to the scenes perfectly and moves the story almost as much the animation and dialogue. I recommend you watch the film in Japanese as the English dub is very good in places, but downright annoying in others. Once I realized that Toki was voiced by Jada Smith, I switched over to the subtitles. But watching the film in English won't take much from the experience. I could praise the film for hours and it's truly one of the greatest films I've ever seen. It's gripping, creative, intelligent and correctly delivers one of the most difficult to execute themes in all of film. Absolutely watch Princess Mononoke.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
You're beautiful.,"The animation is breathtaking, and the way it portrays the conflict between nature and humans is really thought-provoking. It's one of those movies that stays with you because of how it makes you think about the balance between the environment and industrial progress.The characters are amazing too-Ashitaka is such a solid lead, and San's fierce loyalty to the forest makes her really compelling. But I did feel like there were moments where the story left a few things hanging or unexplained. For example, certain characters' motivations weren't always clear, and some events felt rushed without a lot of explanation behind them. It's like the movie tries to cover so many themes and ideas that it sometimes skips over details that would make certain moments more impactful.That said, it's still a gorgeous film with a lot of depth. The visuals, especially the spirits of the forest, and the emotional weight of the story really stand out.

Perhaps Miyazaki's most powerful and epic offering to date,"Hiyao Miyazaki has gained his fame as a uniquely talented animator in Japan; one who has been deemed good enough to be imported to Western cinema. Miyazaki has also been known as a strict conservationalist/environmentalist, and this film combines his two passions seamlessly. I am aware that pretty much all of Miyazaki's films have environmentalist messages/undertones, but this one has a particularly strong and powerful meaning.As always, Miyazaki's films are catered to more mature audiences, and this one has one of the most intelligent and complex story lines one is apt to see in an animated feature. That's not to say that children will not be fascinated by the unique and flowing visuals, but it should also be noted that this is one of Miyazaki's most violent films, and contains various depictions of decapitations, dismemberments, and blood. As such, very young children may be detracted from the film, but audiences from their teens to their twilight years would find this a uniquely fascinating and rewarding movie-going experience.Thankfully, I was able to procure a subtitled version and not the dubbed one (although I am aware that the English voice acting was not as cheesy as most dubbed tiles) The main characters are quite likable and audiences will enjoy going along with them on their emotional and physical rides. Moreover, Miyazaki does not take sides, and presents the story in an intelligent and unbiased fashion, intimating that everyone acts in what they believe is their best interest.This was my third Miyazaki film and I enjoyed this even more than HAURU NO UGOKU SHIRO, but not as much as SEN TO CHIHIRO NO KAMIKAKUSHI.

Humanity and Nature !!!!,"Hayao Miyazaki is a legendary name in the genre of anime film- making. What sets his films apart from the rest is the fact that although his films may be animated which is generally considered to be a cinematic medium directed towards kids, but he makes his films profound enough for adults to enjoy too. The kids will find the vibrancy of the visuals enjoyable while the adults will get enough thematic and allegorical depth. Princess Mononoke is no different.Miyazaki deals with the age-old relationship between human beings and nature. The movie I believe is set in Japanese Civil War era. Miyazaki beautifully uses the fantasy-like storyline to promote the messages of tolerance, coexistence and unity and the denouncement of hatred. Man and nature have the right to exist together without any harm coming to either. The script does get a bit too preachy at times, but the visual subtlety and beauty of the film overwhelms the minor issues with the script. The film could have been a little shorter. The film ends beautifully with optimism and with a hope for a new beginning.I had minor reservations with the script, but nevertheless the mastery of Miyazaki's film-making is visible throughout the film and Princess Mononoke is must watch for everyone irrespective of your feelings towards the genre of anime.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of the most beautiful films in cinema that can stick with you for the rest of your life.,"For those who have never heard of this, or any of Hayao Miyazaki's works, please do yourself a favor and offer the courtesy of checking out his works.Forget everything you know about animation, if all you've experienced is the mind-numbing, lowest-common-denominator American money-maker cartoons. If you think all animated films are for kids (Disney films), or for very low-minded adults and teens (Adult Swim cartoons), prepare to be proved wrong. Hayao Miyazaki is a legend in animation that revolutionized the craft in his storytelling and imagery.Princess Mononoke is a film of a journey, of war and peace, of character perseverance, and of balance. Set in a mythological Japan, it tells the tale of a warrior on a journey to fulfill a destiny of which he doesn't know yet. He has to endure demons, villagers, warriors, and forest spirits, both good and bad. And Ashitaka, the hero, is a peaceful mind unlike any other seen in films. He never waivers between what's good or bad, and only has the intention of peace and prosperity between all living things.Before you go thinking this is a preachy medieval warfare yada-yada film you've seen a thousand times before, please trust me in that this film still deserves a viewing to even those with no immediate interest.First, a warning. Ignore everything negative you've heard about this movie. I'm not saying this as a ""fanboy"" who gets irate when people give negative reviews on stuff I love, but because this film simply deserves a chance. It took me 3 times of seeing this before it overtook me and I fell in love with it.So what makes this film so amazing, anyway? First of all, the obvious: the writer/director and animator: Hayao Miyazaki. Known for revolutionizing the animation world with his non-conventional children's films (Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbor Totoro, Spirited Away), this is his most mature film, and I don't just mean in terms of content. Yes, this film is PG- 13, violent, and probably not meant for the younger kids, but it's beside the point. The story is dark and deeply personal. Miyazaki had stated that after all his more family-friendly films were out, this was the film he felt ""he just had to make"". And there is an air of deep seriousness that comes with this film that's hard to miss.Please remember this, most of all: Miyazaki's films ARE NOT ANIME. Let me repeat: MIYAZAKI DOES NOT MAKE ANIME FILMS. The number one prejudice people will have going into his works will be their view on the strange, typical ""Anime"" world and their views on it. I am NOT an Anime fan, I'm generally neutral towards it. A few shows are entertaining, and one or two films, but I would never consider myself a fan. Miyazaki is completely different in style, animation, texture and story. The one thing that angers more than anything are the people who bash this film because they don't like Anime. I beg of everyone who hasn't seen this film to take that into consideration.Miyazaki's paints a world like no one has ever seen, and always beautiful and fascinating. But what really brings his films to life is the music. Half of what makes his films so beautiful is the score of Joe Hisaishi, perhaps the most gifted musician in movies of all time. His music is intriguing, mysterious and impossible to look past. With films like this, I get to thinking his music was made for Miyazaki, and Miyazaki's films were made for Hisaishi. They balance each other perfectly and work marvelously.Now, many people may not think much of this film the first time they see it, and I was no exception. I was a huge Miyazaki fan already when I saw it for the first time, and I was expecting to love this the same. But the first time I saw it, my feelings were neutral. So a few months went by, and I decided to give this another try. The same thing. It didn't strike me. So another few months go by, and another whim comes over me to give it one last shot. And it finally worked. I was swept away in the story for the first time, and it overtook me.So if you see the film once and are not immediately in love with it, you may just need to try it again in due time. But please, don't think that I'm trying to make you feel that something's wrong with you if you don't like it. I know some people just won't like it, and some people even strongly dislike it. This review is my opinion and love of the film, and I'm just trying to do my part to help other people have their lives enriched like mine has been.All in all, Princess Mononoke is one of the most amazing films ever made. Easily, it's probably the most well-made animated film, but the animation world aside, this film conquers a HIGH percentage of all films and sets a mark on all cinema. The sad thing is it will most likely be ignored because, A, it's Japanese, B, it's highly unknown, and C, it's marked as ""Anime"" and will probably never go past that categorization.But at least take some of these many dragged on comments I have made into consideration if you haven't seen it. Most of you may be let down by it after reading how much I have praised it, but if there's at least a few who are affected by it as I have been, than I will live that much more in content. May Miyazaki's legacy live on through the rest of time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The world would be a better place if more people saw this film.,"This movie is everything a movie should be.Lo and behold, finally, a film breaks through into North American theatres that does not meet all of the old Hollywood ""standards"".  That is to say, it does not meet the usual standards of predictability, ""Go U.S.A"" egotism, dismissal of innocence as frivolity, materialistic endorsement, exploitation, and fully resolved happy-go-lucky ""perfect"" endings.  It does not have hollow and sappy romance.  It does not have the ""good guy vs. bad guy"" mentality.  It's about time the mould was broken.This film is realistic.  And it is for this reason that it can touch us. It is painful, but in the very best way.  It reaches us, makes us think.  It gets inside of us to make us question our most basic concepts of society.And it promotes values.  Not religious values, not political values, but the true, essential values that are neglected in present day media and society: values such as honour, respect, peace, and courage, to name a few.Take yourself and your children to see this film, and you will be doing yourselves and the world a favour.

Beautiful and relatable with a wonderful message.,"Princess Mononoke is one of Hayao Miyazaki's finest films. It takes the viewer to a beautiful fantasy world of nature, spirits, and explores humanity's place in it all. Blurring the lines between good and evil the story of Princess Mononoke is not clear cut black and white. By the end of the film some may feel it should have ended a different way than it did. That the resolution wasn't the right one. With masterful story writing Hayao Miyazaki created a story that's much like the real world.The characters are each one unique and easily identifiable in their personality and unique appearance. Even minor background characters are still given likable roles and are all unique. Studio Ghibli has yet again with this film, continued to uphold their stellar animation style. Displaying beauty and the hard work the developers put into the film with each and every frame.And to accompany the movie is a sweeping and very moving score by Joe Hisaishi, who writes the music for almost all of Studio Ghibli's films. Listening to the score alone can paint a picture of the movie all it's own, but put the two together and it's like combining strawberries with chocolate, you end up with something unique, beautiful to look at, and delicious to taste (in this case, hear).",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Indescribable beauty!,"This truly is a masterpiece as it includes so many indescribable feelings.

Superb,"I have never been a fan of anime.  I have friends who are really into it, but I just could never see the attraction.  So when this film played on my campus this weekend, I went only because it was something to do on a slow day.  I was blown away (and went back to see it again the next day).  The animation is incredible.  The voice acting is well done.  The story is beautiful, brutal, and brilliant.  It was a joy, after all these years of American cartoons to see talking animals portrayed in such a natural, non-comic relief way.  The characters were all very human and ambiguous, very shades of grey.  You could feel for all of them (even the nature-killing Lady Eboshi) at times during the movie.  I have never seen a better piece of animation, and have very rarely seen a better film.  My eternal thanks to Miyazaki for creating this, and to studio Ghobi, for making sure that it wasn't torn apart by Disney to fit ""traditional American"" tastes.  See this as soon as possible (video release June 13th), you will not regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

It's outstanding both in animation and story and has soul and meaning in it, with great soundtrack. I'm a little sad when think of it, because it brings childhood memories.

Japanese anime is well on its way to becoming a hot item in the USA.,"A heroic prince, in trying to save his people from a crazed, cursed god, is himself cursed with a growing disease that will eventually kill him.

Through her eyes and the wolves', the prince sees why the boar god was cursed in the first place and how mankind's disregard for the preservation of nature was the cause. Only when mankind learns to live harmoniously with nature will what caused the boar go to go insane be healed.I saw this movie in the Japanese language while reading an English summary of it. The visuals are awesome. The music, of which I have a CD, is beautiful even when listened to apart from the movie. I would put it on a scale with the award winning score from ""Titanic.""

Words don't describe it. 8*,"After seeing so many 'Anime' movies, even though I like them my one major complaint is the stupidity used in the dubbing. One of the best in this genre, Akira, has tons of 'huh's. Come on, It gets really annoying after a while. I sometimes wonder if it's actually translated, for all we know it could be something else. And that is where Mononoke surpasses other 'animes.' The dubbing is qued, it's meaningful. I really couldn't care less who did the voices, but the dubbing was done well, making it seem like I wasn't watching an Americanized version of a Japanese movie, but I was watching an American movie. And on top of that, the animation and the art work was extraordinary.Well worth the money.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Excellent Manga,"A superb story, excellent animation and riveting music!With this blend you cannot go wrong! so if you are into animated movies, this is one to watch.

Top notch animé,"It is all too often the case that outside of Japan, the animation genre is typecast as being strictly for kids. Also, when animé does come to the West, it is often bastardised by the studios that bring them to the English-speaking market, through heavy re-editing, thereby disjointing the story line, and amateurish dubbing. ""Sailor Moon"" is a case in point.Princess Mononoke is a definite exception. The dubbing is on par with the original Japanese dialogue (although for a more authentic feel, you should check out the sub-titled version) courtesy of top writer Neil Gaiman, and the animation surpasses even Japanese standards.The animation and voices are just half of what makes this film whole. The story line, although slightly complex, does not have the formulaic good-versus-evil scenario. It sends a message that nature is about understanding, rather than taming, it. And the characters are three-dimensional to boot.Hopefully, Princess Mononoke will be the catalyst for the animé genre as a whole to reach a much wider audience. This is definitely animé for the non-animé viewer.On a final note, Princess Mononoke was rated 'PG' by the censors in New Zealand. Personally, I think it should have been rated 'M', since there are various battle scenes involving gore.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

"Princess Mononoke – it's not a name, it's a description","Hayao Miyazaki, the animation legend who brought to you such awesome films as Howl's Moving Castle, Spirited Away, and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, strikes again with this eco-friendly tale about the struggle between man, animal, and god within a deep, dark Japanese forest.Prince Ashitaka (voice of Billy Crudup) of the Emishi, stricken with a curse foisted upon him by a rampaging wild boar that was possessed by a demon, heads west upon his trusty golden elk Yakul to find a cure. He's also out to possibly save his people, as the appearance of the demonic boar portends grave consequences for the village – the gods and demons are reclaiming the forest.Ashitaka attempts to buy some food in a neighboring town with a gold nugget, but the shopkeepers do not quite believe that the nugget is a valid form of currency. Our fair prince is saved from further embarrassment by a monk named Jigo (Billy Bob Thornton), who offers his assistance to Ashitaka. Ashitaka learns from Jigo of a town called (in the English version, anyway) Iron Town, since they mine iron. Jigo also mentions that the forest gods still dwell around Iron Town, a fact that is certainly not lost on Ashitaka. He heads out the next morning.Meanwhile, a long column of men and oxen, carrying rice back to Iron Town to feed the denizens, is attacked by two giant wolves – one of whom bears a masked girl. Leading the men is Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver), who orders her men to fire their brand-new muskets at the wolves. The wolves are driven off, but their mama, named Moro (Gillian Anderson) soon arrives and lays everyone to waste. Half of Lady Eboshi's men fall off the mountainside.Further down the mountain, Ashitaka hears the battle above and comes across two men in the river. He pulls them out (one unconscious, the other with a broken arm) and carries them both through the ancient forest to Iron Town. On the way to Iron Town, Ashitaka encounters the wolves and the girl by the river side. The girl is San, the Princess Mononoke, i.e., the Angry Princess. Why is she so angry? Because Lady Eboshi has been killing all of the animals, which has been causing the forest to fall into disrepair and has angered the forest gods. She kind of has good reason to be mad.The reception at Iron Town is mixed, as many distrust the newcomer Ashitaka. Ashitaka learns that everyone in the village helps mine the iron, with the women operating the mighty bellows themselves. Lady Eboshi also explains that San really has it in for her (because of the forest damage Eboshi's caused) and that when the Forest Spirit himself is dead, San will become human (although to the viewer she looks perfectly human as it is). San, raised by wolves, is not on board with this eventuality.All of which leads to everyone fighting everyone, with mass destruction guaranteed. Iron Town is under siege by Lord Asano and his samurai, who wish to control the iron ore. The Iron Town citizens are left to defend themselves against Asano while Eboshi and Jigo the monk seek out the Forest Spirit; Jigo has a letter from the Emperor himself that guarantees a large sum of money if Jigo can bring the Forest Spirit's head to the Emperor (who believes it will grant him immortality). Then there are an entire tribe of huge wild boars who want to avenge the death of one of their own – the boar that wound up cursing Ashitaka to kick all of this off – as well taken on the humans for being humans. Oh, and apes who also want to kill the humans, particularly Ashitaka, whom they want to eat so they can gain his strength.There's plenty of action, in other words. In fact, the violence is a bit more explicit than you might expect in an animated film. When Ashitaka is first dealing with his curse, he fires an arrow at a soldier who is attacking him; the arrow cuts the man's arm clean off. Ashitaka doesn't know his own strength, it would seem. There's also a fair amount of blood, and a couple of particularly icky scenes: one in which San removes a bullet from Moro by sucking out the blood and spitting it out and another in which San helps Ashitaka eat by first chewing beef jerky and then passing it to him by mouth (he's very weak, you see). I understand, but eww.Princess Mononoke has plenty of strong-willed characters, and many of them are female: San, Lady Eboshi, and Moro, plus Ashitaka and Jigo. The Forest Spirit is a wonder to behold, too, appearing to be part human, part ape, part deer, and probably parts of lots of other animals as well. And the visuals are about what I expected from the maestro Miyazaki, although I think they weren't quite as well developed as they were in some of his other works, like the earlier Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. And it's also possible that there are just too many characters and plot lines and conflicts in Princess Mononoke to easily track. But overall, this is an unquestionable triumph of animation.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Visually Stunning,"Hayao Miyazaki is clearly one of the best directors to this day. His best movie is, in my opinion, definitely Princess Mononoke. Being a fan of Miyazaki's work like Spirited Away, The Secret World of Arietty (which he only wrote), Castle in the Sky, and Porco Rosso (I could name more but back to the review) I had no little expectations for such an amazing film, boy was I wrong. My expectations were greatly surpassed and what we receive is one of the most visually stunning films of all time.The story is about a young warrior who has a curse put upon him by a raging boar demon-god. He sets out on a journey to the western forests where he hopes to find a cure that would lift the curse from him. It's definitely like Hayao Miyazaki's style.The characters are also pretty awesome. The film's main antagonist, Lady Eboshi, develops so nicely you have this real sort of hatred towards her, one that should be present in every film. She has a reason for it though, she wants success and wants the ability to survive. The protagonist, Ashitaka, is a cool character. He sees peace on both sides between the forest gods who want the humans dead, and the humans who want the gods dead. He can't find an ally on either side directly and he constantly is in a struggle for survival. There's a good romance story between San (the human who believes she is a wolf-god) and Ashitaka and over the course of the movie their relationship develops a ton. You actually get an emotional attachment to the characters, something that's very rare. While they aren't directly involved with one-another, you can see the love between them. It's rather heart-warming considering it's a film about death and stuff.The voice acting is great, as expected. With an all-star cast that include Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, John Di Maggio, Jada Pinkett-Smith, and Gillian Anderson, it's hard to believe that the voice acting wouldn't be good. It has a very good musical score that contains intense and emotional factors, never leaving the action bland or boring by complete silence.There's much to enjoy about Princess Mononoke. It's just a film in general that's great to watch. Lots of colours are featured and leaves a stunning visual impact that really catches the eye. The animators all deserve recognition, as the animation blends in with the colours and nothing is absent. It gives the film industry a perfect reason why hand-drawn films are nearly always better than computer animation.In all, Princess Mononoke is one amazing film. Definitely one of the all time best and it leaves nothing out. There were intense sequences that keep you on the edge of your seat while keeping the main attraction to the visual scenery. Everything was perfect and it's difficult to find any errors with such a masterpiece. Princess Mononoke is definitely an overlooked film. It also goes to show that special effects aren't the only thing to make a film look beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Beautiful and perfect,"I love this movie, it is my favorite.This movie is great. It takes place in ancient times, but it has a twist of fantasy(like with demons and gods and whatnot.) It whisks you into a different world from the moment you push play, but yet at the same time it is quite realistic and accurate. It's accurate all the way down to the number of arrows in Ashitaka's quiver. Even the people who usually don't like anime would like this movie, I think.The art in this movie is just amazing.This creator creates beautiful movies, so for all those art admirers, I would definately suggest this movie and the other Miyuzaki movies, like Spirited Away and Castle in the Sky.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Completing its Purpose.,"In animation films I always like the ideas which are purely imaginative like in the full metal alchemist or complete original ideas like the ratatouille. However in this film the imagination was not that much but there is a humble attempt to give original ideas and a very important message. The animation is good. The cast is very nice. But the fact which has made the film somewhat confused for me is that there is no protagonist or antagonist in the film. The film explores the nature of all the people fighting for their own causes and that is what is beautiful in the film. But I could not attach myself with the film because of this thing may be. The ending is however superb and flawless. The message is given in very much plausible manner.""A recommended watch for all animation lovers.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Hail to the Princess Mononoke!,"What a wild ride through the mystical forest of awesomeness! ""Princess Mononoke"" is like the ultimate nature vs. Industry showdown, with a side of talking animals and a dash of epic sword fights. I mean, forget lumberjacks, the real deforestation warriors here are giant boars with serious anger management issues. And let's not even get started on those wolf buddies who make me question my choice of spirit animals.The animation is so breathtaking that even my popcorn got choked up! It's like Studio Ghibli sprinkled magical pixie dust on every frame. The characters are more complex than a Rubik's cube in a tornado - from Ashitaka, the one-armed eco-hero, to San, the forest ninja with an allergy to shirts. And don't get me started on Lady Eboshi - she's the ultimate ""villain you kind of secretly root for."" With all the action, drama, and a side of forest spirits, ""Princess Mononoke"" is the kind of movie that makes me want to grab a bow, ride a giant wolf, and declare war on deforestation... or at least plant a tree in my backyard. 🌳So, whether you're an environmental enthusiast, a fantasy fanatic, or just someone who's into arm-wrestling with forest gods, ""Princess Mononoke"" will surely take you on a journey more epic than a squirrel's quest for the last acorn. It's a must-watch for anyone who's ever looked at a tree and thought, ""You know what? This definitely needs more wolves.""

A masterpiece,"Be prepared, I'm going to gush about this movie for a few minutes.Alright. There are so many elements to this movie I enjoyed. The vignette structure makes it feel like an epic set in a larger universe, and yet we still have a narrative tied together by our five major characters. Fortunately, those characters all have both a gradual period of introduction that provides some depth, as well as their own arc. The classic Miyazaki style of animation (with a few touches of CG) sets the stage well and provides for some stunning visuals. The voice work for the English dub does everything I'd hope to keep up with the animation.This movie isn't perfect as a film that uses visual elements to subtly tell a story in as rich a way as possible, but it is perfect as a film that engrosses the viewer in a fantastic universe by sending a hero on an epic quest through that universe.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The world's best filmakers at their best.,"Miyazaki is never perfect, but man, he gets so close.Setting the record in Japan for the highest-grossing film of all time, ""Mononoke Hime"" -> ""Spirit Princess"" beat out everything Spielberg and Cameron ever made.  While the scenario somewhat resembles Miyazaki's earlier work ""Nausicaä"", even as a re-make this movie is a marvel.  The characters (both human and not) are strong and colorful, unlike Disney's one-dimensional cash-cow arsenal of clowny sidekicks and sappy heroes.  The animation quality that exceeds Disney's best is combined with artistic skill and rich music to sculpt scenes of intensity and beauty mainstream America has never seen.  The end of the movie and return to reality creates such a sharp sting of nostalgia (""dump shock"") that no one can see this movie only once.Disney and its horde of 2nd-rate translators are releasing this movie in April 1999 in a meagre 4000 screens.

rare eye opener,"This movie was not only brilliant in the cinematic sense, it was also a story telling masterpiece. It completely changed my perception of Japanese/based animes and brought me to a whole new cinematographic experience that i had been missing. I rented Mononoke with much skepticism but i found the title after searching IMDb top 100 best films...it rated the highest among the animated genre.True to its rating, it was extremely wonderful as there was not a dull moment in the film. I was literally glued to the screen of the not-so-predictable storyline as we have come to expect of many Hollywood makes. Mononoke achieves the ability to connect with the viewer intimately. It is action filled, emotionally drenched and with an awesome storyline. Despite the fact that i watched the Japanese version with English subtitles, i think it would be safe to say that this would be the best way to view the film to achieve its full effect.This movie has marked a turnaround point for me in reference to my perception of anime and with due effect, i will search for the all the top rated anime films that i can get.""Let us live together(forest and man)""",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
"Amazing movie, a big step for anime movies","I really think this is a great movie. I sat up having nothing to do, and just for fun I thought I might watch this new movie I had, Mononoke Hime. I started out just wanting to see a little of it, 'cause I was really tired at the moment. But the story kind of took hold of me, and I was sucked in. I sat up, watching the whole movie, even though I was dead tired.I think the reason this movie is so good, is because the storyline is so amazingly good. In the start you get fired up from the actionpacked start, and you get curious what is to happen with this boy.Personally, I'm a great fan of fantasy movies, and this one is exactly that. In addition I've started to like animemovies too, and seeing my two interests joining powers in this great piece of anime art, is simply wonderful!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

a masterpiece,"Is Princess Mononoke for children in North America? The answer can be yes or no it depends on your viewpoint. A lot of this film will go over well with children and the intense violence well scare them out of their seats. The girls in Iron town were rescued from the brothels and they do mention that in the film but they don't say what they did other then men bother them. The film runtime is 135 minutes; children are use to films that run for only 80-90 minutes, as the result children will have trouble following the film. Adult anime fans will love this movie unless they just watch anime for animated nudity. When Ashitaka defeats a boar that had turned into a demon he is left with a mark on his arm that will spread across his body and kill him. Ashitaka leaves his village to find the Sprit of the forest in the forest from which no man has returned. Ashitaka makes to it a town called Iron Town where they make Iron. The town is run by Lady Eboshi who wants to tame the forest to gain profit; she is destroying the forest. Lady Eboshi has very good aspects to her she did rescue women from the brothels and gave Lepers a chance to work. A relationship develops between Princess Mononoke who was raised by wolf gods and Ashitaka when Ashitaka rescues Mononoke from Iron Town. The story is struggle between good and evil but simplistic one like in the case of Disney films. Japanese films have more freedom when it comes to creating their stories since they don't have to worry about over sensitive editors. Hayao Miyazaki gives us a story about how humans, animals and nature gods constantly fight over share of emerging order. The ending isn't better then life happy like in Disney its just practical and realistic. This movie is very well directed, the story is enchanting and involving, it grabs the audience attention and never lets it go. The animation is sharp and visually stunning, a true landmark in animation and fantasy adventure, a flawless masterpiece. 10/10 A definite contender for Best Foreign Picture at the Academy Awards.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Great Storytelling,"This was my first Studio Ghibli film and I was blown away by the visual spectacle this movie creates. The storyline and visuals seem are very similar to that of James Cameron's Avatar, except in anime form.Hayao Miyazaki definitely succeeded in his vision for the film as it is absent of the typical ""Good vs Evil"" plot focus and instead is centered around characters that are without evil intent. Many live action films fail with connecting on a personal level, but Princess Monoonoke was able to deliver strong themes that are easy to relate to.The story telling is remarkable, the characters are extremely detailed, and the storyline is incredible intricate without any holes. This is a film I would recommend to anyone and would love to someday see adapted to live action.True Score: 8.8",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Disney left in the dust,"Not only better than anything you're likely to see from the Disney school of factory filmworks, but quite possibly THE best animated film ever made. The sheer imagination, artistry, and detail in every frame of this work is breathtaking.  I applaud Miramax for leaving the American release unedited, both for length and content.  The voices are a mixed bag; Danes and Crudup are adequate; nothing any competent voice-actor couldn't have pulled off. Thornton's southern accent, though he tries to coneal it, is a bit distracting set among the visuals of historical Japan.  Minnie Driver and Gillian Anderson are both quite good, however.  For fans of Miyazaki, the brilliance of this film will not come as a shock, but for everyone else, it should be quite an eye-opener.  Just don't take your children expecting a Happy Meal cross-over with cute sidekicks and musical numbers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Possibly the greatest animated movie of all time,"Visually, Princess Mononoke shines right off the bat. The design and movement of the demonic boar god is among the most impressive bits of animation I've come across. In addition to the fluid and gorgeous animation, the action is done so well it will immediately pull you in. And we will witness several more sequences of this caliber before the end.Fortunately, it's beauty and action are merely the outer shell of it's brilliance. The most impressive aspect of Princess Mononoke is its ability to display each side of every conflict – and how well it all ties in with the movie's core theme: Man Vs. Nature. We understand what both the people of Iron Town and the inhabitants of the great forest fight for and why. We sympathize and even root for both sides to win. Even Jigo – the main antagonist – is given clear motivation for his actions, not to mention a likable personality. When speaking of the characters in Princess Mononoke, it has to be mentioned how great the performances are in the English dub. Best are Minnie Driver as Lady Eboshi, Keith David as Okkoto and Billy Bob Thornton as Jigo.Our hero Ashitaka is one of the reasons why this story works as well as it does. He is our viewing platform. We observe everything through his perspective and follow his ideals since he is our hero. He is neutral - so we become neutral. If he would have been fighting solely on one side, the film's ultimate message; man & nature needs to function more cohabit-ably together, or all will perish - would have differed greatly.In the end I'll simply say that Princess Mononoke is one of the greatest animated movies ever made.

"Separates the men of fine film from the boys of ""mere anime""","There are two ways to look at this film...from the eyes of an anime lover, and the eyes of a film lover. Frankly, I'll choose the latter viewpoint, as I find most anime to be petty, and meaninglessly cerebral. Hayao Miyazaki has truly inherited Disney's talent with the art of animated film, but his style is his own, and his technique, different, but just as good as the deceased master. Mononoke Hime stands not only as a masterpiece of animation, but a masterpiece of Japanese film...a grand, enticing epic which does its own thing, standing up to the epic films of Kurosawa and David Lean. This goes beyond simple anime, and tells a simple story with mind-blowing, beautiful technique. The only anime that tops it is Grave of the Fireflies, Isao Takahata's masterpiece...the only anime I'd consider in my Top Five of Japanese cinema (Seven Samurai, Ikiru, Sansho the Bailiff, Tokyo Story, Rashomon).",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

A Tale of Man vs. Nature - With Some Wild Twists,"""Princess Mononoke"" is a visually stunning and thought-provoking journey that balances man's progress against nature's wrath. The animation, typical of Studio Ghibli's high standards, is breathtaking, and the story is deep, weaving together themes of environmentalism, greed, and survival.I was immediately hooked by Ashitaka's quest, which carries a heavy weight of moral dilemmas. The clash between humans and the gods of the forest is depicted with intensity, keeping me on edge, despite the slower pace at times. While the movie does carry a clear message about the delicate balance between mankind and nature, it doesn't preach in a way that feels forced-it's layered enough to make you think without handing you the answers on a platter.Though a bit longer than necessary, the movie's intricate character designs and jaw-dropping landscapes made it a memorable watch. The creatures, especially the kodoma, are quirky and charming, adding some light-hearted moments to an otherwise serious tale. Plus, I can't forget the wolves-I mean, who doesn't want to be raised by mystical wolves at least once in their imagination?All in all, an epic tale from Miyazaki that leaves you pondering long after the credits roll. If you're looking for an animated film with depth, this is the one to go for. Just be ready for a slow burn and a few wild surprises along the way!",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Impressiv but Flawed,I love Hayao Miyazaki and this movie stand well together with his other works. The films environmental commentary is subtle but very effective. the story is rich on unexpected turns & twists that keeps your intress awake. The character animation is great & many of the backgrounds are beautifully animated. The film is also not afraid to break the usual movie clichés to be more dramatic & original. As for flawes. I found Ashitaka to be a rather uninteresting protagonist (nothing more than a stereotypical hero). Some scenes are also less visually impressive than others. The thing I love most about this movie is that non of the characters are truly evil but has reason to do what other characters call evil.,8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Don't be put off by the whole 'princess' thing.,"Most of my male anime-fanatic friends avoid this film like the plague because it has the word 'princess' in the title, urging connotations of pink jewelled wands and plastic long-haired horses. If this applies to you take note:-It's about a girl who was brought up by giant wolves and spends every waking hour coming up with plots to savagely kill her nemesis.-The other main character, Ashitaka, kills a giant demon-boar thing and his arm gets possessed by the evil from given off by the demon which will ultimately consume his whole body and kill him, but gives him a sort of super-power until then which causes the arrows he shoots to dismember almost everyone they hit.-At one point in the film there is a blind boar the size of a house who's thirst for human blood is not extinguished even when he is pouring his own blood out of every orifice.Knucklehead appeal aside, by the end of this movie you will probably empathise with many of the lead characters - Mononoke: the savage wolf-girl, Ashitaka: the demon-possessed country bumpkin with a heart of gold, and even Eboshi: the woman who shoots iron bullets at everything that moves, but who hides a soft spot for lepers...Oh, and the visuals are beautiful, and Joe Hisaishi's soundtrack is awe-inspiring.

One Of The Best I Have Ever Witnessed,"Anime is not my thing. Certainly, there have been those films which I have enjoyed, but so few and far between were they that as a whole, I had little hope of ever finding a REAL film amongst them. then, this came along. A classicly styled fantasy epic, so vividly brought to life that it almost makes you cry at the commitment its creators have demonstrated. And it was animated, which was the perfect choice for this story. The music, sound effects, the direction, which honestly I have never been able to detect in an animated feature before, the story-it all boiled down to one of the greatest viewing pleasures I have ever had.Now, if there is a complaint to be made, it is that there are sequences which seem a little overdone, or bits of dialogue that somehow seem out of place, or at least badly performed, which is surprising being that the voice casting of the English dub for the film is extraordinary. Aside from that, EVERYTHING else is pitch perfect.This is a film where you can usually count the digits on a hand, and come up with the right number. Where when the breeze sweeps through a persons hair, not only do you see it, but you can nearly feel it yourself. A film that has the courage to show its audience something profound in a format which, in the United States, is sorely lacking. In this country, the creatures would all be cute, not menacing. Here, even the most docile of creatures has a realistic edge. It would have none of the philosophy this contains, and most heartbreaking of all, it would be overlooked entirely, all for the simple fact that it was animated. This proves the point that animation is an art form. CARTOON does not apply in this case. The film isn't for children, & I would never recommend this to anyone under 13. Not because of excessive violence, foul language or nudity, but rather because the tone and the complexities of the story will probably not keep the interest of most under the aforementioned age, or even interest them in the first place.This is a film, which, when compared to live action features such as Excalibur, Gawian and the Green Knight, Dragonslayer, Conan, Beastmaster-it has only one difference: the freeing majesty afforded it by virtue of being animated. I mention these films as they are similar in tone and texture to this, yet, somehow, this surpasses them all. Not just the greatest animated film of all time, but perhaps the greatest fantasy film in cinema history. If you have ever read the ancient myths and legends of mankind, if you thrilled to the ""Lord of the Rings"" series, then this is the film for you, one which manages to capture on screen what your imagination once conjured.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The greatest animated film - bar none,"Continuing from the title, this also comes very close to becoming the greatest FILM of all time. Why is that? Because it has everything that makes cinema great. It is one of those rare gems whose total worth is greater that the sum of its individual parts. Every aspect of the movie words wonderfully together to make a sense of harmony that is unique to this film.The script masterfully works its strong characters around an amazing and epic story. If there is any fault to the story, is that it is TOO epic. So broad in scope and range it is, that even at a lengthy 133 minutes long it still feels like its running at breakneck speed. But this also means that there is never a dull moment in the whole picture. Every one of the hand drawn frames is a portrait to this amazing fantasy world. The creatures are animated with fluidity and grace, even when the intention is to make them clumsy and slow. The same can be said for the human characters, that while not looking incredibly life-like, have a marvellously distinct and interesting style.The voice acting is way above par for typical anime. The lip-synch was manipulated to fit the english soundtrack, and it works (like everything else in this movie) incredibly well. And the music? Pure bliss. It brings goose-bumps to my every time I hear it. Why it was not nominated for best original score at the oscars just goes to show the narrow scope the judges look to at that insult to cinematic awards.This is more than just a movie. It is a testament to how meaningful and great cinema can truly be. You will leave this movie feeling elated, inspired, and down-right entertained. For those that dont like this movie, fair enough, its an aquired taste.I call it good taste.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of the best animated films I've ever seen!!!,"when I first saw this movie (first English then in Japanese), my aunt who loves the environment recommended it and I was just blown away! Although kids (maybe not children under seven) can watch this movie. it is definitely a break from the traditional childish films that animation brings, especially anime! Princess Mononoke is more than just environmentally aware, this movie happens to have a lot of themes to it besides man and nature's relationship. It's a story about love, loss, and most of all, being alive! This also not a movie where there is good vs. evil (even though the humans and the forest gods are fighting against each other) all the characters are complicated, everybody, even the animals are human, which makes this movie more realistic.I especially like Ashitaka, because he not like the usual hero in an animated film. He is wise and sensitive and because he cares for both humans and the forest,( he especially has feelings for San the wolf girl, who is the main heroine and another likable character), he will do anything to stop the bitter battle between the two.Overall this is great a movie and I highly recommend it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

A masterpiece forever in my 3 best animated movies.,"And a masterpiece that easily holds up to any movie, while doing this in a breathtaking beauty.Most reviewers marvel at the visual style, which is by no question amazing. Yet the greatest archivement of what makes this an epic is the ease in which it tells a complex story about various parties at war within a detailled set of rules, laws and traditions while still managing to focus on the small as to not overwhelm the viewer. You have war factions crashing, you have animal spirits attacking human caravans, you have emporer henchmen, you have nature gods in mystical forests transcending human comprehension and you have a boy trying to understand what is happening to his world. The amount of directors i would trust to pull all these ideas off successfully in one single movie fits in my hand. And yet Hayao Miyazaki makes it look like it's the easiest thing in the world.One of the biggest aspects which sets it far apart from general hollywood animation is the fact that you have no ""good versus evil"". All characters have their own motivations, views and flaws, which lead to the actions they take to influence the way story turns out. The hero isn't a hero for killing the villian, he is just pushed into a complex world to navigate. At times he has to take actions he doesn't want to and at times he has to decide between two equal choices. There is no clear path and that makes his world feel so natural.Of course it wouldn't be the epic masterpiece it is without amazing visuals and music. You're carried into a mesmerizing wonderland in such a fantastic fashion, i get teary eyed just thinking about it. This is what cinema should be.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

King of the World,"Princess Mononoke is a delightful anime from the man who has come to define everything that is best about the genre, arguably, this was Hayao Miyazaki's calling card to the world outside Japan. The English voice cast boasts Billy Crudup, Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, Claire Danes, Jada Pinkett Smith, Gillan Anderson and Keith David - a considerable volume of talent for an animation back in 1997 (Toy Story was 1995), arguably marking the beginning of another trend - for big names to be heard and not seen. There are familiar anime tropes here, but all handled with such sensitivity and style that they still feel fresh on viewing today. The theme of environmentalism is strong, but not stereotyped - character motivations going far beyond cardboard cut-out in their complexity, and it is refreshing and enjoyable that Miyazaki finds room for nobility and honour in his protagonists given the present penchant for anti-heroism. Cinema is the poorer for the recent news that Miyazaki has retired at the age of 73. Here's hoping that the art of animation and of film-making properly acknowledge the debt that it owes him.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Second, I did enjoy Billy Bob Thorton's performance, but it was terribly miscast.

"Miyazaki's Eternal Masterwork Exceeds Animation, Revealing a Universe of Ethereal Beauty and Ecological Allegory","""Mononoke-hime"" by Hayao Miyazaki is a cinematic masterpiece that goes beyond animation to explore the fragile balance between nature and humanity in a profound and visually breathtaking way. The film, which is set in a magical and immersive universe, chronicles the adventure of Ashitaka, a young warrior cursed by a boar demon, as he negotiates the intricate relationships between the ancient spirits of the forest and industrial progress. The story takes on a complex structure as it presents people who defy stereotypes, especially Princess Mononoke, the ferocious and mysterious lead who is torn between the worlds of the living and the dead.The film's amazing animation and stirring soundtrack by Joe Hisaishi combine to create an ethereal ambiance that raises the storytelling to previously unheard-of levels. From the gorgeous vistas to the intricate details of the woodland spirits, every frame demonstrates Miyazaki's painstaking attention to detail. ""Mononoke-hime"" delves into topics of environmentalism, humanity's relationship to nature, and the fallout from unbridled greed and industrialization. It is more than just an animated film; it is a philosophical and artistic extravaganza. Because of this, the movie is regarded as a timeless piece of art that appeals to viewers of all ages and captivates the senses.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Enchanted,"This is an anime that is simply so beautiful that even if it didn't have all of the other great elements that make up this wonderful film, it would still be great to watch.This movie is over 2 hours long, but I never felt like it dragged on unnecessarily. The story isn't amazing, but is above par nonetheless. The movie seemed to flow at a good pace, and never got confusing. The sound is definitely one of the great parts of the film. I watched the dubbed version, with an all-star cast of Claire Danes, Billy Crudup, Gillian Anderson, and others, and the voice acting was simply amazing, and the other sounds, such as bows firing and trees falling were also very well done.The best part of the movie has to be the art. It is so well done that it gives the movie a magical feel. Not a Disney magical, but an entirely new and more enchanted magical feel. The large open areas, and the close-ups were both beautiful, and the animation was superb. Overall I'd recommend this film, maybe not to people under 12, because it does have some violence and blood.

"Cartoon isn't the word to describe this film, it's pure masterpiece","Directed by legendary Hayao Miyazaki who is well respected of his work throughout his reel life. I live in Singapore and such imported movies doesn't come cheap. I took the risk of buying an anime hoping it will be a light hearted family cartoon.Darn I was wrong! It was more than incredible and definitely not a family cartoon. Shortly after Ashitaka shot the cursed boar dead in the starting introduction of the film, it went bloody all over and disolved into a carcass immediately. When he was exiled from the village, he travelled west and witnessed a massacre, the first scene began a samurai chopping off a villager's hand. While after another 'hand missing' scene, Ashitaka shot an arrow that whizzed through a samurai's head like an apple of the head in William Tell.That was pure gore and definitely you can't get such actions on Disney or Nickelodeon. The story unfolds the cold truth of how evil Man is. The war between a forest and its Gods against humans who deforest for profitting interests. A love story develop when Princess Mononoke/San took care of Ashitaka when he got injured. Quite touching especially when she chewed the.. erm piece of wood for him to eat? I ain't too sure if that was wood they eating but Ashitaka had great difficulty eating it, even cried.The story isn't that all and it's up to u all to watch the remaining film. Although touching and family oriented, I would rate it for mature audiences as Princess Mononoke is a rather violent film. Don't ever rent the show, buy it and you'll always watch it over and over again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

One of Miyazaki's Best,"This movie was it for me.  I am a huge fan of anything Japanese, and this movie has played a big role in perpetuating that.  It's such an amazing work of art.  This movie follows a young warrior-prince named Ashitaka in feudal Japan who sets off to find a cure for a curse he incurred by defending his village from a demon.  It explores how humanity's seemingly harmless sins, greed most prominent among them, can snowball into atrocious acts of shockingly great magnitudes.  I advise anyone and everyone to see this. Disregard the fact that it's animated; Japanese animation has proven time and again that characters drawn on a piece of paper have no less depth than that of one portrayed by a live actor.  Princess Mononoke remains one of my favorite movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"

Brilliant and Beautiful,"This has to be one of the best anime's I've seen since Neon Genesis Evangelion. It's lush and beautiful. The story begins with the hero, Ashitaka, defending his village from an attacking demon. Ashitaka fights bravely but is touched by the beast and falls to a curse that will consume his body unless he finds the Spirit of the Forest (which is like a 100 point buck). During his travels ends up staying at a village that minds iron. Hence the name Iron Town. Ashitaka soon finds that Iron Town and the forest are at war. During his stay Princess Mononoke, her name throughout the movie is mainly San, attacks. Ashitaka breaks up the fight between M'lady (leader of Iron Town) and San. Soon Ashitaka finds himself caught up in the battle. The story is magnificent and makes for a great D&D scenario for you geeks out there (long live D&D). I have absolutely no complaints about this movie. I love the ending, which is something I'm VERY picky with. I recommend this to anyone who loves anime, adventure, and/or Record of Lodoss War.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
An amazing movie,"Normally, when someone recommends an anime film to me, I'm a bit leery. After all, there are a lot of anime fans out there who LOVE the style, and will tell me to see films which, honestly, are pretty mediocre.  Add on to that the fact that Mononoke was dubbed, not subtitled, and I was a little bit sceptical. Well, this movie blew my mind.  To call it anime, I feel, demeans it in a way.  Many films may be great anime without being great art.  This was both. Visually, it was stunning, and for once the dubbing was not a liability. When a foreign film is badly dubbed (or badly subtitled, for that matter), it distracts me from many good qualities, and I have to temper my praise for the movie.  The voice actors here were truly quality, and it showed.  I thought that they all did well for themselves, and made the movie a bit more comfortable for me, an english speaker, than had Japanese voices alone been offered. To address plot, I felt that this was where the movie shone.  The film portrayed many characters in many lights... just when you want to hate someone, they have a noble side that brings you up short.  I was initially let down by where the movie went, but upon seeing it again, love it even more.  For me, one of the best aspects of this movie was its feminist quality, something not exactly common in medieval Japan.  If you haven't seen Princess Mononoke, do yourself a favor and make it a point to do so.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
English dub wasn't too bad,"Having now seen both the Japanese version and the English dub, I can say that the dub wasn't too bad.  Sure, I had problems with some of the voices, and humor was a little overemphasized, but it could have been a lot worse. I thought Minnie Driver as Eboshi was the only voice that really fit. Ashitaka and San came across as timid at times, lacking in intensity. Jigo's twang actually worked for the most part, with the exception of some out of place one-liners.  I'm very glad the fantastic soundtrack was kept, although two songs were redone in English.  The bgm played during the first fight with the tatarigami was oddly muted in the English dub, detracting from urgency of the scene, which was important to set the pace for the remainder of the film.  But despite minor quirks I still loved it. Mononoke Hime on the big screen is a wonder to behold.  As it stands, the English version of this magnificent film is excellent viewing that will appeal to wide audiences.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Its a masterpiece,"This film is really really brilliant, its very well written and has really amazing animation. The only thing i can complain about is that it was pretty man hating.....the men were treated like buffoons that couldnt think or do anything for themselves. Dont get me wrong i loved this movie very much and i wouldve given it a ten, but the women being more masculine than men really threw me off...the main character was the only masculine man. This film is one of the greatest of the greats, i doubt disney will ever have a film as this good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of Miyazaki's best!,"This is absolutely my 2nd favorite Miyazaki film, the first being Spirited Away. It's definitely one of the more adult animes I've ever seen, and I'm a huge fan of those. I love animes with dark and gritty themes that explore the realms of fantasy, which this film has covered.When a prince from a village is infected with a curse by a demon, he must travel to the West to find a cure, only to find a war being waged between the Gods of the forest/San, the wolf woman of the forest, and the mining town of Irontown, led by Lady Eboshi.Although the themes are centered around the environment, it doesn't include the typical ""man is evil"" message from every other Dances with Wolves or Pocahontas film. Lady Eboshi is likable and reasonable. San is strong willed and protective of the forest, but she has her own faults as well. It's simply about getting over differences when both sides are at fault. It's more about controlling hate and willing to compromise to keep the peace. Even though some of the dialogue kind of forces it in your face, it's still a natural feeling in the end.The animation is fantastic. The lighting and colors are elegant, and the camera angles on certain scenes is stunning. The animation in Miyazaki's films have stylistically evolved over the course of his career, and it shows.The film has a strong emphasis on fantasy. Although it takes itself very realistically and adult, the forest elements involving spirits are not only beautiful, but very powerfully introduced and used. With that said, the fighting scenes are incredibly realistic and entertaining to no end, mostly because of the amazing animation that goes with it.The story is told very quickly, sidestepping when necessary and getting right down to things, which is what I love about it. It doesn't drag, it's long, but very entertaining. There's no bs in this film whatsoever.It's a must see, there's nothing else to say. I recommend the dubbed version for Billy Bob Thorton's voice, it's irresistible. It's not as good as Spirited Away, but it's right there, one of the best animated films of all time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
great,"The film tells us through the story, hatred is endless, only tolerance can finally end all this. This principle is similar to the Chinese saying, ""When is the right time to get a wrong?"" It seems simple but difficult.",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
One of the best movies of all time!!,"When someone asks me to recommend them a movie, princess mononoke always comes to my mind first. The animation is breathtaking, and the characters are very well developed. There is a perfect balance of romance, action, and adventure. The art In some scenes is astonishing, and this movie has turned into a comfort movie for me. This is definitely one of studio ghiblis more violent movies, but this balances perfectly with the story line. All of the mystical creatures are very powerful, and the soundtrack pulls it all together!! I HIGHLY RECCOMEND. If you have not watched this yet, go to your nearest device and sit back to enjoy the best animated movie in the world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
peace and love,"Nature 's creatures have their own laws of survival, and human beings demand from the natural world for a better life. There is no right or wrong.

Mononoke Hime: A Timeless Tale of Nature's Wrath,"Hayao Miyazaki's Mononoke Hime is a stunningly animated epic that delves into the age-old conflict between humanity and nature. Set in a feudal Japan ravaged by war, the film follows the young warrior Ashitaka as he is cursed by a demon and must journey to a mysterious forest to find a cure. There, he encounters Princess Mononoke, a fierce protector of the forest and its inhabitants.The film's animation is breathtaking, with lush landscapes and vibrant characters. The voice acting is superb, and the score is both haunting and uplifting. Mononoke Hime is a powerful and thought-provoking film that explores themes of environmentalism, spirituality, and the consequences of human greed. It's a must-see for fans of anime and anyone who appreciates a well-crafted story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
This movie is a masterpiece WEOW,God there is just so much to say here. The soundtrack is such a knock out it is so beautiful Joe hisaishi is a marvelously talented composer! And the plot is stunning and important and epic but not too convoluted or cliched. The characters can be a little bland at times but WHO CARES the whole setting and dynamics are so incredibly fascinating and the moral grayness of the factory town is so engaging and cool and it is such timeless subject matter. Visually it is absolutely bonkers and blends history and fantasy/folklore seamlessly. The designs for everything are marvelous WOWOWOW <3 It is an INCREDIBLE epic take but also very emotional and really instills such indescribable emotions. My favorite character has got to be lady eboshi she is so interesting morally and also she is very hot lol. I absolutely adore this movie it has such an impact time and time again .,10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
Haven't lived unless you've seen this movie......,"This movie is honestly one of my personal favorites. Not only is the storyline unique, but the animation is incredible. It has a moral/theme that many adults cannot yet contemplate, and the visuals astound you. The characters are very well formed; I love that nobody's perfect here. Everybody is overwhelmed by their emotions at least once. The dubbing is good too, and in a way you can relate to all the characters, even the ones who aren't desirable to be. The ""evil"" Eboshi isn't that much evil as she just doesn't realize what she is doing, and San is only trying to find her place. The quotes are memorable, as well as the strong themes that exist here. I am telling you, I have seen people in shock of the beauty and color of the morals in this movie. It will just astound you. Those who don't like this work of art don't have to waste their time writing a review, since others would do good not to pay heed. Honestly, to give your children strong moral values, show them this movie. Miyazaki has put another miracle to our hearts.",10.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
The reason we watch anime,This is the best anime ever along with Akira.  This movie is as magical as any Disney movie and has great special effects.

A beautiful treatment of animation and emotion.,"This animated film brings forth in me (and maybe others) what live-action movies couldn't hope to do. The film shows the side of nature, emotion, brutality, and humanity that most have never seen before. The towns and villages are filthy, hazardous places, while the forests are clean, fresh and beautiful. Everything is a treat to the eye. The dialog is great. The story is original. I enjoyed it very much, and it remains one of my all-time favorites. Though if it is being shown to children they may be turned off by the violence and maturity of some scenes, but mostly, from the first scene, it's got you hooked! Pick up the DVD, simply because it's better than the VHS. duh",9.0,Anonymous,"Animation, Fantasy"
