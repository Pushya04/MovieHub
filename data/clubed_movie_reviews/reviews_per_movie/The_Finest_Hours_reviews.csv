Like the good old days,"So, this movie was an old fashioned feel-good, heroes-save-the-day, morality driven drama. I loved it for that. So many films of our era are overly laced with cynicism and violence. Finest Hours hearkens back to the Frank Capra style of story telling, when we had protangonists like Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda to make us feel good about being human. I'm a fan of that genre; it's not passe, we need more of it. Kudos to the makers of this film for showing us something fine and upstanding for a change. Hollywood, take a cue here. No more Dark Knights, okay? Just decent, good hearted heroism like the kind found here.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Good ol' fashioned disaster-and-rescue drama is better than the ""experts"" would have you believe","""The Finest Hours"" (2016 release; 117 min.) brings the telling, ""based on a true story"" we are reminded, of a daring rescue attempt at sea. As the movie opens, it is ""Wellfleet, MA, November 1951"", and we get to know two Coast Guarders who are out on a double date. Bernie (played by Chris Pine) is immediately smitten by Miriam *played by Holiday Grainger). The movie then shifts to February 17, 1952, where Bernie and Miriam are attending a party, and they decide to get married in April. Later that night, as a nor'easter is bearing down, the Pendleton tanker is in serious trouble, and before we know it, Bernie is ordered to assemble a crew and go out to find any survivors of the Pendleton. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is a big budget movie from Disney Studios, directed by Craig Gillespie (""Lars and The Real Girl""; ""Million Dollar Arm""). If you have seen the movie's trailer (which as been inescapable in the theaters in recent weeks), you know exactly what you are in for: a bigger-than-life, against-all-odds rescue attempt of the crew of the Pendleton tanker, which has split in two, by a four man crew of the Coast Guard in Chatham, MA. Don't ask me how the Pendleton's remaining half tanker doesn't sink! I think it has something to do with the boat's balancing tanks, but in the end it doesn't matter, as we are here to witness some of the wildest open sea disaster scenes you'll ever see. In a sense, this reminds of ""Titanic"", except that the action scenes are pumped up and on steroids. Chris Pine (as Bernie) and Casey Affleck (as the Pendleton's main guy) are fine, but to be honest, they and the rest of the gang are all second fiddle to the special effects. I know that it's all CGI, yet it looks so darn realistic! The movie has a great orchestral score, courtesy of veteran composer Carter Burwell (his score for ""Carol"" received an Oscar nomination). Also make sure to stay through the movie's end titles, as we then get a bunch of period pictures from the Boston Globe and other news sources with the real life people from the events (and likely the source of the costuming for the film). Last but not least, this is released both in 2D and 3D, but just know that the movie was shot in 2D and then converted into 3D (I saw it in 2D). Bottom line: ""The Finest Hours"" is a good ol' fashioned disaster-and-rescue drama that is much better than the ""experts"" would have you believe.""The Finest Hours"" opened nationally this weekend, and the Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not great. somewhat to my surprise. Regardless, if you are in the mood for an effects-heavy but very realistic disaster-and-rescue movie, I encourage you to check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray (although a movie of this kind just begs to be seen on the big screen). ""The Finest Hours"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",7.0,Anonymous,History
Not bad,"This film starts kinda slow and unrelated to the story ( you expect to see) and it is rather slow paced at the beginning, but soon it gets more packed with action and rests until the end.I enjoyed the film. It was even touching at the end. The fact that it is based on the true story does give it a plus. The breaking of a ship ( two, in fact) in haft because of the storm was really wow! I really got into the scene when they showed the first breaking of the ship. It was intense and really well done. I guess I liked those scenes which were filmed inside of the ship and all the hard work being done to prevent the sinking of it that caught my attention the most and the ones I really enjoyed. However, the relations between the sailors ( in the ship and at the land were somewhat superficially done and yes, you get that some of them are not liking each other, but, why is that is not rally explained and I though it should have been)The love story that also goes parallel to the disaster at sea is sometimes sweet but most of the time is kinda blah and maybe it should have been cut in entirety from the film. It does add something to the film, but not that much in reality. But I guess it is important as it is one of the true facts.All in all, not bad. I give it a rating eight!",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Storm at sea, really not my thing, but nice movie","The fact that the movie is based on true events makes it a bit more special to watch. It's a nice story about courageous coast guards that risk their own lives trying to save an entire ship crew from a sure death. The movie is well made and if you are like me a bit afraid of big storms at sea then you will have the same feeling of anguish as I had during almost the entire movie. There are some cheesy moments as well, when it's more about their romance, but for the rest it's a good movie. If it was not for a couple scenes that I didn't like I would score it even more. Those scenes were unrealistic and bothered me a bit. Scenes where they are at sea in a major storm and have a conversation on a non rocking boat. That is simply impossible, but for the rest it's all good. Good actors, good story, and interesting due to it's historical facts.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Enthralling story of courage and survival,"February 1952. Bernie Webber is a boatswain/Petty Officer at a Coast Guard station on the coast of Massachusetts. A massive storm is in progress out to sea, damaging two tankers to the point that they appear likely to sink. On one tanker, the Pendleton, the chief engineer, Ray Sybert, is using all his ingenuity, resourcefulness and experience to keep the ship afloat and buy time until help arrives. Unfortunately for him and his crew, the Coast Guard have sent their best crew and rescue boat to the other stricken tanker. When the Coast Guard discover the Pendleton's situation, Webber and a 3-man crew are sent to help. The odds are stacked against Webber - just leaving the harbour in those seas will require large amounts of skill, courage and luck. Then they have to find the Pendleton, without a compass, rescue the crew and somehow make it home safe.An enthralling (true) story of courage and survival. Compelling viewing - once the danger strikes, you're glued to your seat. What makes it so interesting is that they don't just focus on the efforts of the rescuers but also on the rescued. I found the Pendleton crew's story much more interesting than that of Webber and co - the ingenuity, resourcefulness and (reluctant) leadership of Sybert was amazing. This is helped by a great performance from Casey Affleck.Not all good though. Many of the characters seem like cartoon stereotypes - the negative naysayers, the clingy girlfriend/fiancée, the inept commander. The romantic angle was overplayed and not that necessary. It did add depth to Webber's character but not much.Performances vary. Casey Affleck is the stand-out as Sybert. Chris Pine is okay as Webber. Eric Bana is pretty weak and gives the worst American accent I've ever heard (I think it was supposed to be Southern but it varied so much and seemed so unnatural it was hard to tell). Holliday Grainger is a bit overbearing as Miriam, though that might have been intentional on the director's part.",7.0,Anonymous,History
real life Disney heroes,"Greetings again from the darkness. The U.S. Coast Guard has played a role in many movies over the years, but only a few have placed this service branch directly in the heart of the story  most recently The Guardian (2006), which was little more than a cheesy, too-talkative water-based rip-off of Top Gun. Director Craig Gillespie (Lars and the Real Girl, 2007) takes a much different approach as he presents a look at one of the most legendary and heroic real-life rescues in Coast Guard history.The Oscar-nominated writing team behind The Fighter (2010): Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, and Eric Johnson have collaborated on the screenplay based on the book from Casey Sherman and Michael J Touglas. It's a worthy tribute (and clearly Disney-influenced) to what is described as the greatest Coast Guard small-boat rescue. It combines a boat-load (sorry) of tension-filled ocean-based sequences with some pretty interesting character-based sub-plots within a Massachusetts community that has become all too familiar with storm-based catastrophes.Chris Pine stars as Bernie Webber, an awkwardly shy and obsessive rule-follower, who has lived under a cloud of doubt ever since a previous rescue mission failed, resulting in the death of a local fisherman/husband/father. We first meet Bernie as he bungles through a first date with Miriam (Holliday Grainger, a young Gretchen Mol lookalike). The film then jumps ahead to 1952 when they become engaged and Bernie is ordered into a questionable mission by his ""not-from-around-here"" commanding officer Daniel Cluff (Eric Bana). See, a huge storm has literally ripped apart not one, but two giant tankers, leaving crew members battling for survival. It should be noted that Bana the Australian, tosses out a laughable southern accent that is a joke within the movie and within the theatre (for different reasons).Bernie and his crew: Richard Livesay (Ben Foster), Andy Fitzgerald (Kyle Gallner), and Ervin Maske (John Magaro), take off against all odds in a too-small boat against too-big waves in a desperate attempt to rescue the tanker crew that includes brilliant engineer Ray Sybert (Casey Affleck) and characters played by John Ortiz and Graham McTavish. Affleck excels as what can be termed a quiet leader. Of course, we know how the story ends, but the heroic efforts against a very powerful Mother Nature show-of-force make for compelling movie watching.The special effects are stout, though not be as spectacular as The Perfect Storm (2010) or In the Heart of the Sea (2015), and it's the human-factor that provides more than enough thrills, excitement, and tension. In fact, the biggest issue I had was that I saw a 3-D version which is an absolute disservice to the film. Most of the story takes place at night and at sea, so the 3-D consequence of dimmed light and muted colors results in a far too dark and dull look to the film. I spent much of the movie sliding the 3-D glasses down my nose in a simple attempt to enjoy a bit more brightness. The recommendation would be to skip the higher-priced (money grabbing) 3-D version and take in the more pleasing ""standard"" version.Disney makes feel-good movies. Their target market is not cynics or the overly critical among us. The romance pushes the ""corny"" meter, but keeps with tradition of other Disney movies based on true stories like The Rookie (2002) and Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story (2005). Keep this in mind you'll likely find this one pretty entertaining. Stick around for the closing credits as a slew of real photographs from the actual 1952 event are displayed, as are photos of the real heroes from that night.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Edge of your seat action,"The FINEST HOURS is a rip-roaring, edge of your seat action thriller that will keep you guessing all the way to the end.There....that should get me on the poster.That said, I will have to admit that I had low to middling expectations going into this film and it exceeded my expectation in almost every way.Starting with the Cast. Chris Pine (good ol' Cap't Kirk) stars as Bernie Webber a mid-level Coast Guard officer who is flung into the forefront when an oil barge splits in half in very rough sees during a storm. Pine presents Webber not as a square-jawed hero, but a real person with doubts and insecurities but a strict code of ethics and when his Capt. (the always capable Eric Bana) sends him out for what could be a suicide mission, he goes out.While Pine holds down half of this movie, Casey Affleck holds down the other half as the leader of the group of survivors on the oil tanker. Normally, I am not a big fan of Affleck's work, but in this movie, I sure am. He is a man of few words and tells much with his expression. If there is a ""squared jawed hero"" in this movie, it is Affleck.These two are supported by a veritable who's who of ""that guy"" actors. Ben Foster, John Ortiz, Michael Raymond James and good ol' Abraham Benrubi are just the tip of the iceberg, so to speak, of wonderful character actors filling the roles of other Coast Guard members and crewmen of the doomed ship.Only Holliday Grainger as Pine's strong-willed fiancé fails for me, but I blame a weak written character more than her acting for that one.But, make no mistake, it is the action that makes this movie exciting. From the opening where the oil ship splits in half through the attempt to get out to the ocean to find the doomed ship to the actual rescue itself, I was on pins and needles, literally vaulting myself up out of my seat to get over a wave at one point. Director Craig Gillespie, not known as an action director, does a nice job of leading us through these scenes, I am anxious to see what he takes on next. I hope it is another action flick.Is it a great film? No. The opening (after the tanker accident) drags and the movie bounces around in tone trying to find out what kind of movie it wants to be, but once Pine and company goes out to sea to rescue, the movie zips along just fine.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",7.0,Anonymous,History
The Most Daring Rescue of a Crew with a Small Rescue Boat,"In 1950, in Cape Cod in Massachusetts, the US Coast Guard station in Chatham receives a distress signal from the oil tankers SS Pendleton and SS Fort Mercer. Commander Daniel Cluff (Eric Bana) assigns the crew formed by Bernie Webber (Chris Pine), Richard Livesey (Ben Foster), Andy Fitzgerald (Kyle Gallner) and Ervin Maske (John Magaro) to rescue the crew of the SS Pendleton in a small enclosed lifeboat. Cluff is warned about the intensity of the storm by Bernie and also by his girlfriend Miriam (Holliday Grainger) but he keeps the order. Meanwhile the SS Pendleton has broken and lost his forward part and his skilled and experienced engineer Ray Sybert (Casey Affleck) assumes the command of the survivors. He uses his abilities to steer the stern in a safer position, grounding it on an unstable bank of sand to avoid sinking.""The Finest Hours"" is based on the most daring rescue of a crew in a blizzard with a small enclosed lifeboat-rescue boat. The heroic work of the US Coast Guard crew is impressive, saving thirty-two survivors from the SS Pendleton. The ability of the engineer Ray Sybert is also praiseworthy. The film is technically impressive with breathtaking action scenes of the rescue operation. The romance is silly and only completes the running time. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Horas Decisivas"" (""Decisive Hours"")",7.0,Anonymous,History
"If you liked The Perfect Storm, then give The Finest Hours a look.","Takes place in the early 1950's where a giant storm dominates the seas by breaking a tanker truck in half, with only a few hours left to survive, the crew id does what they can survive. A rescue ship is sent to try and get to them, but the question is will they ?I love the early 50's look, it captures it so perfectly. Everybody gives a good performance, almost nobody stands out. The storms scenes are also well shot, you'll feel caught up in the storm also. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's easy to compare this to The Perfect storm(2000), it has the same feel to it.

"Three intersecting stories, of which one works very well","""The Finest Hours"" presents three stories, or perhaps one story from three perspectives. The stories are perhaps better described as intersecting rather than interwoven as developments in each storyline have relatively little effect on the other story lines other than points of intersection.The most successful story is one of survival aboard a doomed ship in a fierce storm. Casey Afflect delivers a brilliant performance, possibly the best of his career, as an engineer who must win the respect of the crew and devise a seeming impossible plan to ensure their survival.But the putative hero of the story is played by Chris Pine as a disgraced seaman thrust into a leadership position who manages a heroic rescue by alternatively slavishly adhering to regulations and blatantly disregarding them, but steadfastly pressing on by sheer obstinacy and succeeding by dumb luck.The least successful story is a romance between Pine's character and a local girl who somehow manages to afford a car on a switchboard operator's salary, walks through snowdrifts in high heels without slipping or marring her shine, defies convention and embarrasses her boyfriend by proposing marriage, and barges into the all-male preserve of the Coast Guard station to demand that the commander commit an unconscionable act of cowardice in an exchange that might have been ghostwritten by the screenwriter's five- year-old daughter.Having never read the book, it's difficult to tell what parts were embellished for dramatic impact, but much of the story seems hopelessly contrived. Critical pieces of equipment (radar, compass, radio) malfunction and miraculously return to service as if on cue. At one point, a large group of bystanders race off in support of the rescue effort and one expects them to activate certain items, but strangely nobody does until the love interest does, almost as an afterthought, and everybody else decides to follow suit, leaving the audience wondering why they went there if they didn't intend to do it in the first place. At another somebody shouts out a number referring to a group of people he could not possibly have counted.This is another film that the #OscarsSoWhite and advocates of gender pay parity would rather audiences not see. It's basically a story of real men in the 1950s male-dominated era doing manly things while the womenfolk stay at home being supportive, raising children and mourning those who sacrificed their lives supporting their families. It was only four years after Eisenhower ended segregation in the military and the Coast Guard and various maritime labor unions were probably about as integrated as the Ku Klux Klan.But this would never do in the twenty-first century when studios feel pressured to compromise dramatic structure in favor of political correctness. Consequently, two subplots seem to have been added and/or expanded to provide more diversity for audiences who prefer diversity over drama. One involves a black seaman whose cowardice results in the death of a Caucasian who takes him under his wing. The second is the romantic subplot, which is given roughly equal weight and screen time with the two other through lines. The story is not particularly interesting. The girl is a typical chick flick heroine – pretty but not gorgeous, more cherubic than voluptuous, virtuous and steadfast to a fault, with an anachronistic feminist streak. Both subplots could have been easily eliminated. Perhaps the film would not have been quite the critical or commercial disappointment if they had been sharply trimmed or eliminated.The theme and moral seem weak. A theme concerning luck and happenstance undermines some of the effect, as do several plot contrivances, such as the equipment malfunctions. The episode is supposedly one of the greatest sea rescues in history, but it's presented as the consequence of doggedly plodding along in blind subservience to duty rather than anything one would ordinarily equate with heroism.Technically, the film is top shelf. The period props, costumes, settings and make-up all seem authentic. There is a refreshing lack of distracting jiggly-cam shots. The special effects seem realistic. It lays on the schmaltz fairly heavily at points, but what can one expect from Disney?It might have been more compelling if it had concentrated on the survival story, eliminated the love story and trimmed the rescue story.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Makes me so very proud of our Coast Guard,"This movie has a lot of action and suspense, which is what many of us look for in a film. However, it is much more than a story of an event at sea, it is a testimony of what four men of the US Coast Guard in the '50s were willing to do despite the risk to their lives.A full scale nor'easter stirred the waters of Massechusetts Bay, making the seas dangerously life threatening. Word by two-way radio of vessels being damaged and broken from the force of the waves demanded the local Coast Guard Commander send his men to rescue who they could.Reluctant, initially, to respond to such a perilous task, to rescue men that may still be alive aboard one sinking vessel, the Pendleton, Boatwainsmate Bernard Webber gathered three volunteer sailors to assist him. The freezing snow, winds, rain and treacherous waters were certainly more than he and his men bargained for when they enlisted.Webber took the helm of the craft, the size of which could barely hold him and his three man crew through fifty and sixty feet waves, finally reaching, purely by luck, the darkened liner, a 503 foot, 10.448 gross ton tank vessel that, at its start, contained a full cargo of kerosene and heating oil.Tactics used to keep the Pendleton from sinking are a lesson to watch. During today's rescue efforts, it is the CG's option to use a helicopter for such undertakings, but when the numbers are as many as these survivors, I doubt one trip would end with Webber's results.The bravery and single-mindedness needed to accomplish what these four men sought to do makes me very proud to know our country has such heroic individuals willing to give their lives to save complete strangers.",,Anonymous,History
All Life is Precious,"Now, that's what I call a good film. It may still be January, but The Finest Hours definitely doesn't feel like a film that came out in the midst of Hollywood's dumping ground month. It's directed by Craig Gillespie and stars Chris Pine, Casey Affleck, Ben Foster, Holliday Grainger, and Eric Bana. It tells the story of one of the most daring and dangerous U.S. Coast Guard missions in history as Bernie Webber, played by Pine, led a crew aboard a motor boat to save the survivors of the splitting of the SS Pendleton.First off, it's unbelievable that this is even a true story. I constantly thought to myself throughout the film that there's no way they actually get through this alive. It's even more amazing when you see the real life pictures and records of the events in the closing credits. It's also one of those films that makes you enjoy your time away from the storms on water and appreciate every second on land. But besides the remarkable story, I got sucked in with the acting of Pine, Affleck, and Grainger. Grainger plays Pine's love interest back home in Massachusetts and at times the screen time on her can become distracting. Grainger was good in the role, but the time spent on the motor boat and Affleck's crew on the ship was much more intriguing.Another understandable complaint this film has been getting is its noticeable CGI. When you compare it to films like Life of Pi, Interstellar, or even Titanic from 20 years ago, it doesn't even come close to holding its own against those. But with its lower budget and poignant story, I think you can forgive some of its more obviously green screen moments. The film does have plenty of 'true story clichés' used to bring our emotions to the breaking point, but I never felt like they over did it. I was so enthralled with what was happening that when the film does get to its emotional climax, I had to hold back tears. That's a tribute to Gillespie's direction and the incredible score by the newly Oscar nominated, Carter Burwell.+Unbelievable story+Great lead performances+Timely score-Some CGI overstayed its welcome-Some cuts back to Grainger's character weren't necessary7.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
The Finest Hours is a typical movie disaster,"The Finest Hours is a typical movie disaster. A good cast, not a bad script and the presence of suspense in the right scenes make The Finest Hours a good period drama with thriller elements. Yes, the story was very embellished, and in the film there is a makimum of pathos, but in another way in the USA they do not know how to shoot. Excellent performance by Casey Affleck, the first half of the film is just watching his acting. And Chris Pine played a great lead role. In general, The Finest Hours is primarily interesting for acting and transferring the historical atmosphere of the early 50s, and only then as a disaster film.

Decent old-school survival drama.,"Based on an event that would be entirely unbelievable if only it weren't true, this survival-at-sea drama has an unpretentious, old school charm that wears its heart on its sleeve and its optimism as a badge of honour. When an oil tanker splits in half during a raging storm, Casey Affleck's chief engineer Ray employs ingenuity and nerves of steel to lead the remaining men – all of whom are stereotypes yet not mere caricatures – through an impossible situation. Meanwhile Chris Pine's by-the-book Bernie, a Coast Guard who has recently tasted failure in his line of work, must overcome personal adversity and harsh conditions in his rescue attempt undertaken in a small boat with a crew of only four. These two intersecting stories are thrilling, interesting and affecting enough to carry the film, so it's a damn shame a third of the runtime (including a slightly too-cheesy ending) is given to the town folk nervously waiting to see if their loved ones will make it home. Every time it abandons the ocean-set exploits in favour of checking in on the families – in particular Bernie's infuriatingly naïve and misguided girlfriend Miriam (Holliday Grainger) – the suspense is undercut and the momentum is stifled. Huge credit must be given to the production designers and visual-effects artists though, the multi-layered set of the (slowly) sinking ship's engine room is epic and immersive, whilst the wide shots seemingly composed entirely of CGI are convincing and seamless. The Finest Hours is far from perfect, but it's a refreshingly simple family-friendly tale with a pleasant, old-fashioned approach to storytelling that celebrates the human spirit without a hint of irony.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"Good story, but needed more character development","We find something universally appealing in stories of rescue. A story of humans risking their own lives to help other humans lifts our spirits—and perhaps reminds us of the value inherent in each one of us.So does The Finest Hours—the rescue movie from Disney opening this weekend— deliver?The movie stars Chris Pine and Casey Affleck and is the true story of the 1952 Coast Guard rescue of men whose oil tanker literally broke in half during a violent storm. The actual story is pretty incredible, considering the odds against the men in the hull of the tanker and the odds against the small Coast Guard boat.What makes any rescue movie so poignant for the viewer is a connection with the characters. When we bond with a character, we want him to make it. The Finest Hours attempted to do this by giving us some back story on Bernie Webber (played by Chris Pine), the man leading the rescue. But for me, it just wasn't enough.I was more interested in Ray Sybert, the man aboard the tanker (played by Casey Affleck) who took charge . The movie hinted at a back story— relationships issues with the crew—but the director instead focused on the action sequences on the boat. In the end, it seemed Sybert's heroic actions were downplayed.I'm not giving anything away; it's a common fact the rescue was successful. The movie is awash (no pun intended) with special effects, but in the end, it was just a boat rescue with no heart connect with the characters.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"While it has its heart in the right place, The Finest Hours can't seem to rise above its sappy melodramatic storyline.","The Finest Hours tells the harrowing and courageous true story of the most daring rescue mission that the U.S. Coast Guard has, to this day, ever had to accomplish. Starring Chris Pine, Casey Affleck, Ben Foster and Josh Stewart, the film's cast is stacked to the brim with talent but the director, Craig Guillesspe takes away from their efforts by telling the story in the sappiest of ways. The film starts with Bernie Webber (Chris Pine) on a blind date with his friend as he looks forward to meeting Miriam (Holliday Grainger), the woman he has been talking on the phone with for months on end. It is a sappy way to start the film but that sappiness is soon discarded as soon as we are introduced to the USS Pendelton and its crew. The crew, headed by Casey Affleck's brilliant and film carrying performance as Ray Sybert, is in the midst of a terrible winter storm and they struggle to maintain control of the ship. After being battered by the brutal waves off of Nantucket, the ship is split in two and must stay afloat until help arrives. The film takes its shape during the scenes with the Pendleton and it's crew. Casey Affleck gives a good performance that remains as one of the most interesting of the film coupled with some truly gasp-worthy scenes of suspense and action. This is one thing the film has going for it, it has some truly breath taking action sequences that will leave you clawing at your arm rest and holding your breath. While an abundance of CGI is used, it still feels the way its supposed to. Cold and brutal. While the film is no match for the conditions shown in The Revenant, it still will make you shiver once or twice just looking at the weather these brave souls have to go up against. While these sequences and qualities make The Finest Hours a thoroughly watchable and enjoyable film, unfortunately the film compromises, what could be, white knuckle action and substitute it with a half-assed love story between Bernie and Miriam that borders on annoying after the first hour and equally annoying and poorly done Boston accents. The accents show Pine and Grainger as the biggest culprits. Grainger's performance as Miriam is annoying and wildly unrealistic and Pine is spineless in his rendition of, what many consider, one of the bravest men that ever served in the Coast Guard. Grainger's Miriam serves as more of a nuisance than a help to the film, which is rather disappointing because the role screams for a more able actress to take on the role and another screenwriter to make her character more than just a poorly written female character. It really throws the film for a loop, making it as lopsided as you can get. Despite this, the film moves through its main storyline with tenacity that is hard to match. One sequence in particular features the rescue crew trying to pass over the Nantucket ocean bar, a point in the ocean that features out going and incoming waves crashing against one another. The sequence is harrowing, the pacing of it is brilliant and the sheer intensity is one that the film can't seem to match for the remainder of the film. The film, while it does get your heart pounding, lacks character drama and depth. While we care about the characters, we only care about the actors playing them. If lesser known actors were in these roles, it would be clearer that the film could have used another rewrite and a stronger female character. Overall, The Finest Hours is a decent rescue film that serves its purpose of entertaining you but it does little else in the way of separating it from every other film of its type.",5.0,Anonymous,History
"It takes ""The Finest Hours"" some time to find its bearing, afterwards it's a nice sail through the rocky storm","As far as disaster movie goes, ""The Finest Hours"" is atypical of the usual mold. It seems vanilla, slightly timid in the execution, which is still fine due to its production quality, but it does overturn it from more harrowing promises. There's also quite a bit of spotlight given to the romance subplot, this feels unnecessary and in some events might break the pace. However, when it gets the steam rolling, it produces a delightful display of blue cold waves and breaking steel.This is a real life story of the rescue of the sinking tanker in 1952 told mainly in two perspectives; the Coast Guard Bernie Webber (Chris Pine) and the tanker crew led by Sybert (Casey Affleck). It continuously shifts between the passive yet courageous Webber and equally resourceful though apprehensive Sybert as they struggle through their respective trial.Chris Pine is good cast, Webber is not like his previous roles, he's more reserve and quite. It's a ""shine in peril"" kind of role and he delivers well in momentous scenes. Meanwhile, Casey Affleck as the engineer is trying to keep the tanker afloat despite disdain from his colleagues and collapsing morale. These two leads also have the same predicament, Sybert and Webber are not the squad favorite, so it builds up a nice underdog story as well.One can argue that Miriam (Holliday Grainger) is given the third point of view since her angle takes a few good chunks of the runtime. It's understandable to introduce motivation of loved ones as well as shedding light on Webber's back story, although her parts seem prolonged as some of them are less crucial and the movie could do without them.For a movie filled with nautical terms, it tries to acclimate the audience to the increasing tension as accessible as possible, concentrating on the race against time with daring attempts and ingenious makeshift means. Visual and audio are a match made in stormy sea. The editing for the more extreme sequences are well crafted, it even portrays the ocean so vastly grim it is borderline romantically ominous.The ordeal could've been told in crueler and faster fashion, but the direction for an inspiring triumph is appreciated as well. It is a fine venture to the freezing water with warm home to return to.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The finest hours,"I cannot deny that this movie kept me on the edge of my toes with its thrill packed sound and picture effects and the not knowing if the rescue mission will succeed or not. However these were the only positive elements for me. I was just a little bit disappointed by the performance of Chris Pine who, in my opinion, over acted his role as Bernie, as I felt like he was trying too hard to look like a genuinely good and honest man that it was clear that the man was acting. The thing is he doesn't need to try so hard because his face and his eyes, if utilized well, will do the job for him. Another disappointment was Casey Affleck's performance as he was the total opposite of Pine, because he was not trying at all and looked like he was not drawn to the character or the story, even looked bored in some scenes. Eric Bana, one of my favorite actors, was the most disappointment for me as he did not look interested in the character he was playing and overall it was weak performance for Eric Bana.My overall experience watching this movie was somewhat enjoyable .. the love story did not seem necessary for the plot nevertheless it was not necessarily bad either..the movie focused on its main goal which is the rescue mission and the bravery of Bernie and his men and in that it succeeded.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Fine work all around,"The Finest Hours depicts the true story of what is called the greatest US Coast Guard rescue in history. In 1952, Chris Pine, a junior officer, and his small team of men, get dispatched into a raging storm to attempt to rescue survivors from a horrific accident that ripped an oil tanker in half.Pine apparently had failed in a previous rescue attempt, and in the small New England city town, this stain stayed with him forever. But his young bride-to-be brings an out of town attitude that kicks people in the butt, getting them to move, when she sees her spouse's life endangered. There is just enough of that plot to have you rooting for the young couple, but not too much to sap the main story.Casey Affleck delivers from the other side, as the chief engineer on the ship that is going down. The ideas he devises to gain time and give the crew their only chance for survival are incredible.The special effects of the powerful storm, the rescue craft trying to make it thru the breakers, the sinking oil tanker, and the incredible rescue will leave you gasping for air.Despite the Hollywood ending, the fact that the basic facts are true leaves you in awe of these kinds of people, who, when faced with a disaster, run towards the problem, not away. It certainly makes me appreciate the Coast Guard a lot more than beforehand. These are tough people. The Finest Hours is a tough, solid film, with superb acting and high drama. I think you will enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A good way to honour brave men,"26 February 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Finest Hours. Well done Disney. This was a film filled with intense drama and although I wasn't on the very edge of my seat, the action had me firmly pushed into it. Based on a true story, it depicts the events of 1952 when two cargo ships had the misfortune to be broken up by a big storm. The bravery of the coast guard is honoured by this portrayal of the dangers faced, just in getting away from the land and before setting out to find the remains of a ship in zero visibility and freezing temperatures. Chris Pine plays Bernie Webber, a quiet, by the regulation, member of the Coastguard, who sets off with a crew of three to do the impossible. If this was a work of fiction you would be hard pressed to believe it, but being based on a true story I found myself willing the tiny lifeboat to mount each wave, not turn over and attack the next one with the fervour of men on a mission. I do like a good disaster movie, and this definitely falls into that category, but is much more sombre because it's true. Please stay and watch the credits, there are photos and newspaper cuttings of the real people involved with these events.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent Film,"I have watched this film 3 times, and will watch it again and again. I love the whole wholesome and exciting story. The fact that it is based on a real life rescue is even more amazing to me. It is a good example of how the Coast Guard is a critical piece of our nation's defense and service. I don't know why it appeals to me so much, but it does. Maybe it is because I have my own Coast Guard story in my life. It is also a romantic movie--I enjoy the love story and how it enhances the rescue portion of the movie. The way it was filmed gave me chills and thrills when I wasn't expecting them. Great movie making, and I think it will be a classic eventually, even though the reviews were less than excellent. I know it is a classic for me!",10.0,Anonymous,History
A good movie that is worth watching but a very very watered down Perfect Storm type movie that I'm not sure I'd watch again.,"""We can't leave them out here alone, that boat won't last. We all live or we all die."" Bernie Webber (Pine) is a member of the Coast Guard that does everything by the book. After word of a drowning ship gets to the guard the only boat they have left is a tiny 12 person craft. Against all odds, and the advice of his superiors, Bernie and his 4 man crew set out in the middle of cold winter night to rescue a group of men clinging to hope. I was looking forward to this movie. I really liked the Perfect Storm and was hoping for something similar. Before watching I wondered why this one seemed to come and go so fast without any real hoop-la. After watching I understood why. This is a good movie and for the most part I did enjoy it but it was lacking something the Perfect Storm had; drama and emotion. The fact that this is a true story helps a little and does add something but to me this was just a little to generic and ""Disney-fied"" to have any real punch. That hurt the movie for me.

However for anyone who has ever been more than a day at sea or anyone from a seafaring community this film is impossible to watch. Every single minute contains inaccuracies ranging from minor details like getting the equipment of that time wrong, to outrageously unrealistic mis en scene. This film simply gets it wrong on conditions at sea, groups or individual characters, the language that would have been used, the actions that men would and would not take in heavy weather conditions, group behaviour, ships hierarchy, use of instruments....

We all live or we all die.,"THE FINEST HOURS is simply one of the finest movies I have ever seen. From the opening scenes where Young Bernie Webber is pulled into a blind date by his friend and He meets the Woman that becomes his wife. To Bernie's dedication to the coast guard. Chris Pine is totally engrossing as Bernie. The Story is one of Heroism sacrifice. And Skill and courage under fire . During a Winter Storm on Feb. of 1952 Two Oil Tankers fall victim to the raging waters one of the Ships the S.S. Pendleton breaks in half. The Men trapped on the floating Stern Are forced to work together to keep the floating hulk afloat. The Head Engineer Played brilliantly by Casey Affleck has the knowledge and the skills to keep them alive until they get rescued. But so far no one knows they are out there. And The other Oil Tanker commands all the attention. When the Pendleton finally gets the message out. The picking for rescuers are slim and Bernie is ordered by his commanding officer To mount a rescue . Bernie in command picks a crew and takes out the only boat remaining. A small boat. And in those waters agitated by the storm it amounts to a Suicide mission. As Bernie tells his men. ""They tell us to go out. They don't tell us to come back""! Bernie is also working under the spectre of a failed mission in which he failed to save the lives of a sinking ship the year before. So Bernie is looking for redemption. That and the fact that Bernie is driven to save those men. All lives matter to Bernie and to him failure is not even a option they'll do it or die trying.The Special Effects are spectacular. But they pale in comparison to the acting and the story. Both are the finest kind you'll see in any movie released this year. This movie easily climbed on to the top of my favorite movie list. The style of the movie is beautiful and makes one long for the simpler times back then. And makes us believe in heroes again.",,Anonymous,History

Thrilling story sunk by conventional script,"As someone who has lived at various places on the British coast all his life I have tremendous respect for the men of our Royal National Lifeboat Institution - all volunteers - who are willing to risk their lives to rescue others, and I love sea stories. The US Coastguard is managed by the government and has salaried officers, but on the evidence of this film they have more than their own share of guts and determination.The best scenes in this film are undoubtedly those set at sea, the crew of the Pendleton jury-rigging a helm and nursing the hulk along until she can be run aground, and the men of CG 36500 fighting their way out to sea to save them (even if CG 36500 does develop the characteristics of a submarine a couple of times. I know lifeboats are designed to be non-sinkable, but not *that* non-sinkable). These scenes are truly edge-of-the-seat thrilling.Unfortunately, in order to make a film, the story has to be 'dramatised'. So the Coast Guard station is commanded by an outsider mistrusted by locals who matter darkly over every decision he makes, and the hero is partly shunned as a Jonah after a failed rescue the previous year. (Is everyone around Cape Cod so sour and miserable? Just asking). On the Pendleton there is some Alpha-Male tussling for supremacy among the crew until they accept the ""it's so crazy it might just work"" ideas of the Chief Engineer. These back stories feel very forced and detract from the true drama of the rescue itself.The film tells a good story, but not always in a good way. Worth watching once, but not a film to keep coming back to.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Way better than I expected,"For some reason I saw reviews for this one that were not that favourable. I am not sure why people didn't like it.

You definitely get a sense of what the characters are going through and are rooting for them.I think this was based on a trued story, not sure how historically accurate it is but the setting in the 50's is really well done.

A Poorly Made Film About a Great Story,"I was so looking forward to watching this movie. I'd heard the comments about all the nominations for awards and so it has been on my most wanted list.Chris Pine is one of my favourite (English/Australian spelling) actors, as is Casey Affleck, and that big Scot, Graham McTavish, what a real let down from Game of Thrones and Outlander for him.It was such a shame to see so many great performers being undervalued by lousy direction. Every element for a terrific suspense filled drama was there waiting for the right direction and timing. Instead we got left with all the high drama being dawdled up to and then let slide down the other side with a whimper. Even the music score was no help. Chris Pine looked like he just wanted to sleep and I can understand that it probably was his frustration with the director. He had next-to-nothing to do. Into The Storm this wasn't, but it could have been and maybe even better. Too bad, so sad.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A very good movie... but with Disney's stigma,"It's really a shame that good movies like this one, and based on true events, are not received as is deserve. This is a good movie, great scenes in the sea, emotion, suspense, and with a love story very well embedded, like Titanic did it, even when this time it is not the center of the story (for good). And even more amazing, is that the real story has enough heroism... all of us know that sometimes scripts are adjusted for the big screen (sometimes to dramatize more than the necessary).But the main problem is the stigma of being a Disney movie. Disney has accustomed the moviegoers to sea monsters or a funny guy like Sparrow, walking like he was drunk in the crucial moments (unfortunately, for a lot of people, that is a generalized idea when they listen Disney... sometimes bad movies without any kind of message, and just for kids).But no, Disney has confirmed, and most recently, that they know how to make good movies, and not just movies like ""Frozen""; don't get me wrong, Frozen is an excellent movie (I really liked), but is a very different movie. In fact, my disappointment is that ""The Finest Hours"" reminds me of course with a totally different plot, another great movie of Disney which bet to originality, and which unfortunately was not appreciated as had to be: Tomorrowland... a gem very underrated (in fact, I think until now, Tomorrowland is the best Disney movie outside the animated jewels that they posses, because the originality of their story and its message).Maybe they need a new brand for the promotion of really good movies like this one, or another kind of publicity, or a different approach to the audience, because the Disney brand is resulting a bad reference for the promotion of some of their greatest films.My final thought is: If you like an adventure movie and with the human touch, you must watch this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"Extremely predictable, old fashioned Disney filmmaking.","'THE FINEST HOURS': Three Stars (Out of Five)Disney's new historical disaster flick, directed by Craig Gillespie; who also helmed Disney's 'MILLION DOLLAR ARM', as well as 'LARS AND THE REAL GIRL' (which is outstanding) and the 2011 'FRIGHT NIGHT' remake! The film was written by Eric Johnson, Scott Silver and Paul Tamasy; and it's based on the 2009 book 'THE FINEST HOURS: THE TRUE STORY OF THE U.S. COAST GUARD'S MOST DARING SEA RESCUE', by Michael J. Tougias and Casey Sherman. It tells the story of four Coast Guard members, who daringly faced one of the worst storms in East Coast history; to rescue the crew of a sinking oil tanker. The movie stars Chris Pine, Casey Affleck, Ben Foster, Holliday Grainger, Eric Bana, Kyle Gallner and John Ortiz. It's classic, and extremely predictable, old fashioned Disney filmmaking.The movie is part disaster flick, and part corny romance film. It focuses on Bernard 'Bernie' Webber (Pine); a crewman for the Coast Guard, stationed at Cape Cod. He falls in love with a young woman there, named Miriam Pentinen (Grainger). She proposes to him, and while Bernie is asking his commanding officer, Daniel Cuff (Bana), for permission to marry Miriam (which was custom then); one of the worst storms, in East Coast history, hits the area. Bernie then volunteers, to lead a four man team to rescue the crew of a sinking oil tanker (the SS Pendleton).The film is cheesy, and just like dozens of other movies, that came before it; but most of those came out dozens of years ago (with the exception of 2000's 'THE PERFECT STROM'). It definitely has a classic, old movie feel to it; and Gillespie's direction is very fitting. The film has a few good inspiring moments; but for the most part it's corny, too long, and dull. The effects are good, but the acting is bad (especially Pine in the lead). It should please it's target audience though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/b_aLk3J5gh4",6.0,Anonymous,History
Based on a true story in all its terrifying detail,"The Finest Hours is a Walt Disney film that is filled with much determination that captivates your mind on a realistic approach of being in the ocean on a boat wondering if you will survive. This moved me because you have to be a thinker, organizer and strategist in order to achieve the obstacles that you will be encountering. I really loved this movie because it is in 3D which makes everything appear to be coming right at you and you feel like you are a part of the film, especially during the ocean scenes. This film is based on a true story and it is filled with action, drama and history. The director, Craig Gillespie draws you into this film by his realistic portrayal of events.One of the worst storms to ever hit the East Coast struck New England in February 1952. It damaged an oil tanker off the coast of Cape Cod and literally ripped it in half. On a small lifeboat faced with frigid temperatures and 70-foot high waves, four members, Bernie Weber (Chris Pine), Ben Foster (Richard Livesey), Andy Fitzgerald (Kyle Gallner) and Ervin Maske (John Magaro) of the Coast Guard set out to rescue the more than 30 stranded sailors trapped aboard the rapidly-sinking vessel. The captain gives the orders and sends them out to accomplish the goal.My favorite part of this movie is when Bernie Weber and his fellow crew members set out to find the people on the sinking ship. They lose connection with the captain and also lose their compass. The crew members want Bernie to turn back around, but he says, ""no point"". Bernie just keeps on going to see if he can find any type of vessel. He becomes obstinate and passionate about his Coast Guard duty.The setting is a 1950s snowy and cold day with distinguished vintage cars the town people drive. The women's dress is classy and stylish and they definitely make a statement upon arrival to any event. I recommend this film for ages 12 to 18 and I give it 5 out of 5 Stars because it is action-packed with some romance and tense moments. Younger audiences may not understand and might be scared.

Absolutely Terrible,"What a waste of film. Not only is this a terrible movie, but it's an insult to the actual event. I wondered, as I watched this, did the screenplay writers even bother to read the book? It's filled with so many factual errors (wrong type of engine room for one), that my entire review could be just about that. And let's talk about Webber, the coxwain, taking off his life jacket! No Coastie would ever do something so stupid. EVER. Let's add in an unnecessary love story that simply drags the movie down. Did the idiots at Disney think women wouldn't go see a movie about one of the greatest rescues in history if there wasn't a love story in it? This movie is just a poor effort, and I'm not surprised at all that it bombed at the movies.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Not Bad for a January Release,"The Finest Hours is one of those unfortunate titles that is forgotten as soon as you hear it. Whenever someone asked me what I was going to watch, all I could say was it was the Coast Guard movie. This is no reflection on the story but more a reflection on Disney's quixotic handling of this mid-January release. Movie after movie this year and last featured a trailer of The Finest Hours. Casey Affleck heroically keeps half a ship afloat while Chris Pine utters the manta ""Coast Guard says you gotta go out, they don't tell you you gotta come back"" in a thick Bostonian brogue.Chris Pine plays Bernie Webber, a Coast Guard crewman who defines his decisions on the rule book as if it were a crutch. He even insists that before he marry his sweetheart Miriam (Grainger), he ask his superior officer as per Coast Guard regulation (though really just a formality). As a large winter storm approaches his corner of Cape Cod, not one but two oil tankers miles off the coast are split in half by the waves. The SS Mercer was able to send out a distress call and tie up Coast Guard resources while the SS Pendleton remained nearly invisible save a radar blip. Ship Engineer of the Pendleton Ray Sybert (Affleck) makes a desperate gambit to save the crew by constructing a rudder and running the aft of the ship on a shoal to slow them from sinking just long enough to get noticed and rescued.The concept for a movie of this kind would sound ridiculous if it weren't true. In 1952, two tankers were indeed split in half and after the main crew left Chatham Station for one, a second crew was alerted to the Pendleton and braved the dangerous coastal banks to reach them in a tiny CG36500 lifeboat. The script based on a novel by Casey Sherman and Michael J. Tougias is so old-fashioned, it immediately brings to mind the sea adventures in Captain Horatio Hornblower R.N. (1951) or Sea Wife (1957). What sets The Finest Hours apart are the modernized special-effects and Craig Gillispie's dynamic direction.The Finest Hours is far from perfect. The movie takes it's time to develop the relationship between Webber and heartthrob Miriam who does very little but delve into histrionics. It's a shame too because Grainger is an absolute vision who typifies the 1950's model of beauty and womanhood. Every scene she was in was certainly distracting from the story but for once I didn't much care. There's also something clearly wrong with the station's Commander Daniel Cluff (Bana). It's never clear how the audience should feel; is he closer to the vein of Captain Queeg in The Caine Mutiny (1954) or is he just an outsider trying to do his best given the situation? Also there's Disney's insistence that 3D is the way to go; yeah not so much. This is a movie whose main set-piece is a nocturnal nautical rescue thus wearing 3D glasses makes everything too dark to appreciate.The scenes involving the Coast Guard lifeboat trudging through open ocean are the most riveting, barely surpassing the Pendleton's attempts to run aground via game of telephone. Throughout the movie people spout a torrent of nautical terms which appeared to go over the heads of audience members, yet what was clear were the stakes and the results of such a daring rescue. People will no doubt compare this film with The Perfect Storm (2000) which apart from it also taking place in the Northeastern United States, only makes sense as far as critical reaction.I for one enjoyed this film, which is competently made, has some show-stopping, hair-raising scenes of seafaring mayhem and had some great low-key performances by Pine, Affleck and Grainger. Disney definitely crippled this film by giving it an instantly forgettable title and shoving 3D and IMAX 3D in our faces. It's a real shame too because the added disadvantage of having a January release and lukewarm reviews by critics all but guarantees this story will ever get the audience it deserves.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"The Finest Hours is good thrilling adventure movie with good VFX ,engaging screenplay and decent performances","The Finest Hours (2016): Personally I feel that movies which involves any natural disasters are truly chilling ones because it always makes us to imagine ourselves in their positions.The Finest Hours in one such movie which is based on true events which involves a daring heroic act.Plot: In 1950, in Cape Cod in Massachusetts, the US Coast Guard station in Chatham receives a distress signal from the oil tankers SS Pendleton and SS Fort Mercer. Commander Daniel Cluff assigns the crew formed by Bernie Webber, Richard Livesey, Andy Fitzgerald and Ervin Maske to rescue the crew of the SS Pendleton in a small rescue boat. Cluff is warned about the intensity of the storm by Bernie and also by his girlfriend Miriam but he keeps the order. Meanwhile the SS Pendleton has broken and lost his forward part and his skilled and experienced engineer Ray Sybert assumes the command of the survivors. He uses his abilities to steer the stern in a safer position, grounding it on an unstable bank of sand to avoid sinking.Plus Points:1)Screenplay: Rescue operation movies mostly involves same type of screenplay but the way it builds up thrill plays the major role.The Finest Hours has engaging screenplay which is entertaining at its best.There is no dull moment in the movie and its mostly racy.2)VFX: VFX plays a key role in these type of movies because showcasing a historical natural disasters is not an easy work.The Finest Hours crew has gave their best output and it really helped a lot.The gigantic waves and the rescue operation in the storm are showcased very well.3)Performances: All the actors gave good performances.Chris Pine,Ben Foster,Kyle gave brilliant performances.Minus Points:1)Misses Logic in few scenes: Few scenes have missed logic which is not convincing.In movie they show that all four of our heroic crew crosses dangerous bar with gigantic waves without even getting strapped to anything on their boat.How can it even possible???So The Finest Hours is good thrilling adventure movie with good VFX ,engaging screenplay and decent performances.My rating 7.25/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
A fine hour and a half.,"I like the story.Was not sure if Chris Pine could pull it off with the accent but he does a really good job.Like the character of Miriam Webber, she was worth seeing. The story of Bernie and Miriam made for a good fill in to the story about the coast guard.The visual effects are not as impressive as I thought they would be considering the mock up for 3d. I felt that the effects were a little distracting more than they helped the story arch.I did like the the sets. The peaceful town covered in snow was a great effect that went with the storm at sea.The ship's did look big and made for a lot of suspense, and watching the coast guard try to get over the giant waves of CGI waters was appealing to see. It was definitely an exciting an encouraging rescue made more dramatic by the music.It's on home viewing mediums now and I would suggest you see for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Test your sea legs until it runs out of steam.,"Starts its engines slow but is a hell of a ride once she's fired up and gets going. Obviously the studio was bent on spending its budget to create a cinema experience so immersive that frankly, it feels like I'm still seeing waves on the screen as I'm typing out this review.A tale based on a real life coastal rescue, the 50's world has been beautifully restored and provides warmth as bleak coastal towns withstand the storm. It's the kind of a movie that takes you on a ride however, the characters only have a hand in holding the tiller but not the way the direction of the current is headed.Bernie's case for example, he goes through some serious stress emotionally and physically but gets extremely lucky once already but when the ultimatum of making his return journey uses the same formula, you can't help but notice that the studio just ran out of steam by this point to be able to offer a proper closure as to the whole of the journey we've just witnessed. Who could possibly blame them though, when the sailors are no longer in danger and it's over surely we can pat ourselves on the back and head on home. I wish it is as simple as that. and in a way it is, as the movie offers nothing left to be picked up from it the experience. Queue obligatory cuts of factual photos, which falls way short in terms of doing any justice to honour the man, and what we must take home is a mild nausea and the eerie feeling that someone high up in the studio was playing God because we are thankful to be back but not for its providence.A highly enjoyable movie whose fuel is all but burnt on that big ride out that the journey back seems to never have surfaced in the thoughts of the producers. Had it not been based on a true story we may have never come back.For those that want more intrigue than build ups, I also recommend The Deep (2012), about a fisherman to incredibly have survived a shipwreck in freezing cold waters.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Then I saw 'the guardian' for the first time and realized what it was-there's no attachment to anyone in this film. There was no character development at all, they throw you right into the action and that's it. I wanted to watch this movie in theaters for the big screen epic effect but it's unnecessary when the story doesn't work.

Didn't Deserve to Tank at the Box Office!,"Have to admit I hadn't heard of this film till recently, probably because it was apparently such a commercial flop. More's the pity, as it tells a wonderfully engrossing and thrilling true life marine rescue on two levels; as seen from the rescued on the stricken SS Pendleton and their Coast Guard would - be rescuers.Touted as being the story of the Coast Guard's greatest small boat rescue, it just seems a shame that such a fine film wasn't seen by a larger audience. Movies set on water seem to frequently have as high a disaster rate, as do the subjects with which they frequently deal (Water World, In the Heart of the Sea, Cutthroat Island etc.) and this seems to have suffered much the same fate.The Finest Hours features a great cast with Chris Pine and Casey Affleck both outstanding, playing similarly shy, somewhat introverted leadership roles; the former as a junior Coast Guard officer asked to mount a small-scale rescue attempt and the latter as the doomed ship's chief engineer, improvising desperately to keep the mortally damaged tanker afloat as long as possible to afford a chance of rescue for the surviving crew members.I really liked the highlighting of Holliday Grainger's Miriam. Though she was arguably perhaps fictionalised more than some of the other characters, in creating this strong onshore female, a powerful emotional core of the film was established. On the flip side of this, Eric Bana did his best in a fairly thankless role as the Coast Guard commander Daniel Cluff. Even just a brief perusal of his Wikipedia entry, indicates that he wasn't the self-doubting, inexperienced head of operations, we see in the film, created no doubt to provide an idealistic counterpoint to Chris Pine's almost laconically casual, Bernie Webber. In addition to this, Ben Foster stands out in a supporting role, where though having few lines of dialogue to speak, he imposes himself indelibly through a terrific range of facial expressions, glances and general body language.Unlike a vehicle such as The Perfect Storm where one felt at times the special effects weighed down the (somewhat, slight) story being told, no such claim should be made about this movie. It achieves a very comfortable balance of CGI enhanced action, which never threatens to comparatively diminish the true elements of a remarkable story some 66 years old, that this film succeeds in recognising.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Amazing,"""Everest"" takes audiences on a breathtaking and perilous ascent to the top of the world, with a strong ensemble cast including Jason Clarke and Jake Gyllenhaal. The acting delivers the emotional weight of the harrowing journey, portraying the resilience and vulnerability of those facing the unforgiving mountain. The film editing masterfully captures the intensity of the climb, creating a visceral experience that immerses viewers in the daunting challenges faced by the climbers. The strength of the movie lies in its stunning cinematography, showcasing the awe-inspiring beauty and treacherous conditions of the Himalayas. However, the weakness surfaces in moments where character development may take a backseat to the spectacle. The music complements the film's emotional beats, enhancing the impact of both triumphs and tragedies. With a 6/10 rating, ""Everest"" stands as a visually striking and immersive adventure, even if it doesn't delve as deeply into the personal stories as some may desire.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Inspiring movie and FAMILY friendly!,"I was surprised Walt Disney still produced a quality movie. Our whole family enjoyed it. We especially liked the fact that it was based on a true story. Folks kept their clothes and and every other word wasn't F this and F that. Self reliance and individuality was stressed instead of this over sensitivity and relying on group think. What some may not like is the respect shown towards rules and knowing when to over rule the rules. Gender roles are clear and defined i.e. women are women and men are men. Gasp,they even allowed praying in those days! It's the America we need to get back to in stead of this third world anything goes mentality. If you were not aware of the plot, you really couldn't predict the ending. There was suspense and the special effects were pretty good. It was very enjoyable. Thank you Disney! Produce more like this and we'll come back to being Disney fans.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Courageous story, boring film","I was drawn to this film by the a-list actors and the many underrated actors. The acting was perfectly fine. To be honest it was nice watching Chris Pine play a character who was basically opposite all his usual roles. Ben Foster is always something different and always great to watch. But the acting couldn't hold my attention alone.. The film runs one hour and fifty-seven minutes. Truly with all the drawn out scenes on reactions and moments of silence, they could cut out like thirty minutes of the entire film. I don't need a main stream film with a bunch of dumb action but with the lack of dialog in many moments that they try and make dramatic by long silences, I can't. I couldn't keep my attention on the film and I'm not one to text or use any other device but I still spaced out. The story is really cool only because it's true. But this is why most films based on real life are fibbed a little bit to make them more entertaining for the audience. Truly, I don't think they would need to do that but just trim and edit a lot out. All in all it's not exactly fair that I didn't like the film because of the pacing and editing but I just didn't like it and that's the fact.",6.0,Anonymous,History
certainly not the Finest movie,"So I was very excited for the movie after seeing the trailer, knowing it was Disney and the cast was great. But then I saw the movie and I was very disappointed. I think mainly because the trailer spoiled a lot of things for me and was somewhat misleading. So do yourself a favor, if you haven't seen the trailer yet, watch the movie without watching the trailer because it might be a better experience.Anyway I want to start saying what I did like about this movie and why it's above average. The movie is about the coastguard saving people in a ship that is torn in half on the sea so whenever they're on the sea, the scenes are great. There is a good build up to the scenes and the look of it is very good. Disney continues to show they can do great live action movies with intense scene.Also the actors act well, for what source material they've been given, the acting is good. Especially Eric Bana and Casey Affleck played their roles very well and I liked seeing them in this movie.Also the movie is based on a true story and I think they showed it well. I didn't know the story behind it but after seeing it, I cared for it more so I think they translated it well.But then we have a list of things I don't like, first off the character development. When the movie starts it tries to give a back story to the main characters but they rush it and I couldn't care too much about them. I honestly believe they could've spent a little more time on setting up the characters so that we could care more about them.Then what I found annoying is that it tries to be funny but it isn't. I know when a movie tries to be funny but when the entire audience in my theater doesn't laugh at all during the entire movie, it's not funny. So I hated that the movie tries to be funny but isn't.But my biggest complaint about the movie is that I was bored a lot during the movie. I think they could've cut about 20-30 minutes out of it and it wouldn't hurt the story or anything. When a movie loses my interest and I actually go to the bathroom because I won't miss a thing, I don't like it. I also found the movie very predictable, everything happening I saw coming before it happened. I guessed the end before the halfway mark which I hated.So that is what I think about the Finest Hours, I didn't like watching it but when I thought about it afterwards it wasn't as bad as I initially thought so that's why I gave it 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,History
The movie does a disservice to the real story,"Good /OK movie that should have been amazing. Given the extremely talented cast and the almost unbelievable but real story of the rescue, this movie should have soared. The intro was super slow and the portrayal of Bernie Webber as an almost mute pushover misses. His fiance was home sick during the rescue in reality, she wasn't out being a Girl Boss. Not sure why having lead actors say almost nothing was so en vogue in the mid 2000s to mid 2010s, but it makes these movies almost unwatchable despite great casts and stories. Not sure if that is on writers, producers or directors but I am glad it has phased out. I hope someone does another movie about the rescue of the Pendleton and the Mercer some day with a focus on the storms, the reasons the ships broke apart due to the dirty steel used to build them, and the men who were on them.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Impressive special effects save this historical disaster flick from it's shortcomings,"From Walt Disney studios comes not children's movie based on a classic fairy tale or a classic source material the general Disney fanatic families have often been accustom to, but an intense wild ride of a biographical adventure illustrating the bravery and struggles of the U.S Coast Guard when they embarked on a treacherous journey to save a team of oil tankers who's ship faced demolition during the nasty winter storm that rolled through the Atlantic. This mission took place back in February 1952 during the Cold War era, and for many decades, has been called ""one of the greatest rescue missions in the history of the U.S Coast Guard"". Director Craig Gillipse, the man behind the remake of 'Fright Night' and 'Million Dollar Arm' offers an intense inside look in the events that took place that fateful day, but certainly not without a small of shortcomings in the narrative and overall direction. But in the end, the film makes an enormous ride that is more forgiving than flawed. The film opens up in 1951 when U.S Coast Guarder Bernie Webber (played by Chris Pine) meets the Miriam (played by Holliday Grainger), the girl of his dreams and starts a heart- warming relationship with. A few months pass by and Webber has proposed to marry Miriam, but is soon called back to the Coast Guard when a massive winter storm rolls through the Atlantic causing an oil ship SS Pendleton manned by Captain Ray Sybert (played by Casey Affleck) to split in half. With their ship sinking and Sybert and his crew in stranded in the midst of the powerful storm, Webber and his crew members Andrew Fitzgerald (played by Kyle Gallner), Erin Maske (played by John Maguro), and Seaman Richars Livesey (played by Ben Foster) are ordered by Commander Daniel Kloff (played by Eric Bana) to set out on their small boat through the stormy Altantic Ocean and save the crew of oil tankers.Sitting through this 116-minute disaster flick, it is quite easy to feel constantly reminiscent of 'The Perfect Storm' another disaster film based on the true story. From the terrifying storm sequences and the story of 'men versus nature', these films certainly feel awfully similar. This one however, goes for a more uplifting and less dark approach as it is Disney behind the development. That is not say that Disney hasn't been subject to a few somber projects however, as this film does center on a story that ended in tragedy as well as triumph; and it does a pleasant but flawed job of capturing the intensity of the fateful rescue mission. From the opening minutes of the violent winter storm, audiences are subject to terrifying sequences of Chris Pine and his crew as they battle through the fierce atrocities of the storm including 70-foot waves, and the fate of Casey Affleck and his crew as they are stranded abound the SS Pendleton that is less than a few hours from sinking to the bottom of the ocean. These scenes come to life through some dazzling special effects and impressive CGI, making for some nice and terrifying scenery; though it is a bit boggling how these characters manage to get soaked underwater during a winter storm and not show any signs of hypothermia. The special effects are the major appeal that save the film from it's writing occasionally messy writing. While the film succeeds in the level of intensity and emotional resonance, it more often than not tends to be all over the place in the narrative place, mainly as the main story centering on the rescue of the sinking SS Pendleton is constantly intertwined with a subplot of the main character's wife and the tumultuous relationship with the Coast Guard officers, as well as the struggle of Casey Affleck and his crew in the aftermath of their demolished ship. Compared to the main plot, this latter subplot is weakly executed and serves more as a distraction to the story. On the bright side, we are gladly provided with some great performances with a great cast including Chris Pine, Casey Affleck, Holliday Grainger, John Maguro, and Ben Foster. Eric Bana also does a terrific job, though he tends to struggle his southern accent in a few scenes.The Finest Hours may not rise to the level of it's true ambitions, but it is a tense, uplifting disaster adventure that will please movie goers just enough surprises to distract from at least some its shortcomings. While this movie may not maintain the same quality status as 'The Perfect Storm' (which is somewhat underrated), it is at least worth a try but perhaps not for everyone.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Astonishingly, there is absolutely zero sense of urgency about anything. None of the characters seems particularly invested in the outcome, and no one's pulse seems to have increased even slightly. They all just seem bored and depressed.This is a very strange film! A non-action action movie; a non-dramatic drama; and oh yes, there's even a non-romantic romance element in there too.

"A Fine Movie, but Not Unique Enough","The Finest Hours, yet another heroic tale about individuals who defy the limits of nature to pull off miracles. Disney certainly enjoys capitalizing on these tales in the early seasons don't they? Chis Pine leads the cast in this story about a small band of coast guards ordered to brave a massive storm to rescue a crew onboard a capsizing tanker. Can this inspirational drama stand out from the sea of other similar tales, or has Disney just pumped out another feat of mediocrity in an effort to obtain money? Let's analyze shall we?When it comes to a drama like this an engaging tale is required as the backbone of the movie. Fortunately the Finest Hours manages to accomplish this by taking a straightforward plot and presenting it in fantastic way. The film follows the whole incident from three different perspectives that intertwine across the full two hours. This dynamic approach gave you the full picture and continued to spice things up as they illustrated the dangers faced on all fronts. As such, there is sure to be some part of the tale that audiences will enjoy that will bait your attention in this straightforward tale. Unfortunately, the tale is very predictable and lacked suspense for me, especially knowing the outcome thanks to the trailers with only the ambiguity of who would survive the ordeal. At least the love component is not to mushy to become cheesy and annoying so that's an added benefit.Let's jump to the acting now. Chris Pine grabs the part by the horns and takes it full throttle. His portrayal of Bernie Webber was a nice balance between bravery and hesitation as he tackles the challenges before him. While his accent is funny to hear at first, it eventually grows on you and adds some endearment to the character. Holliday Grainger's portrayal of Miriam was okay, a nice portrayal of a strong, brave woman whose verbal and non-verbal acting brought the courageous nature of this woman to life. However, the trailers made her out to be more involved with the process and I was disappointed with her limited interactions in the film. But best actor in this film goes to Casey Affleck, who played the deepest role of the bunch as the chief engineer. The emotions to which he had to balance were challenging, but I feel Affleck kept the character grounded and realistic on all fronts, thereby making his feats all the more impressive. All the other actors hit their mark well, but there are too many to cast in such a short amount of space.Perhaps the strongest quality of the movie though is the cinematic magic and special effects that brought the true suspense. The Finest Hours' computer animation is on point, with the deadly snow storm brought to life with high-definition details and incredible sound editing. I was brought into the storm, feeling the misery and despair the foreboding nor'easter brought to our sailors as the fury of the sea was unleashed. In the belly of the tanker, the chaos of sinking ship was brilliantly recreated that didn't involve the over use of pyrotechnics and explosions (take a hint Michael Bay). Special effects aside the cinematography was a key aspect in bringing the emotions to the scenes. Our cast of characters do a nice job delivering their lines, but it's the nonverbal acting that really delivers the punch. The camera-work is stable through and through (again pay attention Bay) and captures all the detail despite the aggressive winds and waves. And the symphony soundtrack only adds an extra kick to subtly make the scenes complete.The Finest Hours is certainly not the most original, or unique movie from Disney's collective vault. However, while it is not the most entertaining tale, it does highlight the important qualities of faith, duty, honor, and a slew of other morals that people harp on. The visual effects of this studio are certainly the highlight of this movie, which may be further enhanced by a 3-D showing. Overall, I'm satisfied with the work Disney studios did and feel this a movie most will enjoy.My recommendations for audience members who will like it are: older generations from that time period, fans of inspirational tales, and those who appreciate good cinema magic. I also believe this movie is worth a trip to the theater, thanks to the cinematic qualities.My scores overall:Action/Drama/History: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0",7.0,Anonymous,History

A bit too predictable for its own good,"""The Finest Hours"" is in some ways one of the most unusual movies to be released by the Disney studio under its Disney brand. That's because the movie seems to be more aimed at adults rather than family audiences. Certainly, the movie is free of foul language, real violence, and sexual material. But virtually all the characters are adults, and the story itself is a pretty sober one without any real gimmicks. While those fact make the movie interesting at first, eventually some flaws start to come in. Though based on a true story, the scripted events that happen from start to finish come across as pretty predictable. And under the direction of Craig Gillespie, you don't really get the feeling that the characters are in serious danger; the peril instead comes across as somewhat soft.

I wouldn't say it is the finest hours,"The Finest Hours is just plainly put, serviceable, albeit in an old-fashioned way. There are some exhilarating sequences of problem solving and rescuing on the deep sea, but they quickly fizzle off and become a melodramatic lull; it feels more comfortable being there. This being a Disney movie and all, hard and gritty is not the tone it is going for, which means just like the sailors and rescuers we will be chest-deep in sweet syrup in the end. I didn't mind that so much. It just feels like a missed opportunity to be something different.

Great Motion Picture with Hilarious Regional Accents,"As a New Englander I'm probably more sensitive to regional accents than others, but this movie had me rolling in the aisles laughing. It seems like only one quarter of the cast got their accents right and the rest of them fumbled through, sounding like a mix between Valley Girl and Goodfellas. It's too bad, because I really enjoyed the movie. It has everything an action movie should have: sappy love interest, tension, drama, and enormous scary stuff. But the spoken lines put this production on a whole new level of disaster movie.I think they gave up on letting the Australian actor Eric Bana try to emulate a Down East dialect and switched him over to a southern accent, with amazingly dismal results. When he's not drawling the wrong word endings, he's reverting back to an Aussie outback bush bogan or something. I guess it all has to do with how an actor is able to interpret a character, but his performance is positively schizophrenic.What is especially disconcerting is when an actor or actress nails the accent right on, as Rachel Brosnahan does in her role of Bea Hansen. It becomes quite obvious which members of the cast spent some time learning to pronounce their lines and which of them decided to mumble their way through the parts they couldn't get right. This is a perfect example of the current derailed Hollywood machine; over budget, zero schedule and maximum apathy. It's too bad because this is a great motion picture, best viewed with subtitles.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Good, but next time hold the cheese","In the winter of 1952, the SS Pendleton oil tanker found itself disabled and sinking during a severe nor'easter blizzard. A single vessel was able to save dozens of crew-members in what is still the Coast Guard's single greatest small boat rescue to date. This is their story.Chris Pine plays Bernie Webber, a by-the-book Coast Guard captain with a need to prove himself, especially to some locals who blame him for a failed rescue a year earlier. But the real star of the film is Casey Affleck, the engineer of the Pendleton, who is forced to take command and engages in more and more audacious and creative methods to keep his crew alive long enough to be rescued.The film suffers from some unevenness, mostly from trying to tell two simultaneous stories, and also trying to shoehorn in some added drama via a romantic relationship between Pine and Holliday Grainger, which leads to incredibly flat and disappointing denouement in the final ten minutes. Excuse me, garçon, I did not order this film with extra cheese.There's a somewhat deflated sense of stakes as well, as we know from the title and premise that the rescue attempt is ultimately successful. But it's the journey, not the destination. The film also slyly continues to tell you how impossible the odds are, helping to increase the suspense as you wonder exactly how they're going to make this rescue happen.But when the film is on, it is on.As mentioned before, it all grinds to a screeching halt with an incredibly overwrought and cheesy ending. The human drama and true story was enough to keep the audience engaged. It needn't have been so trite and predictable.But overall, this a feel-good film from the people who know feel- good: Disney. And this is about the mildest PG-13 you've seen in a long while. For a movie about sailors, these boys all have squeaky- clean mouths.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,History

A Slow Methodical Action Thriller,"14 September 2016. This slower paced action thriller doesn't quite have the intensity as its similar predecessor as The Perfect Storm (2000). This mostly by the numbers action thriller has it all though, the girl, the struggle against the elements and yet for all the histrionics the movie isn't has dramatic or epic as Titanic (1997). Perhaps, its the difficulty of transferring the real life story onto the screen in a way that maintains the authentic story of what happened and at the same time include the dramatic flourishes. Maybe its just the unbelievability of the plot points. Or maybe because of the imbalance between not a lot going on at times and the crush of too many things going on at other times. The movie however does proceed point to point, including all the requisite emotions, good guys, bad guys, romance even while there is for some reason distance between the characters. Unlike actually experiencing the involvement in the movie, the audience is more of a passive spectator unswept by the action-thrillers being presented.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Amazing True Story,"Yup, Amazing, but I gave it an 8. I ONLY gave it an 8 because so much of it seemed a bit too Hollywood-ish. But hey, I'm not a film maker and a history buff, not a historian. But as I watched and thought now and then, ""Oh, REALLY?"" I still enjoyed the intensity. The slow start was a nice way to introduce a couple of the main characters, just a couple and funny enough they ARE a couple. Bernie and Miriam. But even they don't get too much in-depth coverage. But that's OK, it's not really about them, but it's enough to give you a bit of a reason to feel for someone besides everyone who risks their lives in this scenario.If you're reading this (and few will, I know) you already know the story, so we'll skip that. This is kind of an opinion forum/review. Here's mine.GOOD MOVIE. Like I mentioned, I saw some clichés, some 'Hollywood' moments that don't happen in real life and some silliness. I also saw a true story and as often happens with me, the full impact truly hits when photos of the actual folks are shown at the end. Holy Moly, that's the way to make a jaw drop. Then, I looked up the whole story and even by way of the United States Coast Guard's own website, the movie is far more accurate than I imagined. Little exaggeration here. We're talking life threatening, edge of your seat, nails chewed to the knuckle stuff and portrayed far better than I believed. OK, so Bernie and Miriam were actually married already, not engaged like in the movie, big deal. I'll cope.Chris Pine has truly impressed me. I liked him as Capt. Kirk more (smarmy, snarky and lovable) but here he takes on a real life person and does him justice. Miriam, played by Holliday (add an 'l' and it's now a name! Hippies. Sheesh) Grainger was sympathetic and believable, not fake. Casey Affleck gave a voice to a character that in real life seems to have been forgotten; a man who did as much to save the remaining crew of the Pendleton as anyone and did it wonderfully.The supporting cast, most especially Ben Foster and Kyle Gallner came through like champs. Everyone always remembers the MAIN guy, but hey, if the other guys weren't there, the main guy could NEVER accomplish what was done and these guys throw that in your face, but respectfully.I have always had enormous respect for the USCG and feel they are truly the overlooked heroes of our armed forces, especially in peacetime. This movie (as well as ""The Guardian"") is finally shining a much deserved spot light on them and in a respectful, professional and entertaining way.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"A truly great story executed poorly by wooden acting, dialogue and a dragging pace.","The finest hours is a film based off an incredible true story, But the film itself is not so incredible.Based off a daring coast guard rescue mission, The film tells the story of Bernie Webber {Chris Pine} who sets out to save a group of people on a sinking ship.The direction by Craig Gillespie fails to bring justice to the real life incident and the pace is just awful, The cast led by Chris Pine and Casey Affleck seem to be sleep walking through the film, The only things i liked about it was some of the effects and some of the score.The film poorly tells what happened in an ineffective way and i rather watch a documentary about what happened. 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,History

A very straight forward rescue tale.,"You might enjoy watching this movie if you are in the mood for an adventure/rescue movie with some romance set in a 1950's feel era.This is a very simple movie, you won't find any surprising plot twists, but it does a lot of things right. The acting is good. The cinematography, costumes, and setting are all interesting to look at. I'm always fascinated by stories of rogue waves and the power of the sea. Some of the open water scenes in this movie with massive waves are really exciting and probably the highlight of the movie.As another reviewer mentioned there are basically three different story lines that the movie bounces back and forth between. The romantic story line is definitely the weakest and the other two do not feel especially interwoven.Overall, I would recommend it as entertainment but would caution against any expectation of greatness.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Underrated,"This is a simple movie with simple objectives, and it nails them all. Sure, it's a bit of a fascist piece of (convincing) propaganda, but it's also a tense and personal true-life adventure film, that does for the coast guard and the ocean what Apollo 13 did for NASA and space.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Surprisingly good film without the usual A-listers,"Rather pleasant film with Chris Pine, Casey Affleck and Eric Bana. What starts as quite a slow, sweet an meandering romance quickly ramps up as the film rolls on. Pine plays a sweet, under confident young man (very well) who grows in stature as the film progresses. Amusingly, Pine's character follows the same process ... it's almost as if the parts were written for them to show their acting prowess and emerge as heroes. It's sometimes hard to praise a movie like this - it's probably not going to win any Oscars, but it's well worth watching - some very very tense moments are portrayed with exceptional realism and finesse.Don't pass this film up ...",7.0,Anonymous,History

Not a good movie,This is not a good movie. It's pretty long and boring. I only give it 2 points because of the special effects.

Wolfgang Petersen should have made this one,"I could not prevent myself to think about PERFECT STORM all along this movie. Another true historical drama speaking of sailors lost at sea.

Who cares about the broad and her feelings? And those sailors on the boat who, submerged by the gigantic waves, continue to wear their hats? Who could believe that? OK, I admit that during the last huge wave, one of them loses his hat...But only because the director Gillepsie did not want to make other takes without the hats, concerning the previous waves scenes...

Maybe it's just that fishermen and coast guards and all the rest, in that time and place, were stoic and fatalists.Holliday Grainger was quite annoying as the hero's girlfriend, and Chris Pine performance as somebody shy and insecure around women is simply unbelievable.

The production values are great, the score is great, but the film is really dark, there's many parts of the films where you cant really see anything, and this is made much worse by the 3D, which the film never really makes much use of it.There's great possibilities for grand action scenes, but they are just good, and there's never really a sense of suspense. The film feels rather straightforward.

An Imperfect Storm,"A cargo ship splits in two during a fierce North Atlantic storm, and the surviving crew clings to hope aboard the floating half, while a small Coast Guard boat sails from Cape Cod on a rescue mission. Based on a true event that took place in the early 1950's, ""The Finest Hours"" is at its best when the focus is at sea. However, viewers may initially think they wandered into the wrong theater; the first twenty minutes detail a sappy cute guy meets cute girl for a date; cute girl asks cute guy to marry her; cute girl frets about cute guy in danger. The shallow unconvincing scenes on dry land are set in a faux-1950's and should have been left on the cutting room floor, because this lame date-film wannabe makes ""The Perfect Storm"" look like a masterpiece.Chris Pine as the young rescuer, Bernie Webber, finds that navigating a small boat in a storm takes more skill and daring than piloting the Starship Enterprise. However, Pine's performance at sea is far more convincing than his underplayed romantic acting opposite Holliday Grainger, who plays his girlfriend. Grainger plays Miriam, the stereotypical 1950's woman; always immaculately made-up and coiffed in designer dresses, even during raging snow storms. Neither rain, nor snow, nor blistering wind can muss her well permed 'doo nor mar her porcelain make-up. The Miriam character is annoying throughout, and her repeated order to the Coast Guard commander, played by Eric Bana, to call back her boyfriend from danger sounds like the whine of a spoiled petulant teeny-bopper. Led by Casey Affleck, the crew aboard the sinking ship fare better than Pine and Grainger, although some appear too casual in the face of mortal danger.The scenes of the storm and the tossing cargo ship are often exciting as are those that depict the tiny rescue boat facing 70-foot waves. In contrast, the snow storm ashore looks more like a Norman Rockwell Christmas card than a threat. Perhaps ""The Finest Hours"" needed an experienced action director, a writer who could pen some decent dialog, and an editor to excise extraneous romantic scenes that add nothing to the action. The ingredients for a thrilling true-life rescue film were there, but some genius decided the studio needed a feel-good date film. ""The Finest Hours"" should find its audience on DVD, where viewers can fast forward through the romantic drivel and enjoy the exciting sea rescue.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"""You gotta go out. You don't gotta come back in.""","I had the honor of knowing the real Andy Fitzgerald during the last years of his life. He was a true Coastguardsman and I considered him (and his wife) true friends and neighbors.Andy (he preferred ""Fitzie"", like in the movie) always described that fateful night of the Pendleton Rescue as ""just another day on the job"". He was a modest, friendly and good natured fellow; but he certainly didn't remember all of the events of the disaster because it happened so long ago (almost 70 years ago now). He held Bernie Webber in high esteem and there was a twinkle of pride in his eyes and smile whenever someone first learned about the rescue and its history. I think there was some hidden trauma there, however, that Andy buried once he left the Coast Guard behind.I love this story- I read the book before seeing the movie and I think these men had such tremendous bravery and resolve in the face of insurmountable odds, a most turbulent and frigid ocean and facing almost certain death at every turn. Sure, there were some fictional segments to add to the drama and love story between Bernie and Miriam, but all told, the film stays true to the heart and character of the men who braved Chatham on the CG36500 in 1952. It was a historic, jaw dropping achievement.A solid 8/10 from me.

"Little development on characters, but it's definitely one tense ride!","Picture the setup of The Perfect Storm. The Finest Hours is dreadfully similar.

There's two of them too: the not-so-liked sea-man Casey Affleck who's stranded on a ship in Cape Cod with 31 other men, and awkward coastguard Chris Pine is one of four men braving the terrible storm. The main characters are under-developed, so caring for them is challenging. The high seas are crawl, constantly barraging our saviours with terrible waves. When Pine and his crew (which involves an underused Ben Foster) reach the Chatham bar, the tensity rises and the adrenaline starts pumping. But once it's over, you'll be wishing nature would rise up again, and boost the interest levels once again.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Two hours of a fine rescue drama but nothing new to see here.,"Based on the true story in 1952, The Finest Hours is about a US Coastguard station being deployed in an attempt to save a crew of an oil tanker that has split into two. The genre of biographical disaster movies is slowly becoming more saturated, particularly those with a serious perspective. The difference this time is that Disney has taken charge of the production which meant this film turned out to be an old-fashioned rescue drama that I thought was much needed. Firstly the cast was good, it was varied from veterans such as Eric Bana and Casey Affleck to more mainstream actors including Chris Pine and Ben Foster. Thankfully this film does not thrive of great performances, it is a visual story and director Craig Gillespie (Million Dollar Arm) knew this, hence the focus on great weather visuals and the destruction of the oil tanker. Pleasant effects but a few fully rendered human characters did not look great and did take away from the realism slightly. The story was very old-fashioned and I found that refreshing especially in 2016 where films try to be different for the sake of it. At the core, it's all about heroism and braving nature when the odds are against you, essentially human persistence and determination into saving other lives. The production design was great, the period setting of 1952 was well lifted. The beginning was standard character introductions, the middle was the rescue mission and the ending was the attempt at getting back in time. All of this being intertwined with a love story. That is where the problem lies, it is very mechanical and predictable. We have probably come to expect this from a Disney production but whilst I personally felt this was a good choice, some might be left wanting more. I mean it is nothing new, it's just a standard rescue story yet it's handled with such care that it is hard not to appreciate. The soundtrack was also well integrated, very traditional and reminded me of films from the 80's and 90's. The credits was a noteworthy part of the film in the fact that they show the photos of the crew and the coastguard station from 1952, definitely brings the additional realism that the film requires. Overall, The Finest Hours was a fine rescue drama with great visuals and a hearty story about heroism, although the old-fashioned pacing may leave viewers wanting more.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",7.0,Anonymous,History

Finest Heroes At Sea...,"The Finest Hours is a film that went to cinemas and received very little attention or promotion. Even when the words ""produced by Walt Disney"" were used, the film gained very little interest at the box office. Why? Is is because this a bad film? Or did the world just simply miss a great film of 2016? Well, the result is a mix bag.The Finest Hours is based on a true story of a disaster where 2 oil tankers were destroyed and broke in half, one half left floating at sea during a huge storm in the year 1952.The cast line up at first glance is nothing to be disappointed in. Cast member includes Chris Pine (Star Trek), Casey Affleck (Gone Baby Gone), Ben Foster (Lone Survivor) & Eric Bana (Munich)The film begins with an introduction to Bernie (Chris Pine), a coast guard member stationed in Chatham. Bernie sits in his car with his friend from the station and expresses the nerves that he has as he tries to build up the courage to meet someone who could be the girl of his dreams. It's very evident that Bernie struggles to be confident in himself and is introduced as a considerate gentlemen. After gathering the courage, Bernie walks inside a local cafe and meets Miriam (Holliday Grainger). Needless to say the two fall in love and after a short time agree to marry.Meanwhile, Ray (Casey Affleck) is on board an oil tanker during the heavy storm. After the tanker is cut in half due to the storm Ray is required to make a stand as the surviving senior officer and lead his remaining team members to survive as long as they can until rescuers arrive at sea.On this same night, Bernie's goal was to ask permission for marriage by his station's commander. Instead, Bernie's night changes forever when he is called to lead a small team on what could be classed as a complete suicide mission. Their mission: to rescue the remaining survivors on the oil tanker with the assistance of three other men during the intense weather. Because of Bernie's nature, he nods and accepts the mission with no questions asked (even if he thinks it could actually cost his own life!), even when the men around him know there is very little chance of him returning. The three men who join Bernie for the mission stand as volunteers.Chris Pine as Bernie is actually displaying one of his better role in his acting career. It was great to see this actor play a character who wasn't so charming and up himself (such as what we've seen in Star Trek or This Means War). Chris Pine is normally the same type of actor in most films. This was a great refresher and reminder that Chris Pine can take on more of a challenging and inspiring role. Even the smaller details of Chris Pine's acting, the way he walks and the way he hangs his head low are different than his norm. Chris Pine was the strongest part of this film.It was great to see so many key actors in this true story film, but, in my option, their full potential is simply not used. This is something that I suggest may have come from the overall direction and from the film's script. The film's strongest point is also located in the third act where everything was simply a build up. The film's title I feel is also not appealing to anyone and doesn't represent the film's tone. I'll also state that when the film arrived at the big screens, I don't recall seeing any posters or a film trailer to promote the film (Am I the only one here?).The Finest Hours does overall deliver a truely impacting story that will leave pleased that you took the time out to watch it. While the film doesn't warrant a repeat viewing, it's still a film that I would recommend and shouldn't be ignored.6.5/10

An Outstanding Film Combining Action with Human Drama,"If you are looking for a contemporary action movie with car chases, gun fights, and super heroes; this is not the film for you. Instead, it takes on the challenging task of capturing real-life people who do extraordinary tasks because they come with their job. Reality is always more powerful than fiction when it is captured with care, but we are not used to seeing this and unfortunately this film has therefore not met all reviewer's expectations. In part, this is a sad commentary on our times.The Finest Hours is about real people whose strength and courage come through but with honesty and subtlety. The film has a powerful love interest, but is nevertheless primarily about men ... unlikely heroes who rise to unimaginable challenges and subsequently return to worlds we can see in our neighbors. Visually it is a dramatic and technical masterpiece.Its original score is powerful but works with the unfolding events. There are no (as yet) big-name stars, but instead an ensemble cast that captures real lives and normal people. In short, it is a courageous movie about real people who despite their strengths and limitations do what must be done and emerge wiser and stronger for their accomplishment.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A film as easy to dismiss and forget as a wrong number,"While ""The Finest Hours"" is by no means the dreary, ostensibly never-ending mess that was last month's ""In the Heart of the Sea,"" it's by no means even close to matching the quality of ""The Perfect Storm,"" one of the best swashbuckling films of recent time. This is another by-the-numbers Disney film, that turns an incredible true story into a series of shortchanged and theatrical instances of peril that has numerous studio executives crossing their fingers, hoping it will somehow lumber its way to be a huge financial hit in a season when few films of more than average quality are out.If all of Disney's eggs are in ""The Finest Hours""'s basket, as I'm sure they aren't but just for the sake of argument, then it simply shows what this time of the year really does to Hollywood. There's nothing fundamentally nor glaringly wrong with ""The Finest Hours"" other than it's a painfully average, uninteresting slog that does so very little to assure any kind of practical methods were taken to really get to the heart of the helpless characters and those brave enough to embark on what seemed like nothing more than a suicide mission.The film revolves around Bernie Webber (Chris Pine), a member of the Coast Guard stationed in Massachusetts on Cape Cod. Bernie's duties are pretty laidback, until the same day he plans to ask his commander Daniel Cluff (Eric Bana) for permission to marry Miriam (Holliday Grainger), the girl of his dreams, he is ordered to guide a lifeboat and a small crew to rescue the S.S. Pendleton. The gigantic ship has just broken in half after getting caught in a violent nor'easter off the coast of Cape Cod, and Bernie and his three-men crew have to figure out a way to track down the ship and rescue as many or all of its thirty-two passengers.This is exactly the kind of remarkable story that we would be calling implausible had it not been based on a true story (same goes for films like ""Argo"" and even ""Trumbo""), and because of that, it's a film that was ostensibly going to be a bit alienating from the start. The reason being is that when you have a film telling this extraordinary of a story, if you don't make the film about the characters, or at least confine the setting and the focus where it appeals to basic human emotions and practices, such as connection and survival, it's going to feel cold and empty. ""The Finest Hours"" doesn't go for the survivalist route of ""All is Lost,"" showing its characters at their most helpless and hopeless, nor does it opt for spectacle as it revolves around two developed characters like in ""The Perfect Storm.""What's left for ""The Finest Hours"" to do is produce a simple, well-shot action film that does a good job at giving us a chronological timeline of the Coast Guard/Pendleton rescue back in 1952, but nothing else. There's no staying power thanks to thin characters, and there's few enticing or memorable action sequences because we're too often cutting back and forth between what is occurring on the water and Miriam's constant worrying over her husband (in yet another vague and almost entirely worthless female role), providing for desperately little continuity.The film was directed by Craig Gillespie, who seems to be one of Disney's go-to directors for basic live-action entertainment that makes caricatures out of characters and makes the factual seem like the overblown (Gillespie also directed ""Million Dollar Arm,"" another almost instantly forgettable film). In a month when films have ranged from the average to the barely tolerable, perhaps it would've been better for ""The Finest Hours"" to downright suck because it would've given me a better, more exciting review to write and a funnier, more relevant review for you, dear reader. Instead, I feel, much like a captain of a ship when all is going well, on auto-pilot as I reflect on a film that is about as easy to dismiss and forget as a wrong number.",4.0,Anonymous,History
"Disney feelgood shipwreck movie based on true story. Only flaw is its sugarcoated sentiment, but that makes it ideally suited for kids and family entertainment.","In this shipwredk film, the action was portrayed quite suspenseful, although some special effects were rather cheesy. But then again this film is defenitely targetted at families and kids, who wont be so critical if special effects dont seem true.Casey Affleck is a favorite actor of mine and he stands for quality just by his presence. I dont know any movies with him that I dont like. In this movie he again is the best actor, by a landslide. I still didnt expect much from a disney movie, but I got pleasantly surprised by the suspense of the story anyway.The only flaw of this movie is the fact that it is a bit too much sugarcoated. The story is about a shipwreck with men fearing for their lives, but it is fair to say that the director went for a smooth, nice looking feelgood picture, so there isnt much desperation or panic to be seen, because otherwise it couldnt be sold as a family picture anymore. Now young kids can watch this suspenseful film too, without getting too scared. There is also a budding romance interwoven into the story. Women/girls will love that, but being a guy I never care much for romances in action movies. Fortunately the budding romance scenes are not many.I wont wanna see this movie again, because now I know how the story ends, the suspense is gone. And the suspense is really the only thing that kept this movie afloat. It is an ideal family film though, which will be a thrill for young kids too.In the end I blame Disney for the sugarcoating of this movie and not the director.

A story reflecting the quiet dignity of real people facing challenging situations,"I just saw The Finest Hours for the third time in a week and I loved it even more the third time around.There are three stories inter-mixed; the townspeople, the tanker crew and the rescue team. In all three stories regular people faced challenges and ultimately tried to do what was right; people growing emotionally while we witnessed their trials. I do want to stress that in each story people came together after debating what to do and pulled together as a team. That is an inspiring message for today's world. We can have our differences but if we want to succeed we have to at some point make a decision as a team and take action. Look how well it turned out for all concerned in this very fine film.The music and sound effects were amazing. I really felt the roller coaster ride across the waves and the strength it took for those aboard the tanker to survive and the rescue crew to get over that bar.Chris Pine is more than a leading man; he is also a wonderful character actor. This was his most appealing role; he was both vulnerable and shy and I could read his every emotion in those astonishing blue eyes. He has the ability to completely morph into his roles.Chris is mesmerizing to watch but a lot of his roles are not particularly likable men and I've seen all of his movies.Eric Bana did seem miscast in his role.I just wish there was some back story on the girlfriend so we know why she was drawn to Bernie. The biggest mystery is why she wasn't at all cold without her coat during a February blizzard.I thought this story held up very well. The actors behaved how real people would in such trying circumstances (no super heroes or macho personalities). I found the rescue operation very exciting. I will see it again at my local movie house and will definitely buy it when it comes out on DVD.P.S.: I saw it in 2D all three times and am glad I did. I think 3D is often a distraction - paying more attention to the visuals than the story.",9.0,Anonymous,History

The Boring Hours,"I usually like most of the movies that I see in the theaters(even the low-rated ones),but in this movie something new happened to me,I slept for 10 minuets,something that never happened to me before. I believe that I got to this situation for two reasons.First,the plot wasn't been managed well.For example,the HYPE scenes where you actually thrilled are too short and involved with bad effects that makes you not comfortable and bored.Second,except Chris Pine and Holliday Grainger the acting was very bad and not convenience enough something that made feel not emotionally connected with the characters. Also,the dynamic between the actors didn't satisfied me.I truly don't understand why this movie is so well rated,it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen,almost no action,no intense or interesting plot.

Coast Guard rescue against what appear to be improbable odds,"The first half of this film was a little slow and I wondered if I had inadvertently walked into the wrong theater. Character development and the formation of relationships was obvious during the first 20 minutes; however, in my opinion, less time should have been devoted to the romancing and more to the backgrounds of the three other coast guard crewmen and the main characters who were rescued. In the second portion of this film Director Craig Gillespie demonstrates a talented affinity for placing the audience right in the vessel as it gets slammed by monster waves. Indeed, I was a bit dizzy by the time the end approached! In that sense, the feeling in the pit of one's stomach rivals and at time exceeds the sensations of reality experienced in such films as ""In The Heart of The Sea"" and ""Perfect Storm."" The contrast of the rescue scenes with the early part of the movie is sort of like two different movies that were spliced together, with the first part being rated a 6 and the second part a 10 for an overall score of 8. In any event, most people will be pleased that they went to see this movie and even be encouraged to face and to conquer the adverse ocean of monster waves in their own personal lives.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Review for The Finest Hours,"The movie The Finest Hours is based on the true event of the wreck of an oil tanker ship in the North East Atlantic ocean. The crew of the S.S. Pendleton lose communication and have no way of notifying anyone that they are sinking. Due to the heavy storm, most of the Coast Guard has been dispatched on other rescue missions and no one is looking for the Pendleton. It's by chance that the Coast Guard is made aware of the ship and only a four men set out on a small boat, in extreme weather and current conditions, to rescue the survivors.While there is a love story set up in the beginning, the best parts of the movie take place out at sea. There is some character development in Chris Pine's character, Boatswain Mate 1st Class Bernie Webber. Throughout the whole, movie they set up Webber to be a shy guy that always follows the rules and doesn't question his orders. There is little bits of information here and there about his past. In the end, Webber acts against his character in order to save over 20 lives and become a real hero.There is some solid acting in this movie from all of the performers. The accents from Pine and Eric Bana were not great but not distracting either. Ben Foster was practically unrecognizable, and Casey Affleck, who plays the Chief Engineer of the Pendleton, shows a lot of the strength and confliction within his character. Actress Holliday Grainger plays Pine's love interest and does a great job playing a strong 50's lady, who is not the typical housewife type of that time. Other supporting actors also bring strong performances and you often forget the period the movie takes place in.The visual effects in this movie are great. The shots of the boats out in the water going up against giant waves looked amazing. There were a few moments in the small boat that seemed unrealistic, but for the most part, everything on the water was done well. The grand scale of the oil tanker was a magnificent reveal. There is very good cinematography in this movie, even the snow storm on land had a great feel to it.There is not a lot of bad in this movie. The opening scenes could have been done a little bit quicker while still establishing the characters properly. There are a few edit choices where it cuts back from the action in the water to land, that feels a bit off. Perhaps that was on purpose to undercut the suspension, but it's not that bothersome. For the most part, the movie sets everything up well and explains to the audience what is really at stake between the two ships and the characters on them.It is amazing to think that this event ever took place, and it is nice to get a good solid Coast Guard based movie. It is like the last half of the Titanic meets The Perfect Storm, some might say it's probably not as good as those movies, but it is one of the better ship disaster movies and it being based on a true story gives it more credibility. Overall The Finest Hours is a very good movie, mostly family friendly. It has great action, suspense, and a decent love story. If you are looking for a well paced, entertaining film to enjoy, then this is a good recommendation.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Unrealistic to the point of laughable.,"This should have been a good film. There was an interesting and action packed tale that could have been told. Alas, it was not to be. It wasn't terrible but it could have been so much better. The romantic storyline with Holliday Grainger should have been a minor detail, not taken up a third of the film. Her character was so annoying and wimpy, you just wanted to give her a shake and tell her to shut up. What really killed it for me, though, was the lack of realism with a lot of the scenes at sea. For the most part, the coastguard boat was sailing along as if it was in smooth seas. Despite this being a massive storm, they hardly moved. As a sailor, this drove me nuts - even in moderate seas, boats move back and forward. And in storms, they move a lot. The crew of both vessels involved would have been getting thrown around not calmly staying upright. It wouldn't have been hard for the filmmakers to have made this a bit more believable. Save this one for a rainy day, when you've nothing better to watch.",4.0,Anonymous,History

Not as fine as you would expect from this cast,"""In the coast guard they say you go out, they don't say you gotta come back.""Director Craig Gillespie and Disney team up once again following their 2014 film, Million Dollar Arm. This time the true story is based on the 1952 Coast Guard rescue attempt at Cape Cod. The film counts with a stellar cast starting from the always charismatic Chris Pine, and including some strong supporting performances from the likes of Casey Affleck, Ben Foster, Eric Bana, Holliday Grainger, and John Magaro. The Finest Hours captures the fifties with delicacy while also remaining old school. The film is by the books and told in a way that most movies based on true events are, so it doesn't stand out. The effects are believable but they never accomplish much visually. There are some thrilling moments and the film slowly builds the tension during the final act, but it does take a bit too long setting the premise and trying to establish a love story that doesn't seem to be all that interesting or relevant.The Finest Hour begins by introducing us to the hero of the story who is about to go on his first date with the woman who will eventually become his fiancée. Chris Pine is Bernie Webber, a shy man who follows orders and likes to do things by the books, while Holliday Grainger is Miriam, a woman who is set on going after what she want. The love story lacks emotion and therefor it is the weakest link in the film. It is the reason why the first half of the film didn't work for me and why I wished the film focused more on the events taking place in the split oil tanker during the storm. Pine is playing against type here since his character is rather timid and that takes away a lot of his charm. I will give him credit for trying to play a different character, but I don't think he was the right choice for the part. Casey Affleck is the true standout, playing one of the crew members in the oil tanker fighting for their survival. He reminds us what a great actor he is and I wish the film focused more on his character. The rescue mission is exciting and thrilling, but the film takes too long to set itself up.Perhaps The Finest Hours is one of the better films being released in January since this is considered the dumping ground for most movies, but it still isn't good enough to get a fresh grade from me. The film has its moments and Casey Affleck should be getting bigger roles, but other than that the movie does fall flat and lacks the emotional depth other rescue films have. I'm usually a fan of Chris Pine, but I didn't enjoy his performance here and this is one of the few films from him that I haven't liked. If you are nostalgic for old-fashioned adventure films than this might be the right film for you, otherwise skip it.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Fascinating and Intense,"I found enough that was fascinating in it, both in the characters and the action - each scene gave my imagination time enough to roam and wonder. There were certainly gripping moments, both with the action and the emotional, and even the sweet romantic clichés worked as intended. Characters: They were period-fascinating, offering enough variety to engage one's wonder, and they were quite believable in character - I was taken back to those times in several ways. Action: Bring a winter coat - just watching the cold and frozen scenes will chill you to the bone. Story Line: They took a few liberties in order to place more focus on the main characters - I did not notice, but those who had read up on the story did, and it will be those people who will drag you to go see it. I don't regret going - it is the kind of movie that will define a region, time, and people for you (that you probably will never visit) for the rest of your life.",9.0,Anonymous,History
This film will give you and your family two of the finest hours you'll spend in a theater this year.,"Coasties get no respect. At least, not as much as soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines get. Even the word may sound derogatory to an outsider, but coastie is actually the most widely accepted term for Coast Guardsmen. Less complimentary terms include the ""Navy National Guard"", ""the Navy's little sister"" and ""puddle pirates"". See? No respect. Even though the roots of the U.S. Coast Guard go back to 1790 and its current missions make it as valuable in peacetime as in wartime, and its focus is jobs that none of the other armed services undertake regularly (if at all), few people know much about coasties. I blame the movies. There aren't very many Coast Guard movies out there. 2006's ""The Guardian"" is the only one I could think of before 2016's ""The Finest Hours"" (PG-13, 1:57), which really is an ""incredible true story""! In this film, Chris Pine takes a break from the bridge of the Starship Enterprise to captain a much smaller ship, but one in no less danger than his ship in the ""Star Trek"" movies. Pine plays Boatswain's Mate First Class Bernard Webber, stationed in Chatham, Massachusetts in the early 1950s. As a coastie, he's very capable, but meek. As a man, he's handsome, but shy. Nevertheless, Bernie rises to any occasion when presented with a challenge. He wins the heart of a pretty and assertive local girl named Miriam (Holliday Grainger) and soon they're engaged. On the day that Bernie plans to officially notify his commanding officer (Eric Bana) that he's getting married, he gets sent out into a nor'easter to rescue about three dozen merchant mariners whose ship was one of two disabled in this especially severe winter storm.The ship in question is the oil tanker, SS Pendleton. Due to a series of unfortunate events so bad that they'd make Lemony Snicket shudder, Ray Sybert (Casey Affleck), the Pendleton's engineer, ends up leading the efforts of the crew in trying to notify someone of the ship's location and keeping it afloat long enough for the men to be rescued. Ray has to contend with the ship's greatly diminished capabilities, the rising water inside the ship and the members of the crew who strongly disagree on the best course of action. Fortunately, Ray has on his side Seaman Wallace Quirey (John Ortiz), the ship's jovial and hulking cook (Abraham Benrubi) and an old salt named Frank Fauteux (Graham McTavish), but their loyalty only helps so much – especially in this weather! As the men on the Pendleton are fighting for survival, Bernie is fighting to get to them in time, and Miriam is doing what she can from the shore. Bernie can only find three other men to accompany him on what some openly call ""a suicide mission"". Without telling Miriam that he's going, he sets out with Seaman Richard Livesey (Ben Foster), Engineman Third Class Andrew Fitzgerald (Kyle Gallner) and Seaman Ervin Maske (John Magaro) on a motorized lifeboat meant to hold no more than 12 men. How these four men in this small boat are going to make it through this storm over a major sand bar, find the Pendleton and rescue up to 41 men are the serious problems facing Boatswain Bernard Webber's crew.""The Finest Hours"", based on the book of the same name, and as produced by Walt Disney Pictures, is an excellent, if not completely accurate tale of heroism. First of all, you're struck with how incomprehensibly gutsy simply undertaking this rescue mission was for Webber and his crew – and how utterly hopeless the situation seemed for Sybert and his seafaring comrades. It's simply great storytelling. Part of the story's effectiveness lies with the important role Miriam and her impending marriage to Bernie play in the story. Although Bernie and Miriam did marry in real life, much about their relationship and her role in the events portrayed has been fabricated for dramatic purposes. It feels like unnecessary embellishment of an already dramatic story.The acting is one of this film's additional strengths. I feel that this was one of Casey Affleck's best roles and finest performances to date. Pine is very good, but having him play a good-looking guy who is insecure about his looks seemed a little silly. The rest of the cast is solid, as is the directing of the little-known but versatile Craig Gillespie, and the quality of the writing in this adaptation by Eric Johnson, Scott Silver and Paul Tamasy. The gale-force visual effects are the best this side of 2000's ""The Perfect Storm"", while the 3D, and, if you have access to them, D-Box seats, really enhance the experience. This film tells a relatively simple story and feels a little old fashioned, but that's part of its charm. Come to think of it, with its complete absence of sexual content or mano-a-mano violence and its light use of adult language, ""The Finest Hours"" also works very well as a family film. This movie will give you two of the finest hours that you and/or your family are likely to have watching a movie this year. ""A-""",8.0,Anonymous,History

70's style disaster movie with better special effects,"If the Finest Hours was released in the 70's I think it would have done a lot better at the box office. Unfortunately this type of film can't find the proper audience that it definitely deserves.It's quite a different film from Craig Gillespie, but he does a great job here, especially with the action scenes.All performances are great, especially Pine and Affleck. Some of the smaller roles are a bit less developed, but are still played well by great actors like Eric Bana, Ben Foster & Graham McTavish, who do a lot with what they are given.Unfortanately I had to watch the 3D version, as it was the only showing in the cinema. The 3D added nothing to the overall experience. Luckily the film was good enough to rise above this.One drawback of the film was the love story aspect. I understand why it's included in the film, and I don't have a problem with this part of the story, only that at particular points of the film it would cut back to the girlfriend on the mainland.

Excellent movie. Bring your life jacket.,"This is a great movie. Tense story, excellent acting, lots of action and an upbeat theme. The movie keeps the audience engaged and entertains. Now one might write off this movie as being just the latest addition to the natural disaster movie genre but that would be only partially correct. There is little in the story that is contrived. That is, the story has plausibility. It does not seem to be stretching literary license (though some is taken). The heroics are not overblown. Actually, what is depicted is amazing and admirable. Coast Guardsmen conduct a rescue operation in almost impossibly abysmal conditions. Yet it happened. You can look it up. The movie does raise a question: why was the US Coast Guard so undermanned and poorly equipped? This movie gives cause to compare it to the blockbuster Titanic (1997). It compares favorably. Chris Pine and Casey Affleck are excellent as the two principal characters who are most responsible for saving a lot of lives. This movie is worth watching. Just make sure that you're wearing a life jacket.",10.0,Anonymous,History

I Spent Most Of Two Hours Wondering What Had Gone Wrong With This,"This seemed to have a decent enough cast (Chris Pine and Ben Affleck, for example) and it certainly sounded like it would be an exciting story of a rescue at sea, as members of the US Coast Guard try to rescue the crew of an oil tanker adrift off the coast of Massachussetts during a winter storm. And - for what it's worth (which often isn't much) it has the advantage of being based on a true story (although one expects it to be ""disney-fied,"" since the movie was made by Disney. Still, it seemed to have a lot going for it - and yet I ended up spending most of the movie's runtime wondering what had gone so terribly wrong.It really wasn't very interesting. It had one of the least engrossing opening I've ever come across. To be honest I dozed off at least three times in the first 30 minutes, which were just interminable. Maybe I'm just not the romantic type, but I really couldn't get myself revved about about the relationship between Bernie and Miriam. And, once we got to the actual rescue, it really didn't get much better. The special effects were OK, but somehow there was an aura of unreality hanging over this. It just didn't seem convincing. And at one point near the end of the movie - which had already gone on much too long - for whatever reason there was a decision made to show the waves crashing over the tanker and the rescue boat - in slow motion! Oy vey! That just made it longer.I wanted to like this. I really did. And I thought I would. But I didn't. I didn't like it at all. I just wondered what had gone wrong. I got totally lost in that muddle of an opening half hour, and nothing that came afterward appealed to me enough to get me interested again. (1/10)",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Slow to start, but grows into a great action-disaster flick","This movie approaches perfection in disaster films. The acting was superb, the special effects amazing and the story unbelievable - but true. My heart was in my throat - and I already knew the whole story from earlier research of the true-life incident - who lives and who dies. They actually skipped some elements of the day's work for the Coast Guard, probably because no one would believe it.The only weakness I saw with the movie was that it was a bit slow in the start, too much romance in the beginning and not enough exploration of our four Coast Guard heroes. We only really meet and get to know Webber (Chris Pine), and it spends too much time exploring his romance. The movie makers attempted to shove some strong female characters into the story - beyond a brief introduction to establish Webber's motivations and history, they really didn't belong in the story.But in the end it was worth it because the scenes of the crippled, broken SS Pendleton are edge-of-your seat stuff, and once Webber and his crew get in their little 36-foot motor lifeboat and head out into 60-foot seas, you're in for the ride of your life.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"IMAX 3D was made for ""The Finest Hours"" -- Excellent film","IMAX 3D was made for ""The Finest Hours."" The technology is fully exploited and realized as it takes you in to the immediacy of the fact-based story. I didn't expect much. So many films made for 3D and/or IMAX are strong on FX and weak on story. At my age, story is paramount, and if the FX can be enlisted to that end, we could get a good film. ""The Finest Hours"" is an excellent film.So many of the films for IMAX 3D are fantasies which probably would have engaged me in my younger days, but as I've aged I have increasingly related more to ""true"" or ""real"" stories like ""The Finest Hours."" I'll also mention that it was a relief to everyone in our party to not be subjected to a barrage of what is euphemistically called ""language."" That has become the movie norm in an effort to dial up realism or tension or whatever. None of the people in my life ever talk that way and ""The Finest Hours"" demonstrates that realism and tension are both well off without it.IMHO, ""The Finest Hours"" was excellently cast and excellently performed. The two male leads both give subtly nuanced performances as just plain guys trying to do their jobs and not seeking recognition or leadership positions, who find themselves in situations forcing them to take charge, and portraying their gradual personal progression as they have ""greatness thrust upon them.""In IMAX 3D, the effects are jaw-dropping. One review, an outlier, complains that the price of 3D is reduced brightness. I thought it was worth every penny. Another review complains that the film lacks human drama. The writers' adaptation from fact to film story and script relies on some well-worn devices, but everyone in my party thought it succeeded beautifully in limning consistent and plausible back stories, portraying women of implacable strength in what might have been strictly a male story, and wrapping the whole tale in a tender romance.I'm interested now in reading the book.

Exciting and suspenseful,"""The Finest Hours"" from 2016 is a true story of an incident in 1952.In February of 1952, an intense, powerful storm hit New England. On that day, an oil tankers splits in half. Hearing the distress signal, the commander, Daniel Cluff (Eric Bana) sends Bernie Webber (Chris Pine) and his handpicked crew on a rescue mission, which almost certainly means death. Bernie is not popular - he was unable to rescue men at another time, though his friends assure him there was nothing he could have done.The engineer, Sybert (Casey AFfleck) takes over, determined to run the stern to ground so that it will not sink. He has to convince the men not to try to leave in the lifeboats, which will not hold up in the storm. He holds fast and fights them.As the storm rages, Bernie and his men forge ahead to find survivors.Very exciting movie with stupendous effects and excellent performances by Chris Pine and Casey Affleck. But what was the stupid love story doing in there? Holliday Grainger is Miriam Webber, whom Bernie meets on a blind date. After several months, she pushes him to marry her, and they decide on an April wedding. Well, she does.When Bernie is out on his rescue mission, Miriam shows up at headquarters demanding he be ordered back immediately. Not only does she act inappropriately but she is as annoying as hell. She comes through in the end, but this entire story did not belong in the movie. Their love story was not built up enough to see anything between them except her iron will. She makes Bernie look like a wuss.The '50s were meticulously presented with the historical references correct. I always watch out for that - references and songs etc. were right on.""The Finest Hours"" is a Disney film, and at the end of the film, it catches the viewer up with the real people.

Nostalgia at its best,"I am rather disappointed by all the negative and meh reviews about this film so I am chiming in with my two cents, for what its worth.Chris Pine was the hook that drew me into this selection when it popped up on Netflix. The movie starts with a romance that is refreshing in that the woman who captures the heart of the lead is rather pushy and a bit more assertive than we'd expect for the time period. It was a neat twist and I rather enjoyed watching Chris Pine's character tangle and be entranced by such a woman.After the love angle is squared away, the story turns to the heroic true story of Bernie Webber. Which, upon checking further into that story, I found it is definitely a tale worth telling and surprisingly the film doesn't stray too far from the facts.The film is a mixture of The Perfect Storm and Hacksaw Ridge. The perfect storm angle is that there are two tankers in distress during a big winter storm at the same time. The report of the foundering of one tanker is mistaken for the other. With all resources aimed at saving the first of the two tankers, the rescue of the crew of the second is left to Bernie Webber and the single remaining too small coast guard ship in the marina.The Hacksaw Ridge angle is that there is something so real about the people in this film--a real humanity to them. Also, there is a mixture of dignity, humility, strength and integrity in all of the characters and its not something I've seen in a film or on the page in a very long time.For me film was very nostalgic. Bernie Webber , as played by Chris Pine, reminded me of my father in many ways as well as all the men I knew and admired as a small girl. The story reminds of a time when people did the things they did simply because it was the right thing to do and did these wondrous things with humility and a quiet strength.Best scene....Webber's hands shaking upon taking the helm to try and return to shore.For these reasons alone, its a film worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent Film Full of Drama & Suspense,"A heroic film full of drama and suspense, had me on the edge of my chair the entire time. It's a story portraying an amazing rescue by a branch of the military, often overlooked, the Coast Guard. The film draws the viewer into the story from the very onset. I watched it twice, because I was so tense the first time, I thought I may have missed something. Each actor portrayed his character exceptionally and distinctly from the others. It was a good mix of personalities. The movie was overall outstanding, had realistic staging, special effects and cinematography. It gave me a new respect for our Coast Guard, not realizing the important part they play in protecting and rescuing Americans and that they do put themselves in harms way.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Its ok...,"Its a fairly ok film, I do think it has far to much filler and could do with being about 30 mins shorter.The Interesting bits are all focused around the oil tanker thats sinking and the rescue boat.

One of the greatest rescue movies of all time,"This is based upon a true story.In 1952 a severe storm off the coast of Cape Cod causes the oil tanker, SS Pendleton, to break in half sending 34 men to the stern of the ship in the hope of a rescue. Head Engineer, Ray Sybert (Casey Affeck) believes the only hope they have is to run the ship onto a shoal otherwise the ship would be at the mercy of the 70-foot waves. USCG Commander Cluff (Eric Bana) sends Bernie Webber (Chris Pine) and his team out to rescue the men on the Pendleton. The real danger in this is going through the bar, a series of shoals that are very dangerous to go thru even in calm weather. Oh, oh.This is probably one of the best rescue movies I have ever seen. I sat there cringing all the time even though I knew the rescue would be successful. How many of the scenes were shot is beyond me. Yes, I knew CGI played a big part in this butstill I mean it was like I was actually there being tossed about inside that half of a ship, and those waves outside were more than menacing. Kudos to the director.The acting all around is excellent, but the cinematography should win some awards as it was nothing short of spectacular. It looked like they shot the movie in the worst part of winter with ice all around and if that was CGI, it was exceptional. Kudos. (maybe movie magic?)Just like any trip we take, the longest part of the journey is getting there. Coming back doesn't take as long. And this was true within this movie. Took a long time to get to the half-ship, but coming back hardly took any time at all. See? (yes, very clever)There are no twists to look for, but keep in mind Bernie and company lost their compass and really didn't know where the Pendleton was. And after the rescue, Bernie didn't know where the homeland was to return. Bernie says on the way out he kept to the left and on the return he kept to the right. Seemed to have worked.Watch at the end to see what happened to all as photos are shown of the actual USCG crew.A statement at the end also says this was one of the greatest rescues in USCG history for small boats. I say this was probably the greatest rescue in history period. We salute the USCG, and, of course, all military personnel, firemen and policemen who run to the problem and not run away from it.

Storming ahead,"After films like A Perfect Storm there is an element of seen it all before in The Finest Hours. It is based on a true story in 1952 when just off the coast of New England a severe storm cracked an oil tanker the SS Pendleton into two and the US coast guard headed for a risky rescue mission.The film splits the scenes with the crew of the stricken ship, the rescue mission and the wholesome 1950s setting on the shore with the families at home waiting for better news.Casey Affleck leads the beleaguered engine room crew trying to hold the ship together to improve their chances of rescue after the vessel's officers, radar and radio equipment has been lost when it breaks apart.Coast Guard Chris Pine, just engaged to be married has been ordered to go out to sea with a small craft and a crew of four to rescue the survivors. His fiancée Holliday Grainger nervously waits for him at headquarters and makes the commander irate by wanting the crew to turn around.The CGI enhanced rescue scenes are effective but the film is at times hammy and for large parts dull dripping with sentimentality as seen in the film's opening scenes and the cast mainly give underwhelming and in some ways caricatured performances.",3.0,Anonymous,History

Should have been titled The Dragging Hours.,"The Finest Hours is a movie based on a true story. Members of the American Coast Guard, Bernie Webber(Chris Pine), Richard Livesey(Ben Foster), Andy Fitzgerald(Kyle Gallner) & Ervin Maske(John Magaro) make a daring rescue attempt, as ordered by their superior, Daniel Cluff(Eric Bana). The Coast Guard's mission is to rescue a group of shipwrecked coast guardsmen, after a pair of oil tankers got destroyed on their ship. These events occurred off the coast of Cape Cod, during the blizzard of 1952.The Finest Hours is a mediocre film, at best. At worst, it is a really slow film that has pretty much, the same extended scene throughout its run-time. The movie opens as a romantic drama. These first few minutes of the film are really dull & the so called chemistry between the actors feels forced & cringe worthy. After this, we are thrust into the Coast Guard life of Bernie Webber & his pals. So, 15 minutes into the movie we are given two perspectives. One perspective is from, the ship stranded in the midst of the roaring blizzard. Here the movie revolves around, Ray Sybert(Casey Affleck). The second perspective is from the rescue boat on its way to save Sybert & his fellow coast guardsmen. The scenes on the ship are mostly technical, with the crew indulging in manual labor. The exciting scenes happen on the rescue boat as Webber & his compatriots are right in the middle of the roaring storm. However, since the majority of the movie takes place on the rescue boat & the ship, these scenes get repetitive. The viewer will be left wondering, when will this movie end. The visual effects are the only highlight of the movie. The most recent film in this genre is, In the Heart of the Sea(2015). In the Heart of the Sea(2015) is a masterpiece, compared to this barely sincere attempt to bring to life, an incredible true story. The 3D in this movie is terrible. It is a waste of the extra money. Not even a single obstacle pops out of the screen & the three dimensional immersion is hardly noticeable. There is almost zero character development. Therefore, the actors' performances have very little impact. Nevertheless, Chris Pine, Casey Affleck, Ben Foster, Eric Bana, Holliday Granger, Kyle Gallner, John Magaro & the rest of the cast, do a decent job with their respective roles. The Finest Hours is not worth a watch. In fact it is so dragging that, I dozed off quite a few times during the film & I never fall asleep while watching a movie! Skip this one & wait for it to come out on DVD & Blu-Ray or, just watch it on TV.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Great depiction of the era and New England Coast Guard outposts provide foundation for harrowing rescue saga,"This movie does a magnificent job of setting the table for itself. It took me back to the early 1950's in New England without so much as an echo of a false note. The dances, the cars, the attitudes, and the not-so-esprit-de-corps-except-when-it really-counts attitude among the Guard members at the outpost are all presented with remarkable accuracy. It was just like stepping into a time capsule.I don't understand some people's criticism of the acting as wooden. I found it anything but. Casey Affleck (Gone Baby Gone) is a fantastic dramatic actor who is stereotyped too much from his Oceans movie roles. Here, he steels the movie from Pine, Foster, and the rest. Not that Pine and Foster were bad - they were pitch perfect as the determined and focused rescuers with lives of their own. As the Commander, Eric Bana gave the film's most thankless role everything he could.I thought Holliday Grainger was a revelation as the spunky and unconventional Miriam. The subplot with her pushiness and combativeness was well told and did an excellent job of providing context.As for the action, it was magnificent with the saga well told both in magnitude of the task, dissension on the big boat, human courage and weakness in the face of death, and of course, the rescue itself. I did go to the 3D version and the effects and motion of the waves made that well worth it for me. It is a great film for the entire family.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"A++  Had me on the edge of my seat the entire time, gripped me emotionally","I have to give this film 10/10. When I first saw the previews I thought it was another ""perfect storm"" film or a remake and I didn't have much back story or even knew that the movie was based on real life. My friend asked me to go see it and I did without any expectation at all.I was completely blown away! I'm a sucker for films that base man against nature and defying the odds. This film achieved all of that. There wasn't a subplot in this film that didn't tie in with the ending and serve a purpose to the main theme. The acting by Chris Pine and Casey Affleck, as well as the other actors, was convincing. I felt the emotions they were trying to depict. The action scenes and CGI did not disappoint either they had me gripping the edge of my seat - very convincing. I was holding my breath a lot in this film.It still blows my mind that this was a true story. It's an incredible depiction of human grit, man vs nature, faith and going above and beyond the call of duty. If you like these types of films then this is definitely one for you.

Best movie in years,"I saw the movie yesterday and when I decided to look up some information I was shocked to see that this movie was a disaster in theaters and has mixed reviews and not as good rating as I thought. I red a lot of comments, reviews and still don't get it. I waited for this movie in a long time without even knowing it. I never heard of it before yesterday and was skeptical when I found it but after the trailer I said to myself ""why not?"". I would want to underline the fact that I had 0 info about movie, that includes the part based on true events. If I knew about it I would have had high hopes and never would hesitate to watch it. Usually for me it's the first 10 minutes of the movie that talks to me, I know if the movie is interesting after that time or if I'm going to be bored. Obviously I wasn't disappointing. Once you see this parallel view on the rescue mission, one from the boat where we get to see their side of the story, how they cope with danger, second one how these rescuers decide to go on this suicide mission, you're completely hooked. There is everything, love, courage, honor, cowardness etc. We have heroes that are real, they make us wait in suspense because you know this is just an average man trying to survive or just do his job. I couldn't stop watching, Casey Affleck nailed his role and I fell in love with his character, he is not just a crew member, he is a hero on the background of others. But he doesn't even knows it, he just wants to live, like everybody, the difference is his coolness and patience. I also liked Webber but I had the feeling that he was miscast, Chris was not looking as a humble and average rescuer. The fact that we get 2 heroes in one movie that are so different but still similar gives this movie originality. This is not just a rescue mission, this is about the crew that does everything in their power to survive. I felt like I saw 2 movies in one. One about how the rescue mission was done and other how the crew managed to survive. The only minus that I saw in the movie, it was something that was out of the place. Miriam. I understand that more and more directors want a female character that is somehow daring for her time but it was really unnecessary for this film. I am a feminist and I love a movie with good female character but she was out of her place. And I'm not talking about her proposal or daring look or they way she speaks but the fact that she is given the honor to rescue the rescuers. I mean why would she be the one who does it? It's clear that places like that have lighthouses and it's impossible to have 0 light, complete dark in these situations, why would she had to be the one that gives the light? It kind of seems that the director pushes her in our throats and it's a little annoying. She takes the crown from the heads of those who actually did something. And considering that in the real story she sleeps through the whole thing I would say that the director made a mistake by making a character out of nowhere for no apparent reason but to satisfy the modern society that look for bad ass women.",10.0,Anonymous,History
I developed Thalassophobia in seeing this film,"It takes some time before the film plunges to action as it gets out of the way the film's romance first. Chris Pine downplays his on- screen charisma and jumps from spaceship captain to ""space""-less ship captain (get it?) in playing the role of Bernie Webber, an introverted coast-guard officer. It is 1952 and Bernie is about to go on a first date with Miriam (Holiday Grainger). Flash-forward a couple of months, and Miriam asks Bernie to marry her (yes, not the other way around). Bernie, having known her for basically less than a year, initially says no but as she walks-out of the room and cries, Bernie follows her and takes back his answer (tears, indeed, are a woman's weapon). Their engagement gets postponed when chief warrant officer Daniel Cluff (Eric Bana) sends Bernie to a suicide mission to rescue a crew from an oil tanker ship, the S.S. Pendleton, that's split in half during the winter storm. O.K., hold up, a ship split into half, one part sinks and the other stays afloat—how insane is that? The events that occur this film seem improbable that I myself have journeyed to research; however it turns out, most of these events, including this one, really happened.From this point, the film is forked into three story-lines which happen concurrently: Bernie's rescue mission with his volunteer crew; the events happening back in the mainland; and the struggle of the men inside the oil tanker ship led by engineer Ray Sybert (Casey Affleck). Bernie's arc holds the message of the film—valor and humanity inevitably comes through at the most improbable odds. ""In the coast guard they say you go out, they don't say you gotta come back,"" Bernie says before they trudge on to the raging sea and get tossed by its gigantic waves. In these intense moments of distress, Chris Pine delivers an admirable performance as the underdog rising to the occasion.This old-fashioned rescue story is sure to be taken back to films such as Titanic (1997), The Perfect Storm (2000), or The Guardian (2006). Viewers will whine from the onset: ""I have already seen this film years ago"", and they will be right. The Finest Hours certainly isn't the ""finest"". This film is quite the outlandish choice for Disney's usually colorful productions. In closer inspection, you understand just why: it sends a powerful and uplifting message about resilience, leadership and faith—characteristics that the outfit so admirably adamantly promotes.Full review here: http://goo.gl/ilmQ8i",8.0,Anonymous,History
A superb rescue operation. Something this film needed as well.,"""We're sinking.""This looked like the movie ""Titanic"". The iceberg was absent though. But still, the oil tanker was broken in two like a toothpick by the raging sea and went to the bottom of the ocean. There was also a romance. Only this didn't happen aboard of the sinking ship. The final result is a Disney disaster movie, suitable for couples. The female audience can melt away because of the love story. A tribute to invincible love and a prove that infinite love can overcome every pesky obstacle. An example of how kindred spirits can find each other telepathically and use each other as a beacon to be united again. I never expected that such beacons consist of a row of old-timers with their headlights directed to the ocean. The male audience can enjoy the exciting rescue operation initiated by an engineer. His ingenious plan was to run the broken ship aground on a sandbank. Expect some nerve-racking scenes and liters of salt water.The fact that this is a Disney product, means that it also contains a happy ending. Well, most Disney films have one. Those who have expertise in maritime history, will know that this film is about a true incident in 1952. The US Coast Guard successfully conducted one of the most daring rescue operations. Guardian angel on duty is Bernard Webber (Chris ""Z for Zachariah"" Pine). The way he maneuvers his lifeboat CG36500 over a treacherous sandbar, endangering his own and his crew's life, is beautifully filmed and a thrilling moment. A hallucinatory boat trip over (and under) giant waves, which reminded me of ""The Perfect Storm"". A successful interpretation by Chris Pine as the colorless, timid little officer who grows out to be a determined and heroic captain. Casey ""Out of the furnace"" Affleck also played a brilliant part as the introverted Ray Sybert who usually hides in the lower levels of the SS Pendleton and who manages to save the ship temporarily in a resourceful way. A subdued and sober character. Personally, I think this is one of his better performances.Unfortunately a dose of romance was necessary again. And this in the form of telephone operator Miriam (Holliday Grainger). A spry woman with a big mouth. It was as if she was the founder of the feminist movement. She asks her boyfriend to marry her (probably unseen and unacceptable in those days) and briefly wants to have her say in this male bastion ruled by the Coast Guard. She hadn't taken officer Cluff (Eric ""Deliver us from Evil"" Bana) into account, who threw her out immediately. The only thing Mary could do was to hope and pray (together with the other women) that her future husband would return safe and sound.The most annoying thing during the exciting rescue, were those intermissions where they showed the desperation and fear of the housewives who stayed behind. As a result, the rising tension was constantly interrupted. The only thought I had was ""Why don't you just go cook something and wait patiently?"". At least I could have enjoyed the action on the halved ship. That and the ridiculous, sentimental ending (they ignored the hero completely) were the reason that I finally thought this movie wasn't so great.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",5.0,Anonymous,History
A Very Nice Amazing Sea Disaster!,"Craig Gillespie did his best. The story line is gripping and makes you feel the danger and emotional turmoil each character is going through, very intricately. The film starts on a very romantic, slow pace and gains momentum as the entire East coast is hit by a snow storm. What stays in your head is everything you are watching on screen - a true account of the 1952 United States Coast Guard rescue of the SS Pendleton, after it split apart during a nor'easter off the New England coast.Leaving the few stretched on ground moments, the entire film is a nature versus man thriller, where courage wins over all odds. Go for this one if you loved the 'The Perfect Storm' and 'Titanic' etc, this one will take you back on that dreaded journey to the sea. As Miriam puts it in the film, ""It's not the water that scares me but what lies beneath it.""My Rating for this great movie is 4/5.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Terrible,"The only reason to watch this film is to appreciate James Cameron's amazing talent in THE ABYSS. All the energy and credibility that Cameron created in THE ABYSS is lacking here.

Everything that made The Abyss a masterpiece is missing here.Casey Affleck is absolutely terrible.

This old-fashioned sea story of The Finest Hours can't save itself from a weary tone,"Like a lot of people, I'm terrified of the idea of having to swim in the dark. It doesn't matter where the water source is (the ocean, a swamp or even a regular swimming pool), but if I can't see what's beneath me, then who knows what could be down there. In a way looking at dark water is like looking deep into space with the both environments being unknown, mysterious and could turn on you in a heartbeat. If there's nothing in the water, then I still hate thinking that if was in the middle of the ocean in the middle of the night. If I can't see my own toes, then there's something unsettling about that.Luckily, the job of jumping into that dark water rests upon the coast guard who are the first responders to any sea emergency. It was only before I stepped in to see The Finest Hours that I realized that very few movies that are about the Coast Guard. It's fair to say that other military branches tend to get more attention then the sea bound team. The Finest Hours chronicles one of their most dangerous rescue attempts that will make you glad to be wrapped in blanket on those cold nights.It is 1952 where Coast Guard crewman Bernie Webber (played by Chris Pine) makes a life for himself in Chatham, Massachusetts where he meets and falls in love with a young woman, Miriam Pentinen (played by Holiday Grainger). They set April 16 as the wedding date while winter is still upon the Cape Cod town, covering the city in a nearly whiteout storm. Bernie asks for permission for marriage from his commanding officer, Daniel Cluff (played by Eric Bana), but is insulted for having to ask to be married. It is then Bernie sees that the rest of the Coast Guard crewmen see him as a guy who only follows orders.Meanwhile, an oil tanker, the SS Pendleton breaks in half during a storm while out on the ocean. The surviving crew, which consists of engineers, cooks, and the lone sailor, Ray Sybert (played by Casey Affleck), see that their not too far from land, but still need rescue.Bernie gets called to go rescue the survivors with only a few crewmen on a lifeboat, even though the nor'easter is still fiercely rough. Despite having a small boat, his compass gone and cold weather beating him up, he still attempts one of the craziest rescues in military history.The Finest Hours has plenty of material to make a great story from a likable real life solider to a stormy sea that even Moby Dick would have found too rough. It's a shame that the final product was simply too forgettable and surprisingly dull. It seems that the tone of the story was to make this more of a typical day then a major rescue (at least until towards the end). I can understand doing that to make the Coast Guard characters more relatable, but it can backfire, and it does here. If these people don't see this as something major, then why should it's audience?The best thing about the movie are the two stars, Chris Pine and Casey Affleck who are both playing different kinds of leaders. They do their parts well enough, but it's the rest of the characters that have little identity aside from their jobs. I know I should be worried about those on the oil tanker, but the movie needed more time for us to get to know these people better. Instead, the narrative only seems to be to do it's sea job, go to the next and do the next job.I'll give this five Coast Guard boats out of ten. The old fashioned story of the coast guard has it's moments in the second half, but are not enough the fixed the deluded tone that the first half is seemingly stuck with. The Finest Hours might make for an okay history lesson, but not a satisfying action movie nor a romance.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Looks great but there isn't much depth! 4/10,"Review: Although this movie was epic, and the whole rescue element was quite touching, it wasn't character driven, and there wasn't much depth to the characters, except for Chris Pine (Bernie Webber), who heads the rescue. Casey Affleck (Ray Sybert), was very calm and collected, as the ship captain who is waiting to be rescued while his ship is crumbling and his crew is panicking, and so was Eric Bana (Daniel Cluff), who sent Bernie out to head the rescue. Ben Foster (Richard Livesey), also seemed very calm as he was helping Bernie with the rescue, so it was hard to feel emotional about the whole situation. The only person who seemed to be worried about her loved one, was Bernie's fiancé Miriam Webber, played by Holliday Grainger, who went through hell to get information about the whole mission but there didn't seem to be anyone else who cared about what was happening in the deep sea. I couldn't understand why they took out such a small boat to save a big crew, and with the terrible weather ahead, I'm shocked that the boat made it back in one piece. With that aside, it did look great and it seemed real but with the power of technology, and some clever CGI, I wasn't surprised from Disney. By the end of the film, I did feel a bit empty, and it was a shame that the director didn't show the aftermath of such a huge ordeal. Anyway, it's a watchable film but the fantastic journey could have been portrayed much better. Watchable!Round-Up: After making such a lose at the box office, like a lot of true motion Disney movies, I can't see this damaging the studio but I'm sure that Chris Pine and Casey Affleck will be disappointed, after putting so much effort into there performances. The movie was directed by Craig Gillespie, who also brought you Mr. Woodcock with Billy Bob Thornton, Lars and the Real Girl with Ryan Gosling, the awful Fright Night remake with Colin Farrell and Million Dollar Arm, which went down well at the box office. He put together a decent cast for this film but he didn't push the actors to the limit, in terms of emotion and depth. I personally was disappointed with the structure of the film, and I can understand why audiences and the critics didn't make that much noise when it was released.Budget: $80million Worldwide Gross: $52.1millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/history/dramas, starring Chris Pine, Casey Affleck, Ben Foster, Eric Bana, Holliday Grainger, John Oritz and Kyle Gallner. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,History

A solid movie,"This is a very entertaining movie that would be suitable for a family movie night as long as very young children aren't involved. This movie will probably be to boring and frightening at the same time.
Most of the performances are on par with what is desired for this movie. Although there are some character persona choices that don't seem ""real""; mainly both leads Chris and Casey (their accent choice just seems off).
The action sequences are intense and I could not imagine actually having to go through that if it were in real life which makes what they do that much more spectacular.
My biggest gripe is how dark the movie is and really needs to be watched in the dark so that you can watch it properly and see everything. If you watch with the lights on you may miss what the graphic artists did to make this movie come to life.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Absolutely average in every single way.,"The Finest Hours (2016) is absolutely average in every single way. Nothing in this movie was terrible, yet nothing exceeds the norm.

The special effects were very practical and convincing. The story is probably the most compelling part and is the only thing I found to be truly remarkable. Without that astounding real-life story, this would be nothing more than a run-of-the-mill rescue film. It was an entertaining watch and I wasn't bored throughout it.

All Hands Abandon Movie!,"Yikes. I just got done watching this movie. What a disaster of story telling. Somehow other reviewers tout this movie as a nice ""old fashioned"" style film. I love old fashioned films, love classic films, I am a huge film buff. I mean Ben Foster is obviously pretending to be a Van Johnson persona here. This movie is a disaster all in all. Its a waste of a good cast, waste of a true story. The script is downright boring, contrived as others have said, and bland. There is no character development so no investment. The efforts of the sinking tanker's engineer was the most interesting parts of the story, the premise of how to keep the tanker afloat and steer the tanker. I would say this was the most suspenseful building potential of the film, that is until the next cut which then spoils any momentum of this story. The damsel fiance wife ending up stuck in a ditch in the snow is probably the worst nail biting twist in the story. When you see this film...Please tell me how in the world a radio that has been drowned in sea water all of a sudden works!? I am not surprised that Disney made this movie. Seeing how they totally dismantled the Star Wars Saga at their first outing baffles the mind. They should just stick with animated kid stuff. This movie has zero suspense for a story that I am sure had real suspense as it was unfolding in the middle of the open sea. I give this movie 3 stars because it has no pulse.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Worth while,So often the realities of professions that involve risking ones own life as a necessity in order to save others is told without focus upon the fact that often these rescues just dont happen because men will not risk their own safety Regardless of it being the purpose for which they are paid for.

The Perfect Storm on steroids,"Hey, I didn't realise this was a Disney movie until I read other reviews. That is a statement in itself. Thoroughly enjoyed this actioner, and I have no problem with factual errors as I tend to watch movies for entertainment. If I want to be educated I pick up a book ... or Kindle.

How special effects and Hollywood undermine human kind,"A wide screen overwhelming ,popcorn crunching entertainment extravaganza that blasts the visual and aural senses.Watching the cgi effects reminded me of Pirates of the Caribbean and the special effects presentations at Disneyworld. All the money spent on sfx etc ,the Hollywood stars,the subtle lighting(even in the middle of a dark,raging storm) and the symphonic,emotive music score demonstrate the failure of such high production value ""cinema"" to deal with the true bravery and spirit of characters taken from real life. There is another way. A history of cinema which has included Visconti,Loach,Anderson,and so many more.....The Finest Hours is not what it says on the film can. Just another special effects Hollywood blockbuster as far away from the real world as ever.",3.0,Anonymous,History

The film moves at a dreary pace...,"All the characters seemed incompetent and self-centered, and the actors acted lazily. There wasn't much enthusiasm here. Is it just me, or did everything and everyone seem to move in slow motion? In any rescue mission time is of the essence, and I didn't feel that urgency - not from the pacing or the music. Yes, even the music seemed bland. The film really moved along at a dreary pace. Also, for anyone familiar with the story, they would have known how it was going to end anyway, so there are no surprises.During the storm, the waves were inconsistent. At times there were huge swells and then suddenly close-ups on actors revealed there were hardly any motion. The actors just didn't blend with their surroundings, rendering it unbelievable.Its still a heroic tale, though, and I did enjoy the film's final 35 minutes, and loved the ending.",4.0,Anonymous,History
The Finest Hours Lifts You Up Honourably,"This is somewhat of a modern milestone for a Hollywood-style movie. A gut-wrenching story based on a daring, factually based, historic sea rescue. The screenplay, written by Award nominated Scot Silver along with Eric Johnson & Paul Tamasy proves a strong point - that a powerful story can be told without resorting to the now 'trendy' course language - making it an all age spectacular. And, spectacular it is indeed. Based on Michael J.Tougias and co-author Casey Sherman's book of the same name, this exciting story literally dumps the viewer into a tiny Coast Guard rescue boat as it's being pounded by the most deadly seas of all.Even though the CGI folk have overdone certain effects - some of the angry ocean scenes are often so convincing they leave you wanting to grab a towel to dry off or even check your life jacket is handy! A strong hand picked stellar cast convince all the way, while Chris Pine and Casey Affleck put in hard working performances as the heroic Coast Guard pilot and the engineer of a stricken cargo giant - that's been torn in two by massive winds and seas. Cynical viewers who have been seduced by hard-edged 'modern' scripts - need to be reminded that love in the 1950's moved at a slower, more thoughtful pace than the soulless in-your-face situations we see in movies today.Photographically, The Finest Hours features stylish visuals by Spanish born D.O.P. Javier Aguirresarobe and the well-paced FX are all brought together with some neat direction by Australian Craig Gillespie - along with a Carter Burwell score. The atmospheric end title song 'Haul Away Joe' performed by Kodaline caps it off nicely (not to mention all those remarkable 50s cars!). All up it's refreshing, quite believable, high voltage entertainment, for those who want more than the comic book situations we get thrown at us all too often.This one definitely deserves more attention and is recommended for a good night's inspirational entertainment - that most audiences should enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Would have been good but...,"I was looking forward to watching this film since the trailer looked amazing and I love these kind of action movies. Unfortunately, Chris Pine spoiled the movie for me during his appearance on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Not everyone knows about nautical accidents so for him to go on the show and say exactly what happens in the film (to the point of saying how many people died, etc) ruined the film for me. I think he needs to be prepped by the film's marketing/pr manager next time he gives an interview...Watching a film where you already know what is going to happen kind of takes the suspense away from it.

This reminds Disney (and us) of what it does best!,"A few of you might still remember...
1952, women often wore pedal-pusher pants and heavily pleated skirts that were commonly made at home, tailor-made, & only recently store-bought. Clothing was virtually 100% natural fibers & materials. Nylon was just becoming inexpensive and the elastic, natural rubber, did not last as long as the rest of your underwear.Almost everyone drank and smoked heavily ( not shown in this version of the '50s ). AM-Radio and newspapers were the high-water mark of the media and broadcasting was based on vacuum-tube technology. Almost no houses had a dead-bolt.Not remembered is that babies born premature at this time had a hard time surviving. Polio was still a major threat. Merthiolate and Iodine tinctures were the first line of First-Aid defense.All too often when danger arose the individual was out of reach. Teamwork and community was the only way society could struggle on.Scouting, Boy Scouts & Girl Scouts was taken seriously.

"I was pretty bored, nice ending though","I found it hard to connect to the characters on any kind of emotional level. This made the overall experience pretty boring because I just couldn't get into this movie. It didn't grab me. There were moments toward the end that started to grab me and the ending was sweet. I just feel it could have been done in a much more powerful way. In all fairness I was a little late getting to the movie theater so I missed the first bits, so maybe I missed some of the initial character building and bonding, which may have engaged me more. I also got basically strip searched by the theater when entering the film so I was a little annoyed and on edge about that. So maybe it wasn't as bad as I thought it was. Who knows. I know its a true story, so I probably shouldn't judge it by the plot. The action sequences in the waves were certainly riveting, although not very believable. It felt a little disjointed the way they told the two stories simultaneously. I suspect this movie would be received best by military or marine-going families.",5.0,Anonymous,History

A very much acceptable film that inspired by a real event except long pauses and too much ineffective sentiment.,"A disaster drama-thriller based on the true account of the 1952. So much better film than I anticipated. But there are a few things I did not like; like the frequent pauses in the narration where nothing really happens other that space given for the emotional background score to pull the viewers in. In a result, it did not work, definitely not for me. Yeah, in the many important scenes, it froze like it happens in the chess games before anybody move their pawn.In the crucial part of the narration, when the boat was overcrowded, there was an unnecessary pause which annoyed me. It was surely a remarkable segment of the story, but sentimentally failed to appeal or maybe you can call it a too much of the sentiment. Honestly, I liked the story, but the film exceeded its runtime to slow down the portrayal of the event which is surely a drawback than any kind of benefit.I loved the performances, everybody was good and so the CGI, which was not a top notch yet acceptable. Especially as it takes place in the dark time, they had the advantage to depict the atmosphere as much as close to how it would have looked 65 years ago and as well to avoid the errors.I never saw its trailer or the teaser, but I knew about this project and after seeing its posters I though it would be about the offshore oil rig. When I saw the film, I realised I was wrong and surprise do such thing happen in real.The film was also did not let my interest fall. Thanks to the director who always try different genre yet he's not a mega budget filmmaker. A good film, but like I said should have been even better. Especially should have out classed in the sentimental segments. I don't know how good was the digital 3D version of it, but still this regular version is worth to give it a shot.7½/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Perfect Movie,"I know the phrase ""perfect movie"" is basically taboo and only awarded to a select few films, but this movie earns it in my opinion.

A visually impressive yet emotionally empty disaster yarn,"In many ways just a good old fashioned adventure/survivalist yarn, Disney's huge box office flop (rumoured to have lost the studio over $60 million at the box office) The Finest Hours would be a hard film to totally discount and dislike yet there's an overall sense of could've been in Craig Gillespie's film that makes it a watchable experience that should've been quite a bit more.Gillespie who made a name for himself with unique yarns like Lars and the Real Girl and Million Dollar Arm seems like an odd choice to take on such a straightforward battle against the odds tale and while the director infuses his picture with the sprinkling of originality such as a long take of a message being relayed throughout a sinking ship or some slow motion ocean waves crashing on a boat full of survivors but the films biggest issue and therefore Gillespie's biggest issue is that The Finest Hours never carves out its own path in the great big ocean of similar films and in the end becomes just one of many where it might just have been something special.Starting out proceedings by giving us some character background to Chris Pine's fairly charisma free lead Bernie Webber and his newly minted fiancée Miriam played rather annoyingly by Holliday Grainger, Gillespie struggles to give us the character depth we need in a film of this kind and while Pine is surrounded at various times by the likes of fellow Coast Guards played by Ben Foster and Eric Bana, none of these actors do a whole lot while the crew of the seemingly doomed freighter SS Pendleton fare little better with Casey Affleck and his merry band of determined seaman barely getting a look in. Gillespie also finds minor struggles in conveying the finer details of this true life story and much of the storm or ocean talk gets lost on the ears of viewers who would know little about ocean bars or squalls.Peppered with some thrilling moments and genuinely exciting set pieces, The Finest Hours is a quality production that's hampered by a mostly laboured delivery and actors that could be doing a whole lot more had their material played up to their individual strengths. For fans of old school like productions The Finest Hours will be a big hit while the rest of us can enjoy the film in part but wish it had looked to leap a little higher than its seemingly low set pass mark.2 ½ happy-go-lucky boat chefs out of 5",5.0,Anonymous,History
Overblown and badly handled action-sequences,"It's a fine story The Finest Hours tries to tell, about a real-life rescue mission of a broken-in-half oil tanker off the coast of New England back in 1952. The film starts off with the background romance between lead character Bernie Webber (Chris Pine) and his would-be-wife Miriam (Holliday Grainger), and this is a nice prelude in which the tone of the time is set effectively and we're escorted back into the lives of mid-century Cape Cod coast guards. The start of the impending disaster on the tanker SS Pendelton is also quite well handled (even if the film takes too long getting there), and it's always promising to see Casey Affleck in the midst of an ensuing conflict. However, the problems start setting in with the introduction of the rescue mission itself, the film's focal point. The action-sequences are overblown and badly handled by director Craig Gillespie, who isn't able to convincingly portray the bravery of these people without throwing all realism overboard (literally). You've got people and boats doing and enduring things that are totally out of proportion, hence negating the veracity of the rescue mission itself. And if that wasn't enough, the film throws in far too many characters, many of which are never established, and far less developed, into people we know or can care for. Ben Foster's incredibly thankless role is the prime example. Luckily for Foster and Pine, they would reunite to film the brilliant Hell or High Water a few months later.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Dramatic retelling of a daring sea rescue,"A well-acted dramatic retelling of a daring sea rescue of 32 crew members of a sinking oil tanker by U.S. Coast Guard personnel. Despite the hectic decision-making both on land at USCG HQ and on the stricken tanker, it is made clear what caused the disaster (a killer storm) and what obstacles were faced by the tanker crew as they tried to avoid sinking, and by the four-man CG rescue vessel as it valiantly battled the storm to reach the stricken ship. My only reservations about the plot is the time spent showing the abbreviated romance between the main character, Bernie Webber, and his sweetheart, Miriam. We really didn't need to see all the courtship rituals that went into developing their relationship. We could just as well accept the fact that his fiancée was back on shore desperately waiting for him during the rescue mission. Likewise, the fact that Webber had failed in some way during an earlier rescue mission hung over him but it was never clear how or why, or even if, he was responsible in some way for the earlier failed rescue attempt. Finally, the Coast Guard in the post WWII era seems to have been a rather informal organization. At times the group appears more like a volunteer fire company rather than an organization with ranks and commands (""I need three volunteers!"" Bernie says to a less-than-enthusiastic group gathered in the mess hall.) That branch has come a long way; one of the special features shows today's Coast Guard rescuers in action, a far cry from the somewhat ragtag bunch in the movie",,Anonymous,History
Quite a touching ending,"This film tells the story of an oil tanker that is split in half by unforgiving storms. Over thirty crew members struggle to survive, while four US Coast Guards mount a near impossible rescue mission to save the crew members.""The Finest Hours"" starts off slow and tedious, as the subplots they introduce only serve as the backdrop for the later adventure. I would have liked more of the rescue effort shown on screen, and less time on land. Maybe it is for this reason that the film does not grip me and touch me as it should have done.Once Webber and his crew start the rescue mission, the film picks up pace significantly. The visual effects of the storms and the enormous waves are very good. Even though the ending is to be expected to end this way, it is quite touching nonetheless to see the outcome.",,Anonymous,History
