"Sad, But Incredibly Beautiful","I went into this movie not having read the book and not knowing anything more than the overall plot. I am a sucker for a good love story, especially love that I can relate to. The pain and emotions felt by the characters felt so real, as if I was feeling the same emotions.Though this was THE SADDEST movie I have ever seen, it was also one of the most beautiful, as it truly showed how exhilarating and comforting and exciting love is.I probably cried throughout about half of the movie, along with the rest of the audience. I cried to the point of heaving out loud and needing more than the 2 tissues I came in with. Again, the actors really expressed the emotions of the characters well and I felt that.I am going to see it again for sure.GO SEE IT IF YOU LOVE EMOTIONAL MOVIES!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Joy of Life,"I was touched by the concepts and situations on this film, being myself a survivor of 48 chemotherapy treatments, I can somehow understand the feelings.Is not a pretentious film, however full of little moments that creates a very good and convincing environment.I like both main rolls. The story is completely credible, it can happen any time to anyone.It is an Ode for Life, it tell us that ""We can and should have moments of infinite joy within a limited time"" It is our choice!I liked very much this film!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Would happily see this again!,"Average American guy right here, and I dug this flick. I don't care how many 13 year olds were in the theater with me, this movie has emotion. After watching the Descendents, I knew Woodley was going places. She simply delivers in this movie. I'm not going to write a long winded review about the summary, but I will tell you about the acting.Elgort and Woodley truly deliver. You forget they're acting each and every scene. The chemistry between the two is palpable. Laura Dern comes out of nowhere; I think the last time I've seen her face was JP. She puts up a pretty good role as Woodley's torn mother. Defoe is pure love/hate on almost a House level. In fact, he goes beyond House hatred with his apathy in this movie. And the two's sidekick (Wolff) is loads of comic relief, which is surprising considering that he too is in the therapy group. The rest of the cast is just kind of there (sorry Tramell). But that's because the camera is on Woodley and Elgort the entire time. I don't even think there's a scene except for flashbacks where the two are absent.As far as the movie... An emotional roller-coaster. You will get addicted to their relationship. You will cry big man tears internally (and probably externally) after 1.5 hours. You will be emotionally drained.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great,"One of the best romance movies I have ever seen and one of my favorite movies that I have ever seen. I loved the book and I loved the movie even more. The writing, plot, story, and screenplay were fantastic. Shaileen Woodley and Ansel Elgort's performances in the film as Hazel and Augustus were spectacular. The Fault in Our Stars is gorgeous, funny and sad at the same time and it shows true love can be found no matter what. Loved it so much.",,Anonymous,Romance
A Beautiful Love Story: Going to love it for the longest of the infinity,"'Some infinities are bigger than other infinities' says my favorite quote from the movie (and the book) and its true because I am going to love this movie for the longest of the infinity. I am a huge fan of the book and one thing which really makes the movie stand out is an amazing performance by Shailene Woodley. She is outstanding in every scene she is and I have to say I am kind of in love with Hazel. Even though its a love story of a girl who has terminal cancer I wouldn't say that the film is tragic rather the film is about living your life to the fullest in your 'little infinity' If you have already read the book, the film is true to the book and the great acting, directing and music adds another dimension to the story. The Fault In Our Stars is definitely one of the best romantic movies ever. When you see this movie you are going to laugh and you are going to cry and when the end credit roles I can guarantee most of you are going to be completely in love with this love story.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bring Kleenex. Lots of Kleenex.,"Wow. Being an avid book reader, I'm always skeptical about watching the words of my favorite books transformed and materialized on the big screen... but TFIOS stayed true to the book. The movie was absolutely lovely from beginning to end. The young actors were great. The comedy hit on all the right notes, the romance made your heart smile and the tragedy pulled at your heart strings. It really was a wonderful adaptation, and I believe it stayed as true to the book as possible without many changes where there were any. The minute it was over, I wanted to watch it again. Upon leaving the theater, I looked around and there was not one dry eye. Not even the men. If you are a big fan of the book, like myself... and are skeptical about whether this stays true. Don't be. Kudos the John Green on his first film adaptation. It was an absolute success. I'd give it a 10 out of 10 if I could... but I don't believe in ""perfect.""",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

I've Saved my Ten for This Film,"Before I continue with this review, please note that I have not read the book, but am going to in the very near future :) Please note that Im also a (straight) guy... not that it matters :PWow what can I say about this movie. From the moment the title sequence starts, I was hooked straight away. Scene to scene this movie just manages to suck me into this beautiful world of Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters. The chemistry between Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elsort is astounding and the performances were astonishing. Honestly, this is the best movie I have seen all year, even better than Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Godzilla which was a massive surprise. I just thought this was going to be another teenie love story and boy was I wrong. I loved this movie and recommend it to everyone across all ages. I'm rambling on and praising the movie now so I should probably get on with the review.The direction and cinematography was fantastic. Not a single shot felt odd or out of place. Every shot matched the scene and felt real. The editing was also great as shot after shot matched with the characters faces and where they were (typical good movie editing stuff).The acting perhaps was one of the best aspects of this movie. Seriously it makes the two characters feel real and alive, and at times I forgot this was fiction and not based on a true story. Their performances were so heartfelt and definitely Oscar worthy in my opinion. But knowing the academy this is just another teenie love story that will not be acknowledged at all. Hopefully I'm wrong, but thats the way it normally is.This is the first movie this year that I have given a 10. I don't give out 10's easily, but there was seriously nothing wrong with this film. The pacing was perfect, the acting was phenomenal, the direction, editing and cinematography was exceptional and overall, this movie is one of the best romantic comedies that have ever touched the face of the earth. I encourage EVERYONE to go see this movie no matter what age you are and bring a packet of tissues as well. You'll need it.10/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The Fault Is Not in Our Stars, But in Ourselves??","The Fault in Our Stars was good. It was funny and certainly heart gripping. I thought Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort did a great job. Overall the story itself was magnificent, albeit there were several faults in the film itself.The editing was awkward at times and there were noticeable contradictory mistakes that I will not dwell on other than to say (without spoiling anything) that there is a teleporting basketball trophy... See if you can spot it!! I also felt that the framing was too narrow at times and some of the two frame shots were unnecessary and distracting. My last and largest problem was that there is a huge difference in what works in a book and what works on film. Some scenes can feel odd – and that is because they are out of place. In addition, the themes could have been much stronger and left us in really thinking. Sadly the film did not quite make it.I may be focusing too much on the negatives. I did rather enjoy the film and thought the book was fantastic. I would recommend it to anyone contemplating. Enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Was this shot on film? Cause there's a lot of chemistry involved!,"This movie, simply put, is worth each and every one of its 125 minutes. Including the closing credits, that you need to dry your eyes and think about what you just saw. It's the inspiring story of two young people who are no different then all of us, as they both are in the process of dieing. Though Hazel Grace and Augustus are more aware of this fact of life; because their eternity"" has an expiration date, set by Hazels terminal illness: Cancer.As the viewer is put on an emotional roller-coaster, alongside the feelings and attitudes towards life and love the two teens share, this movie will be a key to many locked doors in the recepients minds. And through these doors we are lead by an ensemble of actors who are amazingly sensitive in their portrayal of personalities and emotions.The writing and directing is so brilliantly executed, that you have sympathy with every character this movie so caringly brings to (short) life. Even when they oppose another you feel unable to take sides. Because you find yourself sharing both. And when the credits role - like the tears on your cheek - you realize, that these opposing views are one and the same after all: Life.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Star is Shailene Woodley,"Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) is tired of her parents (Laura Dern, Sam Trammell)'s help and the support of the support groups. The doctor diagnose her as depressed. That is until she meets Augustus (Ansel Elgort) at a support group meeting. He's a one-legged cancer survivor who share the same view of life. Hazel gives Augustus a book 'An Imperial Affliction' written by Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe) to read. Van Houten invites them to visit him in Amsterdam, but the meeting doesn't turn out the way they hoped.This is a perfectly OK teen melodrama with a great performance from Shailene Woodley. She nails this character through the ups and downs. Her scene with Willem Dafoe in Amsterdam is terrific. She doesn't just hold her own but she comes out on top. Ansel Elgort is too one dimensional. I think that has a lot to do with the writing. He is all sugary charms. Even his bad driving is engineered to endear him to the audience. He's not a real person but rather a manufactured character.This movie could do with some swearing. This is where the MPAA rating system really screws with a movie. It's a movie that needs the PG rating. As such, bad language that would fit these characters' situation is just gone. One would expect these characters to have the gallows humor and the swear words to match. I guess there isn't much the filmmakers can truly do about it. One scene that encapsulates the movie for me is the kiss in Anne Frank's house. As the kiss develops, I thought that this is going to be awkward. Once they start kissing, the scene actually is touching. It works and then everybody starts clapping. It becomes over-written. It's a movie with a great young star that is trying to do something interesting but just tries too hard with its writing.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A movie above grade ten,"It's a romantic movie even if it's full of drama! It's a movie you really have to learn! A masterpiece, as I was rarely given to see!

I've never cried so much in my entire life.,"I don't really cry in movies unless they're really, really sad. And this movie is bound to get you crying like there's no tomorrow. I brought a box of tissues and I used about half of them. I have never cried so much in my entire life. Being an avid fan of the book, I was kind of scared that like some of my other favourite books, the movie would be ruined. But no, the movie had all of the book's materials in it (except for one thing). I never thought Shailene and Ansel would play Hazel and Gus, but when I watched it, their performance blew me away. I think Shailene's ability to cry got ME crying, because that's how real it felt. It is an amazing movie, and I'm sorry to say that it's even better than A Walk to Remember. Go see this movie, and if you do, maybe read the book first so that you can be somewhat prepared!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly Heartfelt,"I went into this movie expecting a stupid teenager-drama. I haven't read the book and I'm not really a love story type of guy. And although many people may see it as just that, a stupid teenage love story, I was very positively surprised. It was actually cute and funny, and I really enjoyed it. It might still have a few klischeè teenage movie things, and it might try to be all inspirational, but It felt real and heartfelt. I was also positively surprised by the performances, which were nicely and lovingly done. It was sad but at the same time gave you a warm, chummy feeling. So if you like a good love story that has a little humour to it, but manages to crush you a little as well, I highly recommend this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
We call it LOVE,"Imagining a day without love has become impossible since I watched this movie. No matter which kind of love we focus on, what really matters is this that an antidote to all poisons and a key for all doors has been summarized into 4 words; LOVE.It was a year ago when I started reading John Green's novel, ""The Fault In Our Stars"". I found out from the first pages that at least one guy could finally find a new way to anecdote a romance story and do believe in this fact that this guy could make a revolution in this genre. Actually, as a person who usually writes about different subjects, I had never ever thought about this kind of relationship. A relationship between two teenagers whom both suffer from cancer and in a way are strange. Not only the idea of this story is something pure but also the words which writer's used to communicate better with readers are among the best ones. anyway, accept my apology because we are here not for the book's review but because of the movie's one.Like all the reviews I have here on IMDb, screenplay is the first item in which I'm interested to talk to you about it. As you know when you want to make a movie out of a successful novel or story which has acclaimed critical praises without any pictures, you have a hard job to do not only because of this fact that you are not able to change everything you want but also because of this fact that maybe changing words affects reader's mind. Here the writers could've done their job in its best way. Just follow these four simple steps and then you will find out why I'm telling you this. 1-Open The Book 2-Read It 3-Watch The Movie 4-Review The Book , and you feel that you've seen all the things you expected without any deficiencies. That's exactly the reason I know this title as an important movie. Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber have done their best.About the casts, I searched, but couldn't find anyone better than Shailene Woodley as Hazel and Ansel Elgort as Gus. We've seen them before in the Divergent but here they show how good they are. Two things would be enough to prove their abilities; The way Ansel Elgort tries to communicate with all audiences and his co star by his body language and without any dialogue and sometimes just by staring into Hazel's eyes which shows that he has overwhelmed by his role and his character and the way Hazel tries to convince you she is in love with Gus. So, they've done their job perfectly. Actually, I've become one of their fans since I watched this movie and their amazing collaboration with each other.As a conclusion, I prefer to write about the best scene of the movie, based on my own opinion. I think the scene that Gus asked Hazel to write him a funeral speech and asked her to read it in front of him, while he was alive and was there in his own funeral ceremony, was the best scene. The way they became sad, the way they became happy by reviewing their memories and etc. all together would be enough to convince you how memorable this scene is.I think if you are interested in romance movies you should watch this movie. Believe me! it's a good one.Best Regards,Amin Ghanbari",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
To A Fault,"This film is mildly recommended.No, the fault is in the story, a simple tale of two teenagers coping with The Big C. Based on the popular YA book, the film, as well as its source, is marketed for an adolescent audience, which is certainly not me. While the subject is adult and serious, the treatment is purely superficial and saccharine. Let's begin to count the ways this weepie manipulates its audience and is a disservice to any cancer survivor:￼1. The Stereotypical Young Lovers: As with all romantic films, the couple must be good- looking and adorable, but more so, the two doomed partners need to be brave and stoic as they buck the odds to keep their love alive. Here, for your approval are Hazel (Shailene Woodley) and Gus (Ansel Elgot), two teenagers who meet cute at a cancer support group and fall head over heels in love. They suffer, as they must, but as one character ruefully points out,""Pain deserves to be felt."" Unfortunately, I felt the pain and suffered as does the audience as they spout positive bromides about survival and love rather than real teenage conversation.2. Dumb Plotting: Director Josh Boone helms the story fairly well, amid all the suds. The screenplay is based on John Green's popular novel and Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber rarely stray from the source material. Both set these lovers on a absurd journey to Amsterdam in order to meet a writer (well played by Willem Dafoe) whose book inspired them to move on with their lives. (This particular section of the film is where I gave up all hope for any sense of truth to enter the picture. Especially cloying is a scene in the Anne Frank house that defies any resemblance to reality.)￼3. Inconsistent Acting: The Fault in Our Stars does have one stellar performance at its core which slightly elevates the movie. Ms. Woodley is the perfect heroine to play Hazel, bringing nuance and a fine degree of distinction to her melodramatic role. She keeps the mellow at bay and is convincing in her dramatic turns. This talented actress invests in her character and so does the moviegoer. Not the same can be said about her co-star, Mr. Elgort, who brings his puppy dog eyes and handsomeness to the forefront. No subtlety here. It's a surface performance without much depth, a look-good-and-read-your-lines performance. This throws the whole love story out of kilter. (Strong support is also given by Laura Dern and Sam Trammell as Hazel's devoted parents, less than good support by Nat Wolff in the thankless role of as their wacky sick friend, Isaac.)4. Unrealistic Treatment of an Illness: The film is relentless in its shallow depiction of its disease, always looking at the sunny side of life and looking away from the harrowing effects of cancer. Dying is such an unpleasantness, a mild interruption of life in The Fault is in Our Stars. For every realistic display showing the effects of this debilitating illness, there are an infinite number of life-affirming uplifting moments that overplay the characters' circumstances. The couple's grim fates are always just out of reach, but rarely seen in the true context of death. Death is ugly, but not here. The film doesn't want to be too much of a downer after all.￼5. A Slow Death Indeed: In conclusion, romantic doom is profitable in films. Screen junkies love a good cry. Look at some past winners in this tear-jerking category: An Affair to Remember, Bridges of Madison County, Ghost, Titanic, The Notebook, Dr. Zhivago, and the granddaddy of all soapy romantic movies, Love Story. The rare few that merit our tears can even be exemplary movies, films that have been sensitively rendered: Gone With the Wind, Brokeback Mountain, Brief Encounter and the two films that always do me in, Casablanca, and Roman Holiday. Those films have the words and pictures and stars in perfect alignment. Just as many soap operas before this, The Fault in Our Stars tries hard but it doesn't earn every drop of moisture lodged in those tear ducts. It may get that whimpering reaction by its final scenes, but that's mostly due to the luminous Shailene Woodley.Well, I guess every generation needs a Love Story. But as for me...I'll always have Paris or Rome. GRADE: B-Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.comNOTE: The film poster uses a clever tag line along with the subtle oxygen tubes to hint at the plight of the lovers.

"A tad predictable, but very touching/strong performances from Woodley/Elgort.","Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort both have arrows strongly pointing upwards. Both shine brightly in this movie and suck you in from the get- go. Following up their (sibling) pairing in Divergent, they both flash a wide range of chops here. Woodley is charming and smart, and Elgort majorly surprised me showing off a comical side. Also very smart.I won't spoil anything, but I did not read the book so I had no/low expectations and was sucked in early on, and definitely was attached to the characters throughout. It's a great story and it tugs on your heart. Loved it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Interesting love between physically doomed souls,"Great photography, super performance from Laura Dern, and a cute love duet between Gus and Hazel, interminably shot from favorable angles to highlight their good looks. Facial expressions are repeated ad nauseum, not to reveal anything about their personalities but because they are such darlings (get your hankies out - quick!)In between, you see a fellow who loses his girlfriend because he is about to become blind as a result of cancer in the retina, and who takes revenge by pelting her car with rotten eggs.And you get Willem Defoe as a do gooder who pays Gus and Hazel a trip to Amsterdam but is really nasty at heart. Incidentally, the touristy shots of lovely Amsterdam probably paid for this flick - in fact, under the veneer of a sensitive, romantic love story, you have the hard reality of Hazel's parents who can't afford to take their terminally ill daughter abroad but then do so with great abandon and at obviously great financial cost. Financial tightness does not stop anyone taking rooms at the most expensive hotel in Amsterdam and drinking the best champagne.The syrupy eulogies at the end add a further dimension to the falsehood at the heart of this movie. No one suffering from the fatal diseases affecting the characters in this movie should be under any illusion that this is a pic designed to make money under the pretense of making people feel better about the always difficult subject of death.I suppose I'm too cynical and I've lived and loved too much to be conned by this copout.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
True to the book,"I read the book several months ago and have been anxious for the movie. So this grandmother went with her 16 yr old grandson who had also read the book. We are both happy with the adaptation. The story of two teens with cancer who meet in a support group for teens, neither want sympathy and both knowing they will die - want to live life. They exchange books and because of the ending of one and the questions they have - they email the author in Amsterdam. Because he had not used up is 'wish' they end up being able to go there and have the chance to meet the author. Willam Defoe portrays the alcoholic author so well - you do not like him. Gus also tells Hazel something he has been keeping from her. Gus and Hazel have their ups and downs and knowing their time may be limited their love is fresh and true - and presented so well. All the acting is good, the sets, the music -and there is a lot of music but I did not notice most of it - a sign of a good movie score. I volunteer in a hospice facility and it was so good to see the presentation of their cancer as real. Their feelings of what they are going thru as real. I will read the book again and see the movie again - it is worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Treads a fine line so that it really works,"This could so easily have gone wrong: a story about two teenagers facing life- threatening cancer risks being overly-sentimental but, while being a real tear-jerker, this treads the fine line with skill and warmth. Hazel has thyroid lesions which have metastasised to her lungs and throughout the film wears a breathing tube and lugs around a portable oxygen tank. Gus has n osteosarcoma condition which has stabilised after the amputation of one leg. They meet at a support group for youngsters experiencing cancer and her favourite novel, ""An Imperial Affliction"", takes them to Amsterdam where nothing goes as they expect.Since the movie is based on a best-selling young adult novel by John Green, it will find a ready audience in spite of its serious subject, but those who don't know the novel (like me) will find this an impressive and moving work because of the fine acting by the two leads - Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort, both of whom star in the ""Divergent"" series - and the assured direction by young Josh Boone. Of course, it is easy to be cynical about a film like this, dismissing it as mere manipulation, but ultimately all cinema, indeed all art, is manipulative and this is not a self-pitying, rather a life-affirming, tale.Footnote: The title of the novel and the film comes from Shakespeare's ""Julius Caeser"" when Cassius declares: ""The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in ourselves, that we are underlings"". For Hazel and Gus, their cancer is in the stars but their response to such tragedy is ultimately in themselves.",,Anonymous,Romance
Tiresome and Too Long Romance,"The seventeen year-old Hazel Grace (Shailene Woodley) has lung cancer and needs to carry everywhere an oxygen tank. Her mother Frannie (Laura Dern) encourages her to go to a cancer support group against her will. However, when Hazel meets the eighteen year-old Gus (Ansel Elgort), who lost part of one leg with cancer but apparently is cured, they fall in love with each other. Hazel introduces her favorite novel to Gus and tells that she dreamed on having a conversation with the author, Van Houten (Willem Dafoe), who lives in Amsterdam. Gus contacts him and Van Houten invites them to visit him in Amsterdam. They travel to Netherlands with Frannie where Hazel will learn that things are not like they seem to be.""The Fault in Our Stars"" is a tiresome and too long romance. The story has a promising beginning, sort of Gus Van Sant's ""Restless"" and supported by the good performances and chemistry of the young lead couple, but the film should have been edited to become shorter. In the end, it becomes a melodramatic Mexican soap opera. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""A Culpa é das Estrelas"" (""The Fault is from the Stars"")",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Just okay,"More likely backed-up by best-selling novel from John Green, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is an honest yet faithful love story which containing some positive messages to inspire teenagers. The plot flows as a good drama should be, thanks to screenwriter Scott Neustadter and Michael H Weber who finely adapt John Green's genius idea into a soulful play and beautiful drama. The script for two central characters, Hazel Grace and Gus are well developed. It really shows how Hazel's feeling to Gus grows as much time they've spent together and how they need each other to live despite their imperfect conditions. Besides that, the movie seems taking advantages from Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort's chemistry who easily makes an adorable couple and put some sweet moments from it.Unfortunately, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" isn't without it's faults. The other characters beside Hazel and Gus may only just supplement, seems unimportant and sometimes annoying like Van Houten character who looks stupid with his strange behavior and builds an awkward scene every time he appears. Also the film emphasizes more on meeting true love rather than people's attempt on surviving from cancer that makes it missing some points. Don't expect the drama would be as complex as ""50/50"" or ""Dallas Buyers Club"", because what ""The Fault in Our Stars"" offers is much focus on couple dating and having romantic dinner. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is an average good and sweet drama supported by lovely performances from it's two impeccable stars. But nothing much you could get in it that makes this movie felt just enough on being okay.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Will Hold Your Interest Even If You Don't Get Into The ""Sad Stuff""","When I sat down to watch ""The Fault In Our Stars"", I was worried that it would be nothing but a ""kleenex box flick"". Much like guys can be drawn to the theater with the right quota of explosions, special effects, and superheroes, the same can often be said for women only with really sad stories. That is kind of how this movie is marketed too...as a real tear-jerker. Luckily, the film does enough besides the ""waterworks"" moments to keep your interest throughout. It isn't just all sadness and crying.For a basic plot summary, this movie focuses on Hazel (Shailene Woodley), a teenager living with a rare form of cancer that makes her (in her own words) a ""ticking time bomb"". At a cancer support group (that Hazel usually loathes, of course), she meets Gus (Ansel Elgort), a fellow youngster who also happens to have a less-severe form of cancer. The two strike up a conversation, which leads to a friendship, which leads to a romance. Through a mutual interest in a mysterious author (played by Willem Dafoe), Hazel, her parents (played by Laura Dern & Sam Trammell), and Gus go off on a ""last wish"" adventure to find this author and have him explain the ending of his most famous book.I won't go into any spoilers on what makes this movie so ""sad"", but when you consider it is about two kids with cancer, you can probably put two and two together. If you are into emotional speeches and heart-stirring (for better or worse) scenarios, then you will indeed need a tissue box handy. However, even a 28-year old male like me was able to sit through the film without rolling my eyes or tuning out. Though coated with adolescent angst and high-profile teen actors, the kernel of emotion transferred from the core of the story (although I have not read the book, so I can't get into the differences) to the big screen remains poignant.""The Fault In Out Stars"" probably gets a bit of a ""bum rap"" right now because the general market is so saturated with these types of stories. I kind of compare it to ""The Giver"" in that regard. Yet, one must remember that is was John Green's book that practically STARTED this entire genre; it just took awhile for it to get transferred to Hollywood.On my personal ranking scale this movie would get a 3.5-star ranking, but I'll bump it up to four stars here because it is a touching story with even a little comedy and light-heartedness thrown into the mix.

the fault in the adaptation,"One of the best things about TFIOS was the voice of Hazel. It put a great, creative spin on an otherwise common disease story. We don't entirely lose it here. It's in the narration, and in her speech. Some of the book's whimsy comes out with cute choices like placing text messages into speech bubbles above the characters' heads in the book's font. But...from the beginning, we lose the Hazel's wry commentary, and the movie treats the kids' diseases as the most pressing issues, rather than their mental grappling with them. When Augustus is introduced, he is practically stalkerish in his attention toward Hazel, which is forgivable only because of his cuteness. From here on in, it's all twee cuteness. Augustus is a wonderful, but impossibly movie-like boyfriend who would probably get on your nerves in real life, and would also probably be hiding a terrible secret. The movie is not as pressing as the book when we go to Amsterdam to meet the author that inspires her. There's very little urgency or conflict. The movie delivers sweetness and young love, and it truly is sweet, but at times it loses the flavor of the book. I will also say the wardrobe and art direction are terrible, and that I'm not sold on Shailene Woodley's star quality. Even though her man has one leg, it still seems he could do better. I'm knocking this movie a lot, but I will recommend. The preview audience seemed to laugh and cry in all the right places.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Shailene Woodley is amazing,"Not as bad as I expected from the trailer, not as good as I had hoped after seeing the reviews. It's not all that great, but it's not bad either. It's shamelessly, even overly sentimental, totally unsubtle, but hey, it works somewhat most of the time. Probably the biggest reason for this is Shailene Woodley. I remember thinking she was really impressive in The Descendants, even in her limited screen time. Then I saw her in The Spectacular Now, and yes, I became a bigger fan. She's pretty amazing here, an actress completely capable of naturally selling the roles she plays, without making them ever feel artificial or contrived. I wish her a long, very successful career, and when it comes to certain things, she's better than the current it-girl Jennifer Lawrence. Ansel Elgort doesn't fare as well. He has some good scenes, but somehow he just comes across pretty unconvincing.",,Anonymous,Romance
Film Reviews: The Fault In Our Stars/www.nightfilmreviews.com,"I have never been surrounded by so many teenage girls before until I sat down to watch this film. During an early screening of the alluring teenage film adaptation of John Green's novel The Fault In Our Stars, I was surely the minority of the sexes. To be honest, I don't think I knew exactly how outnumbered I was until the film's tragic scenes unfolded, delivering a current of waterworks and overwhelmingly loud wails of screaming, crying and sniffling, predominantly from female audience members. This early screening of the film was jam-packed, and had me sitting only a row away from the massive screen. If Josh Boone's film adaptation of The Fault In Our Stars taught me anything, it's to never underestimate the power of teenage girls and their ability to pack theaters and show their support for films and books they love.The Fault In Our Stars is guilty of possessing a number of faults, but its biggest sin lies in its persistence to aspire to be greater than it actually is. It succeeds when it exposes us to the tragic relationship between its protagonists and the loved ones around them, and fails when it aspires to find new territory of plot and redemption for characters that are already born with unlimited amounts of pathos.Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) is as much a teenage girl as any other living in the United States. Her love of reality television, reading and curiosity of the taboo is just as strong as other girls within America. The only difference: Hazel Grace has terminal cancer. The Fault In Our Stars should be a film about cancer and how it effects the people surrounded by it (think 50/50), but it becomes overwhelming with its fascination to overly glamorize the telling of a tainted love story, therefore becoming a love story about people with cancer (think A Walk To Remember).From the beginning, love, life and happiness are overshadowed by impending doom, and that is perhaps the problem with the film. No matter how much you fall in love with Hazel Grace or Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), their fates are sealed. Green's novel may have been about telling a heart-breaking love story between young teens, but much like Hazel's fascination with her favourite book and the open endedness of a certain literary character, Hazel's happiness is less about coming to terms with death, and more about the continuation of the life of her loved ones. The interactions with the people who will survive and live well beyond Hazel's existence are never given their due diligence on-screen, especially her mother (played delicately by Laura Dern), always being pushed aside by the love story that will ultimately end in unhappiness and tears.There is sure to be a reason why Green's novel has becomes such a pop culture sensation. The film is said to be a somewhat loyal adaptation, brimming with very clever metaphors of life and death through dialogue and foreshadowing. It does a masterful job of fetishizing the most average looking parks, backyards and parking lots, and makes great use of its supporting actors. Sadly, the two actors that have the most screen time are the two weakest components of the film. Woodley, who is slowly following in the footsteps of Emma Stone and Jennifer Lawrence, seems to play Hazel Grace less, and herself more. With the exception of her chopping off her hair and having an oxygen tank follow her around everywhere she goes, Woodley only taps the surface of her character Hazel Grace, barely gracing audiences with the brilliance radiating with the promise of such a philosophically pessimistic character.Elgort, who comes off as a character who is easy to fall in love with, shows much of his charm and promise as a young actor. Elgort as Waters shimmers with potential, delivering a performance of a person who may be a little too cherry and perfect, given sad circumstances.Green had said to gain the inspiration of the novel by working as a student chaplain at a children's hospital. Drawn to the exuberant life of its terminally ill patients, Green is quoted as saying he wanted to write a book about people who were constantly being dehumanized, while showcasing the abundance of humanity in people with a terminal illness. The film does an excellent job of making audiences believe that love is what keeps Hazel and Augustus alive. Love becomes the answer, but only for so long before the inevitability of death at the end of a terminal illness takes hold. There is a point where love exists, and people fade in the film, and although the relationships that held strong are bonded by love, hope of an improbably oblivion becomes the films main concern.The Fault In Our Stars can be self-assured as being a quality film made for an audience that would be content with half-assed filmmaking. The production quality and storytelling is top- notch, even if its is constantly emotionally manipulating. The soundtrack is filled with hyper ""emo"" songs, the look and feel of the film is drenched with sadness and all hope is lost with each new, depressing plot twist and turn. Thankfully, its supporting cast of actors supports the majority of the film's life. From Lotte Verbeek, a literary assistant who makes the best out of sad situations and breathes new life to new experiences for the couple, to a saddened and miserable author played wonderfully by Willem Dafoe, to the underused best friend to the couple Isaac (played brilliantly by Nat Wolff), the small, brief appearances by the people in Augustus and Hazel's life are never given enough screen time to show shattering conclusions when sadness strikes.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Well-Meaning Tears!,"To anybody to sees The Fault in Our Stars, male or female, be sure to have a tissue handy. I have seen a countless number of films, and I confess this is the film that may have teared me up the most. This realistic story about two teens with cancer coming together is so sweet, but there is also an emotional weight added to the story because of the subject matter. The film doesn't try to be saccharine, but it tries to be sincere. The movie has a light-hearted tone for the most part, despite the dark subject matter and that I can truly be happy with.Josh Boone's film is about two kids named Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters who fall in love with each other when they meet at a cancer support group. Together they go on adventures with nothing to stop them, not even the Grim Reaper.The film is truly well-acted. Shailene Woodley deserves an Oscar nomination for this role. Her charisma is inspiring and this may be her best performance to date. Ansel Elgort is not too shabby himself. I loved his quirky personality and despite his problems, still has the ability to keep his witty charm. Nat Wolff was very good as Augustus's friend, who had cancer rob him of his eyesight. Laura Dern turned a sympathetic performance as Hazel's mother and Willem Dafoe gave an hateful, but very good performance as the author who influences Hazel.Overall, The Fault in Our Stars is an incredible film. It's a very deep, thought-provoking movie It goes in a lot deeper than a normal romance film would do, and that adds more effect to the film. By the time the end credits rolled, my eyes were dripping with tears and to say that's rare while watching a film is an understatement. A powerful, well- meaning story about cancer-stricken teens falling into such a passionate love.My Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Debbie Downer,"The title reflects my demeanor, not the movie. Perhaps I missed something here, but to me the movie was more about a sweet teenage love story than it was about cancer. I am an adult woman, and I really think this movie was geared towards teenagers who clearly got something out of this that I did not. The acting was really good, but unlike every other viewer, this movie did not touch me as it did others. It was not sad until the end, but it still did not rock me or make me cry. I did not think it was an incredibly depressing film, but it also did not pull me in as much as I thought it would. It's more of a 6.5 and it was worth a Saturday night, but did not live up to the hype in my opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
So little time,"If you think that The Fault In Our Stars is just another teen romance are you in
for a pleasant surprise. You'd better have a good supply of tissues because this
film involves two very special teens. Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley are a
pair of cancer survivors and they just haven't got very much time.With Woodley she's come through cancer of the thyroid and she has the breathing
apparatus as just part of her person now. Her parents naturally worry about 
over straining herself, but Woodley is determined to lead as active a life as she
can.At a cancer survivor support group she meets Ansel Elgort who has really made
quite a name for himself since this film came out. Elgort is a former basketball star who lost a leg to cancer. He is so incredibly quirky and charming in this
part I'm surprised he didn't get Oscar consideration.The two make a trip to Amsterdam to visit an author they admire. Willem Dafoe however has less than meets the eye, still they have a good time. When
they visit the Anne Frank house the symbolism is certainly not lost on the
viewer.The title is a play on Cassius's famous quote from Julius Caesar about the fault
not lying in our stars but in ourselves. There's no fault here for Woodley an
Elgort. Fate has dealt them a cruel and rotten hand and they have to make the most of it.I haven't seen a film move me as much since Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby. Even a Medusa would be reduced to tears with this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Shailene Woodley gives phenomenal performance in a solid film,"This movie took me by surprise. Usually this kind of young adult fare isn't something I go for.. Too watered down and formulaic. And although this one does sometimes stray into pandering melodrama, it's for the most part made with a blunt, matter of fact clarity and heart wrenching realism that needs to be commended. Shailene Woodley has been on the map for a while now, and although she sometimes phones it in in mediocre projects (cough Divergent cough), she has a magnetic star quality and gravitas that pulls you in. She is unbelievable here, playing a hard luck girl in an agonizing situation that no one should have to go through. There are two scenes that she just nails, and raise her performance to award worthy quality. After seeing her in Descendants, White Bird In A Blizzard and now this, I can say she's a new favourite. Ansel Elgort is charming, life affirming as gives excellent work as a fellow cancer patient who falls madly in love with Woodley's character, Hazel Grace. Old pros Laura Dern and Willem Dafoe are superb in supporting roles. At one point Dern say something like "" It's how people have always dealt with pain... You just do it."" This film takes that simple piece of advice and makes its characters make decisions and act accordingly.. Yes what they are going through is horrible, heartbreaking, tragic stuff, but it doesn't cancel out the fact that you are LIVING through it, and can make the choice to do just that: live with whatever time you have, and deal with it as best you can. This is what sets the film apart from a lot of other films of its type.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not your banal weepie; far better,"Over the last couple of decades, terminal-disease-at-youthful-romances are dime-a-dozen in the proliferated Korean flick market, escalating audience symptoms from indigestion to constipation. ""The fault in our stars"", you probably have heard, despite the subject matter, is not one of those.There is one very interesting quote (the circumstances for which are incidental and omitted here): between the 3 of us, we have 5 legs, 4 eyes and 2.5 pair of lungs. The three people are the protagonists Gus (Ansel Elgort, with a smile that wins all), Hazel (Shailene Woodley) and Gus's delightful sidekick Isaac (Nat Wolff, equally delightful), all cancer patients. Gus had one leg amputated from just above the knee; Hazel for all intents and purposes has a plastic oxygen tube anchored to her nostrils all the time (oxygen supplied by a portable cylinder she drags around); Isaac had lost his left eye at the beginning of the movie and then loses the right in the middle of it. Gus has been free from a relapse for a few years; Hazel's situation is ""stable""; while sacrificing both eyes appeared to have preserved Issac's life. But unfortunately, as we all know, nothing is really certain in the fantastic realm of cancer-land.Gus and Hazel meet at a cancer support group and eventually fall in love. This is not something new to the cinematic world so I won't elaborate the details. One thing I want to say is Woodley and Elgort have set a new bar for the meaning of ""chemistry"" in acting together. Separately, they are equally superb. On Hazel's side, another wonderful dimension is in Laura Dern's top-notch portrayal of Hazel's mother Frannie. While this is not a particularly manipulated tearjerker, tear will flow, even more so in the mother-daughter scenes than the lovers' scenes.(additional SPOILER warning)What makes this movie stand out, however, is the reality and cruelty it does not hold back from depicting. A lot of movies with a similar theme would have as the focal point a ""last wish"" sort of scenario, unabashedly manipulated to give an uplifting conclusion. In ""faults"", Hazel has a dream which Gus and Frannie help to realize – to visit an author named Van Houten (a brilliantly casted Willem Dafoe) in Amsterdam. Hazel, in her sickness, clings to a book by Van Houten about a girl who eventually died of cancer. What Hazel (and Gus also) wants to do is ask Van Houten face-to-face when happened to the rest of the people surrounding the girl after her death. To cut a long story short, the three have a dream-like trip to Amsterdam where the young couple is treated to a romantic dinner by the author before the fateful visit the next day. This is where the movie shines: a rude awakening that all these nice correspondence and gestures are offered only by the author's kind-hearted mate. Van Houten turns out to be an obnoxious, ultra-cynical drunk, to such an extent of extracting from our lovely heroine the only four-letter word that appears in the entire movie.All these happen only in the middle of the movie. Ironically, this ""common enemy"" becomes a trigger for the young couple to let go of all their inhibitions and let their love flow. The rest of the movie follows a somewhat familiar trajectory. There is a plot twist which may be unfamiliar to some but I, for one, have seen it elsewhere.Doubtless, there will be discussions emerging from the theatre surrounding thing such as what makes Hazel and Gus tick, is Van Houton truly a villain or just a realistic depiction of a normal human being etc etc. But one thing is certain: you would want to see more of Shailene Woodley's movies, the ""Divergent"" series aside.

Surprisingly emotionally ineffective,"""The Fault in Our Stars"" isn't as bad as it might have been (considering the tastes of 13-year-old girls) but it's also not as good as I was secretly hoping it would be. You see, I'd just watched ""Five Feet Apart"", the movie that seemed an obvious cash-in (or even rip-off) of this one. That was actually somewhat emotionally affecting in places, whereas ""Fault"" surprisingly left me feeling not much of anything.The pacing of the movie is strange, like it's moving too fast despite it also being over-long. The character of the love interest also seems undercooked. A lot of his dialogue feels overly written, where you keep wondering how he was able to come up with such finely honed paragraphs of speech so quickly. I believed, more or less, in the Sprouse character in ""Five Feet"". Teens in movies are always hyper aware of themselves, and Shailene Woodley was an ideal choice for her own contribution to pop culture alongside ""Heathers"" and ""Daria"". Ansel Elsort, though, just doesn't seem ready for it.There are parts of the movie that work, such as the meeting with the writer, played by a great actor I won't reveal here. But then the movie goes to awkward territory, such as the two lovers sharing a make-out session in Anne Frank's house... to the applause of the tourists there. Eh? There was a reason why John Safran made out in her house for real, and that was for shock value. Why would people applaud?I think they needed to go back to the drawing board with this one, and cut out some of the strange, extraneous material. And focus more on the central relationship, which despite being central to the story, feels secondary to it, like we already know they're going to fall in love, so they skip it and just get the show to Amsterdam as soon as possible.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Fault In Our Stars...,"*HERE BE SPOILERS* During the long, drawn-out ending of this movie, I could hear sniffling and noses being blown everywhere. And indeed, if you're looking for a weepy to blub your heart out to, then this could be the film for you. Now, I have to confess on my side... the vision did get slightly blurred... but certainly not the flood-like levels I experienced around me. I last time I saw this level of collective sobbing was Titanic... I guess there's something about a charming pretty boy dying young that sets off the ol' female tear ducts. ""HE HAD ALL HIS LIFE AHEAD OF HIM"". *Snort*... ""Madame, could you please remove your hankie from my lap?!""Anyway, credit where credit is due... this is, for the most part, an engaging portrayal of two intelligent teenage cancer sufferers who don't know what the future holds. Gus appears to be in remission but has had a leg amputated, while Hazel has only one lung after her treatment, and has to lug an oxygen tank with her everywhere. They meet at a support group, which is of course full of false platitudes and unhelpful advice. The couple connect almost instantly in this staid atmosphere, and before long they're swapping books and sharing their own unique brand of black comedy.In fact, they make a perfect match... which makes it all the more tragic that inevitably, one (or both) will pass away soon. Come on... you've seen the way this movie is marketed... you weren't expecting a happy ending. But before she shuffles off this mortal coil, Hazel wants to meet the author of her favourite novel in the flesh... because the story he wrote had an unsatisfactory conclusion that she wants elaborating on. One problem: he now lives in isolation in Amsterdam, and she doesn't have the money to get there. Plus, her health may be at risk during the flight. Thanks to Gus and her family's efforts though, her dreams come true...The trip to Holland is eye-opening in more ways than one, as our intrepid duo have an unforgettable three days. Sadly, it's all downhill from there as events take a turn for the worst.The film does begin to lose some of it's power by becoming a bit too melodramatic, and the previously witty dialogue turns rather flowery to this trained ear. Still, it studiously avoids maudlin sentiment for the most part... So I suppose we can allow it to get a little morose during the climax. As long as old biddies seated nearby could be more careful with their snotrags in the future. Jeez... 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A fault indeed,"I'm gonna be real, I don't watch many romantic movies so I'm not an expert in the Romance genre. I gave this movie 3 stars for argument's sake, I don't wanna be completely biased when I knew what I was getting myself into. That being said...This movie was all the rage when it came out and my friends were peer pressuring me to go see it so we did. I honestly couldn't care less whether Hazel lived or died or her whole ordeal (as cold-hearted as that may sound) because she's an obnoxious, selfish, self-centered spoiled brat. She goes as far as telling her parents she knows they won't get over her probable death and basically their whole lives would be over, to which they basically replied ""nah mate we cool"" (understandably so). I also don't think cancer patients look that healthy or athletic (ie Gus), but what do I know? The only character that I felt was in touch with reality is the writer, but of course angsty teen princess Hazel wants none of this BS. How dare he tell her to get over herself?! I don't even wanna touch the scene where they go to Anne Frank House, because it'll make me reconsider my 3 stars rating and I'm struggling to keep an open mind about this movie. I really am.If a movie about a bunch of spoiled brats is supposed to make us sympathize with them just because they have cancer, then I guess I'm cold as ice.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Fault in Our Stars was a touching teen drama about a young couple with cancer,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both were touched by the story of a couple of young adults, Hazel (Shailene Woodley) and Gus (Ansel Elgort), both of whom have cancer, and their eventual love affair. One thing they bonded over was a novel about another character with their disease which got them to take a trip to Holland to meet the book's author, Van Houten (Willem Dafoe). I'll stop there and just say there's plenty of touching moments between the couple but also some funny scenes and lines to offset some of the sadness.

No fault in these stars,"""The fault in our stars"" is an amazing love story reminding us that it doesn't always end happily ever after. Bringing a movie out of a book is never an easy task, especially not when it's an amazing book like this. Due to this fact I arrived at the theater with some skepticism and concerns. 20 minutes into the movie those thoughts were completely blown away, replaced with only good ones. My reason? The cast. Apart from the mother, who wasn't the mother I had gotten to know in the book, the cast was impeccable. Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort, Nat Wolff, Willem Dafoe(even though I'm not a fan in general) all made this movie into what it is. This combined with a fantastic score, and some absolutely beautiful scenes took this movie to different heights than I was able to predict. Astonishing. Making this movie better than the book was a mission impossible, but they sure made a noble attempt. One last shoutout goes to Shailene Woodley who was able to capture the character I grew so fond of in the book perfectly. I rarely use the word perfection but it certainly fits the bill in this particular scenario. To me Shailene, you are Hazel Grace Lancaster.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not entirely cliche, but also not entirely enjoyable","I think most people have heard enough about The Fault in Our Stars to know what they are getting into. So, making complaints about the way it manipulated me emotionally seems a bit foolish. Yes, it is a tearjerker, much like any movie that deals with cancer and death. I expected to cry a number of times with this film, and I did. That's neither a good thing nor a bad thing, because it's what I anticipated, the only thing I was hoping for was that I'd get something else I didn't expect. This kind of heavy romantic drama can utilize a lot of clichés, and I was hoping this one was beloved because it broke the mold a bit. In some ways it did, I was particularly pleased that they didn't fall into the trope of the jealous and controlling parents who don't approve of their daughter's romantic relationship. Instead they were kind and loving parents who merely wanted what was best for their daughter.There's another somewhat unexpected element to the story, but I'd rather not discuss that in case someone reading this plans on seeing the film someday. I think where The Fault in Our Stars disappointed me, though, was in the plotline of the author. I won't go into too much detail, but a lot of weight is put on a particular book in the film, and there are some interactions with the author of that book which I found to be a frustrating cliché. It feels like a cheap plot construction merely to get the main character to face her fears, instead of a useful part of the story. Aside from that, I can't criticize too much about The Fault in Our Stars, but I also can't say it's all that enjoyable to watch. I suppose if you're in the mood for a therapeutic cry, then this might be the film that could accomplish that for you, but watching teens suffering with cancer and facing their inevitable death isn't my idea of a good time.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"'Okay?'  'Okay.' Perhaps, 'okay' will be our 'always.'","Based on John Green's immensely popular novel by the same name, adapted for the screen with extreme skill by Scott Neustader and Michael H. Weber, and directed with sensitivity and taste by Josh Boone THE FAULT IN OUR STARS steps so far beyond expectations that it may just be another Nicholas Sparks young adults tearjerkers and actually becomes one of the more impressive dialogues about death and dying and the meaning and importance of love. Add to that a cast of young actors (an experienced actors) who 'live' their roles and the result is a film that should be experienced by everyone.Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) and Augustus (Ansel Elgort) are two teenagers who share an acerbic wit, a disdain for the conventional, and a love that sweeps them on a journey. Their relationship is all the more miraculous, given that Hazel's other constant companion is an oxygen tank, Gus jokes about his prosthetic leg, and they meet and fall in love at a cancer support group. Add to that the presence of Gus' best friend Isaac (Nat Wolff) who also has cancer which makes him lose his eyes (and his mental stability at times) and we have a trio of youth facing enormous odds who end up discovering the real meaning of being alive in the world and the importance of love. Hazel's parents are (for once in film) sincerely supportive in the face of a dying child and realistically portrayed by the brilliant Laura Dern and Sam Trammel. Hazel and Gus travel to Amsterdam to visit Hazel's favorite novelist Van Houten (Willem Dafoe) and discover he is a smarmy drunk who lives with the compassionate Lidewij (Lotte Verbeek). Sharing how the story plays out would involve spoilers for those who have not read the book.The on screen chemistry between Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgot sends this film into that rarefied realm of becoming a classic.

A Fault of Feelings,"For everyone who has waited for this in a long time: It would be amazing to finally see a movie turn out to be so much like the book. They use the little quotes, the big lines everything. Okay not every detail can be in it but we must forgive that. Look at other movies which don't even come close to the book. No this Movie is a good one. It is obvious that John Green was at the set and helped out if it wasn't going the way the book was going.However compared to all the emotion in the book, I must admit that in the movie it was barely. Of course I cried, I'm a girl come on. However I didn't really cry because of what happened on the screen but more because I thought how that felt when I read it in the book. I think that they could have done a much better job with the emotions. There were a lot of people crying in the cinema, so I doubt if they agree with me but I found it all with all a bit emotionless for the person who watched it. It was for example just Hazel crying.

Far too Overwrought - even for a Cancer film.,"'The Fault in our Stars' ...eh.It's a Cancer film, expect to get sad as the stereotypical boy next door helps lonely girl come out of her shell.For me it was just far too overwrought with the love story angle, I think it was the amount of 'lovey dovey' speeches they made, when there was a lot more room for displaying the love rather than pausing for a whole page monologue about it. Ithich made the pacing of the story a bit choppy and too ""Shakespeare in the Park"" feeling.The performances from the cast were just OK. Shalene Woodley definitely stood out however. They certainly would've shone even brighter with better source material.Wait for this to come on Cable.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"As An Avid Fan Of The Book, I Was Thrilled With The Movie","Wow. I just left the theater, so I'm still a bit teary. This movie did what is so rare in movie adaptations of books nowadays - it stuck to the story faithfully. The acting is excellent and the pacing is great. At first I was unsure if I liked the lead actors because they were so different from what I pictured when reading the book, but they quickly proved themselves. Ansel and Shailene play off each other very well and they did the characters justice. I was a blubbering mess for the last thirty or forty minutes. The story is beautiful and it carries such a great message. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"The book was WAY better, read the book.","I know, many movie goers are probably sick of hearing that from book lovers, but it is a fitting statement for this movie.John Green's descriptions are just so beautiful and eloquent and at the same time really easy to read. I seriously could not put this book down. I started just browsing and I couldn't stop reading. It was amazing.Which was why I was quite disappointed that some of my favorite lines from the book were not in the movie.I also found it hard to see the two actors as lovers, after seeing them as brother and sister in Divergent.Overall there wasn't anything bad about this movie, it just didn't quite do the book justice, and dragged on a bit towards the end.If you have not read the book, I think it is very likely you will enjoy this movie much more than I did.If you have read the book, I don't think it's worth seeing the film.But if you have seen the film, it is definitely worth getting your hands on the book!

"I don't know many large words, but this movie was really something special.","I had only known about this movie having seen John Green talk of it. He wrote the story, though I haven't read it. I read an article saying the book had been banned. All to unfortunate. I just want to say that I think these are the kind of stories that should be enforced, not revoked. This movie is captivating in that you want to just watch, but instead you're held closely, cozy in the web. It's riveting, because it's so simple but induces your conscious. The grade was peaceful, the dialogue was written for the story, not the moment. This movie just does it for me. I'm not good with descriptions, but this story is told very naturally, and I think it's best had on a nice winter night by a fireplace, with a window cracked.

I Really Really Enjoyed 'The Fault in Our Stars',"First off i must say that i have not yet read the book by John Green. I remember watching the trailer to this movie months ago and thinking that i wasn't completely sold on it.However, i do know one thing. I do enjoy watching movies starring Shailene Woodley. She is a fantastic actress. I remember seeing her in 'The Spectacular Now' and thinking how great she was. I actually didn't care for that movie, but i did like her performance. She was believable.'The Fault in Our Stars'... is a great movie. Once again i thoroughly enjoyed Shailene's performance. She just plays the role of the average girl in high school/college so well. She's beautiful, but it's not only her looks which carry such a movie. Her character(s) in these coming of age movies really shines because she gets it and does it (acting) very well.I felt like this movie was divided into three acts. In the first act, i struggled a bit to find the characters believable, specially Augustus. I felt like his character was trying too hard. It wasn't until the second act when i realized the characters started to grow on me and i found the characters believable.The third act in the movie is fantastic and really proved to be the strongest for all the characters involved. You really feel for these characters and you're thoroughly invested in their journey together.The writing is fantastic. Now that i know how much i enjoyed the second and thirds acts, i'd like to revisit the movie again to enjoy it all over again. It could very well be that i didn't ""get it"" from the beginning because it may have had hints of a clichéd teenage coming of age movie with no substance.This movie is different. There is plenty of substance. The focus is kept mainly on Hazel and Augustus' relationship. These two carry the movie without the need of a big supporting cast. Shailene's performance is fantastic. You really feel for her and her struggles. Specially if you've every known someone who's battled cancer at a young age, specially a teen in high school dealing with the pressures of friendship, fitting in, dating, sex... all of which come with peer pressure. Its all relatable.By the time the third act shows up on the screen, i dare you not to shed a tear or a few. This movie really pulls at the heart strings and it does so wonderfully because of the fantastically written script (and book i presume). This movie (book) contains some great messages. Enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Usual Content but believable acting,"Frankly speaking, I don't have an appetite for love stories but reviewing art critically makes it somewhat bearable. It may well be treated a caution for the fanatics of romance. But if you intend to ignore the repercussions following, you may be my wonderful guests for the post.The movie has actually won several awards but it is ironically only due to the fact that it is more practical than ""A Walk To Remember"". Shailene Woodley may look cute as always but has actually grown as an actor since her last flick ""Spectacular Now"". The movie lacks in the content but manages to engage you till the end quite intelligently. It is actually the acting, direction, and music that works for the movie. The target audience (viewers) is well served for the stupidity. The ""Awww"" or the ""Epic"" class may want to abstain from speaking negative about the movie but for the person with average intellect like me wouldn't.I actually intend to make matters worse for you by rephrasing the title to ""The Fault in Our Content"" and surely I would be advised soon that ""It is the one movie review that I should have never wrote"".

Simply Amazing.,"okay, so before i saw this movie i read the book, and I LOVED it , the movie was a bit different and some characters weren't in the movie, but it was good, no i mean it was great. It's one of the best movies i've even watched, it made laugh and cry, it just simply made me happy. And it's really amazing. I've given almost half the movies i've watched 10/10, but this is the one that truly deserves it. And if i could give this movie a 100 i would, i got so obsessed over it. If you want to watch a romantic movie that'll just make you smile and cry, i really suggest this. It's not like all the cancer love stories or whatever. It's just kind of different, people might say that i'm over rating it, but i sure am not. Everybody has a different taste in movies.

Just another movie about cancer,"It's not that I do not have feelings you know? Or that i do not respect or/and admire people who have or had cancer, it's just that the entire movie fell in a cliché, EVERYTHING. I know that is hard topic, but let's face it,when a film about cancer is in the billboards everybody thinks is a excellent movie when the big C is present in the synopsis. Hollywood had banalized and trivialized the topic, there is a movie almost every year about it, that the people just adore 'em. The industry must look for other ways to show to the common people how hard is the whole topic; The avant- garde films about the topic are not as recognized as they would be (La guerre est déclaréé, or maybe even 50/50 that took the whole drama of the illness with a grown-up patient). It's well done movie, and the end is fresh (yeah, I like the end) but it's still a Hollywood movie made for the teenagers (specially females, really SPECIALLY) who wants to see how love works and then dream about it until they're 30 and they are still singles.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Now THIS is a real love story.,"I'm a guy, so I don't watch chick films or shows unless there's at least something to appeal to men as equally. I figured this would be a typical clichéd sappy love story we've seen before for, like, the 100 time. Surprise surprise! I was proved wrong. I've watched JeremyJahns review this and I refused to believe what he said because he reviewed and liked the Nightmare on Elm Street remake. Apparently, I'm an idiot. This is not just a love story, it's a drama. Two young people suffering from different cancers get together and start becoming friends first even though one of them has an attraction to the other by appearances, but still taking it slow nonetheless; seems logical, and eventually fall in love. And then there you have it. They live out there lives. This reminds me of ""The Bucket List"" These two know the cancer will kill them but they never let it destroy them. They take it in stride--for the most part. I recently saw Shailene Woodley in ""Divergent"" and thought she did okay; the movie kind of felt like a Hunger Games knock-off. But in this? Good lord! She gave an astounding performance of her life. Not once did it feel like she could have done one part a little more or less. I smell an Oscar coming her way! Also, she's freaking beautiful! I think I like her better with short hair. Ansel Elgort does a good job as well. I like that he's this kind of 'I don't care. I'll do whatever I want' guy, but never to a point when he's being a d!ck about it.All in all, it's an impressive love story that doesn't feel clichéd, old, or very...what's the word? Tweenish. I won't say it's the most realistic love story ever put on screen, but it's more realistic than the usual love stories we get nowadays.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Young Love in Numbered Days,"I read the book by John Green in one morning. It was a quick read, but it was uncomfortable to read in its sadness. This novel was about the love story between two cancer-stricken teenagers. I am surprised it was a bestseller given the book's topic seemed so morose and upsetting for the young adults that it targets. While it had its effective moments, the book had a language that tended to be rather indulgent and unrealistic given the age of its teen protagonists.The film is a very faithful adaptation of its source novel. It is so faithful that the faults of the book also become its faults. The film is two hours and ten minutes long. It felt too long, sometimes wallowing too much in its own misery. Luckily, the dialog in the film's script were more believably teenage. I enjoyed the delightful animation used to show us the text messages between the two lovers. The wonderful soundtrack consisted of cool songs by Ed Sheeran and several other indie-type musicians. This type of music highly complemented the film's youthful angst.Also, the film benefits from the earnest performances from its main cast. Shailene Woodley has a malleable face, not too perfectly pretty or distinct, just right for portraying a wide array of characters. She was really very effective as Hazel Grace, given that this was such a difficult part to play, demanding both physically and emotionally. Ansel Elgort had the charisma required to play her ideal boyfriend, Augustus. The unbelievable perfection of his character as written becomes his limitation as actor.Ironically, for me the best parts of the book did not materialize that well on screen. These were their Dutch-motif picnic in the park and their heart-to-heart talk about the new PET scan result. The way Ansel Elgort delivered his lines in these two important scenes were not clear enough to create the welling dramatic impact they did in the book. The script did not even include that highly-emotional moment towards the end when there was dead silence after a recording of a beloved voice invited to leave a voice mail.Overall, I think this film is good to watch depending on your mood. It can give you a good cry if you let it, though I thought the book might be more effective a tearjerker than the film. The best thing about this film is seeing Woodley and Elgort together as Hazel and Gus. The both of them had captured so well the essential chemistry of these two star- crossed lovers as described in the book, and this saves the film from being too depressing.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hypnotized..and..I like my choice of TEN....OKAY?...,"I've seen many films, but don't write reviews nor have I got the literary skills to do so, but this one gave me a burning desire to put many words out even though it's hard to find ones that might be sufficient for this epic story. This is just my feelings sorted in the order they pop inside me rather than a review. I don't have to write about all the good writing, acting and performances along with charming set up of deeply sentimental scenes coated with highly emotional songs. These are all obvious, some people would still claim it as a teen movie or another sad love story for a dedicated audience, but truth is I've never come across a fiction that induces such noble thoughts and emotions and never felt such feelings for a fictional character before. Most common way of hypnotism is the state of mind that you are really fascinated and moved to an alternate state of consciousness by something that is made up...and this movie does that. I'm an average man on his late thirties and usually don't cry for a movie nor like sad stories, but also never keep myself from simple pleasure of admitting it..proud to confess bursting into tears on their eulogies which could have been their vows...not just because their limited infinity or the ending that set my soul fire but because how real and how utterly great their love was..and their way of celebrating it..couldn't't't resist to envy...maybe I aspire what I lack in my life but everyone relates to it one way or another...I want my own Hazel Grace...Mesmerized by whole realness of it......as for real life I wish for once people would kill bias and consider this as a worthy piece of hypnosis business of motion picture industry. Along with all characters, Hazel Grace was uniquely real and endearing thanks to Shailene Woodley giving her life perfectly...and won't be surprised (rather will find peace) if she or movie gets showered with awards other than reactions of us...Like many, I also had a tendency to save my 10 always for something higher..up until finding myself re-watching it over and over..so yes this is my first ten and I like my choice of Ten!...OKAY.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A very bad script, exploiting portions buyers viewers' sympathy","This film tells the story of a young woman who has cancer. She attends as support group and meets the guy of her dreams. They develop a relationship, yet the cruel reality hits and takes their dreams away.The story is very predictable, contrived and unconvincing. Are we really expected to believe that they fall for each other so intensely that easily? And the subplot about the Dutch author is simply ridiculous. I'm very unconvinced that someone would track down an author, fly half way across the world to ask a question. The phlegmatic response from the author is disgusting, yet oddly satisfying.I honestly thought the film was boring and annoying. It is exploitative of the viewers' sympathy towards sick children to sell a really bad film film, which makes it even worse.",,Anonymous,Romance
Disney Version,"I loved the book. Let me say that again. I LOVED the book. The movie, though it had some charming moments and they did salvage a couple of good bits of dialog, felt as if someone went through the story with a big Disney-After School Special sponge and scrubbed away all the edges that made the book so unique.Where was the snappy sass and witty repartee from Augustus when we meet him at the support group? In the book, his ease at teasing his soon to be blind friend was appalling and fantastic in equal measure and it set the tone for the reality of people living with cancer. They do not want pity and they wish, more than anything, that people wouldn't edit every freaking thing they say in their company because they will miss the good jokes when they do.Where was the family gathering after Gus got out of the hospital and the cloying, sympathetic behavior of siblings and extended family that was so brilliantly exposed and demolished by Hazel & Gus's funny exchange in front of them all?If they took the time to put thought bubbles over heads while texting, why didn't they just let Hazel narrate the deeper thoughts that easily could have been laced throughout the film?And how the heck did the screenplay writer, the director and anyone else who read this miss the HUGE significance of the reading of kids names at the support group who had died? The singular moment they should have gone for a good cry from the audience should have been hearing Augustus's name echo out in that ""Heart of Jesus"" room and it would have been THE moment it all came together. But no. It either never got filmed or it's sitting on the cutting room floor. I could have done with less - way too long-dramatics when her parents got the call and the whole emotional bundle would have been offered at the name reading.For any teens who saw this film and ""Loved it!"" 10 Stars! Hearts & Flowers! I encourage you to wait about ten, twenty, thirty years and read the book...again. You will, as an adult, finally understand the depth of what you have in your hands and when you re-watch this vanilla, cutesy teen love story film, you'll give it the six it deserves.It could have been so much more if the screenwriters hadn't pulled their punches to dumb down the dialog for a larger audience.

A note of joy in the midst of gloom,"A young love clouded by death. Two attractive young people, fall in love so what is the problem? Well, they met at a cancer support group and both have terminal cancer.This is a very unlikely love story. It has all the elements of a rom-com but it is a drama through and through. Attraction, excitement are all there but with a nasty reality bite. Each of them knows they are dying soon but for the moment they are concerned not losing the person they love, or hurt them.On the whole, it was made in a way that displays all angles in such an unfortunate story. First person, immediate family and partner. It is one thing for the person concerned to know they are to pass soon, but what about the parents involved knowing they are about to lose a child? It is just harrowing.In the midst of it all, comes romance.

What an Emotional movie! 8/10,"Review: What an emotional movie! It's not very often that a film brings a tear to my eye, especially when it's based around 2 unknown stars and a storyline without any twist and turns. I also smiled all the way through the film because it was great to see Gus and Hazel's relationship blossom under extreme circumstances. Basically the movie is about 2 teenagers who are suffering with cancer and they fall in love with each other, even though there life could come to an end due to there illness. There's many different elements to the storyline which makes it so brilliant but I don't want to spoil it for those people who haven't watched it. The performances are so realistic and deeply emotional which is why I couldn't help but feel for Hazel & Gus. Although the movie is based around two characters, the director cleverly introduced new characters throughout the movie to keep it fresh and interesting. For a 2 hour movie, I really didn't want it to end, which surprised me for a movie in this genre. It could have easily been a morbid movie because of the touchy subject matter, but it really was a joy to watch and it's proof that you don't need major stars and a big budget to make a great film. Brilliant!Round-Up: This is definitely one of those movies were you have to take time out after you watch it, because it's an emotional roller-coaster. You might remember the girl from Divergent and The Descendants and the boy also starred in Divergent and Carrie but they aren't household names yet. I'm sure after this movie they will get a huge amount of work, which they deserve after putting in such great performances. Even Willem Dafoe, who only had a tiny role, was brilliant along with Laura Dean who plays the girls mother. In all, if your into your emotional dramas then this is definitely a movie for you and I'm really not surprised that it blew up at the box office.Budget: $12million Worldwide Gross: $304millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their really emotional movies about 2 teenagers suffering with cancer and manage to fall in love under extreme circumstances. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The story is about two people suffering from cancer and who lives a love story.,"The film speaks about the unexpected love between two teenagers suffering from cancer.

It's probably one of my favourite films because the story looks so amazing, he makes me dream even if the teenagers are sick.

I don't really get why people love this movie so much,"It was a typical teen romance drama. It had it's good moments, but there were very few. For the most part the movie just contained sappy and awkward moments. It felt like the movie was trying to make you cry instead of having it happen naturally.The characters were very weak and mostly stayed with the same motives and barely changed as people. Since their characters never really changed it made the story predictable. Just see how their characters act and feel and you can see all the clichés and how the story will proceed.The acting wasn't that great either. I have seen both of these actors in other movies where they were much more believable. Shailene Woodley was great in White Bird in a Blizzard and The Spectacular Now. Ansel Elgort wasn't the best actor along Shailene Woodley either, she overshadowed him, which didn't make for good chemistry.To me the only redeeming part was the soundtrack, which was mostly indie music which fit the mood most of the time.The Fault in Our Stars is a generic teen romance movie.

Unfortunately I couldn't see it that way, which has to do with the fact, that this is so by the numbers that it hardly evoked an emotional reaction (once at the airport scene with the father, but several times it was shuddering, because of the sugar overload this has).I actually was under the impression it was another Nicholas Sparks film/novel this was based on. Not because I read this anywhere, but of how the ""story"" ""developed"". No real surprises here, not even that you get beautiful people looking beautiful, while pretending to be something else (or sick). That wouldn't matter though, because even movie sickness is best portrayed by someone we love to watch, but the fact it lies to itself (""you are a fairy tale/movie"" is what someone should tell the voice over, if it actually helped ... but it won't).A far better movie on the subject, which actually does evoke emotion if you get on the ride is ""50/50"".

The Fault in Our Stars,"The Fault in Our Stars is a romance and drama movie based on the novel of John Green. This movie was release on June, 6 2014 and has been directed by Josh Boone (Stuck in love, 2013). The principal actors in The Fault in Our Stars are Shailene Woodley (Divergent) who played Hazel Grace Lancaster and Ansel Elgort (Divergent, Carrie) who played Augustus ""Gus"" Waters. The acting of this two was amazing. The chemistry between Shailene and Ansel was unbelievable, they transmitted us so many emotion in a short time and they represented the character of the book very well. The transmission of their chemistry in their character make the story looks very real, serious and sincere. I read the book before watching the movie and the story is almost the same. All the important elements and details of the book are there and also more. For all the readers, we could not ask better. Even if the characters are sick, we can associate themselves to this characters and it makes the movie very sensitive and moving. I think that the best quotes of the movie and the most moving is ""You gave me a forever within the numbered days""-Hazel Grace Lancaster.

"Best movie, okay? okay","The Fault in Our Stars is an exciting movie about the love of two young people learning from an early age to face the sad reality that they could be separated from each other at any moment. Despite this, Josh Boone's adaptation of John Green's book shows that it is possible to overcome difficulties to achieve at least a little joy. Yes. The Fault in Our Stars is a romance with teenage characters who fall in love and live a story full of tears and passion. But the film is not only that.Basically, the film tells the story of Hazel Grace, who was diagnosed with thyroid cancer, which eventually spreads to her lungs. Her mother forces her to go to a support group, where she ends up meeting Augustus Waters, who has undergone treatment to remove a bone tumor from his leg. And that's how, in my opinion, the perfect couple is formed. Even though Hazel doesn't want to get involved with anyone because she believes her days are numbered, she eventually gives in. As she says in the movie, Gus gave her a forever, within the numbered days. Finally, they embark together to Amsterdam where they live an unforgettable adventure.The part of the movie shot in Amsterdam are beautiful, with incredible scenery. Despite being where one of the saddest scenes takes place and where I cry for the first in the movie. The movie is heart touching and the film gives us an unusual outcome. As Hazel would say ""their love story was epic"", and I am happy to have been able to watch this amazing romance.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Grace,"Greetings again from the darkness. Having not read John Green's book, and missing his targeted demographics by gender and a few decades, the narrator's very early criticism of my favorite teen movie ""Say Anything ..."" had me quickly questioning whether I was going to make it through this one. The greatness of Shailene Woodley soon won me over and I was all in.The story revolves around a teenage girl named Hazel(Woodley) who was diagnosed with cancer a few years ago, and has remained alive and active thanks to an experimental drug. She is an exceptionally perceptive girl and carries the burden of worrying about how (or if) her parents (Laura Dern, Sam Trammell) will carry on after her death. She attends a teenage support group to keep her parents happy, and bumps into a friendship with a spirited young man named Gus (Ansel Elgort) ... a self-labeled one-legged 18 year old virgin cancer survivor.You guessed it ... this is a tear-jerker. But it's even more of a love story. Specifically, it's a story about the joy in finding someone to love. While the cancer is ever-present, it's the love story that captures our interest. When the story veers from that, it suffers. The trip to Amsterdam and the segment with Willem Dafoe seems out of place until it's eclipsed by the final scene at the Anne Frank house. I understand the point, but it struck me as forced emotions ... in a movie that was not lacking emotion.Regardless of all of that, the reason to see this is the genius of Shailene Woodley. Neither she nor Elgort are teenagers, but they perfectly capture the adorable balance between awkward and witty. Woodley's range is staggering (The Descendants, The Spectacular Now, Divergent) and she and Jennifer Lawrence should be blessing us with their talent for many many years to come.The screenplay was co-written by Scott Neustadler and Michael H Weber who also co-wrote both (500) Days of Summer and The Spectacular Now. Their feel for dialogue and budding relationships is spot on, delivering a level of respect to both sexes. This film is very sweet and filled with grace, and tainted only by the saccharine musical choices and the Amsterdam sequence.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Such a moving story,"I read the book and I loved it. I saw the movie and it was as great. Such a moving story.The characters were all great, the humour and wit between them was fantastic. Their chemistry was so lovely. I was constantly with a smile on my face when I saw them fall in love with each other. So unbelievably heartwarming.I saw the movie for a second time and although I knew exactly what would happen, I cried again. The ending is so sad, so touching, it really moved my heart.The actors did a great job, the scene of Augustus in the car, it felt so real. When Hazel was heartbroken, I really felt her pain. They both played their emotions so well.For me this movie is a must see, I definitely recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
ROMANTICALLY EXHILARATING! INGENIOUSLY STUNNING! MONUMENTALLY HEARTBREAKING!,"I'll be the first to admit that romantic comedies are not usually my cup of tea. But as a genuine cinephile I will honestly say that out of hundreds of the ROMCOM'S I've sat through when trying to accommodate a past, present or future potential girlfriend I would come across some that were quite mesmerizing every now and then. With that being said, sophomore director Josh Boone's romance epic ""THE FAULT IN OUR STARS"" is easily one of best films of (2014).
From its infectiously raw opening scene to an incredibly heart breaking ending director Josh Boone's heartfelt drama is a magnificently endearing love story. 
Even though the film may seem to be only targeting teenage audiences by concentrating entirely on the lives of just two teenagers, it's a conquest for love that's remarkably original with a roller coaster of emotion elevating throughout all while including some of the strongest acting I've seen in (2014).",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Watched it only because of Ashley Woodley. She definitely delivered. This is a cute romantic movie that makes u be grateful for the things that you already have in your life. That is why I highly recommend this movie if you are into romantic stuff. If not then it wont be a waste of time either. Other than that, the script was good. Screenplay was also flawless, IMO.

A Must See!,"Being a massive fan of the book, and an avid reader, I was worried that the film wouldn't do the book justice. Oh how wrong I was. The movie stuck to the book the way any adaption should, and the actors were perfect for the parts they were chosen to play. One of the few movies adapted from a book that I have thoroughly enjoyed just as much as when I read the book itself, as it wasn't butchered when made into a film as many book to film adaptions are. This is a story that shows the harsh realities of living with cancer, and what life is like for those who have to live with it everyday. Heartwarming and emotional, I doubt there are many people who have watched this movie, and left with a dry eye at the end.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Warm film abut illness.,"We forget about people struck with illness, and this film came along to remind us about people who are in the midst of it all. I liked this film. Acting is truly excellent, you can feel the chemistry between two principal actors. Plot is interesting, although I am not sure is it realistic, with going to Amsterdam and all, but you have to make interesting film like this for the wider audiences.

The first movie I ever cried to,"This is my first review. This is because what I think usually isn't what everyone else thinks. But this time, I have to speak up.This movie is, like it says in the title, the first movie that I've ever cried to, and I've seen some sad movies. However none of those movies have ever felt so realistic. Even those who were based on a real story. This one however, did.I could probably go on and write 20 pages on how good the chemistry between the actors is, or how well the movie was written and such. But I'm not going to. Because that isn't what makes a good movie in my honest opinion. It is the feeling you get when you watch the movie that matters.when watching The Fault In Our Stars, you get the feeling of joy and humor. But also great sadness and sorrow. All this combined with the feeling that you belong in this movie, that this is something that could happen to you or your loved ones. Combining each of those elements is not an easy thing. A few, if any movies have done it. Until now.No matter if you are an action fan or fantasy fan. No matter what kind of movie you like, you should watch this movie. You will probably feel a great pain in watching it, since it reminds us of all the sad parts in our lives. But it is worth it because honestly pain demands to be felt.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

You WILL cry....unless you have a heart of stone,"I am going to start off this brief, two-paragraph review by saying that I originally had no intentions of seeing this movie, period. This movie was obviously not meant for guys, particularly ones my age, and instead was meant for the young, teen-girl audience. So I figured, ""why bother?"" That being said, I did end up seeing it, and I actually thought it to be a very good film. The characters were given a LOT of depth, Shailene Woodley gave one of the best performances I have seen all year, and the story is not just a typical cancer story. Instead of having the lead characters fine and healthy throughout half the film and becoming sick towards the end, this film is about people that have already moved into the acceptance stage of their illness, and how they learn to enjoy what little time they have left in life. It is a very well-paced movie, the dialog is fine, you will cry at some pointI did, and it has Willem Dafoe (if only for about five minutes).This film had so much going for it that I really have nothing major to hold against it. The acting was very, very well done, the editing is spot on, and nearly all of the technical components of the film were in top form. All the complaints that I did have with it were extremely minimal, and most of them were fixed by the end of the first act anyway. Because of this, I have to applaud ""The Fault in Our Stars""; it was not meant for my demographic, yet it made me enjoy the movie anyway. There really is not a lot I can say about this movie without sounding cheesy or weird so I will let my rating speak for me.I am going pretty high on this initial rating (although it may change later on): 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
More of a love story than a cancer-film,"I had no expectations towards this film, based on the reviews I thought it's the kind of movie you have already seen without actually seeing it. However, falling in love is so beautifully depicted in this movie that I'm not sure I have seen anything like this in recent films. The two main characters (and the actors) are absolutely lovable just for what they are, for their silly jokes and meaningful thoughts. Some scenes are so powerful that you'd want to be in their place despite the cancer/dying background. It certainly had an impact on me, at least. And I was once again persuaded how great actor Willam Dafoe is, and it was also nice to see Lotte Verbeek from Nothing Personal",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Then it looks like that the characters chosen were really themselves in the movie not performing or acting. Then in the start it feels little boring but once you start catching hold of the story than its like you are feeling what they are feeling.The great thing which I liked about the movie is that the director had kept it simple and had not included too many glamorous details as the current trend is.This movie gives the great insight of the lives of teenagers suffering from any kind of such dangerous disease.

Geeky Randy's summary,"Adaptation of the bestselling book of the same name about a terminally ill 17-year-old who falls in love with a cancer survivor that she meets at a support group. All cast is very likable, with admiral performances by leads Woodley and Elgort, and an exceptional supporting appearance by Dafoe. A real plus for not spoonfeeding the audience; but for a story that insists on being honestly sad, it certainly lines itself up for convenient tragedy with a turn-of-events that is quite predictable to the more observant viewer.

"For a deep movie, a lot of saccharine moments","I spent a lot of time checking my watch, wondering when this movie was really going to get rolling. When it did, it was good, but the whole movie could have used some more editing. Also, I found it had for me an annoying 'life is beautiful' postcard-y sense about it for such a difficult topic of kids dying of cancer. There was little difficulty or real conflict in the first three quarters of the movie. Laura Dern's talent was completely wasted. Willem Dafoe put in a fine performance as a crotchety, hateful writer, but it wasn't enough to add any real depth to the movie.I wish I could say I liked it more. Hazel, Augustus, and Josh came off as likable, real people, although A's perfect attitude began to bug me as the movie wore on.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A heartwarming, touching, beautiful romantic drama comedy film","Based on the popular romantic novel by John Green, The Fault in Our Stars is another story about a pair of star-crossed lovers who care immensely for each other but couldn't be together due to their unfortunate circumstances. I believe for those who have never read the book or watched the trailer would assume that this film to be those weepy, sappy melodramatic mess, right? Well, not exactly.Surprisingly, the film is a heartwarming and touching love story wrapped in exceedingly witty dialogue and memorable one liners, successfully preventing itself from making its way into melodramatic territory. The comedy and romance is well-balanced. The film is also slightly mature and wise in its content and character perspectives: What is oblivion? Is there any meaning or purpose in life? Can we truly outlast death by being remembered by everyone in the world? What should we actually seek in our short life?The main female lead, Hazel, who suffered through cancer most of her life, doesn't anticipate much from her life, as her days are numbered. Out of nowhere, here comes Augustus, a surprisingly charming cancer survivor who's seemingly optimistic about his future. Augustus's charming smile and his relentless devotion of love for Hazel captured her heart. They're both equally smart and the on-screen chemistry between Shailene (Hazel) and Ansel (Augustus) made their instant connection believable.Shailene and Ansel both provide convincing performances as a couple. The romance was subtle, feels honest and realistic for the audience to emotionally invested in them. Their affection for each other deepens as the film progresses and it's heartbreaking to see that this relationship doesn't last. (I don't think I'm spoiling it, as we all know what we signed up for even before watching it). The film doesn't overly exploit the romance drama that's usually comes with the chronic disease, which is commendable. Rather than making it the typical depressing melodramatic tearjerker, the film has a bittersweet ending with surprising depth and meaning about life.The eulogies written by the leads for each other is thought-provoking and heartfelt at the same time. I have a few gripes about the film though...I would appreciate if the film adds more scenes about their cancer sufferings. Cancer is not a joke. The film seemingly gives an impression to the general audience that stage 4 cancer sufferers can still live and converse normally like many others without the repetitive time-consuming treatments, dealing with severe side effects from drugs or countless hospitalization. The film does feel draggy a bit in some parts as well. Overall, despite some shortcomings, The Fault in Our Stars is still undeniably a decent romantic drama comedy that's well worth your time and money.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/07 Rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
An overrated film!!!,"This is my first film review here. Actually I will not review much but just share my feelings and observations and the film very shortly.1. The theme is poor; a very cliché subject to work on. 2 The script is very poor; many meaningless conversations. 3. Casting is poor; characters do not match at all. 4. Acting is extremely poor; You never get into the film as you cannot get rid of the feeling that they are only ""acting"". Especially Augustus and Hazel's mother (and up to a point her father) were very far away from being real. Also the mimics and the toning of the conversations were ridiculous.I think high rating of this film come from teenagers which may be the target of this film.I gave a 6 to this film but I am too much generous, I should say..",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not Story but the acting and direction,"A few friends had recommended the book to me, but since 1. I already had a long to-read list, 2. I have had heard that a movie is coming soon, so I decided to watch the movie instead. Okay, so the date of its worldwide release came and went, without any mention when it's going to release in my country. So, after a month or so later I had already almost forgotten about the movie, but just by chance I had a glance on the name ""The fault in our stars"" in movie show timings in today's newspaper, so just decided to watch it right away. Okay, to the movie 1. Story: okay, so there wasn't anything new to that; I mean, there are already A walk to Remember, Restless and Keith, so, there really wasn't anything I would say that could have blown people's mind. 2. Acting: Good job everyone! I have seen The Descendant, and Shailene's acting was really good in that movie, and here, I wouldn't feel shy in saying she has done a better job. Brilliant! And especially, though I don't want to say it, ""she really looked sick"". The guy, playing Augustus, was also good, but initially I was reluctant to accept his character, but with time it got better. Or it's his good acting that put me on ease. Other characters, well, what I can say about the veterans, except for their appraisal. And William Dafoe, as always, ""never fails"" to make audience hate him. I particularly liked his character and his word. 3. Direction: It was good. The movie was full of little things that really made the whole thing compelling and be felt. Screenplay, at couple of times, there was a little awkwardness, but overall good, or maybe it's the acting that took care of everything. 4. And music too was nice, but they could have included more appropriate soundtracks at a couple of places. :)And if I decide to go into the details and dig out the dialogues and all, then, apparently, I will be praising the book. So, I'll just stop here by saying that although the story really hadn't anything new to it, yet the movie was good and perfectly watchable, and probably, for some, it could be a great experience.PS: Since it includes a tour to Anne Frank House, I have to read the book now.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

My most favorite scene is also the most saddest part of the film. Audiences may have expected, Shailene Woodley to deliver one of her best performance yet but Ansel Elgort, the guy who portrays Augustus Waters brings such warmth and vulnerability to his character that one might be unable to help themselves but wish to have a friend just like Gus.

"""The world is not a wish-granting factory.""","3 1/2 out of 4 stars.John Green's novel ""The Fault In Our Stars"" has been a big hit for the past couple years. It tells the story of two teenagers with cancer who fall in love. It was only a matter of time until it was turned into a movie and fans of the book will not be disappointed by the film.Josh Boone's 2014 adaption of ""The Fault In Our Stars"" stays true to the novel thanks to its writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber (who also wrote ""500 Days of Summer"" and ""The Spectacular Now""). There were one or two changes from the book and some things had to be eliminated. If the film had an extra half-hour or hour, it would be exactly like the book. I have read the book and the things they had to take out make sense.Boone's adaptation works very well thanks to its strong cast. Shailiene Woodley is great as Hazel and she has great chemistry with Ansel Elgort (who plays Augustus). Nat Wolff, Laura Dern, and Willem Dafoe are also well cast. Although it can be sappy at times, the cast makes the line works and we can care about these characters.The film does have its faults, though. The editing is awkward at times and I thought the exposition seemed just a little rushed. The music is good for the most part, but there are awkward moments where the music doesn't work (""Boom Clap"" by Charli XCX being the strangest). However, there are moments where the music fits perfectly, like Ray LaMontagne's ""Without Words"" and M83's ""Wait.""""The Fault In Our Stars"" is effectively brought to the big screen. Fans of the book and people who haven't read it should enjoy it. It may not be a movie for everybody, but it's a solid adaptation.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Akin to Tom Hank's performance in Forrest Gump! Ansel Elgort's performance is equally Spectacular! Nat Wolff's performance was Great too! Shailene's performance was what draws people into the movie. She becomes and ultimately IS Hazel Grace! With a few True Stars you can see it in their expressions and mostly see it in their eyes.

Not just another teen romance,"Quickie Review:Hazel (Shailene Woodley), a terminal cancer patient and Gus (Ansel Elgort), a cancer survivor become friends after meeting for the first time at a cancer support group. Despite the overwhelming circumstances they both have been dealt with, through their friendship that grows into love, Hazel and Gus triumph over the fear of death and oblivion. The Fault In Our Stars is a surprisingly touching movie that is actually smart. Its incredible two leads bring such realism to their characters that make them and the story all the more relatable. A beautifully heartbreaking and heartwarming movie that deserves more recognition.Full Review:Well, I'll be honest when I saw the trailers and saw that this is yet another teen romance novel adaption, I couldn't care less for it. But then slowly I started to hear some good buzz so I got curious. I knew I wasn't the target demographic, this was made even clearer to me when I realized there was literally one other male in the entire cinema (no exaggeration) and he was there with his girlfriend. So I was the only single male in his 20s watching The Fault In Our Stars. Which is a shame because I enjoyed the movie and think more people should go out and see it.There is a reason why some people avoid movies that are based on teen romance novels, because they tend to sugar coat and glorify the love aspect of the story and ignore realistic hardships that comes with relationships **sneeze** Twilight **sneeze** (sorry, allergic too crap movies, can't help it). But let me be absolutely clear, The Fault In Our Stars is not that kind of movie. Both Hazel and Gus are instantly likable characters. They are witty and smart, and that comes across very well thanks to the strong script. Gus especially is this extremely optimistic person and by being with him Hazel finally feels like she doesn't need to be defined by her cancer. At the same time Hazel helps Gus realize to cherish the memories he makes with the people he loves. All of what I described doesn't happen in an instant, it all takes time just like it would in real life. That is why when they eventually fall in love and see them suffer with cancer together, it is completely believable.This is not a movie that only people dealing with cancer or people who know others with cancer will relate to. Everyone will be touched by the story of Gus and Hazel. I could hear half the theater sniffling and in tears, and understandably so.So I must say if you are on the fence about this movie, I say give it a chance. It may not be a perfect movie but it doesn't have to be. I am thankful I gave it that chance.P.S.

"Wow ,Wow ,Wow and Amazingly WOW!!!","One of the best movies I've seen in a long time .The movie was touching and it compelled me to eulogize the movie and its stars.I never got my eyes off for a single moment .Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort share an amazing chemistry.I don't like reading books but now i guess i am more intrigued to read the book .This movie shows the truth of life and how two young folks deal with the fact of life that they have few days to live.Seen a lot of romantic movies but this one is very different and deserves nothing less than 10 and an Oscar nomination.Touching, romantic, sad and is emotional to the core .Never cried in a movie but exceptions are always there and ""The fault in our stars"" is that exception.A MUST Watch Guys.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The Fault in our stars undoubtedly does what every entry from that genre promises to do; make us cry like babies, mucus dribbling down our snoot and all.","The Fault in Our Stars, based on the bestselling Young Adult book of the same name, belongs to a very particular subgenre, which combines teenage romantic drama and debilitating disease. I have seen only a few movies belonging to this genre. Love Story (1970) is apparently the movie that is the gold standard in this genre. I have seen its modern successor, A Walk to Remember (2002). Suffice to say, I wasn't in control of my emotions for the next three days, and it might have cost me ten-fifteen marks in my XIIth Board English language exam. So, in spite of knowing nothing much about the movie outside of the trailer, I armed myself with a healthy dose of cynicism and went to the theatre.And I cried.2014 was the breakout year of Shailene Woodley. She had just wrapped up her TV show and her last four movies were the Oscar winning The Descendants (2011); the indie hit the Spectacular Now (2013); the experimental thriller White Bird in a Blizzard and dystopian thriller Divergent (both released in 2014). The last one, also based on a bestselling YA franchise, had made her a global star, and she had by then firmly established herself among the talented crop of young actresses in Hollywood. She continues her fine acting form here, portraying the cancer patient Hazel Grace Lancaster with great sensitivity and wit. She conveys energy of a doomed teenager exceptionally well, compassion oozing from her body, and quiet strength in the way she defies the role of a cancer patient. Eschewing self-pity, Hazel tries to manage her emotions while acutely aware of her parents' struggles, which she knows in her heart she will leave soon. Trying to make sense of her emotions, the well-intentioned parents send her to group therapy, where she meets fellow cancer patient Augustus Waters. ""Gus"", played by the talented Ansel Elgort in only his third movie, is a plucky former athlete who, after a losing a leg to cancer, is determined to lead a happy life. They inevitably fall in love, and there are a few surprise touches in their story, yet after the crying stopped I didn't find anything solid underneath the movie. Maybe I am too cynical. Or maybe because I don't have a debilitating disease and don't have first hand information on how people behave with such knowledge playing in their minds. I had a problem with how Gus fixates on Hazel at their first meeting and decides to pursue her, in spite of her doing nothing of any interest in the meeting. The fact that Hazel returns the affection without any conflict doesn't exactly cover up for this glaring hole in the plan, but maybe something got lost in the almost-literal translation of the book to the screen. There is a kiss scene between Gus and Hazel in Anne Frank museum, which I thought was wholly inappropriate, given the setting. Gus comes off as a cocky smart mouth, as opposed to charming rogue, which did make me wonder why they didn't go with Miles Teller, who had great chemistry with Woodley in The Spectacular Now. Maybe because Elgort has the wholesome corn-fed American boy look done pat.Fortunately, the parents aren't portrayed as clueless impediments in the lives of their children, set up as a target of scorn and ridicule by the audience. The lovely Laura Dern plays Hazel's mother with great empathy, and along with Sam Trammel, who plays the father, makes the best of the thinly sketched characters. Nat Wolff makes the best use of his time as Isaac, Gus' best friend. Willem Dafoe interrupts the feel-good, non-conflict vibe of the movie as a reclusive and cranky author, and the beautiful Lotte Verbeek from The Borgias (2011-13) has a cameo as his assistant.If you are a connoisseur of Hollywood cinema, you know how the broad strokes of the story will go, and you will cry, laugh and cry again at the appropriate times, and hopefully that should be fine. Because that is the most I got out of this movie. Good performances all around, but a one-time watch is all I recommend. Maybe two, if you're hanging out with your Significant Other and wouldn't mind crying a bit.VERDICT: 6/10Go for Shailene Woodley.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Loved the way it made me feel so vulnerable.,"I don't know why but this kind of movie makes me feel good. I guess it just makes me feel so fragile and we also need that kind of emotion. Almost all people wants to show they are strong but deep inside they can be broken too in such situation. I just like how it's true to show that pain is really an ugly feeling but it can make you feel stronger every time you surpass those excruciating moments in your life. Although it is based from the book I must say that the movie is great. I haven't read the book but I guess the movie made justice to the book. I never liked reading books until Just recently I started to read a fiction novel and I'm liking it. And I might read TFIOS book too because of this movie.

Youngsters in an imperfect world show us how to live life to its fullest,"I am so glad I saw this though it appears to be a tear jerker. Well it may, but it also gives you lots of hope. It flies in all accounts: perfect story, script, casting, acting and inspiration. I cried and laughed and felt satisfied even though I was not sick.We can learn so much from kids and yet these are not really kids. As young adults they have the purity and positive drive of kids who just live for the present and seize the moment. Yet on the other hand they are about to become adult and have the maturity to love and care for the people they deeply love/look up to/admire. Beautiful story setting. Very realistic and positive outlook for life. Inspirational for all ages and of all conditions. Life maybe short but still good. It is important to vent and have a support system who accepts you as who you are and on your side at all times.Excellent casting and acting, especially the three youngsters who have to brave cancer. Guz (Ansel Elgort) is so charming with his sincere smile that you just want to hug and kiss him. Hazel (Shailene Woodley) is very cute and sweet and had a great sense of humor. She also displays a strong sense of confidence. Yet when they weep you really feel the ache inside them and cry with them. Even when Issac (Nat Wolff) loses his eye and has to wear sunglasses, his facial expressions made me cry.But it is not a sad story. Death is all around us. We are all going to die. Yet before that day comes, we have to live well and full and have a good laugh about it. These teenagers with terminal illness show us exactly how to do it. As mentioned in the movie, pain demands to be felt. So is love, sadness, anger and all kinds of emotions because they are what make us human. No need to worry about whether we would be remembered because we would not know then. Let's focus on this life.Have not seen such a good movie for a long time. I would give it an 8. Really looking forward to read the book.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Ok can be our always,"In the vast sea of young adult adaptations, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" emerges as a poignant beacon of authenticity and emotional depth, steering clear of the oft-trodden path of melodramatic clichés. Directed with a sensitive hand by Josh Boone, this film adaptation of John Green's beloved novel transcends the genre to deliver a narrative that is both heartbreaking and life-affirming.From the outset, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" captivates with its lead performances. Shailene Woodley, as Hazel Grace Lancaster, imbues her character with a wisdom and vulnerability that resonates far beyond her years, deftly navigating the complexities of a young woman facing terminal illness. Ansel Elgort, in the role of Augustus Waters, matches Woodley's intensity with his portrayal of a charismatic and earnest cancer survivor. Their chemistry is electric, crafting scenes that are at once tender and profound, making the audience a silent witness to their journey rather than mere spectators.The screenplay, penned by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, maintains the literary richness of Green's work while adapting it for the screen with a deft touch. It manages to retain the novel's philosophical musings on life, love, and the universe without becoming ponderous or preachy. The dialogues, especially those centered around their favorite book, ""An Imperial Affliction,"" offer moments of intellectual engagement that elevate the film above typical teen romance fare.Visually, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is a treat, with Amsterdam serving as not just a backdrop but almost a character in itself, its beauty juxtaposing the somber reality of the characters' lives. Cinematographer Ben Richardson captures the city's charm and melancholy with a palette that's both vibrant and subdued, reflecting the film's emotional landscape.The score by Mike Mogis and Nate Walcott is another triumph, weaving through the narrative with a subtlety that enhances the emotional undercurrents without overshadowing the dialogue. The music, much like the film, understands the power of restraint, allowing the audience to feel the weight of silence as much as the notes.Perhaps the most commendable aspect of ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is its treatment of terminal illness. Rather than exploiting the tragedy for emotional manipulation, the film treats it with respect and realism. It explores themes of suffering, hope, and the human spirit's indomitable will to find meaning in existence, all through the lens of two young lives caught in the throes of love and mortality.In conclusion, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" not only stands as a testament to the power of love in the face of death but also as a cinematic endeavor that dares to delve deep into the existential questions that define us. It's a film that will likely leave viewers with a profound appreciation for life's fleeting moments, a tribute to the courage of living fully, even when the stars seem to conspire against us. This is not just a film; it's an experience that lingers, a narrative of stars not only in our sky but in our very faults.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
So sad,"""The Fault in Our Stars"" strikes a poignant chord with its heartfelt portrayal of young love and life's impermanence, earning your solid 7/10 rating. The film's acting, particularly Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort's moving performances as Hazel and Gus, ensures that you're emotionally invested from start to finish. While the film's editing is sharp, allowing the narrative to flow seamlessly, its strength lies in its authenticity, tackling themes of love and loss with a raw and unfiltered honesty. The weakness, if any, might be the predictability of the storyline, but it's easily forgiven in the grand scheme of its emotional impact. The music beautifully complements the story, and the cinematography captures the bittersweet essence of the characters' journey. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" succeeds in conveying a powerful message about the importance of living life to the fullest, even in the face of adversity, making it a film you undoubtedly enjoyed.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It's not a cheesy, sentimental tearjerker: but man – did I cry!","The Fault In Our Stars tells the story of two kids, who are both recovering from cancer, falling in love. This could have so easily become a cheesy, sentimental tearjerker like so many other movies featuring love and disease, but the way the story is told is beautiful.It is actually a very adult movie, it's smart, funny and sad. The script flaws effortless and leads you inside their story and the people around them. All dealing with the aftermath of their disease in their own way. Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort have a great chemistry together and they deliver every line perfectly. (Well, maybe only the sentence about the Dragon Carrot Risotto being human, that was a weird one, and Ansel Elgort clearly had a problem with it.) They stay far away from being pathetic victims, and give many layers to their characters.Also the supporting cast is making this story really work, especially Laura Dern as the caring, sensitive mother and Nat Wolff, who gives a great comic performance as the best friend of Gus. The cinematography is beautiful. For instance: I love my hometown Amsterdam, and they did a great job showing the beauty of it. This is the Amsterdam I know so well and love so much.And of course the scriptwriters and the director did a fabulous job with this movie. It's not a cheesy, sentimental tearjerker: but man – did I cry! I don't know the book, and I don't think I ever will. And I don't care.

"Good, but underwhelming","I must say that The Fault In Our Stars caused a certain feeling on me that I'm not accustomed to, since I'm still trying to figure out my emotional reaction to the film. On one hand, I enjoyed the story and the movie flows in a good way. On the other I feel a little underwhelmed by the effect the movie was trying to convey. Cancer is always a tough subject, especially at a young age as is the case in this movie. In a way, I related to the characters, but didn't care enough to cry at the end. Unfortunately I have experienced one side of this disease, as I saw my Grandfather pass away because of it. Still this personal heartache wasn't enough for me to end up loving the movie.In terms of execution, I have no complaints, as the movie is expertly directed, written and acted. Shailene Woodley & Ansel Elgort handle their roles in a great manner and make the romance more believable. There has been some Oscar talk for Woodley's performance, and personally I wouldn't mind seeing her nominated.I guess that by the end of this review, I have decided upon my evaluation of the film. So, in the end, I believe that a movie like The Fault In Our Stars is primarily a ""chick flick"", as its marketing strategy pointed out that. However If you're looking for a good story and may, or may not, have had a personal encounter with cancer, I would most definitely recommend this film. Speaking for myself, I think it's a nice enough movie to feel like you haven't wasted 2 hours of your time, yet ultimately the story failed to fully grab me in a spectacular emotional fashion.Rating: 7,5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Must Watch!!,"Based on the novel by the same name and authored by John Green, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" hit the theaters on 2014 as a coming of age romance film. The story is about a girl named Hazel Grace Lancaster living in Indianapolis and suffering from Lung Cancer, she meets a young man named Augustus Waters and the two later fall for each other as the plot progresses.The film starts out with Hazel Grace narrating the story under a starry night sky laying on the grass. Suffering from cancer, Hazel Grace lives a life filled with doctor appointments and heavy medications. Having a pessimistic outlook of life, she gets forced by her parents into joining a in a support group in the ""Heart of Jesus"" (Not a religious metaphor, but a reference from within the film). There she meets Augustus Waters, an ex basketball player and Osteosarcoma survivor. Augustus is an optimistic charming boy who fears oblivion, he wants to live an extraordinary life, longing to be remembered by the masses after his death and leaving a mark on the world. Later in the story, we get to see how the pair work out despite having contrasting characters and interests. But as always, love comes with a risk of loss. Does Augustus escape oblivion? Does Hazel become more grateful for life? Is there a conclusion to the story at all or does it ends abruptly like life itself?""I fell in love like you would fall asleep, slowly and then all at once.""
John Green: Augustus Waters~One thing I liked about the film is that unlike other romantic works, this one spares the little details about how and when they fall in love with each other, they just do. The main part was not about falling in love, but living it and reliving it.The film emphasizes on the value of time and life which we take for granted. Whether leaving a mark in the world is the optimal way of living or is oblivion inevitable? The story embraces many shades of characters and explores them through situations and dialogues. Like the pessimist-optimist pair, or the author in exile Peter Van Houten and Hazel's own parents.""That's the thing about pain. It demands to be felt""
John Green~What this film struggles on is what most live adaptations of Novels do, failing to capture the whole vision of the writer on the screen. Despite having a 2 hr and 5 minute runtime, the live action fails to deliver the impact of the same magnitude that the Novel is renowned for. Leaving the characters slightly under-explored and failing to fully build up the plot before moving to the next part. It relies on dialogues and events rather than building a genuine connection with the characters for the build up of emotions. The film also leaves out a few characters from the novel, like the sister and the ex girlfriend of Augustus. It might turn out to be an underwhelming experience for the ones who read the novel.""Come quickly, I am tasting the stars!""
Dom Perignon~Overall it's a really nice adaptation. Expect a few quote worthy dialogues, references and different metaphors as the story completely entices you. While watching the film, we embark on a journey with Hazel Grace and a touch of cancer, a cancer of emotions which will multiply later and engulf us during the climax of the film.The music in the film is as enticing as Hazel Grace practising her speech for Agustus's birthday in the film. The sound track features ED Sheeran in the end credit song ""Al of the Stars"", a piece of art written by Ed himself. The film itself becomes a critically acclaimed classic. With 27 Award nominations with 18 taken home. This film should be in the must watch bucket list of film lovers.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Acting was fine but the dialogue was pretentious creating such fake characters. Anyone over 15 years old will predict every story beat that will come. The saving grace here is, unsurpringly, Willem Dafoe with his character being a grumpy drunk writer.

However, it never happened after any of those movies. This one was different, it was beautiful, heartbreaking, and just an overall masterpiece. I have to give it to the great mind of John Green for creating this story but I also have to be mad at him for creating this story because who knows when these tears of mine are going to stop. When reading the book, I obviously cried, but when watching the movie I cried even more. The characters chemistry and the overall amazingness of the character Augustus just made it that much more heartbreaking.

"A Perfect, Witty, Honest, Sad and Unforgettable Story","Hazel (Woodley) has cancer and can die at any moment when her lungs fill with water. August (Elgort) has cancer, is in remission, but.. Both meet at a Cancer Support Group and August falls instantly in love with Hazel. We do too. (you're too easy)I cannot say enough good things about this movie. It is perfect, witty, honest and will be hard to forget. It's almost like a true story, but it's not. However we will (read should) be reminded of it when we encounter someone with cancer. They struggle with things we take for granted. Things like breathing. See? Keep in mind that although we see stories for our entertainment, real dangerous things have happened to people with medical issues and we should always be aware of that.The movie pulls us in instantly as August goes flirting with Hazel and the banter between them is pure gold and it also pure gold the rest of the way. We hope August is a good guy, sincere, and level headed because we like Hazel and don't want to see her hurt. When Hazel is sad, we are sad and when she cries.. August never disappoints.Shailene Woodley deserves an Oscar for Best Actress and Ansel Elgort for Best Supporting Actor. Whoever cast them for this movie is a genius. They were great together with a chemistry not often found in movies. Their love will touch us for the entire movie and maybe beyond.August finds a way to get Hazel to Amsterdam to meet her favorite author Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe) as she needs to know the answers to some things in his novel. Dafoe does good in this curmudgeon role.Go to the cupboard or store and get a box of Kleenex because you will need it at times. Although much of the dialogues and banter is light and witty, there will be times they are not so. This is a most impressive, heartfelt, touching and well told story.You asked about a twist even though this story is rather straight forward and a twist isn't really necessary. However, there is one and you'll be reaching for that box when you see it.Notables: Laura Dern as Hazel's mother and Sam Trammell as Michael, Hazel's father.

Not bad but over-hyped,"I was so excited to see this movie and I do love sad movies but I didn't like something about this movie. Like when I normally watch a sad movie I feel depressed and will think about it for a while but I just didn't think too much about this because it was too depressing. It laid it on waaay too thick; it did not need to be that depressing I didn't see the point. But the movie was smoothly engineered to make the audience sob uncontrollably and yes it achieved it for most people. Literally you could hear the whole theatre sobbing, I think I was the only one that wasn't crying but I never do anyway.Acting by Shailene Woodley and the people who played her parents and the guy Isaac was really good too. Some parts were really funny as well, surprisingly. And it was filmed really well, in terms of how it all looked.Overall, it's worth a watch to see what the hype's about but it is overlong, pretentious dialogue, depressing, great acting(a lot of crying in to the camera-type shots),often funny, very saccharine and predictable(even though I had not read the book).

"""The Fault in Our Stars"" is all cliché, but it is for sure a charming story that makes the audience laugh, get emotional and, above all, cry","John Green has been standing out in recent years thanks to his literary career and his YouTube video channel (in which he discusses interesting subjects in a quick and fun way). But even as a gifted writer, The Fault in Our Stars is perhaps his most uneven work, sympathetic in parts and silly in others. But it is the book responsible for its absolute success. No wonder, it is the first to hit the cinema screens. The novel reached prominent positions in bookstores around the world and it was not uncommon to see young people, especially girls, with the book in their hands wherever they went. Something that is not very surprising when you read the synopsis of the work, which obeys the old commercial (and universal) standard boy meets girl (in this case, girl meets boy), adding the spice that the couple has physical limitations and serious problems of health, making the relationship difficult and creating obstacles that, although they take a slightly different form than usual, we have already seen dozens of times before.Written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber (who wrote the great ""The Spectacular Now, 2013""), ""The Fault in Our Stars"" introduces us to Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley), a young woman who has been battling cancer for a few years, feeling that at any moment he will take your life. It is then that at one of her support group meetings she meets Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), who lost his leg because of the disease, but managed to survive it. From then on, their relationship intensifies, having as a central point their fascination with the fictional book ""Imperial Affliction"", which tells the story of a girl with leukemia and ends in the middle of a sentence, implying that the girl dies. In the end, which leaves them anguished and thirsty to know what happened to the rest of the people involved in the plot. Thus, Augustus manages to contact the author of the work, an American residing in Amsterdam, played by Willem Dafoe, in a small but extremely welcome participation, and arranges a meeting with him in the Dutch capital. Then Augustus, Hazel and their mother embark on a journey that will change their lives.Director Josh Boone (""Stuck in Love"") makes two hours seem like minutes, showing competence in his role. The filmmaker deals with the theme in a warm and captivating way, dealing with delicate subjects such as illness and the proximity of death with admirable lightness. Any slip on the scale between drama, romance and comic relief could result in the failure of his work, which does not happen. The interesting thing about the film's narrative ends up appearing in its beginning, through its differences. All due to the simple fact that the plot is told by its protagonist at certain times, alternating with everyday scenes at others. In fact, everything is very reminiscent of a diary, acting efficiently, placing its viewer more and more as the lives of its characters go on. Meanwhile, the direction works a lot remembering angles from other films of the genre, mainly ""500 Days with Her"", but leaving the highlight on account of what is shown by the circumstances of its characters. The soundtrack finds its perfect fit at all times, completing the technical part in a way that borders on perfection for the objective that must be achieved.If Hazel and Gus were uninteresting, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" would surely fail. Luckily, their relationship holds up mainly because of their interpreters, who have beautiful performances and show enviable chemistry on the scene. Shailene Woodley - who had already shown her talent opposite George Clooney in ""The Descendants"" - delivers her best work so far. The actress acts with admirable passion, creating a direct empathy with the viewer. Two scenes stand out in particular, when looking at herself in the mirror after meeting Augustus, she carefully adjusts her respiratory system, just as she had done with her hair and clothes, showing that the probe that keeps her breathing is already part of her body. . The other takes place during a touching monologue by Hazel Grace about infinity. Ansel Elgort (Divergent) also does not disappoint, playing Gus Waters with the confidence that the role requires. At first, the character can be annoying in essence, appearing to be someone perfect and positive at all times, without flaws. Such an impression is undone in the impactful third act of the plot. The good dynamics of the couple guarantee the support of the feature, especially when the light and delicate tone prevails over the heavy and not so subtle dramatization provided by Josh Boone from the end of the second act onwards. While the focus is on the sweet relationship between the two, built on the basis of altruism, pure love and friendship, the narrative sustains itself with efficiency and charisma.The support cast also does a good job, with the participation of the always welcome Willem Dafoe, whose character gives a touch of cynicism and cruelty to the story, in counterpoint to the passionate spirit of the couple, in addition to names like Laura Dern as the mother of Hazel. Hazel's relationship with her parents, incidentally, is one of the best things in the film, showing well the two perspectives at play: the couple who know they will eventually lose their daughter, and the girl worried about the fate of the family when she is gone. . It is from this context that one of the most touching scenes in the film emerges, involving a discussion between the daughter and the mother.Putting these elements into play and failing to obsessively explore the disease and its physical effects is one of the good choices made by the screenplay adapted by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, who prefers to invest in the growth and relationship between the characters, which makes the more sensitive experience. The use of humor also contributes to the result. It's even impressive how the film has many funny scenes that don't appear out of place, thanks to Hazel's sarcasm or situations played by Augustus's friend, a good comic relief. The camera, in turn, always remains close by, trying to adopt a slightly naturalistic aesthetic that reinforces the development of the characters. It is a conventional directorial work without highlights, but one that will probably leave the American Josh Boone safe from the wrath of many fans.However, not everything is smooth sailing in ""The Fault in Our Stars"". One of the problems is the construction of the plot, which, in seeking greater fidelity to the book, ends up inserting scenes that even work in isolation, but which, when seen in the cinematographic context, practically stop the unfolding of the plot, not taking it forward and lengthening it unnecessarily. An example of this is the sequence in which Isaac (Nat Wolff), a friend of the couple, throws eggs at a car. However, the main problem comes in the final third, when the film unfortunately indulges in certain clichés. It is then that the production starts to appeal to the spectator's cry in an artificial way, weakening the narrative. Even so, watching ""The Fault in Our Stars"" turns out to be a pleasant experience most of the time, which is a nice surprise.The show of exaggerations is present for the most part in the final third of the production and almost ruins everything. Not that emotion itself is a problem, quite the contrary, it is legitimate and, I believe that for the vast majority of people, real and efficient. The problem is in the form and resources employed to achieve it. Excessive close-up of the characters' faces, overacting, romantic and emotional speeches that are not very organically intertwined, an intrusive soundtrack that insists on highlighting each moment of greater excitement, almost as if crying ""Cry"" for spectators; everything is orchestrated in a very obvious way, as if there was a certain insecurity on the part of the filmmakers regarding the natural emotional involvement resulting from the story being told, making it artificial and almost irritating. In any case, even though she uses uncreative and low-key methods on many occasions, it is fair to point out that there are artistic and technical merits worth noting, such as the art direction, which, by establishing blue as the base color of Hazel Grace, makes use of it to create rhymes and visual metaphors that permeate the film in its entirety. Starting with the very blue of the sky, which contrasting with the brightness of the stars that give the title to the work, fill the girl's room in a beautiful composition that illustrates not only Hazel's personality, but also her search for happiness and self-discovery.Still dealing with excessiveness, Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, in their constant attempt to bring the film closer to the book, transcribe excerpts, transforming them into voice-over narrations by Hazel Grace. Such an instrument, however, proves to be completely unnecessary, as it only explains what we can already understand from the images, such as a lack of confidence on the part of filmmakers in their target audience's ability to understand. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is a constant attempt to tell an innovative love story, but which ends up falling into the waters of predictability, with a relationship that is nothing short of forced. Even with its cheesier moments, like the applause that follows Augustus and Hazel's first kiss, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is an emotional piece of work. Well-produced and well-acted, it's not a simply appealing product like some of the three hundred Nicholas Sparks adaptations. In fact, within what it proposes, it is a good film, with a charming story that makes the audience laugh, get emotional and, above all, cry. Tears or no tears, Augustus and Hazel's romance is a great, heartfelt experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant!!!!!!!,"I have never cried so much or been more entertained by a movie. I was a bit skeptical about watching this after reading the book to which i gave 20/10 stars..but I am deeply relieved that hey stuck so closely to the book. John Green I take my metaphorical hat off to you sir.. you have delivered an amazing read and the director has kept to the story. This movie was everything I was hoping for and more. It doesn't happen very often when you read an amazing book and put the movie in the same amazing box. I never have.. I have been greatly disappointed at times.

Understanding The Faults,"The Fault in Our Stars is based on a YA novel that somehow becomes a sensation. It's basically one of those which defines the generation's admiration to literature and music, and it majestically expresses them quite sincerely. The movie gives a perfect vision to their blissful moments as a youth. But it's also an uplifting drama about the risks of having cancer and it might be a difficult thing to balance between the sad parts and their happiness, and fortunately it doesn't become a problem. It's not as completely powerful as it should be, but it's wise enough to just embrace its aesthetics and soul.It's actually not an original thing to see a love story about two sick people trying to gloss over their pain with a relationship. Hazel and Gus's interaction keeps it simple, attempting to forget the real problems of their condition. These types of drama tend to over sentimentalizing the unpleasant truth behind the person in every single moment, but instead, they most of the time just express who they are. The painful moments only happens when it has to remind the two that they are still living with a fatal disease. The film remarkably hits the right note in both elements. The romance is distinctly endearing, the truly soulful moments that aren't meant to be taken away. And the crucial parts which straightly display the reality of what they are going through.They are definitely affecting, but only at the fine level. The real impact only comes occasionally, and when it goes there, it becomes triumphant. The film just needed a lot more contemplation at the rest of the depression. It's probably too busy focusing at the sweet stuff, but that couldn't be a big flaw anyway. The movie just could have suggested to be tougher. Still, I'm glad it manages to flesh out these characters beyond their struggles. The leading cast shines all around. Shailene Woodley is pretty natural as she imbues the character's personality more than just the angsty feelings. It works in both ways but we get to know Hazel better at the brighter side. Ansel Elgort shares the same feat by showing off his charms, until the performance becomes a nuance when the situation has got a lot serious.The Fault in Our Stars has favored enough for the fans by being a really good and faithful adaptation of the popular book, but a better movie would deeply contemplated more on the serious stuff. Nevertheless the film still keeps the themes effective; the characters are wonderfully developed and the drama doesn't rely too much on making the audience cry. Overall it's a pretty strong film which standout by its outstanding performances and a direction that fully understands the environment and subtext of every scene, unlike most YA films. And I guess that is what everybody needed for this adaptation.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Fault in Our Stars,"Ok, yes - it's cheesy and at times quite nauseatingly sentimental, but it is also at times quite a touching story as two determined people who meet over a gentle meal of chemotherapy. ""Hazel"" (Shailene Woodley) - never without her portable oxygen cyclinder - attends a support group where she encounters the ostensibly recovered ""Gus"" (Ansel Elgort) who has turned up to support his blind best friend ""Isaac"" (Nat Wolff). They both have a certain disdain for ""process"" and a fondness for reading. It's that latter fascination that leads them to write to the author of their favourite book. They are surprised when they not only receive a reply, but the offer of an all expenses paid trip to Amsterdam to meet him! She has to convince her parents (Laura Dern and Sam Trammell) that it's a goer, and then off they go for a bonding exercise that introduces them to a Willem Dafoe who really does challenge their ideals. The story then takes quite a dramatic twist, changing the dynamic between the couple somewhat and it's at this point we start to sniff that sweet small of melodrama and the plot hits the heart-string tugging skids a bit. There's a degree of chemistry between the two actors and Dafoe also turns in quite well for his one or two scenes but the rest of it meanders just a bit too much. It's over two hours long, and there's far too much time spent on lacklustre character development. Everyone is easy on the eye and I didn't hate it, it's just a little too sugary for me. If anyone wants to rehearse my eulogy with me, do let me know.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love Conquers All,"Love Conquers All: I saw The Fault in Our Stars starring Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort tonight at AMC Theatres! ""Hazel"" (Shailene Woodley) meets ""Gus"" (Ansel Elgort) at a cancer support group meeting and they basically fall in love. ""Hazel"" does have doubts about falling in love because of her terminal health condition stating she's a ""Ticking Time-Bomb"" but gives in to ""Gus"" who really goes hard for her. I really liked how they both were very witty even knowing their lives would eventually end. I also liked his style of trying to land a date! Not too aggressive but romantic to say the least. Nothing like two virgins going on a picnic! ;-)""An Imperial Affliction"" by ""Peter Van Houten"" played by Willem Dafoe was a book mainly ""Hazel"" was obsessed with but her boyfriend ""Gus"" becomes interested in what the book was about, what it had to offer to their relationship, and her real story, not her cancer story. This led ""Hazel"" ""Gus"" and her mother ""Frannie"" played by Laura Dern to take a dream trip to Amsterdam, Netherlands seeking out answers to their questions regarding Van Houten's book.The end of the movie is quite tragic and emotional, but there's a twist of irony prior to the tragic ending. How would you like to attend your own funeral? Tom Sawyer did in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. I would say, if you go see it, take a box of Kleenex® Brand, your significant, other OR close friend with you, so you have someone's shoulder to cry on! Just sayin... I give it a rating of 9/10!

Moving,"STORY: This film has quite a unique story to it, which is always refreshing when signing up for a romantic film. The plot moves along speedily but with not too much haste. It brings you to the right places at the right times. I would say the climax in Amsterdam is a bit underwhelming. But there is a big unsuspecting twist that turns the movie nicely.ACTING: The acting is pretty damn good in this movie. Woodley and elgort put on a pretty damn good show. Elgort's unrelenting confidence and charm pairs well with woodley's courage and sense of self. The parents are ok. The characters definitely come to life with these two mains though.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Obviously in the stars,"I can not believe how high IMDb ratings are for this movie! I give 1 to this one because this film has a simple plot and can be summarized in three sentences.After you realize the whole film is nothing but a parade of clichés, you may decide to walk out because nothing original is going to happen. Or stay and try to figure out which of the leads would be dying first.Acting is terrible and the fault is obviously in the stars: Gus character and Dad are not able to act, they only pause for the cameras. It gets annoying sometimes, and you start thinking after 15 minutes into the film, would this guy ever be able to keep his lips closed for once please. And he does not!Film is so boring and this is nothing, it has more than one ending. So, when you have the feeling that it's coming to an end... this is wishful thinking. You are far from that happy moment. There is still too many ridiculous cliché moments to watch which are aimed to make viewers cry.Do yourself a favor, do not watch it!

"This decade's Love Story, Ghost, Titanic...","The good ones are the hardest to write about. My thoughts are stars I can't fathom into constellations...The Fault in Our Stars (henceforth TFiOS) is a story of first love, of how to deal with loss and the business of dying, of giving a number from 1 to 10 to the pain you are feeling, and a wake up call to how you want to play the game of life with the cards you are dealt with. The teenage lovers depicted in TFiOS are cancer sufferers stage IV.It sounds like one pretentiously powered to the nth degree emotional manipulative tale. IMHO it isn't and has this almost evangelical sheen gleaming like a halo at the seams. It breaks your heart not because it's sad. It does that by swelling your heart with beauty until it burst. It's sad but it's also very funny and insightful, with the right blend of levity and honesty. It tackles big subjects - life, death, love. And it does it amazingly well, constantly buoyant with a hope even in the face of death. I know the book first and the movie feels like the actual movie that played in my head when I read the book. The movie is extremely faithful to the book.Movies of this sort live or die on one thing - the chemistry between the leads. The chemistry is spot-on perfect. The two are kindred spirits, sharing an irreverent sense of humor and immense charm, and watching them fall in love even as they face universal questions of the human condition - How will I be remembered? Does my life, and will my death, have meaning? - is deeply moving. Shailene Woodley, I know since The Descendants and The Spectacular Now. But they IMHO are not ""sit up in your seat and see me"" material. I see Woodley not as a young Jennifer Lawrence, but an actress with a sweet fragility. TFiOS is her star making role. She embodies the role of Hazel Grace Lancaster so well I couldn't see another actress in it. Love how she plays her - she is not your archetypal teenager suffering from cancer. Ansel Elgort, I only know from Carrie in a dumb role. His performance is pitch-perfect and winsome. Together they are simply marvelous (I know both of them played sister and brother in Divergent but I have yet to see it).The supporting cast did a superb job too and each of them has good scenes to shine in. I thought Willem Dafoe was superbly cast as Van Houten. He totally imbues the character of a bile-spitting curmudgeon. I hate him but I also pity him.If I have to nitpick, I would say Dafoe's character is the weak spot. He feels like a simple plot device right at the end. In book form, I could see the over-arching purpose, but in the film his purpose seems simplified. But I am really nitpicking and scrapping the bottom of the barrel. IMHO TFiOS is near flawless and for a runtime of over 2 hours, we didn't feel the narrative was long drawn. And it has one of the most creative and cutest ways of showing SMSes and emails on screen (I bet it will be copied soon). It's a movie that like pain, demands to be felt and I hope people will fall in love with it like how we fall asleep, slowly at first and then all at once.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bittersweet and darkly humorous love story,"I have not in fact read the book, so this review is based solely on the merits of the film on its own. And I gotta admit, it's a fine movie. Sure the whole message of the film is a touch convoluted as it all starts with the whole speech about how this is not some overly romantic love story coated in saccharine. And yet it kind of is, at least it starts to be as soon as we meet Augustus (Ansel Elgort), one of the savviest, most perfect 18-year-olds ever seen in cinema. And yet that dichotomy doesn't really bother me, because teenagers do that. They think their sufferance is special, unique, and they draw strength from that. It feels real that way.As a whole this is one of the most touching love stories I've seen in a while. A lot of that is due to the phenomenal chemistry between Elgort and Shailene Woodley, playing the main character Hazel. You totally buy that these teens are in love and the movie wastes no time in getting them together, starting the saccharine. In some movies this would be rather Disney-esque, but here it seems more like a stylistic choice. Like they wanted to focus on the actual relationship instead of how it started. And that relationship is very fine. Full of sarcastic humour, snarkiness, tenderness and some really good conversations, it's a romance you won't get tired of watching, no matter your age or gender.The script is also very well paced, the rest of the cast is equally talented, the story contains enough joy and sorrow to reach you and as a whole it's a pleasant way to spend an evening. Definitely recommended for all. And now I kind of have to read the book as well.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Fault in Our Stars compensates for its flaws with Shailene Woodley's performance and tear-jerking moments.,"Summary: The Fault in Our Stars compensates for its flaws with Shailene Woodley's performance and tear-jerking moments. 63/100 (C+)The Fault in Our Stars is a pretty passable and forgettable film. That's why I give it a 6/10. It's far from being a bad film, but it wasn't very special either. I read the amazing book few days before watching the film, and I have to say that the book was breathtaking and deeply emotional. It is filled with lots of funny moments and also, painfully sad moments. The last chapters made me feel so many emotions at once. Then appears this mediocre and sometimes heartless adaptation. It was so disappointing because it does not reach that emotional impact from the book. The movie feels so rushed (even with its 126 minutes of running time).It was so straight to the point, there was not enough character development. My major issue with this film is that each scene feels so mediocre and emotionally empty. Also, when it tries to be funny ends up being awkwardly humorless. Another problem is the lazy screenplay, the writer changed a huge part of the original script and some of the scenes were so badly scripted and awfully directed. I mean, the actions and the way that this talented actors interacted between each other in dramatic scenes were not similar to the book at all. What a shame because the book took more risks. It was braver.Another problem is that there were not enough characters. A lot of important characters from the book were not in the film. Come on, the director had enough running time to put them in, but he didn't. Also, I didn't feel that connection between Hazel, Gus, and that book called ""An Imperial Affliction"". You don't know anything about this book that they love, they just barely talked about it throughout the film and there were not enough conversations about this beloved book in the film. But I'm happy that there were some decent moments here. All the scenes in Amsterdam were beautifully shot and very similar to the book in all the right ways. It was definitely the best part of the movie.All those moments in Amsterdam were very enjoyable and beautiful because there was a lot of chemistry between these two main characters. Shailene Woodley was terrific, she was born to play this role. It's sad that this director went for the easy way and didn't put lots of important and crucial moments from the book in the film. The DVD version has some extra minutes, but it's just not enough. Overall, The Fault in Our Stars is a mediocre and empty film compared to the book, but it definitely has its moments and the performances were terrific. Sorry if I mentioned the word ""book"" so many times in this review, but I can't stop comparing them. (C+)",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Life Changing Movie!,"The Fault In Our Stars is one of the greatest movie made of this genre in a long long time.This movie taught me much more than what 19 years of my life could.And when i would tell you what this movie taught me most people would say that they already knew that but there is a difference between knowing something and believing in something.It taught me that not every infinite is equal and that some infinities are simply bigger than others.You don't get to choose how big infinite or life you get but you do get to choose how you spent it.And i think its better to live less years with no regrets than live more years full of regrets.Second thing that it taught me that you don't get to choose to get hurt in this world or not but you do get to choose who hurt you.If someone you love hurts you than that feeling of pain is a blessing in disguise and the intensity of that feeling of pain could only be told by someone who don't get to feel a thing and what he could give to just felt for once the pain of getting hurt by loved ones.The last but not the least is that this movie taught me how to deal with the biggest fear of my live ""Oblivion"".And that the Oblivion is inevitable and only thing you could do is ignore it.And its not about being widely loved or widely remembered but about being deeply loved and deeply remembered,because it is better that people remember you for who you were rather than what you do!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly Really Good And Touching,"I know that since this movie is based on a book that is read by many teenage girls, the movie is bound to get people scoffing at it and writing it off, and I understand that. I myself expected to see some cheesy stuff that made me cringe at how hard it tries to be deep or sad. But I go into films wanting to enjoy them, and i'm not going to be an idiot and pretend like I didn't like this movie. I think a lot of people say it's bad just because lots of teenage girls like it and that means they need to bash it and shouldn't like it. It turned out to be really good, touching, and a lot less cheesy then I was expecting.Let me say that I think Shailene Woodley does a great job. She sells the role completely and seems so sweet and likable. She takes lines from the book that might, when said out loud, seem cheesy or pretentious, but she makes them sound natural. I would say that I liked Ansel Elgort in his role 93% of the time. He doesn't always sell the lines, and sometimes it makes it seem cheesy or done just to make young teen girls swoon over him. He can occasionally fall into the ""dream guy"" cliché that romance films have, but I would say overall he works. You do care for him. They have great chemistry and it's so great seeing them on screen. I think they work quite well.The sad parts are handled in a good manner. I won't spoil anything, but it doesn't feel like they're doing stuff to force us to cry at the movie. The movie just falls together well and you feel like crying because it works. It makes it all feel real. Their conversations feel fairly real (aside from a few remarks from Elgorts character such as the whole ""metaphor"" thing and the fear of ""oblivion). It really gets you right in the heart.While it's not a perfect movie, it's extremely enjoyable and has a lot of heart. It will make you laugh, cry, and get you thinking about love. I will say that if you're and extremely negative single person, you might not like this movie. I think having an understanding of love or a relationship helps with connecting to the film. I saw it with my girlfriend and it really kind of made me think about our relationship, in a good way. If you're gonna hate on this for being marketed to teen girls, there's no point in watching it because you've already made up your mind about it. Otherwise, go and see this film. It's really something.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good movie for sure, but too overrated for me...","I'm not saying this is not a great movie, I mean sure a girl is sick and all, great storyline but it's just too much.

One Of The Best Love Stories That Went From Book - Movie!,"I loved it! I cried for almost the last 45 minutes of the movie. It's one of movies that you have to bring tissues. It's definitely a chick flick. The people on the team that made the movie cast the right actors and actresses to play the main characters. John Green is one of the best authors for young adult romance. I read the book, but don't really remember some of the major plot, so i can't really compare the book to the movie. It's a movie that i would buy when it comes out on DVD. I think it's going to be like The Breakfast Club for me, I'll be able to watch over and over again and it'll never get old. The part i don't like about the whole story is the way Peter Van Houten treats Hazel Grace, he acts like a total jerk, and they definitely picked the right actor to play his part, Willem Dafoe. I just want to say that i recommend it to all the people who've read the book or like romance.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bring back the romance.,"In the many dumb movies coming out, I felt that the Fault in our Stars brought back the romance to modern day teenagers. Romance we forgot as we grew older and got busy. I loved how the relationship evolved smoothly and grew little by little, making the spectator's hearts grow with them. You'll simply love the way they love each other.Beautiful movie, intelligently written and I wished I haven't read the book before. If I didn't knew what was going to happen I would have cried more, but even though I cried. And generally I say books are better than adaptations, but in this case, I liked the movie way better. I even suggest to watch the film and then read the book, as a relief to revisit those attaching characters and depict beautiful quotes.Have a nice cry.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Lack of substance,"Take out cancer and they are left with a hollow storyline. The movie is simply not believable to me. I know it is fiction but fiction can be made into a very believable film if it has relatable characters or storyline. Not to mention, I find Gus' character rather simple- minded. Hazel's parents characteristics are contradictory too. They are portrayed to be protective of their daughter's well-being and safety but this conveniently dissipates when Hazel wanted to fly to Amsterdam with Gus. Sorry, I think this is not for a more realistic/mature audience, don't get me wrong, I love romantic films but this is sadly not my cup of tea.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why the did I do this to myself?,"This is my first review(rant), having just finished the movie (a little late I know, I just didn't care enough to watch it in theaters), and I had to get this out, I don't cry easily in movies, but when I do, I'm not shy about it, because that's the whole point of fiction to evoke emotion, and if a movie/book/TV show has managed to do that to me, it just means said work of fiction has done it's job.Now that being said, I went in to this movie sort of knowing the ending, and what to expect, having waited this long to watch it, I just couldn't completely avoid spoilers or hearing how people have reacted to it (i.e. tears), what I could not predict was turning this seething mass of tears, pain and snot.Which brings me to my point, why in Thor's name did I do this to myself? Because stories like this add to the human condition, they enrich our mundane lives, pain however bad it might seem at the time, is better than being numb.This an excellent film, one which I regret not watching sooner, because in spite of knowing how it was going to turn out, right from the beginning it still managed to grip me, imagine how much more I could have enjoyed it had caught me by surprise.I guess what I'm saying is, if you're on the fence about watching this movie (as I was) because of the demographic of it's fans or the YA tag, don't be it stands on its own as just a really good story, you don't need to be a teenage girl to enjoy this.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

And then watching it and the title came I couldn't take my eyes away. Its like watching that I just don't want to watch anything else. That is the greatest movie I have ever watched other Passion of the Christ. Seriosuly that is such an amazing love story and how the actors chemistry in the movie worked so well together making it seem like it was real that I had to remember that it was a movie. Like I just can't believe it. BLEW ME OUT OF THE WATER! I've been looking for the book and can't find it so that right there should tell how amazing this story is. I probably will end up reading it as much as Hazel has read An Imperial Affliction. That is just amazing I seriously cannot stop thinking about the eulogy scene when Hazel described her feelings for Gus it was just incredible. And I can't forget Isaac's when he never wanted to see a world without him in it. It was just incredible and how it ended with ""Okay"", just sealed the deal for me. I'm a guy, a straight guy. But I am literally a sucker for this movie. I just don't care it's incredibly a masterpiece. I'm going to watch this again actually if I have the time and even get me started when the DVD comes out.. it will never leave my DVD player. Thank you so much Shailene for your acting in this it was superb. It also made my crush for you even bigger since Divergent. Seriously that was amazing. The emotion into every feeling in every scene was just incredible. It's just impossible for me to think of anybody else playing Hazel. Dude, Ansel, that was seriously some awesome acting for real. The character you brought to life was just amazing. Hilarious, always keeping a smile no matter what, on every one's face. Just incredible. Seriously, congratulations on this movie it was perfect.

Terrible,"I've been trying to figure out why this movie is so highly rated, and Not sure why or how anyone could sit through this nonsense. All around horrible acting, and predictable storyline from start to finish . I was tricked into seeing this, and by far, the worst movie I've seen since 2004. Highlights all the narcissism and self entitlement problems females today bring to the world. Princess syndrome at it's worst. Two sick people and a family, and one individual spends the entire time only thinking of herself and what she wants, how these other person can improve her pitiful life while she does nothing to contribute back. Thinking they need her and won't be able to cope or survive without her, come on.

A Truly Good Movie!...Don't Let the Bad Reviews Fool You.,"After watching this movie, I won't say that I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews. People who look to this film for cliché moments and things to gripe about will find them, but only because they're not capable of getting beyond what they perceive as unrealistic story-telling to see the true essence of what this film is trying to express; a story of suffering and of trying to find purpose in life, even when that purpose has to change and adapt to the suffering.In no way do I see this film as pretentious or nauseating. I think it tells a very honest story, even if it does so in a dramatic way. It's not a perfect film and the acting isn't always profound, but the story itself stays so true to its characters that I think the end result is a film which tells a very powerful story in an almost- perfect way.Personally, I very much enjoyed it. I wouldn't give it a 10, but it's a solid 9. At no point during this movie did I wish it was over, and by the end of it I felt like I was able to gain something very positive...Which, by the way, should be the objective of any film. If realism is all you care about then watch the news. In my opinion, all of the negative reviews on this film are absolutely baseless. It may not be for everyone, but it is for anyone who has emotional depth or an appreciation for human experiences outside of their own...However idealistic they may seem.And just to add some perspective -- I'm a 27 year old male with no close experience with cancer, or really anything expressed in this film, and I still was able to find something in it that I could appreciate on my own level. It's not a movie that's just for one kind of person, and I don't think it was created to be that way. I think this is a film for all people...And it's well worth the two hours it took to watch it. It will certainly leave you feeling some kind of way.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I'm glad I chose to get hurt by this movie,"*SOME SPOILERS*This was definitely by far one of my favourite book to movie adaptations. I left the theatre feeling the same way I felt when I finished the book. Everything was so well done! I loved the acting, directing and writing of this movie!I was skeptical when I found out the Ansel Elgort was going to play Augustus.. I had watched Carrie, and I loved the character he played in that movie, and I thought he was quiet cute.. I also watched Divergent, but personally, I don't like the character, so I didn't think much of his role in the movie. In the book, Augustus was described to be incredibly hot and breath takingly beautiful. Though I thought Ansel was good looking, I was still worried. However, I was not disappointed AT ALL by Ansel's portrayal and the director's choice. I could not have imagined a better person to play Augustus! He did such an amazing job playing the role! I fell in love with Augustus Waters all over again because of Ansel :) I knew that Shailene was going to do an amazing job! I have seen her previous movies/TV shows (The Descendants, The Spectacular Now, Divergent, The Secret Life of an American Teenager) and I already loved her as an actress! I was not at all shocked at her beautiful performance! Supporting cast did a remarkable job, glad to see Willem Dafoe in this movie!The screenplay, locations and direction of this movie completely satisfied me as a book fan. Everything did complete justice to me as a fan. Though there were scenes that were taken out, I was no disappointed, though a little shocked. The way they portrayed the feelings and emotions of the book to the movie was SPECTACULARLY beautiful! The essence of the story and book was not missed! The same lessons were taught, the same emotions were felt and the same ache and tears came through half of the movie. The way the dealt with the tragedy was amazing.. I was so glad that they made us fall in love with Augustus the same way as John Green made us fall in love with him! The worst part for me to deal with was the pre funeral scene mostly, but mostly half of the movie left me in tears!Excellent job done, and I could have not been happier as a book fan :) Thank you Josh Boone, Scott Neustadter, John Green, Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort, Nat Wolff, and all other cast for making this experience the best possible for me!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A very faithful adaptation of an affecting but troubled novel.,"These days, young-adult fiction is everywhere: dystopian stories of moody youths undergoing strife, war and heartache, as in The Hunger Games or Divergent, are dominating the bestseller lists and popping up in cineplexes. What's so unusual about The Fault In Our Stars, an adaptation of John Green's best-selling novel, is that it locates the dystopia and war within the bodies of its teenage protagonists. These kids aren't battling an evil regime or fascist overlords; they're struggling to survive against the merciless onslaught of cancer. Green's book is a bit of an odd beast: touching but manipulative, genuine and fake, all at the same time. The resulting film, being hugely faithful to its source material, thus manages to pull off the same curious trick of overwhelming and underwhelming the viewer, often in the same breath.Hazel (Shailene Woodley) has been living with - or dying of - terminal cancer for years. Her concerned parents (Mike Trammell: under-used; and Laura Dern: wonderfully sympathetic) fuss around her constantly, wanting her to live what life is left to her after the treatments and exhaustion have taken their toll. And so Hazel attends a support group for kids stricken with cancer. One day, she meets Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), a charming, sweet kid whose remission came at the price of a leg. They share an immediate connection, one that deepens as they bond over Hazel's favourite book: An Imperial Affliction, penned by reclusive author Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe). Knowing how much it means to Hazel, Augustus resolves to get her the answers she seeks about the novel - even if they have to travel all the way to Amsterdam to get them.If that sounds like a recipe for melodrama, that's because it is. There's plenty of that in store, of course, because these kids are dealing with the worst and most traumatic of experiences, at a time when they should be healthy and carefree. But the film, as did the novel, does a pretty good job of maintaining a spark of cheeky life amidst all the doom and gloom. Hazel and Augustus trade banter as easily as they do insults, and the affection that grows between them is as entertaining as it is affecting. Woodley and Elgort share a gentle chemistry that works very well, whether they're in the throes of first love or battling through the trenches of disease side by side. Their friendship with Isaac (Nat Wolff), the boy who loses his sight to eye cancer and his girlfriend to her self-absorption, is wonderfully bittersweet too - together, the trio ride the lows of Isaac's depression, and the highs of his tiny moment of vengeance.But, for everything that feels raw and real in the film, The Fault In Our Stars also comes across as overly plotted. Hazel and Augustus are designed specifically to break your heart and swell your tear ducts, which is why their relationship can sometimes feel painstakingly constructed. They are, quite literally, made for each other, which weighs down rather than frees the story in which they find themselves. Their interactions with the troubled, prickly Van Houten also lose some impact in the move away from the page, where his words, ideas and general depravity can take fuller form. In the film, Dafoe ensures that Van Houten remains tough to like, but the character's rougher edges are sanded away in a half-hearted bid for redemption.Ultimately, the film - which lifts entire lines and scenes wholesale from Green's text - triumphs and suffers where the book does. The relationship between Hazel and Augustus, when stripped to its core, is a heart-breaking/warming account of a soul-deep connection that matters all the more for its tragic brevity. There's a lot of welcome, saddening depth in the film, too, about the everyday heroism of children being forced to live on the brink of death everyday. But this is also a deliberately manipulative tale, one that hinges on an awkward twist (present in both book and film) that practically dares you not to care and cry about what's going on. It's an effective tactic, for the most part, but one that doesn't earn so much as exhaust its audiences' affections.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

It really isn't a film I would normally go see but i'm glad i did because it was very touching. What a beautiful film, even from a male's point of view.

"An OK teen RomCom/Sad Drama for a Sunday afternoon, tissues optional.","When I read the reviews of this film I had the filter set to Helpfulness and I couldn't work out if this was the best film ever or the biggest steaming pile of excrement you will ever see. The first eight reviews were 9-8-10-9-8-10-9-10 and I was getting very excited but then suddenly, there were eight 1's in the next 12 reviews....hey? I saw reviews like this with The ""Before..."" trilogy (Sunrise, Sunset, Midnight), I loved those films but others just didn't get it and the 10's and 1's reflected that but I don't think this film falls into that category. At the time of writing this film is 7.7 which is sort of about right. We all have different scales and for me, anything over 7.8 falls into the pretty good category and over 8 into the very good...and so on. When leaving a review there really isn't anything that should get a 10 or a 1 as where can you go when something comes along that is better or worse? As it happens, this is mentioned in the film and it's not a spoiler to say that she describes her pain as a 9 because, well, it could be worse.So having got all of that out of the way, this film is a 7.7 which for me falls into the ""OK"" category. Shailene Woodley is the stand out actress with the rest just, meh, although Willem Dafoe's almost cameo appearance does add a bit of bite to it. My wife loves a good RomCom and is always reaching for the tissues and although she did again with this film, not as much as she usually does. I've shed a tear watching Cars, fought them back in the final scene of Pay It Forward and bawled my eyes out at.....well, you get the picture but not this time. I just wasn't moved enough by the performances or the script. This film is a little similar to Five Feet Apart which we watched yesterday and for me, I preferred that. Its rating is 7.1 which I feel is a little low and should really be a 7.7 with this film being 7.1. Anyway, It's OK without breaking any new ground and even the twists you could see coming and I found myself predicting the script a few times it was that generic. 7.1 for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

The way the film starts. The way it ends. Everything.This film is a landmark when it comes to Romantic films. Not clichéd at all. Very sweet. It makes you fall in love with the characters over and over again. And you empathize with them.The actors were brilliant. They felt the situation. That was evident. It formed a really nice base, the actors' performances, for this amazing story.This is a must watch. Even if you tend to hate romantic films.

Good but not a something interesting to watch it repetitively,"I took many months to watch this movie after it released. I knew about this film from someone review about this story and my crush, after I stalked her social account. Then I got this movie from my friend. By the way, before I want to watch this movie , my cousin told me that it is a sad movie and my friends also said that this movie is best, they said. So, I asked myself, is it really sad like my heart was going jump-out like I was watching Titanic before? It really made me want to watch this movie.But the real sadness was, I already found the spoiler(little bit as a spoiler) before when I was scrolling my time line on twitter and It seems happen the same in the movie. End up, the story not sad at all after I finished watching it. I don't know if I didn't feel sad because of that spoiler or the story feelings can't cross my heart at all. However, I still can feel the sadness and sickness that the Hazel feels. Yes, I'm still into romantic movies. My open-minded about any genres of film happened after that Titanic film, sigh.The story start with the narrative by the main character, Hazel Lancaster. Which is for me it is just good. I'm not the fan of the novel of this adaptation and I also never read it before. I also knew that there are many quotes or an impact dialog in this story that has brought up in this movie, nice. For me, the plot is not too slow and not too rush , it well organised. The ""sad moment"" not really gave an impact for me, maybe due to the spoiler as I point out in this writing. What I really love is the scene when they are, Hazel and Augustus going to meet the novel writer of Van Houten that they really admire in Amsterdam. It is really unexpected 'tragedy' happen in their meeting, for me it the cause of the story is getting interesting and this scene has a thing to do with the ending.Lastly, I tried to watch it back but for me this movie isn't powerful enough to push me for watching this again.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Infinity in a finite life.,"It is very hard to form coherent thoughts and sentences after seeing this movie, just as likely after reading the amazing book by John Green. The fault in our stars is definitely a masterpiece, in every single way. When I first heard about it, I thought this will be yet another teen love story, with no original thoughts whatsoever. Boy, was I wrong. First of all, the book is perfectly written, the story and the characters are so real, when you start to read it, you will immediately jump into the John Green created world, and well, that is a roller-coaster ride that only goes up. I saw a lot of tearjerker movies that had something to do with cancer or illness, but I have never saw a movie that was so artistically and perfectly wrapped up in this psychological universe, which was filled with wisdom. The movie not only shows us a love story, it also tries to get you thinking about the finite life, and at the same time, its infinity. However, what truly is remarkable, the fact that it does that in such a down to earth way. Not heavy quotes and out of reach definitions, just simple, yet powerful thoughts that are going through well-organized minds.The movie adaptation I have to say was certainly not a let down. I was really scared to watch this after reading the perfection that book was, but I am glad I watched it. Shaileene and Ansel were great choices for Hazel and Augustus, they are great actors, and they really grasped the essence of the characters. The milieu and the whole environment of the movie was very similar to the book's, director Josh Boone did an amazing job. The monologues were spot on, ad the saddest scenes in the books were truly the saddest scenes in the movie.It is really hard to create something extraordinary in today's world. John Green, you did that. And for that, you will be remembered. You are loved widely, and I am sure, you are loved deeply. Because, that is all that matters. Thank you for giving a world some infinity within this finite life.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Enchanting and a must watch,"Well, lets begin with a line from the movie (believe me, this one's full of 'em) ""If you want the rainbow,you have got to deal with the rain."" The movie is a very soothing journey as you travel beside Hazel Grace the protagonist of the movie and you get to see lives of few teenagers struck by cancer. The plot is sad on the whole but this very fact delivers the enchanting touch to the viewers. It is very well directed and story is really touching; I haven't read the book but having seen the movie I'm sure the book shall be awesome too. In terms of story content the movie doesn't offer much as I can possibly sum it up in a few sentences (don't worry I won't do that) but this is certainly the type of movie one doesn't watch for the story, you watch it for its sheer beauty and emotions. Woodley and Elgort appear as a great adorable couple, interestingly both of them are quite different but still incomplete and they fell in love because they in a sense complete each other and also teach each other and the audience great lessons about life. They show us that in spite of all difficulties and pain we endure there are always people who love us unconditionally and will always remember us no matter what happens and it is our duty to pause and enjoys those really great moments with them rather than yearning for public recognition. This is aptly reflected when Augustus mention that,""Hazel was not widely loved but she was deeply loved"" and I guess that is what is important for all of us to understand. You see her favorite writer flooded with letters symbolizing fame and wide respect, love but is in constant misery and not at all in peace but his work has motivates many like Hazel. So, what is the point of all this fame when is doesn't bring peace to you.The movie is filled with exquisite sequences portraying Hazel and Augustus as a very adorable couple, their date in Amsterdam is particularly well shown where the actors aptly exhibit the excitement as well as anxiety of a first date.Well, I'll end this citing another dialogue, this time from Augustus, ""There's a thing about pain, it demands to be felt.""",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"The Fault, Dear Brutus, is not in our Stars, but in this Film Adaptation","I'm not exactly sure how I feel about The Fault in our Stars' film adaptation. On one hand, I thought the casting was perfect (especially Gus and Issac), and I loved that the movie remained completely true to the novel, but on the other hand, the movie didn't really resemble the novel at all. Never would I willingly read a book or watch a movie about a romance between two teenagers with cancer--the whole concept just reeks of cheap sentimentality. But I read TFIOS because I was familiar with John Green's work and I knew that his take on cancer wouldn't be your average, clichéd cancer story--and of course, it wasn't. For all its pretentious, unrealistic dialogue and overcrowded metaphors, the book managed to turn a clichéd concept into a witty, cynical, but ultimately hopeful story that evoked Sisyphus (hence the hamster in An Imperial Affliction being named after the mythological figure): cancer was Hazel and Augustus' rock, but it was their rock, and they made the best of it. The point Green makes in the novel is that Shakespeare's notion that ""the fault...is not in the stars, but in ourselves,"" is pretty much BS. The fault IS in our stars, in a seemingly random, chaotic universe that hands out cancer to undeserving kids.I didn't get that depth from the movie at all. While I enjoyed watching Hazel fall in love with Gus slowly, the movie went down hill when she fell in love with him ""all at once."" The film suddenly turned into what Hazel's voice-over kept insisting it wasn't: a gooey, tragic cancer story. The trouble is that I don't know how the script or direction could have been altered to give the movie the book's poignancy. Like I said, it was completely true to the novel. Maybe they could have made Hazel's mom less of a horribly stereotypical mom (she was the worst part of the film, in my opinion). Maybe, just as Hazel can't breathe without her oxygen tank, John Green's story simply can't thrive without his prose.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Therefore my expectations were extremely high, and that is always a problem because for most of the times I end up being disappointed to some degree. And so, I did expect something a little bit different, in terms of emotion but the movie was extremely similar to the novel aside from a few changes. Still, I never got to reach that moment were I felt that this was an adaptation of the book I really loved and enjoyed in many levels. It was something I was hoping for, and it never delivered, except for a few crucial scenes. Moreover, the acting was excellent, Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort were spectacular and were the perfect choice for the characters of Hazel and Augustus. But the movie was Shailene's, she owned every scene and was great once again. While Ansel, he was great too in the way he acted and how he expressed himself and his mannerisms, but I didn't like his physical appearance for the character, to me he wasn't Augustus in the outside but only in the inside. But overall they had a very beautiful chemistry and it showed. Also Laura Dern was excellent too. The movie looked very beautiful, the cinematography gave another sense to the whole movie by not looking like another teen love story about cancer, but a real love story about real people. Furthermore, the ending was something that I knew was coming and that would give me chills, and it was everything I knew it would be. It was extremely emotional and just perfect. Therefore, this was a very good movie, that even though was just like the book, to me it lacked some of the pathos that really made the book very special, but maybe that was just because I knew it was coming. But still, its a very beautiful romantic movie that should please many fans of the book and also those who haven't, that will end up falling in love with Hazel and Augustus. ~June 5, 2014~",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Better than Okay.,"This movie was more than okay. I absolutely loved it and it will definitely be hard to beat for movie of the summer. It is definitely hard for me to put this movie into words because as I was watching it I wasn't really concerned on how this would rank. It was a great movie with wit, character, a structured script, and comedy. Although I haven't cried in a movie since Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close back in 2011, I did cry while watching this tear jerker being played out by these amazing faultless stars. The only thing that needs improvement is the transitions from one subject to another in scripting and in the story. I did jump around quite a bit. All in all, I give this an 8/10 stars. No fault in that and this movie also earns a spot on my top 100 movie list. Thanks!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Okay–okay movie (pun intended),"Movie runs at variable pace. Sometimes, the story runs too fast so that you are not able to feel what characters are feeling. Other times when director wants to throw some solid dialogues and wants the viewers to appreciate them, he makes it go slow. He cuts way too many scenes but naah... not the dialogues. He adjusts the dialogues of those deleted scenes elsewhere. Many a times, he desperately put okay–okay thing to create the effect even when it is not fitting the situation. Secondly, the movie is too straight forward. Everything is served on a plate for the viewers so much so that they are not required to think what is going to come-up next. In short, this movie is made for dummies.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Don't forget a box of tissues,"You know how really good books are often adapted into crappy movies that don't do the story justice? The Fault in Our Stars is not one of them.It's hard to describe the plot of TFIOS to convince someone to see it. I mean what else could you really say besides ""The Fault in Our Stars is a romance comedy about two teenagers with cancer who fall in love"" that doesn't make it seem like a typical sappy romance film that most of us are tired of by now? How else could we try to distinguish the unique quality of TFIOS as we know it besides following up on that plot summary with, ""But really, it's John Green. You just have to trust me on this!""?I was honestly skeptical about seeing this movie at all. The cast didn't seem very exceptional from what I've seen from the trailers. I was afraid, like many others, that seeing the movie would replace my vision of the book as when you thinks Harry Potter, you instantly imagine Daniel Radcliffe. And I didn't trust the performances of the actors, especially having last seen Maleficent, in which all the cast were extremely bad with the exception of Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning.It wasn't until I saw John Green's tweets about sneaking into the theater to see TFIOS with oblivious movie goers, learned about his close involvement with the movie adaption, and discovered that it was the official opening day that I got really excited and asked some friends to see the movie with me. I was skeptical throughout the entire movie until an involuntary teardrop ran down my face, and when it was difficult to stop myself from sobbing, I knew, this was extremely good. Shailene Woodley (Hazel) and Ansel Elgort (Augustus Waters) were absolutely phenomenal. Everything was extraordinary - the pacing, execution, cast, story content (what they included and didn't leave out from the book in the movie), music selection - not to mention hilarious. Well worth a watch. You'd be missing out if you didn't. I'm going to see TFIOS for a second time tomorrow because it's just that good.I suggest reading the book first and then watching this. Make sure your heart can handle the tears. You'll be glad to be a part of Hazel and Gus's little infinity.Okay?Okay.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""Okay?"" - Yeah, Okay!","The Fault In Our Stars stuck in my sights since the huge success of book. I could see it everywhere I go and I love bookshops. Frankly, book cover is truly original and catchy. But I'm not really into these teenage dramas and never read it. However, I did consider watching film because of two leads: talented and beautiful Shailene Woodley and newcomer Ansel Elgort.Golden Globe nominee Woodley (The Descendants) plays a girl, Hazel Grace Lancaster, with thyroid cancer, who's been diagnosed of disease in early age and since then her life mostly happens in between home, hospital and support groups. While Elgort's character, Gus, is an ex basketball player, cancer survivor with an amputee leg. As they meet at the most boring support group meeting, their friendship gets a weird and interesting start that turns into unconditional love (whatever it is). Even from the very beginning we all know that this is not going to work, because any of them can just die and leave another behind. Gus and Hazel knowing this are truly having the moments of their lives, making all their dreams come true, which includes trip to Amsterdam - a place where the author of Hazel's favorite book lives.The Fault In Our Stars is a pleasant movie to watch and mostly because of main characters and actors. Hazel Grace and Gus are the most real people among other hundreds of teenage dramas. They are real with their problems, personalities, aspirations, the way they love, etc. Shailene and Ansel manage to just fit the bones of this couple and turn their personalities inside out - making them easy to read, understand. However, good parts of writing does not go further, since the rest of story is just another A Walk to Remember. Hence, it does not bring much new to the table. The end is predictable, it says nothing new.I'd say Shailene Woodley's performance is surprisingly good. Surprisingly because The Fault In Our Stars does not seem one of those movies with brilliant acting. But she makes her character so nice, so good to know, so perfect to watch, that I can not resist thinking that Shailene actually was great here. Hazel Grace has some emotional breaks, a lot cries, drama, fun, laughs and Woodley deals with this huge palette of emotions quite impressively.Ansel Elgort's portrayal of her sweet, gentlemen boyfriend is no less good. He, to the contrary, is more fun, not dramatic, easy going.Since, The Fault In Our Stars fails to deliver something new, extraordinary or refreshing, it's a nice one time watch film, with impressive performances that is not going to be remembered too long.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Thanks a lot to everyone who have been part of the movie. I wish them a happy life and am eternally grateful. I hope we learn to endure the relationships in the best possible way.

How I learned to stop worrying and disregard the flaws...,"I really like the idea of 'fixing' a film's average rating by kicking it with a 0 or 10 and I make use of it deliberately, but since this has been happening here extensively enough, I will rather try to offer you a biiit of a mediating evaluation, really because I think that this is not a film which you necessarily have to love OR hate. Apart from that, I am actually still trying to figure out myself what made me like it in the first place - because i did.In fact if you are, like me, prone to readily dislike a film for being all to cheesy, predictable and like this one bourgeois (as hell!) - you will be struggling trying to watch more than the first two scenes featuring the pretentious, smart-arse make-believe stereotype Gus... some acting is bad, while sometimes character concepts are just the painful thing - and they usually do not coincide here. An in itself very good but in this configuration maybe sometimes very series-like popish soundtrack and suboptimal camera settings are just things I want to have mentioned. It has some lengthy moments and awkward scenes (yep, the Anne Frank house clapping scene is unbearable) and aspects of questionable directing....In the end you may still accept the film as a whole - while it has to rely mostly on the few following things: (1) the simple inherent tragedy, that works however rich and white the characters may be and their well-depicted inner conflicts. (2) the great character of Hazel Grace, beautifully represented by Shailene Woodley, who evolves despite some script-related clichéising (...she is also kind of unapproachable...so what?) and (3) its emotional power, because in their moments of genuine weakness (or strength!), the characters are believable and they function.I think TFIOS really encourages us to see the romanticism, in all its frailty and 'vanity', as a refuge and a beautiful, joyful thing while it is strongest; this innocent and so temporary romantic love as a momentary prospect against oblivion. It is macabre and wondrous at the same time that the two lovers might only have enjoyed the purest form of romantic love in the face of death - but does that change so much about it in general? Anyway, it is a story about teenagers, teenage worlds of thought and maybe ideals - if you do not care about that, you won't enjoy the film either.Cheers!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Answer,"It has been said that the movie is a sick love story. To me, it's a realistic love story. Love must count no matter the length of the time. Death also doesn't mean to an end. By the poetic name of the movie, stars refer to the concept of death in western culture in which death is an ultimate end of one's life. There's nothing more after one's life. When we look close to the storyline, the whole movie emphasizes the fragility of human life and the purity of love. The pipe and the conversation when Peter Van Houten plays funky rap music to Hazel reveal that love is a feeling than an answer. When people look for an answer like Hazel, they will be emotional and hurt themselves. The death of Gus can mean the end of love or the start for Hazel to learn to love, and the answer is from us. The fault seems to be the only answer of death.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Better than expected,  but not conceptional","I had heard about this movie but I postponed the watching for months. Evidently, I was afraid to live through another teen tear-jerker without a difference...Well, my fears did not come true full, particularly during the 1st half and very end, where balanced approach, pleasant performances (incl. a ""harsh"" one by William Dafoe) and some distinct shifts made the watch rather seamless; plus, for me, a nice joy of recognition regarding Amsterdam. But then, some typical Americanisms appeared (e.g. related to eggs and funeral rehearsal) and when one started to guess the ending, then it was not that catchy anymore, at times even protracted (in the Anne Frank House, for example).True, I realize that I do not belong to the target audience, as well as I have never experienced respective issues in my environment, but I often felt that the movie in question was made for attracting audience and making big money, vis-à-vis e.g. 50/50, dealing with related topic.

8/8,"I don't cry very often - in my group of friends, I'm known as having a heart made of ice. Before I watched the The Fault in Our Stars today, I could not remember the last movie I've cried to, the last one being at least three years ago.The Fault in Our Stars is a very good movie for the right audience. I'm luckily in that audience, being a 15 year old girl, having read the book also.In a very specific scene with Hazel talking to her parents about when she'll die of the tough lung cancer she had, it reminded me of what I was doing through doing my half-depression some time ago. There, I dealt with the same feelings - about being forgotten, leaving people behind, and death in general, which I struggled with accepting. Just there, I felt so connected to these characters, even though I don't have cancer, and never have - but it just felt so real, and that's where I cried in the cinema for the first time in my life.The acting in this movie is very, very good. It felt honest, it felt realistic. The script could easily have made this movie into one big sap with soaking cheese, but with the very talented actors and amazing directing, the film avoided that.Of course, this isn't for everyone. I would say it's mostly for teens around my own age, and if you find yourself having a need to break your own heart and think about your role in the universe, go see TFIOS.

Other than that, I felt as if the movie did a great job of telling the story of Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters.

Not  faulty at all!,"There are not too many faults in the emotional ""The Fault in Our Stars"". The movie is centered around Hazel and Augustus, two teenagers with cancer who form an exceptional friendship and romance. It is based on John Green's best-selling book which made plenty of green in the literary world. The ascending Shailene Woodley marvels again with another solid performance, here as Hazel; Shailene fortunately has not diverted herself into the poisons of Hollywood demise. Newcomer Anton Elgort is an unfaulty star-in-the-making with his work here as Augustus. And I also thought Willem Dafoe was stellar as novelist Van Houten; but a Dafoe performance is usually outstanding just at default. Josh Boone's direction of the film was authentic as he did not convert ""The Fault in Our Stars"" into a weepy Lifetime movie by incorporating a myriad of themes in the picture. I loved how love for a novel became a potent point in the movie; yes, I even read into that. Sure, this type of film will bring the handkerchiefs and kleenexes out, but I refuse to call ""The Fault in Our Stars"" a tearjerker.

An Average Teen Romance with Heartfelt Moments,"The Fault in Our Stars delivers an emotional story, but ultimately falls into the category of an average teen romance. While the performances from the leads are heartfelt, the film follows a well-worn path of young love and tragedy that feels familiar rather than fresh. The chemistry between the characters is genuine, and there are some truly touching moments, but the narrative often leans too heavily on melodrama, making the emotional impact feel more predictable than powerful. Fans of the book may find it more engaging, but for those unfamiliar with the source material, it can feel like another tear-jerking romance without much new to offer. The film is certainly charming at times, but it doesn't break the mold of typical teen romances. In the end, The Fault in Our Stars is a solid watch, but it's far from the groundbreaking romance it's often made out to be.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's refreshing to see a female teen character who attracts a guy through her smarts and wits. It's also refreshing seeing a male character who isn't all horned up and actually believes in courtship and respect.A special shout out to Shailene_Woodley, who has an amazing and convincing performance.If you are parent of teenagers, I this would be a mostly positive movie for kids to watch. There is just old-fashion courting that you never see in teen sex comedies. It almost has a religious feel and overtones but avoids that path.

I finally went to see the movie with my daughter and it was lovely - though you could probably have sailed out of the movie theatre on the river of tears going on around us by the end of the film.This is a very faithful adaptation, though it leaves out a lot of the philosophical stuff in the book (that really wouldn't have translated well on screen).

"2 parts schmaltzy trudge, 1 part beautiful heartbreak. Worth working through. Just.","The Fault in Our Stars, adapted from John Green's novel of the same name, is the story of Hazel (Shailene Woodley) and Gus (Ansel Elgort), two teenage cancer patients who meet at a support group, form a friendship and fall in love. It is a fairly typical teen romantic drama of two souls reaching out to one another, each with their own emotional and physical baggage; Gus a prosthetic leg, Hazel the constant companion of an oxygen tank.For two thirds of the 126 minute running time, Josh Boone's follow up to Stuck in Love is an uncomfortable experience. Not because of the subject matter of cancer and inevitable death, but because The Fault in Our Stars tries so damn hard.Constantly we are pushed and cajoled into empathizing with the sick teenagers and to feeling the depth of their friendship. It all feels far too forced. Hazel's mother, Frannie (Laura Dern) gushes and sighs sycophantically, everything is amazing, fantastic, absolutely beautiful The dress she gives her daughter is just one example of painful gushing that is promptly undone in the very next scene when a waitress shows them to a table wearing a genuinely stunning dress.It is irksome, annoying, cringeworthy and the worst kind of labored, insulting, schmaltzy teen pap that ostracizes anyone with at least two years distance from the completion of puberty. I just wanted Hazel to get on and die so I could go home and whinge at my wife for dragging me along.Then, in the final act, Boone turns The Fault in Our Stars around. In a scene I shall, in the interest of avoiding plot spoilers, refer to simply as the 'poultry' scene, the dynamic changes. From there on The Fault in Our Stars finds a grip on reality, it stops propelling us into emotional traps and just flows, carrying us along with it.From there on it feels real. The contrivances evaporate, the bludgeoning ends and it just gets on with the job of showing us a heartbreaking story of life that sometimes isn't fair and death that is inevitable, the only mystery being the timing and cause of it.Elgot is barely watchable without inciting feelings of mild, petulant violence. He is smug, the ultimate jock without an American football team at his back. While I'm guessing Gus should be suave, confident and just ballsy enough to be admirable and lovable, Elgot plays him as cocky and in need of a jolly good slap. Again, regard that as for the first two thirds; in the final act he, too, manages to rein it in a little and pulls us on side. His Gus isn't bad, just annoying and the kind of kid you'd make you wonder why your daughter wasn't aiming higher.Woodley (The Secret Life of the American Teenager, The Descendants), however, gives a stunning, tempered performance that pulls us onside from the outset. Hazel is a good kid, a sweet girl but not apple pie perfect – close, but Woodley just avoids it. The emotion that pours from Woodley, racks her and shocks us. It is impossible not to imagine ourselves in that situation even if we have limited experience of it. There is no suggestion of onions rubbed into the eyes prior to rolling the camera, just an outpouring of pent up anger and an unfair amount of heartbreak. Stunning!Though The Fault in Our Stars belongs to Woodley, director Boone and his screenwriters deserve the final compliment. It would have been far too easy, and from the first hour or so I imagined it no other way, to extend the film to its final mulchy conclusions. Boone exercises restraint, turns around a two-star trudge into a journey that ends with possibility within the inevitability. It is a perfect end that leaves a heaviness in the heart rather than the earlier tightening n the stomach.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Powerful but so subtle and heart-wrenching all at once..,"First of all, I would like to say I was completely torn by this movie from the perspective of this young boy who is desperate but so singular and unique, and this beautiful young girl, also somewhat desperate, who thinks her insecurities and cancer make up the reason she had no friends.

WE were forced by society to be this way. Our rational minds tells us ""boys don't cry"" since we were babies. Do you think we have no emotions.... go one day to a bar to see a man crying, when emotions take over, and overpower rational mind after a few.But that was OT. This movie...it got me sobbing like a little girl.I felt tears pouring of my cheeks. Romeo and Juliet is a sleeping pill compared to that. I hate this movie for that. Last time I watched a drama. F#ck that. Considering I'm especially really empathetic in real life, I can't watch this kind of movies. I can put myself in their shoes, and I feel all that pain. It's too f#cking painful. I hope I'll forget this f#cking movie soon... I have to give it an 8, I can't go any higher, because I know when I will sober up, I'd give it a 6 . OH f#ck you... I'll give it a a a 9.

TIL: Adding cancer as a story theme doesn't make your movie any more interesting or any less shallow,"The Fault in Our Stars is not much more than a cliché romance movie, but with one main difference - the theme of cancer. The fact that both the protagonists have cancer could have given this otherwise atrociously shallow movie some depth, but it didn't. The cancer theme was poorly handled, and despite dealing with such an important and sensitive issue, the movie doesn't rise to anything more than an unoriginal and cliché chick flick. By using it's cancer theme purely as a vehicle for romance, this movie ends up feeling... wrong. It's offensive.See, this movie is essentially like porn for women. The female lead is a girl most girls can identify with, except that she has cancer. The male lead is, as usual with these type of movies, the boy of every girls dreams, except that he has cancer. He's handsome, clever, fit, alpha male etc. Inexplicably, he has eyes only for the female lead (of course) and is a virgin.So it's basically just another romance movie. Cancer doesn't give this movie any depth, but it's poor handling of the sensitive theme does make it more offensive.Oh, and no, kissing where Anne Frank spent several miserable years doesn't make your movie any better, it's just offensive.Normally I wouldn't review this stuff, but this is the most overrated movie on IMDb.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
courageous and moving,"I want to give my opinion of this movie and I usually don't write reviews but after seeing a lot of negative ratings/reviews I must. For all the people who gave this below 8 star rating I guess you don't see the complexity of this film. You only see the negativity around every corner and to be honest it doesn't take much...but if you look you will see the brightness, love and simplicity around you. It is there and once you grasp it...well it's painless.I know this isn't a movie review...the movie itself speaks volumes..heart wrenching, powerful, courageous, selfless. Imagine if we all could set aside our problems and have concern for others without thought..? Imagine the compassion we could learn from others..if we allowed ourselves to feel...as a grown man watching this film I would be honored to have a son who portray this character and even more honored to have a man with so much selfless love and devotion in love with my daughter...WOW...some may say it's just a movie....well I say if it's plausible its possible.This is a must see film so don't listen to those negative reviews...allow yourself to feel and be emotional...after all we are human...right..?As Anne Frank said ""think of all the beauty still left around you and be happy""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"It's a good life, Hazel Grace","The Fault in our Stars.I read the book. I fell in love. Then I fell in love with a person. Then I proceeded to pass it onto my loved one. She fell in love. I fell in love with her falling in love with this lovely book.Anyway.My biggest hope (and fear, simultaneously) was that the movie would a) have the wrong casting b) not follow the book and cut and slice into the plot c) ruin the former experience of readingTurns out I was wrong on all 3 levels.The Fault in Our Stars has what I consider the most perfect casting for this movie. Everyone more or less converges with their story counterparts and has their story to tell. Each character is memorable by means of acting performance and facial/bodily expressions. Character development here is as intense as was the case with the book.Okay, so enough about acting, what about my blunt (and totally biased) opinion?The movie was plain brilliant. I hardly ever cry at movies, even less so when I am in the company of others. I was, I did and I did it a lot (in this case that is not a shameful feat). Hazel Grace, cancer patient and realist versus Augustus Waters, former cancer patient and idealist. The chemistry between the two persona is astonishing and utterly fascinating. I think everyone is a mix of those two dispositions, and we struggle to choose which one to rely on... rendering both persons very easy to relate to. The movie pierces fixed ideas ostensibly set in stone on cancer and adds ideas of its own. Of course, kudos go to Green for the original work, but the movie manages to convey the same defiance, which I believe is a rare occurrence. Does cancer have to define your life? No. Is everyone fighting a brave battle? No. Is it okay to glorify the dead? No. These are all very controversial topics but I agree with each and every one of them to a differing degree. Questioning these delicate topics and considering the way outsiders see cancer vs how cancer patients look upon it is a very needed debate in contemporary society.The movie managed to pinpoint what made the book so true to life and expand on it, without deviating from the main plot.Excellent. Intoxicating. Life-changing. Go see this movie now. Or see it again. It matters. It deserves it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Undeserved acclaim,"Somehow, this unabashedly manipulative film has become a runaway financial success, and I have to say I don't get it. All of the characters are nothing more than quick sketches that are never fleshed out, right down to the main romantic couple. Heck, even the characters from the blandest dime-a-dozen big-budget action film you can think of have more dimension and personality than the ones paraded across the screen here.Make no mistake: This movie's screenwriters didn't set out to write a story about Hazel and Gus. No, they set out to write an Emotional movie with a capital ""E."" I have nothing against those movies; as a matter of fact, I absolutely eat them up. But the thing is, in order to be effective, you need characters that people care about and identify with, not cardboard cutouts with about as much depth as a single sheet of paper.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
John freaking Green,"Back in 2012, I read the book for the first time. Little did I know that a little more than 2 years later that I would be seeing John Green's creation come alive on the big screen.What I LOVED about this movie, and should really be the ""norm"" for all other books turned into movies is that it was incredibly true to the book. And what was left out of the movie, was at least reference in someway or another. Examples: Gus has a poster of the movie ""V for Vendetta"" above his bed - talked about briefly in the book - and Hazel and Gus sitting on the swing - referencing back to the ad they created to sell the swing set in the book. After this movie, I want all movies made from books to have the author sitting right next to the director THE WHOLE TIME.This movie made me go through a whole box of Kleenex in less than 2 hours. Definitely one of the best movies I've seen this year (so far).",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great entertainment,"The fault in our stars is amazing! I was very excited when i first found out about this movie, but when it finally came out i read many bad reviews, so despite how excited i was, i prepared myself to be disappointed when i went in to see the movie. But i wasn't disappointed at all. The fault in our stars is basically just another ridiculous teenage love story but what makes it different than the rest, or better if i should say, is that it's realistic. It's realistic in the sense that life is a bitch and that it doesn't always have a happy ending. Its realistic in the sense that pain, death, and all other bad things are inevitable. That you will get hurt and you don't have a say in it but you do have a say in who will hurt you. I enjoyed this movie so much, i laughed and 'aawwwwed' and cried. It was a little boring at the beginning because the dialogues were a little too long in my opinion, but overall it was great. I give it an 8/10. Although i know why there are some bad reviews- this movie is not for everyone. Its mostly for girls. I dragged my brothers to watch this movie with me and they complained the whole time . If you're someone who's looking for a romantic drama that can make you cry, go see this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

What a surprise!,"Now let me get something out of the way first. I am a 15 year old male who went to see this movie with 4 other guys. We wanted to see what the fuss was about as none of us had read the book. Also, none of us expected ourselves to cry. Well weren't we in for a shock.I loved this movie. The two leads (Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort) were superb, their realism that they brought to each of their roles worked well and they had a fantastic chemistry between each other which really complimented the movie's storyline. I thought the script was great as it isn't your usual YA sappy romance story, with an overall less cliché feel. However near the beginning I did think the script was a bit cringe-y with the staring and what not, but as the story progressed and became deeper so did the writing become more mature.As much as hardcore fans of the book say to read it first, I really enjoyed this movie by going in knowing next to nothing about it, and I feel that made the twists all the more hard-hitting. Some scenes brought me to tears, where as others made me laugh with awkwardness. Me and my friends all left the cinema broken and shocked. We now have a pact never to speak of it again.

Not a typical teen romance film,"These days with so much emphasis being put into movies with high-tech special effects and things going boom. It's refreshing to have a chance to watch a gem of a film such as this one. Now, I am not one of those audience members that are into romance movies much (maybe during my younger days), especially teen romance movies. But I am so glad I got a chance to watch this teen romance movie. Lot of teen romance movies or dramas these days seems to go into that really sappy, pretentious, delusion direction and just misses it's mark. And seems to target the audience members that likes to eat a bucket of ice cream while watching some superficial cardboard cutouts input on what love is in order to feel that sense of sweetness in their lives (which is understandable). However this movie is like a romantic poetry on screen, this is a bold statement but I would even go as far as calling it modern day Shakespearian story work. Mainly because the story is so well written and it delves into the mindset and the core if the matter when it comes to emotions and heart. So when it comes to the story it's about 2 people dealing with cancer and the relationship between one another. You can let reality crush you and live in denial while trying to forget by means possible or you can stand and fight through and seek (and these are two characters dealing with cancers!). It also wasn't forced to get emotions our of the audiences or did it seem self-indulgent like some art house movies. Sometimes when it comes to movies like this, even the serious scenes sometimes comes off funny because of how cheesy it is, however that wasn't the case for this film. When it came to the funny parts the audiences in the theater was laughing, during the cute scenes they were all chuckling, and during the sad or serious scenes it was dead silent. That my friends is movie magic, as a matter of fact I ALMOST cried...That is a lie, I actually did cried then looked around to see I wasn't the only one in order to not go in that guilt trip. Thankfully, I wasn't the only one, but even if I was the only one, it's okay. Augustus Waters is now one of my favorite leading male character in this genre. He is just so charming, humorous, witty, knows how to use sarcasm in a non-demeaning way and above all the guy has integrity. The couple in this film was so likable, cute and the chemistry was so uplifting that I wanted to get out of my seat and root for them. Overall this is a movie that really tugs on the heartstrings and is not just another teen romance movies that Hollywood seems to be chugging out these days. If anyone including teens and even elders are looking for something to do during date night, check this film out. It will make you fall in love with movies all over again. As a matter of fact this is probably my favorite film of 2014. Oh and the soundtrack is fantastic.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
My first written movie Review,"I did give this a 10 and here's why. This movie was real, it was not faked and not filled with teenage fluff. It touched me as a mother and a woman. I wanted this girl, who was given a horrible dose of life, to love life. Experience everything that she could and be happy. As a mother I saw what I would want for my daughter. I would want her to love her hardest and die knowing what that felt like. As I woman I want to be loved like she was. This movie spoke on levels that most of us can't comprehend. I have never been so sick that I have had to stay the night in a hospital. I have never had to be rushed to the er by a loved one or have people terrified every time I call their name. The person that this book was based on knew all of those things. She may not have had a teenage romance before she passed but her memory will live on because of who she was. The movie made a point to tell you that this was not an ordinary teenage love story but it was an exceptional one. I hope when you decide to watch this movie you go in ready to let go of what you know about people and clichés and just be a part of Hazel an Gus. Be strong, scared, loving, compassionate and vulnerable. Be so happy you have another day to be great and enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It's unfair to let it go, what we love the most in the world.","The director might be soaring after back to back success. Interestingly, both the films dealt with writers, but the main themes were romance. He's just a two movie old and now the movie goers can expect eagerly for his next venture. This movie was based on the teen novel of the same name about a 16-years-old cancer patient.Hazel Grace, who is battling between life and death is also a strong fighter against all the odds. When her mother sends her to attend the group therapy she meets Augustus Water, a fellow member. As she is being sarcastic, Waters finds an interesting character in her. A friendship develops and they spend more time together. Even knowing there will no future together, the relationship progress and how everything ends is the rest.Usually cancer themed movies are called tearjerker films. Surprisingly, this movie's aim was different. Of course emotion strikes, but the story narration and character developments were the basic goal. Three-fourth of the movie was well told story about teen romance. The afterwards account begins with a twist which were portrayed in the usual manner. Like all the movies, kept sentiments in the last part. The last quarter was very predictable, but they avoided cliché as much possible.''Apparently, the world is not a wish-granting factory.''The parents' role was kind of mysterious one, that diverts viewer from their anticipation. Interesting it also creates some doubts. Compared to the previous movie 'The Spectacular Now', Shailene Woodley looked completely different. That means the physical transformed to look a perfect 16 year old was amazing. Her performance as well gives an impression that the Hollywood's future Academy award grabbing the female lead is on making. At this rate she can do that like Jennifer Lawrence did.As for the lead actor, it is a good breakthrough and expecting the same result from his next movie as well. This movie, which runs over a 2 hour was smartly sliced the contents and organized those on the right spots. Many had agreed it was a fine cinema transformation from a book. So you can try this, but be careful because nowadays most of the teens movies are overrated because of the overwhelmed teen audience. The warning meant only for the older people. I'm sure the youngster will love this movie, I mean most of them.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best Movie,"""The Fault In Our Star"" is the romance movie. This movie talked about two teenage cancer patients that fall in love with each other. A girl, Hazel Graze has lung cancer and a boy, Augustus Waters lost one leg with cancer. They met at a Cancer Support group and knew each other and their health problems. In the final part is so sad as the author of this movie ""John Green"" put Augustus Waters dead. Hazel Grace is my favorite character because she's strong and brave even she has lung cancer since she was young but she never given up. I really feel real to her. My favorite part of this book is when Augustus confessed his love to Hazel Grace, which I felt so happy for them. The sad scene is on the final part, Hazel Grace reads the letter that Augustus wrote for her after he died. This book made me cry so hard and it never keep me from turning the pages.

Wonderful performance and wanted to see more of her.As a realist and difficult to take 'theatrical' license, I'm wondering how Gus and Issac got to that church toward the end. Issac is blind and Gus is dying and in a wheel chair. How in the world did the get to and from the church??? Would have been more realistic if one of Gus' parents had been sitting in the back somewhere. Then you'd know how the two boys got there.

A female friend of Hazel is missed out, important signs of pain felt by Augustus is missed out, the author of Immperial affection is not the person which was described in book, hazel had to search for Augustus letter everywhere and finally she gets it via Author's assistant which was hand written as per the novel.

An incredibly dramatic masterpiece,"A terminally ill girl suffering from lung cancer meets a boy with a very difficult condition of his own who is about to change her life forever. A very close friendship is born between the two but it will not remain as such for long. As they spend more time together and understand each other's situation, their relation evolves, making the final part of their life more than bearable. As a final wish, he takes her to Amsterdam to visit the author of her favorite book but their adventure will not be without obstacles as illness never sleeps.It's a movie which follows the lives of two teens, deeply traumatized by their condition, who manage to find comfort in each other's arms, struggling every day not to lose faith. Their drama is presented in great detail, from the moment they first met, going all the way to Amsterdam in search of answers regarding their book. We're faced with two very complex characters, very well designed and described, not to say how they're excellently played by their respective actors, who transmit a plethora of emotions, making themselves extremely pleasant throughout the movie, despite their illness. You're bound to burst into tears many times throughout, as you'll find it extremely hard to see their struggle.The plot is very well designed, managing not to be predictable or linear, bringing something new and quite unexpected with every occasion it gets. The unique atmosphere it creates simply draws you into it, keeping you attracted, interested and curious about the faith of the two. It generates plenty of drama and thrill along the way, but also raises the mood and even makes you laugh once in a while. The end to their story is as unexpected as it is tragic and sentimental, but in a good way. I cannot express the emotions I felt during this movie, every single word simply being insufficient in providing any explanation.Overall, it is very dramatic but at the same time it brings laughter when you least expect it and romance in its purest way. This movie can cause a lot of tears but it will also bring warmth in one's soul if he or she lets it. It's simply breath taking in every aspect, from its gorgeous story to its presentation, cast and finale. Make sure you don't miss this wonderful masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

It all felt kind of manipulative and corny.,"For a film that begins with the remark ""this is the truth, sorry"", The Fault in Our Stars could up its honesty quotient. Slickly made and very nicely acted within the confines allowed by the script, Josh Boone's adaptation of John Green's young-adult blockbuster novel nonetheless can't help but sell candour (not to mention plausibility) down a tear-laden river in its tale of young love cut short by cancer.I was more or less going along with a narrative that sells its lack of sentimentality like a badge of honour - until a scene set at the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam of such startling insensitivity and phoniness that all the movie's faults suddenly come crashing down around it.To backtrack, this is the tale of Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley, making her bid for the big time), an indrawn 16-year-old with a conspicuous lack of friends who was diagnosed age 13 with cancer, since which time she wears plastic tubing to help her breathe and carries around a portable oxygen tank as a visual reminder of the baggage - both physiological and psychic - that her illness has brought with it. Wry, sardonic, and determined not to milk her ailment for easy bathos, Hazel finds her self-containment thrown amorously off-guard by the arrival in her life of Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), a dashing, witty 18-year-old who has lost part of one leg to cancer. Completing the adolescent triptych is Gus's great friend Isaac (the winning Nat Wolff, an alumnus of Boone's 2013 film Stuck in Love), who is going blind and spends most of the film sightless, his eyes hidden behind dark glasses.One instead waits in vain for any of the characters to be resentful or dangerously angry or even to indulge the self-pity that is theirs by right, and one includes in this parents who on this evidence constitute a supremely self-sacrificing lot, the excellent Laura Dern and Sam Trammell as Hazel's mum and dad chief among them. (The two are pictured above left.) A final meltdown from Gus notwithstanding, our central pair ultimately come across as ever-attractive, always-engaging poster children for forbearance. Where are the abrasions - the rough-and-tumble of the soul as well as the distress to the body - that arrive all too fully with illness? On this evidence, they remain tucked away behind preternatural poise until such time as there is a cue for tears. This movie can parade its ""truth"" as much as it likes, but I for one don't buy it.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""It's just a metaphor""","with being only half interested in watching the film but yet being dragged by my other-half, my expectation for the film was not at a high, i haven't read the book nor even picked it up yet the film seemed flawless in perfecting the beauty of flawed life. The movie is a roller coaster of emotion in its self that takes you on a journey of many feelings and emotion, knowing that cancer plays a role in who the characters are we are immediately set up for a doomed laps of events, this just helps draw us in as we can only wish for the best outcome like any other love story.To my understanding john green has created a perfect life within a limited time line or what is as close as perfect can get for these two lovers. something so thoughtful and emotion grabbing has been successfully portrayed on the big screen. the acting was exceptional, both play a convincing role with unmatched chemistry for one another, i give it 9/10 as it does nothing but draw you to the unbound love and affection of such a heartbreaking film, I'm not generally a crier but this almost got me there. the movie is brilliant yet not perfect as most movies aren't but remain exceptional, within moments of hazel and Gus meeting its easy to love how easily they fall in love.

Not the clichéd weepie you're expecting,"The Fault In Our Stars wants to make you cry. And it succeeds with a vengeance. It'll boost Kleenex sales for sure. near guaranteed to have everyone in the theatre sobbing, TFIOS is a devastating tear jerker of a movie. Grown men, you'll cry as well. A love story between 2 cancer patients played by Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort, this is based on a popular book which I haven't read but would now like to. I usually avoid this kind of thing since many romantic films (Endless Love I'm looking at you) are nothing more than 2 dimensional formula sheets which aren't even remotely touching, but TFIOS is a relatively rare exception. It's not a perfect movie and is admittedly supported by a somewhat clichéd framework. Ansel Elgort's character is a bit unrealistic and very occasionally they seem to be sugarcoating the story. Also, the first kiss happening in the Anne Frank museum seemed questionable. The film believes it's subverting romantic clichés even though in many ways it isn't and this is slightly off putting.Mostly, however, this is not your typical weepie. The film is surprisingly humorous and although the key emotional moments hit hard, there is a sense of hope and lightness to the story as well. The screenplay has clearly been written with skill, and the lovers at the centre of the story, both played excellently, have very strong chemistry throughout. The visuals and direction further enhance the film and although it does go into a truly heart-breaking third act, the journey there is one of hope and celebration, managing to find a balance of happier and sadder elements. This is likely the best love story of 2014, and its target audience will love it. It's not as smart as it thinks it is, but the effectiveness of its emotions and screenplay are unexpected and borderline gut wrenching. Deservedly a very successful film, this is a love story which can appeal to those who aren't a fan of this kind of thing. Just bring the tissues.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
a terrible subject for humanity,"an amazing presentation. a successful team. a terrible subject for humanity. a film filled with excellent cross scene. I hold myself to cry harder. I think everyone should watch. This one however, did. I could probably go on and write 20 pages on how good the chemistry between the actors is, or how well the movie was written and such. It should at least be nominated for the Oscars for best-screenplay and definitely an award for Shailene Woodley. I normally will reject plots that I can see coming but with this story it was journey of getting there that made it suffer- able. Two more quick points as this is one I would highly recommend for my friends that are softhearted enough to admit as guys we enjoy a good love story as much as the girls do (now and then).",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Absolute garbage,"Why anyone would care to see this 'play on emotion' junk movie, I have no idea. Full of obvious heart-string pulling scenes fit for 12 year old girls. I wouldn't suggest this garbage be watched by anyone(unless you are that 8-12 year old girl that find badly written scripts 'good'). You get more content from a Maury 'who's my baby daddy' episode. If you find yourself with nothing to do, avoid this movie! Even as a last resort! It would leave you empty inside from the hollow acting, all the way to the bad script and plot scenes. Should you have a daughter that wishes to see this, prevent that from happening at all costs. This will only succeed in diminishing their intellect and giving them a false sense of reality with life and relationships.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
An emotional ride that celebrates life,"""The Fault In Our Stars"" is an incredible ride of emotion from start to finish. It's a touching love story that really pulls on the heartstrings and manages to make prolific statements on life and what we as humans should do with such an amazing gift. That we are not bound by the life we are given and we can do whatever we want so as long as we don't let our circumstances bind us.I am really impressed by this films script and how thought provoking and heartfelt it is. The relationship and the genuine emotions are so well written that not for a second I don't believe what they are saying or feeling towards one another. I also enjoy how it doesn't take a strong sentimental or sappy approach on the subject matter, as these characters are really sick and it could have come off as trying way too hard or manipulative. The script instead focuses on celebrating life as apposed to the darker side of death.The director, Josh Boone, does a good job with handling everything that is going on and directs the cast well, as they are the strongest parts of the film. I really enjoy some of the stylistic approaches in the film, such as how they show the text messages. One small fault in his directing is that the film gets a bit conventional near the end and it manages to lose some of its magic. The soundtrack is well used and really drives the movie home. It's filled with upbeat and fun songs that really makes the film feel like a celebration of life.The cast is top class and they truly give some wonderful performances. Shailene Woodley gives a magical performance that conveys genuine happiness and heartbreaking sadness. She easily portrays so many emotions realistically and convincingly. Ansel Elgort plays Woodley's love interest and if not done by such a good actor, he could have come off as annoying and in your face. His character is a bit loud and egotistic, but he is a nice guy and really loves everyone, who he encounters. Woodley's and Elgort's on screen chemistry is incredibly good. I really bought their relationship and felt every pain that they felt. The actors are a true highlight of the film.Overall, ""The Fault In Our Stars"" is a really good movie that is a fresh of breath air in this summer blockbuster season filled with high octane action and ridiculous special effect. It's a emotional ride that does not force it's message or manipulates its audience. It is a genuine movie that shows a brighter side of life and death. While the film does get conventional in it's third act, it still ends on a high note. I give it an incredibly high 4/5",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Best Movie I Have Seen This year,"I read the book The Fault in Our Stars earlier this year and loved it. It has become my favorite book I have ever read. So, I had pretty high expectations going into this movie. This is a fantastic film Shailene Woodley is one of my favorite actresses and she does a terrific job playing Hazel. She has amazing chemistry with Ansel Elgort the scenes with the two of them are a lot of fun. The romance between the two of them was believable and never felt forced. Shailene does a great job with the emotional scenes and had me tearing up a few times. I truly believe she should be nominated come Oscar time. Ansel Elgort was also great as Augusts Waters I liked how much he cared for Hazel. The most difficult scene to watch took place at a gas station. He does an amazing job in that scene and I don't think it would have been the same with another actor. This is a very special film and one I hope a lot of people take the time to watch",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amazing,"This has got to be the first time I've ever given a movie 10/10, it was truly outstanding. I am a huge fan of the book, and for such a long time that my copy is first edition. It's also my favourite book of all time. And I'm going to say something about this film that I rarely say about book-to-screen adaptations. This film really done the book justice. Ansel Elgort was perfect as Augustus, and Shailene Woodley was perfect as Hazel. They kept all the best parts in the book, and while they could've, they didn't reduce it to some rubbish chick-flick. The beauty and the integrity of the book was there in the film and any fan of the book will be pleased with this film. I strongly recommend it whether you read the book or not.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fault in Our Stars Review,"The Fault in Our Stars is a story about young life, love, and living while you can. Based on the 2012 novel written by John Greene, this film tells the story of Hazel Grace and Gus, two teenagers living with different kinds of cancer. Hazel, the more pessimistic of the two, knows she has limited time left and chooses to let the clock tick without making something happen. The story begins with Hazel meeting the charismatic Gus at a stereotypical support group. Gus immediately chases after her affections and what follows is a beautiful story of what life is like for the not-so-typical American teenager falling into the arms of young love.Leading this small but powerful cast is the phenomenal Shailene Woodley, in the role of Hazel Grace. Woodley practically carries the film on her shoulders being the entire focus of the film, and she does an incredible job of it. The emotional ups and downs her character endures over the course of the story were hard ones to keep up with, and hard ones for a 16 year-old boy to relate to, but I was immediately taken by the power of her character and the realities she faced, and the realities actress Shailene Woodley portrayed so well. In my opinion, Woodley's performance is by far the best seen in a 2014 film so far, and will be hard to top. Starring opposite Woodley is Ansel Elgort, playing the bold and practical Gus. Elgort's performance honestly put me off a bit. The character he developed was great, however it did not match the screenplay he was given beforehand, which made the character of Gus difficult to relate to. This was minor, however, and in no way took away from the whole of the film. Also starring are Laura Dern and Sam Tremmel doing an excellent job as Hazel's parents, Natt Wolf as Gus' best friend, who's purpose was honestly difficult to understand, and Willem Dafoe as Hazel's temporary idol Van Houten. Josh Boone took the director's chair for this picture, whose screenplay was provided from Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber adapting the novel of John Greene. Neustadter and Weber did an excellent job with their adaptation, keeping necessary story plots, eliminating portions that would fit well for a book but would struggle on the screen, while holding dearly on to the abstract and poetic words of author John Greene. Director John Boone's work was hardly noticeable in this film, which is always debatable whether or not that is a good quality. Here, I believe it was. What Boone did allowed the viewer to step into Hazel's small world. A small world filled with countless infinities. There were no extraordinary shots, camera angles, or certain scenes that left watchers breathless; instead, we were there with her. Sitting on her bed waiting for those special texts filled with so much more than a three word message, climbing stairs that felt like both an impossible mountain and the finish line of a marathon, and seeing everyone you care about so much love you more than you can imagine. The work done by these filmmakers did not take us anywhere special, but they allowed us to see life here on earth at its fullest: valuing the people you're with above anything else, whether it's in the form of romance or friendship and especially family at its very best. The Fault in Our Stars is not a movie about cancer. It is a movie about love in all of its truest forms. So as I sat in the theater watching the credits roll with other viewers walking past me wiping their eyes, I smiled. And that's exactly what a movie should do. I give The Fault in Our Stars an 8.6/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wow.,"I saw this film late one Thursday night and I was blown away by the storytelling of the film. Not only was it captivating it was also immensely emotional. There were a few faults with it, but not enough to warrant it even close to being bad. The characters of Hazel and Augustus had such great chemistry that it didn't even feel as though you were in the cinema. It felt as if you were watching the life of someone else. My only problem with this film was it didn't quite flow as well as it could have. It jumped from scene to scene and the transition scenes were rough. But that might have been the intention. That was the only fault that I was able to find with it. The story was great and it followed the book more of less (other than rough scene jumps) and it had me crying even after the movie was over and done with. All in all it is definitely a movie to be seen by all ages and by both men and women.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
You will need Kleenexes for this movie.,"I knew this movie would be good, no not good - amazing, breathtaking, astonishing, heartbreaking, special, or just something in between that. Reading the book, I found myself non-able to stop. So I had very big expectation for this movie, and God help me I was positively surprised.Not only had they chosen actors who fit very well with their characters, but they played amazingly with each other. Nothing felt awkward or not right. Shailene Woodley (though I had my doubts) was the perfect Hazel Grace. She knew how she should react, how she felt, how her whole world was supposed to be. It was a pleasure watching her play that role.I actually thought that I would start crying as soon as the movie started, as soon as the worlds ""The Fault In Our Stars"" would appear on the screen, but I didn't. The beginning was as lovely as the book's beginning. Everything was down to earth and you started to get an idea of what it was like to be Hazel Grace, what you go through when you have cancer and what your priorities are. It is not easy, especially when you're as sick as she is.But she soon figures out that there is more in life than just cancer, and that thing is Augustus Waters. And their time together is absolutely heartbreaking, but true. I have to say that the journey they have, is why you need kleenexes. It is nothing but real, true and sad, but the thing is, sometimes you need that. You need something that might not have a Hollywood ending, and if you seek that, then this is the movie for you. But please, I was very grateful for my Kleenex, you should have some near you - just in case.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
irritating and preachy,"This movie was full of messages from the writer or director that were offensive...they don't entertain today rather, they usually have to give the proles messages on how to think and live...here is a sampling:When selling a swing-set the girl has to add the word pedophilic to its description which the guy had listed as merely lonely..why would it need to be connected to pedophilia??..oh I get it.. nowadays pedophiles are funny and cute...who would think of a swing set as pedophilic? Yet this was coming from the female lead so I guess she's right!!! 😱 sarcasm..The Christian guy leading the support group is made out to be an idiot even kissing an image of Jesus on a large rug he is rolling out...they make light of his testicular cancer and portray him as a pathetic dweeb..the only sick character they make fun of...yet they then egg the car of the ex gf...beautiful blonde of course... of the Jewish kid because she dumps him because she can't handle his illness of eye cancer..so she gets judged for her rejection of him..which was her right..yet they show no tolerance for the Christian and his illness and even make him out as an idiot for his beliefs... when the girl's mom comes out of the house they warn her to go back in because her daughter committed a grave injustice...so these self righteous little thugs egg her daughters car more while she sheepishly goes back in..admonished by these monsters..lesson here...we can be intolerant of you if you're a Christian, but if you dump the Jewish kid for going blind, we get to vandalize your car and threaten your mom and its all OK because we judge her as intolerant in a way we disapprove of..The lead guy tells her she could write a story even better than a celebrated author by adding blood, guts and ritual sacrifice...that makes it better??? Haha...oh we get it ..we're supposed to laugh!!...ritual sacrifice another funny topic...hahaAfter this, it seemed like karma that the guy, who instigated all this, was dying in an especially miserable way...I was thinking..see, Mr self righteous..show intolerance and you suffer!...but I think the director missed this irony...The last message ran throughout and was nihilistic on the extreme constant assertions that there's nothing after this life because their miserable disease wouldn't be allowed by a caring God, and yet also preaching about how beautiful their love was..hint..show it, Mr director don't preach it...anyway if it was just a 1 year blip in a dying works where everything just ceases to exist..then how meaningful was it anyway??Two hours misspent but yet enlightening in that I saw first hand the propaganda Hollywood is pushing on young people...sad..but lapped up like milk by the young kids watching...add they said...amaaaazing!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best Movie of All Time,"I am a fourteen year old girl, so my opinion may not matter to many people looking for a true review. However, I do believe that out of many of my friends and classmates, I am able to write an honest review without my teenage personality getting in the way. With that said, I recommend, if you are looking for a legitimate review before you watch this movie or spend money and time watching it, to read this review. I will not include any spoilers because I hate when that happens to me as well. I read the book about three months before this movie came out. It was before they released the trailer for it too. I simply read it for a class project and not just for the upcoming movie. To be completely honest, this was the first book I read that has a movie that goes along with it. When starting the book, I did not expect to love it as much as I did. To put things in perspective, I have read it five times and highlighted and annotated the whole thing. But that's the book, not the movie. My point is, I really think that you should read the book before watching the movie. If you haven't, please do because you will appreciate the movie so much more. I went to the movie in theaters the day it came out with friends. I did not buy the tickets online because I truly didn't expect it to be really crowded since they had so many times that night. However, the line was unbelievably long to just get into the theater! And no, it was not just teenagers. I love that. I loved how this book/movie did not just target teenagers like critics and people may say. There was so many ages there! Old, young, college, 30s; every age. I also probably saw at least 15 people I knew from my school alone. The reason I tell you this is that this book/movie is for everyone! Now to the movie: it was incredible. I won't spoil anything like I said earlier. the acting was fantastic. I felt everything the characters felt. It had every single person in the packed theater laughing every 30 seconds and then crying their eyes out every other 30 seconds. It was a roller coaster of wonderful emotions. It went EXACTLY with the book (with minor changes that didn't change the plot or storyline so it didn't annoy me at all, I actually liked the small changes a lot). It took so many direct quotes from the book and it made it feel like this genius book that I love came to life! Another thing I loved is how the actors/actresses they chose matched how I invisioned each character in my head! Like I said before, I read this book before any news was said about the movie. I especially liked Ansel Elgort (Gus) because he was the perfect Gus in my mind. At first I was skeptical with him, but once he made his first appearance in the movie, I knew he was absolutely perfect. What made me so happy as well, was the setting of each scene. I feel like every scene that they were somewhere different, was just beautiful. The sky was never gloomy, the places were lively, and just overall gorgeous. Not every movie always has that and it really added to the feel. I cried so much from beginning to end that my mascara ran down my face. Luckily, I went home right after. It was actually embarrassing at some points because I wasn't sobbing, I was full on crying. My mouth was quivering and I was breathing heavy and my nose was running. This movie has to be one of the best, if not THE BEST, movie I have ever seen. I am definitely going to see it again in theaters and buy the DVD when it comes out. Absolutely beautiful. I am quite sad now that it's over but, the world is not a wish-granting factory so I guess I'll have to live with it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Summer Love Story Unlike Most,"Never have I seen a movie so heart wrenching as this one. The Fault In Our Stars is an exceptional movie that will have you crying, laughing and anxious all at the same time. It is based on the amazing novel written by John Green. In this movie, Shailene Woodley plays Hazel Grace, a girl diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. Ansel Elgort plays Gus Waters who is diagnosed with cancer as well. They fell in love with each other the way we fall asleep, slowly and then all at once. Their journey goes from meeting their favorite author in Amsterdam to rushing to the hospital for immediate chemotherapy. This movie shows the hardships of being in love and fighting for your life in such a beautiful but realistic manner. I absolutely love this film.There are so many great aspects about this movie that it's hard to highlight a few. However, one of my favorite things is the whole plot and its meaning. It creatively captures a teenager's perspective of love but also of dealing with cancer. It reaches out to a younger audience but still allows an older audience to enjoy it. John Green knows how to grab the audience's attention by intertwining the two most heart- wrenching aspects of life - love and death. Another thing I really love about the movie is how well it depicts the book it is based on. I read the book a few months ago and I loved how the director put in just enough of the details to keep its authenticity. I didn't feel like there was anything missing. Overall, this movie is extremely great and I want everyone to enjoy it as I did.My favorite character is Hazel Grace Lancaster. Hazel is witty and smart but also strong and understands things. She teaches Gus a lot about books and how not to be afraid of oblivion. Hazel knows she's going to die but she accepts that and she wants her parents to accept that too. I think a lot of teens going through love or even pain can relate to Hazel Grace.My favorite scene is when Hazel, Gus and Isaac go to Isaac's ex- girlfriend's house. Isaac's ex-girlfriend, Monica, dumped Isaac because he was going to have eye surgery which would leave him blind. Right before the surgery, Monica dumped Isaac and never even asked if he was okay. Hazel, Gus and Isaac want revenge so they go to egg her house. This part is so funny because Isaac is blind and he can't see where he's throwing the eggs. This struck me as so funny because he's throwing the eggs in the bushes and at the trees but Hazel and Gus try to keep his spirit up by giving him encouragement. It is just a funny scene. I recommend this movie for ages 12 to 18 because it is a lot to comprehend and some of the information about death may be too much for young children. I am 14 and have never cried so much in two hours. This is an amazing movie and I give it 5 out of 5 stars. This is a great movie for teens to go out and watch with friends. It comes out this weekend so make sure you get to watch this movie, you won't regret it!Reviewed by Jailene A., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Truly Amazing. No Fault Here.,"I read The Fault in Our Stars about 2 years ago and had not revisited the book before seeing the movie. I remember the majority of the novel and was pleasantly surprised to see that the movie stayed fairly true to the book.This movie brings out every emotion. I cried (A LOT), laughed out loud, and got chills on many occasions during this movie. I think that everyone that read the book will probably cry a little bit more because you have read the book and know what to expect and what is going to happen next.The actors played their roles amazingly. The personalities of both Hazel and Gus were brought out perfectly through every scene. Not one scene seemed forced or awkward. The scenes connected smoothly and made this movie seem like real life. I felt as though I were watching the life of Hazel Grace unfold as if it were a true story.Everything was perfect about this movie. Definitely the best movie I have seen this year! The emotions and wonderful quotes from John Green's book were all there. I couldn't have asked for a better adaptation from the novel. What a beautifully made movie. I want to see it again right now! And you all should see it too. 10 out of 10!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great movie I mean great,"I saw this in the Philippines where every seat was taken and people even sat on the floor and at the back they were standing. I sat in the front row as I often do for quiet but every seat filled there too. Somehow the locals knew it was good even second day of release. I was told the book was very popular there. In fact people were calling out the names of characters as they made their first appearance. The ingenuous response of the Filipino audience was almost as touching as the movie itself. I am a bloke and even before I felt sad, tears were streaming. I have never experienced that before. Weeping before the sad bits came. I can't account for it. And I usually don't cry being a man and all. If you don't cry during this you would have to be a sociopath. It is beautifully put together. What a movie. It is corny of course but sophisticated heartfelt corn and not actually overdone. The acting has been acknowledged as great and yes the female lead was excellent. But I was most impressed with the male lead Ansel Elgort. This guy for me stole the whole movie with his performance. He was magnificent especially since he was only19 when he did this movie. All the acting and photography was excellent. William Dafoe also did a great job as you would expect. I thought Hazel Grace's mother was performed exceptionally well. As I came out of the show holding back the tears there was a long line of people waiting for the next session.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A poignant character study,"Now the top grossing film in the U.S., The Fault in Our Stars, Josh Boone's drama of cancer-stricken teenagers can be overtly manipulative and traverses a thin line between honest sentiment and maudlin sentimentality, yet it succeeds where others have failed because of the authentic emotion generated by its lead actors, Shailene Woodley (The Descendants, The Spectacular Now) and newcomer Ansel Elgort, who display a rare chemistry together. Based on the best-selling novel by John Green and adapted for the screen by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, on the surface the film is about cancer but is, in reality, more a poignant character study of the thoughts, feelings, and connections that teenagers make with each other and the world.Told from her point of view, 17-year-old Hazel Grace Lancaster has had thyroid cancer since she was thirteen. Because her lungs are prone to filling with fluid and interfere with her ability to breathe, she has to carry an oxygen tank with her at all times. Hazel is mature for her age and, in Woodley's remarkably expressive performance, conveys a nuanced emotional range running from a resigned cynicism to a witty commentator on life but always with an innocence and intelligence. In a voice-over that begins the film, Hazel tells us that ""this isn't just a movie, it is the truth, sorry.""It is a bold claim that, in spite of the filmmaker's sincere attempt, does not always live up to its promise and there are as many false notes and genre clichés as there are moments of lived-in reality. Concerned about their daughter's depression, Hazel's mom Frannie (Laura Dern) and dad Michael (Sam Trammell) encourage her to go to a cancer support group at the local church. When her mother tells her that she knows that depression is a side effect of cancer, Hazel jumps in and says her ""depression is not a side effect of cancer. It's a side effect of dying."" This oh, so clever remark might seem pretentiously literary coming from someone else, but when Woodley says it, it feels just right.Hazel reluctantly attends the support group and shares her observations with other cancer survivors but one in particular catches her attention, a tall, good-looking boy of eighteen named Augustus (Elgort), whose battle with cancer has left him with a prosthetic leg. Gus radiates charm and sincerity and tells the group that he is there only to support his friend Isaac (Nat Wolff) who is in danger of losing both eyes to cancer. Both Hazel (he calls her Hazel Grace) and Gus relate to each other in a thoughtful way and even the most potentially awkward dialogue comes across as natural. When he tells her that she is beautiful and later when he looks in her eyes and tells her how much he loves her, it sounds deeply felt and authentic.The two talk about their favorite books and what their life is about and the imminent spectre they face of an early death. He tells her that he plans for his life to have a meaning that will remembered through the ages to which she reminds him that there will come a time when none of us on the planet will be remembered. Hazel says that her favorite book is An Imperial Affliction, a novel about a young person with cancer which he agrees to read but is dismayed by the fact that the book ends in mid-sentence. They send each other text messages, and their affection for each other grows exponentially until Hazel decides they should be ""just friends.""She tells Gus that she is keeping her distance because she is ""a grenade likely to explode and wants to minimize the casualties,"" but Gus has fallen in love with her and is not about to let go, whatever the consequences. He invites her to go to Amsterdam with her to meet the author of the book, Peter van Houten (Willem DaFoe), to ask him what happens to the other characters after his book ends. Their trip to Amsterdam to meet van Houten, however, though beautifully photographed by cinematographer Ben Richardson, turns into a near disaster, though it ultimately serves to bring them closer together.Unfortunately, the entire middle episode feels leaden, highly improbable, and incongruous with the tone of the rest of the film. Hazel and Gus' subsequent visit to Anne Frank's house, while well done, also does not ring true. If the ending is predictable, the tears it evokes are earned because we care deeply about the characters we have come to know and identify with. Author Washington Irving observed that ""There is sacredness in tears. They are not the mark of weakness, but of power. They speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues."" If that assessment is valid, then The Fault in Our Stars, for all its flaws, is the most eloquent film of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Perfection,"There are film adaptations that don't even scratch the surface of the original book; there are film adaptations that blow the book so out of proportion that it isn't even about the book any more; and then there's ""The Fault in Our Stars.""Having read the book prior to watching the film, I had very high expectations. Simply put, this film adaptation nails it. The screenplay doesn't copy the book word for word, but it doesn't need to. The plot, casting, setting and props are nailed to a T. And of course, as with any film adaptation, the screenplay has its own quirks but it fits so perfectly that even the most OCD of book-readers wouldn't twitch an eye over them.If you've read the book, you will definitely approve of this movie.

It's a metaphor, see: You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don't give it the power to do its killing. A metaphor."" That's fine, but the sight of Augustus with the cigarette in his mouth looks as ridiculous as it sounds. He puts the unlit cigarette in his mouth so often that we want to take his away from him and say ""STOP THAT!!"" The movie is loaded with strange moments like that. "" - Bad camera angles, scripting and jarring pace. Normal scenes are given heavy emphasis and over-emphasised. Nothing feels natural, the chemistry seems forced. Camera angles that linger between the two main actors for what seems achingly ages for what seems hours... I had to look away from the screen they were given so much dead focusOverall 0/10. This just takes the cake. Seriously worst movie i've ever seen and it's made me write up this darn review. If you want quality acting, from real actors and real directors, with real sweet charm, heart, good pacing and film editing, watch Silver Linings Playbook starring Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. An infinite times more believable and lovable than this.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Take your girlfriend guys,This Movie is a Really Good Movie that is sad and Romantic.

Okay? Okay.,"Known as a heart wrenching film, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is a best-selling novel and film that is meant to put a lump in your throat. The young adult romantic drama is a tale of two cancer affected teens, Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace Lancaster. Together they battle their sickness and come as one to show what true love really is. The two lovers make the time they have together feel like an eternity. However, it's cut short as they both find out they are slowing dying. Hazel never knew she would end up with a man like Augustus but it was arguably the best thing that ever happened to her. The line, ""The world is not a wish factory"" brings a lot of meaning to this film because both characters continue to suffer, but never wish nothing else but to be together. Many great things make up this amazing film: character relations, scene, and the tone. Both characters connect with their role and make the audience feel something which is important when portraying someone other than you. The scene and dynamic of where it was filmed was absolutely exquisite. The different settings flowed together wonderfully as they go from their hometown Indianapolis to Amsterdam to seek Hazels wish. The tone used was eye opening and uplifting. Overall, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" was an incredible film and I recommend it to everyone. I give this film an A+.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Groundbreaking Study of the Experience of Cancer,"FAULT IN OUR STARS is a quite remarkable film, if only for the stunning performances of Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort in the leading roles as two teenagers suffering from terminal cancer. There might have been a temptation to sentimentalize this story in the manner of LOVE STORY (1972), but director Josh Boone manages to create instead a story of remarkable poignancy while remaining aware of just how destructive the awareness that one has cancer can be.It's often difficult to explain to non-sufferers the effects of cancer, not only physically but emotionally. Despite the well- meaning intentions of her parents (Laura Dern, Sam Trammell), Hazel (Woodley) cannot really communicate her true feelings to them. She is not simply an ""Ugly Duckling"" whose illness renders her somehow 'different' from her classmates; she is a living, breathing person who wants to be regarded just like anyone else. The fact that she has an illness is irrelevant; in the limited time she has available, she wants to live life to the full. This is precisely what Gus (Elgort) and fellow cancer-sufferer Isaac (Nat Wolff) understand, and hence the three of them become almost inseparable. When Hazel and Gus are together, they not only gain strength from one another but learn how to treat the world on their own terms, and not necessarily listen to their parents. Boone's handling of these sequences is quite brilliant, especially the sequence where the two teenagers hug and kiss in bed.In the end, however, the realities of cancer leads to a sad ending; but is it really 'sad'? According to a non-cancer suffer, it might be considered as such, but to Hazel it represents something else, something intangible. She might experience severe emotional distress, but that experience gives her a renewed faith in life. Cancer requires people to rethink their lives and try to approach each day in different ways, to reconstruct themselves and to become more mindful of the world around them. This is what Hazel manages to do, which is why we feel so supportive of her.FAULT IN OUR STARS is perhaps the first movie I have seen to approach the experience of cancer in a way that non-cancer suffers might understand. It is a groundbreaking piece; if it could be shown to anyone and everyone who has encountered the disease, it might change their lives for the better.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Emotional and Different,"To tell you the truth, it was an OKAY movie.Hmm...What can I say? Teenage girls are important. They made this,this very good movie with great advertising and from an important and wonderful writer with famous books and served by new breakout stars such as Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort and Nat Wolff.( That was a pretty long sentence, I know.) I will point out that I never recommended it,though, sadly.It was a very sad, truthful,like a kid just knew Santa wasn't real type of movie. It really told the truth. And I'd repeat the sentence. Because it is good, at least feels good to watch a movie. Especially for me. (Total stranger. Who the heck cares?) But honestly, not every life turns out that way. I guess the book was very emotional. And I'm guessing that people BEGGED people to make it a movie. And to tell you the truth since that's what I've been doing all along, is that I don't think ANYONE should hate it or regret watching it. Although I honestly don''t think it'll leave a mark in the world. It could be some teen girl's favorite,for a while,but not forever.The truth does hurt but it won't be there forever.I cried through some parts of it and some parts I was so sad that I couldn't cry. No tears or water filled up my eyes. And I'm sure most of it was because of the spoilers on YouTube or Facebook or your friends or even the ORIGINAL BOOK that ruined the important part(s) of the movie.The movie got a fair rating. And if it wasn't for the book, actors or advertising, it wouldn't be a great movie. It'd be good, but not great.I've run out of words. Watch it yourself. You don't need my opinion or anybody's in fact. You're a different person and you'll decide what you like even though it might be a little extraordinary. Don't think if other people liked it or your friends liked it that you might too.Thanks, I appreciate your time to check out my review.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Impressed!,"I am not a fan of romantic movies, but some of them just happen to seep through because of the great writing and wonderful performances by the cast and this was one of them, i was thoroughly impressed. went in expecting a very predictable and cliche boy meets girl, they fall in love, they have some big fight, break up...only to get back together and happy ever after like over 75% of the flicks in this genre but this was oddly fulfilling. i definitely would give this a second viewing, wonderful.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sweet tearjerker that rivals The Notebook,"Beautiful film with exceptional acting by the entire cast. Shailene Woodley should expect an Oscar nod for her performance. I was prepared to have tissues ready for this film, but I did not expect to need them throughout the entire movie. The plot, while some feel that it's already overdone, was fabulous, telling the story of cancer through the eyes of teenagers who had never really had a relationship. If you were not moved by this movie, something is seriously wrong with your moral character. It moved well over the topics of death, religion, point of view from the parents and friends and had a lot of symbolism of how it may be like to know you're terminally ill but never know when life will be over. Best money I have spent in a theater for myself and my daughters since Divergent.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Very Little Fault in These Stars!!!,"A couple of months back I read the Young Adult Novel ""The Fault in our Stars"" by John Green, in anticipation of the movie. It is the story of Hazel, a teenager living with cancer. At the start of the story, the cancer is seemingly terminal, but she has survived for the time being. Her mother makes her go to a support group in the basement of a Church - To get out there, live life, make friends, etc. In this support group, she meets Agustus, also a teenage cancer patient, in remission, who has an amputated leg due to his illness. The two fall in love, and I will stop there.If you have not read the book or seen the movie, your mind can imagine where the story goes. I won't spoil it. For those who have read it – It is a good adaption of the book.The First Half of the movie while not bad, is not perfect at times – the Second Half Shines! Shailene Woodley, has some very strong individual scenes as Hazel. She is one of the most popular younger actresses out there (lead of the ""Divirgent Franchise) and it shows why in those scenes. She is bubbly when she needs to be, and can turn serious when it's time. I think she hasn't even become the best she can be yet. Ansle Elgort's Agustus is as likable and charming as you want him to be. Laura Dern is very effective as Hazel's mother, and in his brief turn – William Dafoe is effective as Van Houten - The author of ""An Imperial Infliction"" - a book that ended with some unanswered questions, which Hazel and Agustus desire to get, prompting a desired trip to Amsterdam to meet him.I know it is cliché - Suffice it to stay – If you have a heart, you will not helped but be moved – And you don't have to have read the book. 3 ½ out of 4 Stars!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not Impressed,"I used to be a regular visitor of this site because I would check the ratings to decide whether or not I would watch a movie I don't care to see. This movie is rated well above what it deserves.It started off nice. I thought it was going to tell a realistic love story. Instead, it gave what it said it wasn't, a fairy tale and a cheesy one at that.Once you get over the fact that they both have cancer, it really isn't a good movie. It seems like the fact that they are sick is the only thing carrying this movie.Some scenes were really unnecessary, rushed, drawn out and well...boring.As the movie went on, I couldn't take it anymore. So, as the lady was trying to help the girl up the ladder, I stopped it and returned it. There wasn't any love chemistry between the two main characters. It's more like they liked each other because of the fact that they are both dying. The chemistry is so forced that it couldn't fool a Disney princess.I love romance movies but this was a miss.

This film will make you cry it's sooo sad but it reminds you how harsh life is for some people and it shows you that cancer sucks and it ruins and wrecks life's. The ending was so unexpected, I really didn't expect it, I felt so sorry for them. When they both cried it really did make me feel so sad. The fact that Hazel grace knows that one day she is going to die makes you want to cry. It really shows you what cancer does to teenagers, they both know eventually they will die and they both know that one will die before the other and that will break one of there hearts.

"Taken Over #1 from ""The Shawshank Redemption""","Prior to seeing this movie (today), the movie that ranked number one for me was ""The Shawshank Redemption.""

This film is powerful and, perhaps most importantly, real!How do I know? My only sibling (my older sister) passed away from cancer 23 years ago at the age of 40, and I recall from then much of what I saw in this fantastic film today.

"The Fault in Our Stars in a cute love-sick story that's funny, sad, and satisfying a cure for a good romance.","Nobody likes getting sick. It's unpleasant, it changes our daily routine, and we're brought down to a level in which our souls have been weakened by the disease, making us feel bad about ourselves and giving us an everlasting fear that sickness can strike at any moment. No matter how healthy we try to live, we aren't invincible and we could drop dead at any moment from something that scientists have yet to discover. That's what's troubling about the universe; the air and land we breath has so much we don't understand that were still young at fighting.One such disease is cancer. This has been around forever and people to this stay still get sudden announcements from their doctor that they too have become one of millions of people with a disease they have yet to find a cure. Technology has gotten better, but most cancer victims are stuck to taking chemotherapy as a treatment, but it's no guarantee. I think that people with cancer or any other kind of sickness wants the world to know that they are regular people like us with interests, family and love. Two teenagers reveal their love-sick story in the adaption of the critically acclaimed novel, The Fault in Our Stars.Hazel-Grace Lancaster (played by Shailene Woodley) is a sixteen-year-old cancer patient who has had this curse ever since she was a little girl. She has gone through many treatments and has had a couple of encounters with death. Fate has kept her alive as she struggles to live a normal teenage life. At the insistence of her parents, she attends a support group for teenagers like herself, yet doesn't find much that interests her. This changes when she gets stares from a new addition to the group, Augustus Waters (played by Ansel Elgort)He has a rebellious spirit that many of the other cancer stricken teenagers lack that intrigues Hazel, yet she writes off his affections and ask that their relationship only remain friendly. As the weeks pile on, their texting sessions become longer and the two get to know each other, including Hazel's dream of meeting her favorite author, Peter Van Houten (played by William Dafoe). Augustus uses his wish from Make-A-Wish to take her and her mother to Amsterdam, where romance finally draws the two to each other. The trip goes well and they continue to prosper their relationship, until one of them hits further complications (I won't be the one to say who).The Fault in Our Stars could have gone a million ways wrong from adding a dumb misunderstanding to having them instantly fall for each other right on the spot. Love stories are like horror films as few of them are any good, but this one is a very good love story. Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort have some excellent chemistry that makes them look very precious together. It's a real relationship where they're seen talking to each other about this stuff and how far is too far for this kind of love.It's a rare mix of funny and sad. Just how sad is The Fault in Our Stars. It never reaches a point of phony smultz, but rather heartbreaking facts of life that our characters have no choice but to face them. I'll say that I enjoyed 50/50 a little better then The Fault in Our Stars as it is missing something that was needed; more scenes with Augustus on his own. We get a lot of scenes of Hazel watching TV or reading, but I never got more out of Augustus then that he used to play basketball and he's a rebellious amputee. The best way to describe the movie is something that I also used with Her had last year, cute. It's a cute story that I sure plenty of people are going to bring tissues with before they watch.I'll give this eight and a half cityscapes of Amsterdam out of five, as both characters would have loved this. The Fault in Our Stars is a nice love story that the books fans are gonna love and will become as much of a valentines staple as 500 Days of Summer and Love Story has become.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Even the font of the title. Even the title. OK OK i'm going bananas but in essence here it is:I was expecting to see a teenage movie with a bit more sorrow due to the circumstances however i saw a touching,funny and beautiful love tale told from two very convincing actors that got my eyes in tears more than once.I simply loved it.

Best love story of this generation,"In what some may call the tear-jerking film of the summer based off of the best selling novel The Fault In Our Stars, Hazel Grace (Shailene Woodley) and Augustus (Ansel Elgort) take us along side them as they endure their emotional and heartbreaking journey. Hazel, who's history of cancer has left her lungs weak, now supports a new fashion accessory of an oxygen tank; much like Augustus's, prosthetic leg he was given from his cancer. When the two young and naive cancer patients meet at their weekly support groups, Augustus instantaneously falls in love with the sarcastic and smart ass character played by Woodley. The writers do an amazing job of making the audience connect with the movies in more ways than one.This unconventional love story portrayed by these two characters is one that is unfamiliar to this genre of movies. Completely original and dramatically unlike any other love story, it leaves you fighting back tears one moment while suffering from a gut-wrenching laugh in the next; all the while feeling the same pain that the characters on the screen display. When Hazel suffers from taking on a flight of stairs, you see the pain and struggle within her, while seeing the love Augustus has for her as he stands by her side. It is truly interactive in the sense that these actors have done such an extraordinary job in making the audience experience the aura and ambiance this film gives off.The actors behind the screen play a huge role in why you may find yourself relating the story to your own life as well. Perhaps the circumstances are not as severe; but the principal of being able to fight for yourself and the ones you love is not a foreign idea. The way Woodley plays Hazel so naturally and effortlessly in the film, makes her engaging. Us as an audience automatically are overcome with empathy and sympathy. Elgort plays the approachable and charismatic Augustus and he undoubtedly does the character justice. He draws you in with his clever wittiness and his ironic comments, such as, "" Hazel Grace, it'd be a privileged to have my heart broken by you"", while maintaining the image of prince charming. What girl wouldn't want to hear that, right?The script that was made for this movie is one that cannot be matched. Some may be hesitant on seeing the movie because they may have fallen in love the book so much, but surprisingly it pulls the lively and alluring chapters directly off the page and on to the big screen. To be able to match the tone and atmosphere of a novel in its follow up film is something remarkable and very hard to accomplish. The amount of voice and detail that was put into the script is something that should not go unnoticed.I applaud the writes, actors, editors and directors of this film because it was truly one to remember. They allowed us to step inside the movie along with them and fully connect with every scene. It truly is an eye opener and makes the audience wonder about many things. As Augustus says, ""You don't get to say if you get hurt in this worldbut you do have some say in who hurts you.""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I really can't see how this is 8+,"I'm giving this a 3 because I gave Boyhood a 2 and I think this movie deserves slightly better.I gave Boyhood a 2 because I come from China and I know what ""abysmal"" means and I wanted to separate Boyhood from those films that actually deserved absolute trash.But that's it. That's the only reason this film is getting the extra 2 points from me.Honestly I'm losing faith in IMDb and rotten tomatoes and all critics and the general audience. How do people give such high scores for such pretentious and empty films?I'm NOT one of the people who think that visually pleasing films are the best. However, I think people who would back any ""indie"" film and attack the ones disagreeing as shallow and ignorant are equally annoying. I don't think there's any superiority in genre. And concluding ""you must be one of those that love Transformers"" is a pretty weak arguing point.Anyway, rants aside, I think this movie is extremely childish and unrealistic. The story kinda parallels Twilight and 50 Shades, only it made the fantasy ride on a tragedy to seem more deep and mature. It really makes me wonder how much the authors of these books experienced in life to have came up such unrealistic crap.Terminal cancer patients don't behave or look like this. Oh gosh this is so disturbing to me... Couldn't they have picked somebody else for the actors? Cancer patients don't look this healthy. Gus was one that needed to lose a limb, but still had that healthy skin and beefy body, huh? Even the CGI for the prosthesis was so fake. I guess his shin was just too bulky to make it look like it was just a stick underneath the pants.Haley's character was really unlikable. The girl had more negativity and aloofness than Bella from Twilight, plus she liked to get all deep and talk about some philosophy that the pretentious teenagers love. I was totally wondering where Gus got all that stuff he talked about in his final love letter. How did you see this girl as all those good qualities anyway? I had minimal impression of her being smart or caring.Gus was unreal. The philosophy was incredibly naive and pretentious. His way of dealing with things were childish. The way people responded weren't much real either. I mean, you give THAT speech at a middle aged lady and she LETS you throw eggs at her car and house? And all that applauding when they kissed? I'm surprised they even let Haley continue climbing. And yeah, a virgin that's about to die has that much confidence in landing girls who don't even want to talk, huh? Also, even putting the character aside, the actor had very bad acting skills for a lead.This movie makes no sense. Was it written by a 15 year old? I can forgive someone that age for thinking this is good philosophy and realistic love and a good story.Oh wait the movie wasn't all naive and pretentious. The writer was a character with some dimensions, and the writer had a good point. But they made the writer such an asshole that it was impossible to redeem him or explain his reason in the end.In all, just a very naive and unrealistic movie with pretentious philosophies and childish fantasies.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Did justice to the wonderful book by John Green.,"No movie genre makes me cry more than a movie about cancer. A Walk To Remember, My Sisters Keeper, Now is Good are a few films that destroyed me emotionally but i adore them. The book by John Green is great read and this film serves the book justice if not more so. I felt a lot more closure at the end of this film than i did reading the book. Now Is Good is so similar to this film but both stand on their own as individual films about the destruction of cancer. I think Fault In Our Stars is actually better than Now Is Good but i'd say that has a lot to do with John Green. Amazing amazing film! Broke my heart but a good movie should be able to do so. Ansel Elgort is just beautiful and so believable as the character of Gus. Shailene Woodely does a great job as Hazel too, the casting was spot on. Highly recommend this film!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

In love With This Small Infinity,"Being that i very much enjoyed the book when I read it about two years a go, I was very nervous for the cast to be released. When it was, I felt that the casting choice for Hazel was appropriate. I had seen other performances by Shaliene Woodly and had admired her before her casting, however, I had never heard of Ansel Elgort and questioned his casting for the role of Augustus. After seeing the movie, I realized I should have trusted the casting directors and of course, John Green's judgment. I went into the movie expecting some over-hyped,average teenage girl movie, and what I witnessed COMPLETELY EXCEEDED my expectations by far. The casting was PERFECT, and I did not feel that the movie was a disappointment to the book, which is how I had assumed I would feel. Although I wanted to rip my heart out of my chest, and throw it on to the freeway for millions of cars to run over, the movie had some comical moments that really made you laugh out loud. It is definitely a tear-jerker, as the book was, but that is practically a given.It gave the audience a great pain, and that pain definitely demanded to be felt. There were also parts of the book that I was disappointed to see had not made the movie, like Hazel letting a young girl wear her oxygen tubes, and when Gus discusses his ex-girlfriend, however, I understood that they could not be portrayed due to strict timing. As for the movie overall, congratulations to John Green, Josh Boone, the cast, and everyone else for successfully bringing one of the greatest romance stories of all time to life. I COMPLETELY recommend and I can not wait to see this movie about twenty million more times.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

8.5/10,"The Fault in our stars has its stumbles and problems, but most importantly it is a movie that will speak to each one of its viewers in a very personal way and by doing so it will produce very different opinions. This is due to the fact that the film treats its material in a unique way and, to the movie's merit, it has the balls to say this is the way we're going and we're sticking hard to it, by doing so the experience that everyone will take out of it will be very subjective. Because of this I feel it is very hard to talk about this movie looking at it soley as an art piece; it touches thematics that are close to every human being and comes out victorious in its intent to offer a prospective from which each one of us can take what he or she wants and think about it. Meaning that as much as the film can be liked or not, I contend that every judgment will be surely influenced by the relation that the viewer had with the film's tone and the themes involved: so if you were able to take something special out of it you will probably see the whole picture on a positive light, if instead you didn't feel in anyway moved or interested you'll probably see it on a total different light. Yet this isn't due, in my opinion, to the fact that the movie is good or bad, but it is because it has its way of going and you will be either in, out or mildly in on it, however I invite you not to blame this on the artistry and to value the filmaking craft on a different level: this doesn't mean that you must like the movie, but only that I see two sides of judging it here and I don't feel like they should be mixed.Regarding the movie's treatment of its story, I believe that The Fault in our Stars had the potential to reach the greatness of its similar ""50/50"" but comes a bit short in that. It most certainly touches equal emotional heights and curiously it touches them more frequently, but, other than banally having singular moments that will plainly take you out of it (yet they don't count too much), it has a subtle convenience about itself and tends to privilege sentimental storytelling over realistic storytelling. I am not against ""sentimental storytelling"", everybody needs and loves believing in the fantastic: reason why the movie doesn't fail by being sentimental, but it clearly isn't what the film was going for, that being more realism. I didn't feel comfortable one-hundred-percent in being carried away by the narrative in the first 45 minutes and this is probably due to Gus' character (not the performance!), it didn't feel safe for me to give the story my suspension of disbelief in the start, I truly believe this was the script's fault, yet most thankfully after the first act and a half this problem quickly dissolved and boy was I on board from there onwards! The narrative had its problem, but from the tone and the treatment-of-material perspective I was totally in. The film has a very wide array of themes: family, love, friendship, disease, death; it could have failed so badly in its intent to touch on all of those, yet the balance of every element inserted both in drama and comedy was astonishing. The movie made me both laugh and cry multiple times, it is so gut-wrenching yet never stumbles in melodramatic or pretentious territory and manages to maintain a very noble intention and heart. This culminates in the last 30 minutes which touch amazing dramatic heights and had a true impact on me. Hats off to all of the actors that all had their moment to shine and did so, still maintaining a solid quality throughout despite some characters feeling somewhere and somehow unconvincing. Yet this didn't really matter on the whole because I found myself truly caring for everything and everyone and being involved, connected and sometimes reflected by the people portrayed. Josh Boone surely deserves lots of merit for the success of the movie: his direction is very, very solid and keeps everything going without having any really important stumbles.Yet nothing and nobody deserves the praise that Shailene Woodley deserves here. I can now salefy say that she is the best actress working today alongside Jessica Chastain. I will also go as far as saying that this performance is Oscar worthy. I truly don't have many words that can explain how much I loved this performance. I might as well go on and just write a love letter to her instead of describing how wonderfully awed I felt by her. Frame after frame all I could think of was just how dam spectacular she was. She is the reason this movie succeeds in every single aspect. Without a performance of this caliber you would have half if not less of a movie. I don't know how to put in words how much I was riveted by this particular performance, I knew she was totally brilliant before, but this really was powerful. I actually came as far as thinking that Shailene Woodley would really die (it's no spoiler, we all know Haezel has terminal cancer) because of how convincing she was in the role. I have rarely ever been affected so deeply by an actor's craft and as superficial as it might sound I am honestly saying what I really thought. Thank you Shailene for your acting talent, this is the reason I love going to the cinema.In the end ""The Fault in our Stars"" hit the right buttons for me and resonated on multiple levels. Plus it had very deep emotional affection and in spite of its many minor incoherences I found myself totally won over, this is one of the best of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The most emotional film,"The movie The Fault In Our Stars is a magnificent movie in terms of its subject, all the structural elements in the movie are so harmonious that you get great pleasure while watching it. The subject of the movie is very emotional but it gives important messages that we need to acquire in our lives. As for the subject, a girl with thyroid cancer cannot breathe without a tube and for this reason she is confined to her home. Her family sends her to an association for cancer patients. There, she meets the boy who has the same disease and whose leg was amputated because of this disease. After this child, the girl's whole life changes, she looks at life in a more positive way, she does not confine herself to her home, she lives all her wishes and dreams with that child, and while she thinks her life is over, she clings to life again with that child. The book is also available and it is a book that has received many awards. I think you should read the book first and then watch the movie. That way you will see exactly what kind of integrity it is. If you are going to watch this movie, you should be ready to cry because especially the ending is a very emotional movie. What makes the movie beautiful and meaningful is what they experience in this emotionality. Is great love.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Sick Pathetic CANCER movie,I was totally spellbound on seeing an 8.2 rating for this movie.IMDb rating has nowadays become wholly untrustworthy.The whole thing seemed like a soap opera series with crying tears and sentiments.If so much people are giving this rating I believe it is only for the sob.In real life this is really heartbreaking but for a movie it is sick and pathetic.The heroine does not deliver anything and the hero seems worst.The whole movie does not even require a review.It does not do the main basic reason for a film--TO ENTERTAIN(whether for crying or for laugh or for horror or any other emotion.This movie is for immature people who like to cry on seeing rubbish sentiments.....,2.0,Anonymous,Romance
An exceptional love story!!!!!!,"The Fault in Our Stars is a 2014 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Josh Boone. The film stars Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort, and Nat Wolff, with Laura Dern, Sam Trammell, and Willem Dafoe playing supporting roles. Woodley plays Hazel Grace Lancaster, a sixteen-year- old cancer patient who is forced by her parents to attend a support group, where she subsequently meets and falls in love with Augustus Waters, played by Ansel Elgort. Hazel and Gus are two extraordinary teenagers who share an acerbic wit, a disdain for the conventional, and a love that sweeps them - and us - on an unforgettable journey. Their relationship is all the more miraculous, given that they met and fell in love at a cancer support group.

Real hard to keep out the tears,"I stepped into the theater hoping for a good movie. I had seen the ratings on IMDb and 8.4 was a very good score for a romantic drama. I must say that I entered the cinema hall with high expectations but guess what? I came out more satisfied than ever, literally trying hard to keep my tears from rolling down my cheeks.This movie portrays the romantic life of two cancer patients and it is as good and as realistic as it gets. No useless stuff, no made up scenarios - it all seems natural. I haven't read the book so I had no idea what was coming and whatever was thrown at me, I found it really good. I couldn't predict how it would end (atleast not exactly how it actually ended) and it was a pleasant (though sad) surprise. The story isn't sad - You start with 2 cancer patients, you know how its gonna end. But the love that bonds the lead characters even in a time of unbearable difficulty and to know that it will not last long is heart breaking. Even much before the movie ended, I was contemplating as to what will happen to the characters later on in the story.If you are looking for an amazing romantic drama, this is the best and the most realistic as it will ever get. For those who cannot hold back their tears, make sure you bring lots of tissues along, you'll need it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Circus for the masses,"I am open minded enough to watch/read a work of art that is not in my typical favorite subject.

Have you heard a real teenager speaking? The whole movie is so surrealistic that it would be the same if the characters were blue and could fly.And by the way, not less important, the movie is disrespectful to real cancer patients and their families.But, if you like to cry for some sick fiction teenagers for entertainment, because you can't feel a s**t in real life, this can be a good pick.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Extended version is quite powerful,"I haven't seen this since theaters just because it was so emotional I wanted to spare myself. This review is for the extended version which is actually just a touch better because like the book it's not afraid to show a little bit more truth of the situation. This teen weeper is about a young woman named Hazel played by an always strong Shailene Woodley (The Descendants) whose had cancer since she was young. She tries to deal with stuff as realistically as possible even when she meets hunky, swoon worthy Gus played by charming Ansel Elgort (Baby Driver) in a star making performance. They have great chemistry and he pushes her boundaries giving her somewhat of a new lease on life. Initially I was more moved by the parents story and their amazing performances by Laura Dern (Jurassic Park) and Sam Trammel ( True Blood). I still felt like that was very strong but with the extra footage I was really enamored with the central relationship. Although I'm 40 I really felt their story and was even more affected by it's tragic outcome. Funny, sad and powerful Fault is one of the best weepers of all time.Budget: $12m

Not your average romantic comedy,"Going into seeing this film I didn't know what to expect I haven't read the book (even though now I really want to) The film itself is surprisingly well put together of course it falls into the same formula of the average romantic comedy of having to be centered with the couple and how they fall in love and surprisingly this is very over dramatic I dare say it is one of the best of its kind I would call this a slice of life type of story if you ask me personally It is emotionally driven and provocative each of the characters are well portrayed especially our main female protagonist Hazel which is played by Shailene Woodley I will not be surprised if she gets a Oscar this year for this performance cause I was shocked I remember seeing her as this pregnant teenager in the hit TV show ""secret life of a American teenager"" and now we can see how matured she is in her acting skills I really recommend people to see this mostly to those who have dates but I will assure you will have a good time and will not regret seeing this wonderful film!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A compelling film that handles its sensitive subject matter with sincerity,"""The Fault in Our Stars"" manages to strike a delicate balance. It's a film centered on a difficult subject, yet it avoids feeling manipulative. The strength of the narrative lies in its grounded approach.

The direction keeps the focus firmly on the characters, allowing their relationships and struggles to resonate. The cinematography, while subtle, creates an intimate and believable world.Shailene Woodley delivers a powerful performance, anchoring the film with her nuanced portrayal of Hazel. Ansel Elgort, alongside her, creates a believable and touching romantic connection. Even in his smaller role, Willem Dafoe adds a layer of depth.

The soundtrack effectively amplifies the film's emotional beats, contributing to the overall atmosphere without overpowering the narrative.In essence, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is a compelling film that handles its sensitive subject matter with sincerity.

Where is the depth?,"I was quite disappointed in this movie. And surprised at all the 9-10 star reviews. I don't want to repeat everything people with 1 star reviews have said, but totally agree with most of them. Bad acting. I mean... where is the chemistry between these two people? Where does this great 'love' come from that they keep talking about but are not showing? 'Love' story? Not on any level. And how many times can you say OMG in a movie? Was there some kind of Guinness World Record attempt here? It was very distracting and so shallow. I had watched The Good Lie just before this and was bawling my eyes out.

Ultimate tragic romance,"Director Josh Boone took on the challenging and all-too-common theme of young, tragic love with The Fault in Our Stars - so he had better get it right - and he did. In fact, it's refreshingly one of the best if not the best attempt at capturing this difficult and emotionally swept up idea in film. Hats off to stars Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort who add a truly beautiful, touching and sentimental movie to their portfolios. Waterworks guaranteed.Woodley plays Hazel - a 17 year old girl who's already running on borrowed time. Her devoted parents (Laura Dern and Sam Trammell) try to manage; having dealt with their daughter's illness since she was 13 and their longtime weariness shows empathetically on their faces. Life lacks luster for young Hazel whose situation is pretty grim. Mom and Dad send her to a support group for teens with cancer - and it's there that she catches the eye of Augustus (Ansel Elgort). He's also been struck with an affliction that has taken part of his leg; although when he meets Hazel he is currently in remission. He's adoringly innocent, playful and forever charming - and completely smitten with Hazel. She's cautious per her situation, but ultimately can't help but fall wonderfully head over heels for him. It's the value of this relationship that the characters discover and it's their definition of what makes a significant life that is forever altered.There are some obvious short-cuts to the audience's heartstrings being used in The Fault in Our Stars - let's not deny that - but it's quickly forgiven in this honest and gut-wrenching romance because it's just done so well. The premise allows the teen coupling to be intensified without making it ridiculous. The character's simple lives transpire to a higher plane with love, and their longing for more of what they just can't get is the ultimate tragic romance.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The movie never seems to force the audience to feel a certain way; it never pauses to say, ""now you are supposed to cry."" It balances the good and the bad so that no one leaves the theater feeling depressed. You may be sad, but not hopelessly depressed.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The story line was very interesting as it's completely different perspective of an illness than the way it's usually presented.The love story element of the film, brings the idea of appreciating the people that are close to us as you never know when it's time to say goodbye. In addition to this, this also gives hope to those who are seriously ill for love and to try new things even though the diagnosis is clear.The cinematography and sound in this film is great and it really appeals to the storyline as well as suits both characters in terms of their personal thoughts.Overall, I think this is a very positive film to watch even though it's mainly about cancer.

The Fault in Our Love Stories Not Present in FIOS,"All too often, I see melodramatic cancer movies (i.e. MY SISTER'S KEEPER) that try so hard to make you cry and just relieve the target audience of the book. So many of these films along with the other horrible love stories eventually become the same level of cheese as anything you'd see on the Hallmark channel you watch to get a few laughs in your days. But in THE FAULT IN OUR STARS (FIOS), it may be the sense of self- awareness it has, or the beautifully crafted characters, director Josh Boone finds a way to make a genre- defying love story that will undoubtedly stand the test of time.Hazel Grace Lancaster, presented in the Oscar-worthy performance by Shailene Woodley, has established herself in the beginning as a cancer patient who has long since come out of the acceptance stage of dying and transformed into the waiting stage, which makes for an extremely interesting and immersive character to gain a mind set. Never has a simple love story delved into such raw human emotion and been so genuine in presenting true human thought process. When Hazel is introduced to Agustus Waters, played by Ansel Elgort, she is given a ""little infinity"" that blows any charming a man has ever done to a woman in a movie. A series of events happen, and a depressing final act ensues, but for some reason, you come out of the theater feeling refreshed. Relieved that is, that there is still some hope in the romantic genre, that films still know how to develop multiple-leveled characters all the while creating an iconic film still accessible to the mainstream audience.The major, and only flaw, this film has is in the character Agustus. While he is very touching and genuine as the recovering cancer patient, he seems to have a tad but too much self-awareness of exactly how charming he is. I don't want to use the term cock to describe how he comes across, but in some instances, that's the only term I can describe his reactions to lines of other characters, etc. He has one scene in particular that is supposed to be sad but I couldn't help but burst out laughing from the facial expressions. But other than that, FIOS is a leap forward in the romance genre and will provide grief for all romantic films to come since they will not be able to live up to this film.

I loved how they didn't really change anything from the book and really stuck to the original storyline. The romance between Augustus and Hazel was really well written, not forced, awkward, or rushed at all. They captured the essence of their spirits in this movie so well, I was shocked.

"Bring tissues. A lot of them. This is one smart, witty, and edgy romance that, we warn you, ends in genuinely bittersweet tragedy","Kudos to John Green for proving that popular young adult fiction need not always be set in dystopia (think 'Divergent' or 'The Hunger Games') or the supernatural (need we mention 'Twilight'); rather, his bestselling novel is a love story between two witty, engaging teenagers with cancer, and before you go thinking that this is no more than Nicholas Sparks for a younger crowd, trust us when we say that it is nowhere near that. Instead, as those who have read the book will stridently attest, it is wise, warm, funny and touching all at the same time, and the best thing one could say about this film adaptation is that it retains all these qualities which made the book such a sensation.Going into a story like this, you know that it is bound to turn mawkish at some point, especially as it deals with the inevitable progression towards death of not one but both of our endearing protagonists. What makes Green's novel - and by extension, Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber's screenplay - such a winner is just how it earns each and every drop of your sympathies for the two leads, Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) and Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), so much so that when it does play that tug at your heartstrings, you'll not begrudge for every tear you shed. And oh yes, unless you're defective (and we say this with not a single hint of spite), you'll be moved to tears by this story of dying love.Preserving Hazel's narration of the events that follow (and clearly benefiting from the strength of Green's prose), our first encounter with Hazel is through the thoughts in her head. As a teen, she came perilously close to death, but an experimental treatment has managed to beat back the cancer, and so she goes around these days with a tube inserted into her nostrils that's tethered to an oxygen tank she lugs around in a trolley bag. It is at a support group for cancer patients that she has her 'meet-cute' with the strappingly handsome Augustus, a basketball player whose career was cut short when cancer took his right leg and where a metal support now resides.Both are immediately taken to each other, and it's not hard to see why. Not only do they match each other in intelligence, they are just as whip-smart, making an instant connection as they trade barbs with each other - and yes, in case there was ever any doubt, fall in love. Most prominently, they bond over their rejection of the usual 'cancer story' sentiments', finding much to talk about in Hazel's favourite book 'An Imperial Affliction' by the reclusive Dutch-American author Peter Van Houten, which just happens to be about living with cancer. Hazel counts herself as Van Houten's biggest fan, so Augustus takes a chance and tries to reach out to Van Houten himself, who unexpectedly replies to the latter's fan mail.One thing leads to another, and pretty soon Hazel and Augustus are travelling to Amsterdam to meet Van Houten (Willem Dafoe) in person - better still that it is an all-expenses paid trip sponsored by Augustus' Make-A-Wish type foundation. We won't spoil the surprise for those unacquainted with the story, but suffice to say that the trip marks a turning point in their relationship not only because it deepens their personal affections but also in how it gives them an unexpected lens by which to re-examine how they have come to terms with their condition. It is a sobering turn of events no doubt, and even more so when you consider on hindsight what happens after.Does one or both of them die at the end? Well, certainly. Death is pretty much written into a story like this, so in that sense, it is still an unabashed tearjerker. What differentiates this from the rest of the sappy melodramas is its refreshing sense of honesty about the real- life issues it confronts. Yes, it doesn't sugarcoat the realities it wades into - the disease, mortality, and the impermanence of our temporary existence on this earth - and instead deals with them with insight and self-deprecating humour; in particular, the recurring theme of oblivion makes for a heartbreaking moral search by one of our protagonists to find meaning in suffering.To his credit, director Josh Boone handles the material with sensitivity and restraint, but he doesn't add much to the cinematic language that Green's book was already brimming with. Instead, the real stars here are Woodley and Elgort, who embody the amazing chemistry which Green describes between Hazel and Augustus. This is easily Woodley's standout role, bringing just the right mix of strength and vulnerability, resistance and acceptance, to make Hazel a living and breathing character that invites her audience to feel her struggle and share in her fate. Her 'Divergent' co-star Elgort is confident but stops short of ever becoming cocky, but most importantly makes for an extremely appealing couple with Woodley.The best assurance we can offer to fans of the book is that it remains faithful to Green's tale, and by that we mean it is equally sharp, funny, and well-observed. It is also a weepie all right, but one that earns its emotional kick with wit and earnestness. At no point does it ask for any pity from its audience; instead, it regards its characters with the respect and dignity that they deserve, acknowledging their everyday struggles and the uncertainties that the disease has on their relationship. It's not always you get a cancer picture that you get characters saying lines like 'pain demands to be felt' or 'life isn't a wish-granting honesty', but that is also the reason why 'The Fault in Our Stars' rises above the trappings of its genre to become something exuberant, perceptive and genuinely stirring.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Love story in romance movies tends to be simple, and it also looks like it from the outside: two sick kids truly understanding each other and falling in love. However, the quality of lines make a whole difference. Anne Frank's quotes from her diary overlapping as Hazel challenges herself to climb the stairs is brilliant because those lines exactly tell how Hazel feels and her choice to live the moment. It could not have been clearer and more metaphorical at the same time. Very touching and poignant.

I usually don't cry when I'm watching movies but the fault in our stars was so emotional that made me cry. l have watched a lot of romatic movie but I can tell you the fault in our stars is definitely one of the best romantic movies of all time! Of course titanic and the notebook were my other favorite romantic movies too",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simply 10,"I watched this movie after years again and went to see reviews here. I am truly disappointed by all those bad ratings. Noticed many times how Ansel played his role without emotions. This is simply not true. Ansel and Shailene did amazing job, with right amount of emotions. Makes me sad seeing all this reviews saying this movie is not worth watching it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Loved at as much, maybe more, than the book.","I read the book in about 6 hours a few weeks ago. Loved it-- couldn't put it down. I did not have high hopes for the movie when I rented it tonight. Watching a movie after reading the book almost always leaves me disappointed.I'm glad to say I'm not disappointed. At all. I'll watch it again tomorrow.My husband and I laughed, cried and cried some more. I just could not get over the chemistry between Shailene Woodley and Ansel. I really thought it would be strange seeing them together romantically right after playing siblings who hate each other in Divergent. I wonder how that will play out in the divergent sequels...This movie was just great.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
fault in our stars .....how our life is affected from things beyond our control,"i know there are different opinions about this particular title,this is one of those movies which demands it's viewers to get connected to it. beautiful adaptation of the novel, though i agree its bit cheesy(but that's for the audience only).

Best Movie Ever!,"I fall in love with this movie immediately. The actors plays so well, expressing the feelings of their character beautifully.The writing and directing are amazing, the movie go smoothly. They manage to put 336 pages into 2 hours very well, I didn't feel they are missing something or the the scenes are going too fast. The landscapes are beautifully and they make you want to be there with them.I like that they gave a new perspective to this terrible disease, therefore, even if you are very sick you can have a chance at happiness and love..you can make your wishes to happen. Is also about the journey, the struggle that you with the disease, the belief that you'll manage to pass all that and the relationship you have with the ones that are close to you.I will definitely going to see it again!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wonderful story,"Do you believe in love at first sight? Some people talk that sometimes there're meeting that change our life.

The world saw it in 2014.Hazel is a young girl who has cancer. Despite the fact that the disease has temporarily receded, the girl doesn't feel a drop of joy. She goes to a support group, where one day she meets Augustus Waters, after which the lives of both change.

Fault in ours stars review,"A lot of my family get cancer sadly so I understand how sad cancer can be. When I saw the trailer for this it looks like it would be good even know it a sad kind of romance. I recommend if you plan on watching this movie you might have to have tissues on hand just in case you start crying becuse the ending is quite a sad one but in a good story way. The two main character had get chemistry together. The romance was great. The story had lots of emotions like happiness, sadness and so much more. The ending was so unexpected when I first saw it I didn't think it was gonna ended up the way it did. I knew something sad was gonna happen but I didn't expect it to happen to who it happened too. I highly recommend this story anyone who doesn't mind watching sad romances once and a while.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

An excellent rating for an excellent movie. Spoiler... you will cry.,"A beautiful movie if ever I've seen one. Honestly, one of the best I've watched since watching perks of being a wallflower. The characters are convincing, the chemistry between them is palpable and even though you only know the characters for 2 hours, the ending is enough to make even the hardiest of men with a smidgen of a good heart cry. The story unfolds without flaw and takes you through a journey of love and loss, making you understand the harsh realities of life, while also showing to you the beauty that can be found in even the smallest of infinities. All in all an excellent movie and a worthwhile watch for anyone seeking to find a diamond among the movies of 2014. And to any person who has the gall to give this movie a 1, I say you must have absolutely no good taste and do not have mental capacity to grasp the deeper and more beautiful things in life. Though I have not read the book, I am definitely going to. I am certain that the director and the actors did a brilliant job at bringing the book to life for us. Hats off to all of you :)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
over rated,"It wasn't a bad movie, but I didn't enjoy it either. The film was kind of an average romance. I felt it was a nice story at first, but I got bored of it. After reading the book, the scenes in the movie were exactly how I imagined them, however, it didn't live up to my expectations. With all the hype, I expected it to be great. However, I couldn't really connect to the characters. I don't understand why people were crying at the end. I didn't. I felt little connection to the characters. Everything was all too deep, and the metaphors sounded ridiculous, like it was written by an emo kid who bleeds on paninis. Reasonable story, average camera work, average effects, good actors.

A romantic & heartbreaking masterpiece!,"The Fault in Our Stars is a movie about two teenagers, Hazel(Shailene Woodley) & Gus(Ansel Elgort). Hazel is constantly accompanied by an oxygen tank as she can't breathe without it. Gus has an artificial leg. Despite all these odds, the two of them meet & fall in love with each other.The Fault in Our Stars is a flawless film. The chemistry between Shailene Woodley & Ansel Elgort is electrifying. Hazel & Gus' romance is adorable & is the highlight of the film. The performances are another highlight of the film. Shailene Woodley is spectacular as Hazel. Woodley's character's vulnerability and awkwardness has been portrayed brilliantly by her. Ansel Elgort is brilliant as Gus. Elgort oozes good looks, boyish charm and vulnerability with panache. Nat Wolff is great as Isaac. Laura Dern & Sam Trammell are awesome as Frannie & Michael respectively. Willem Dafoe is amazing as Van Houten.

A brilliant film to a brilliant book,"I had real high hopes for this film and I was not disappointed thank god! I read the book a while ago and it was that type of story that stuck in your mind for days! No kidding this book had me feel all the emotions, it was brilliantly written by john green yet another one of his fantastic novels, It had romance drama and comedy all in one and was a heartwarming story right from the beginning. I thought the film was really good, they picked the perfect actors to play the characters, just how I imagined them to be when I was reading the book, OK so they missed a couple of things out in the film which were in the book but they weren't really important things. I advise people to read the book first if you're planning on watching this so then you can imagine yourself what the film will be like. It is a fantastic story, film and just like the book this film will stay in my mind for a fair few days because it was such an emotional and moving film in which the actors captured the emotions perfectly. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Whose Fault is This Film?,"The fault in not in the stars, but in the minds of this films creators.I am not a fan of Josh Boone. Despite being pictured on IMDb with a Bob Dylan T-shirt, his films are usually the equivalent of teeny bopper pop songs, all sparkle and no soul. He also uses the same formula for every single film. It's his little bag of (cheap) tricks which is as follows -1.Make sure your love story has a bit of death in it so that love becomes more important.2. Keep everything very superficial in terms of thoughts and feelings and instead just use clichés to achieve empathy.3.Throw in as much of your own musical taste as possible because everyone should have to listen to your ipod when they watch your film.4. Set you pretentious melodrama in white middle class America, making sure everyone is rich and good looking, cos no-one wants to watch ugly poor people crying, that's just awkward.And hey presto, you've got a Josh Boone film.But I wanted so much to have something good to say about a movie that sets out to empathise with people who are terminally ill, but instead I found myself actually angered by this films approach to such a serious issue.Despite being diagnosed with cancer, both of the main characters seem totally fine, very happy and to be honest in complete denial. I'm not saying this kind of movie should be a total downer, but nor should it be a disneyfied dose of shallow distraction.If that is the case however then we are left with a question of some moral implication, namely, does this movie make light of the kind of suffering and depression involved in diseases like cancer, or is it simply trying to provide some light distraction? My view, was the former.Even as a film for teenagers a blanket whitewash of teeny charm, axiomatic platitudes and pseudo-morality is hardly a responsible framework of material for a film that supposedly aims to help, lacking as it does in any sense of emotional maturity or intellectual depth.I am glad however that they donated a large portion of money to cancer charities. For that, this film is forgiven. But honestly, show a Boone movie to a struggling poverty-stricken member of any society, who actually has real problems, and you'll have a riot on your hands.If you want a serving of insincere and self indulgent sympathy then this film does the trick.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Some movies make you believe in love...,"There are movies that entertains you and there are some that showcases your very own life in front of you, not literally, but you can connect the bits and pieces of your life to the story. This movie is one of those that flows in your heart and you will likely to be comparing it with all time modern love stories. Tears roll not because whats happening to the character but because you wonder what if the situation was same for you, what if the same words were spoken to you, what if you have loved a person the same way. This is what makes the movie so highly regarded. It is not a movie about technicality but about the script and the foreshadowing that keeps you wondering from the character's point of view.

Not Your Typical Cancer Movie,"I have refused to watch this movie ever since it came out . I guess it was because I thought it was one of the cheesy romance dramas that have been flavored with classic cancer story. I could not be wronger. This movie not only exceeded my expectations but it made me regret every single second that I wasted with not watching this movie. It is not a classic cancer story. It has twists and turns. It has the element of ""the unexpected"". It is one of the movies make you happy and sad at the same time.

"So very disappointing. It seduces teenagers, but what do they know?...","It's a pity. A book like this, one in a decade, from an incredibly talented author, to have this fate! A disastrous film, nothing works. First, the script: Almost always it's different from the book it's based upon, which is not a bad thing, but here, we have a complete misunderstanding from the script writers. Green constructed his story so beautifully, piece by piece with the precision of a clockwork. All of his work went down the drain. I don't want to go into the details of the story, but if you've read the book, just don't see this film. The casting is a joke. Two perfectly healthy young boy and girl, pretend to be suffering from cancer. Not even their make up is believable. Willian Dafoe even worse of his usual bad self. A disaster. The director is a complete failure, in directing actors, as well as picturing interior, or exterior spaces. Last but not least, the music is so bad, it sounds like a cheap - very cheap - TV series selection. Everything in this film is so bad, I wouldn't know which is worse. In total, John Reed's masterpiece should have a better fate being filmed. Of course it seduces teenagers, but what do they know?...",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Touching movie, reminding of another excellent movie, the Flemish ""Hasta La Vista"", 2011","There are so many critical reviews about this title that I shouldn't probably take my chance at doing it, since I am pretty sure that all I would have to say has already been mentioned by others, more gifted than I am at analyzing and defending their point of view from a movie- critically-at-ease perspective. The movie managed to touch me, to transport me, just as it did to so many viewers, according to what I can read here, and that's the point for me. So it is well-worth a ten. The script, the directing, the acting, they are all in harmony, just like a well-performed symphony where everything is there where it needs to be in order to get the audience well and beyond time and space. The point of my review is simply to suggest another great movie I have seen that was reminded to me by ""The Fault in Our Stars"", well, a different movie that is being so much in tune with this one, from a different perspective, of course, and that is ""Hasta La Vista"". So I would end by saying just like on the site of IMDb: if you liked ""The Fault in Our Stars"", you may also like ""Hasta La Vista"", a Flemish movie of 2011. Give it a try.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A praise to life,"One of the best young adult movies around. The title is purposefully set to remind you of the star-crossed lovers in Romeo & Juliet. Instead of being part of two competing families, impending death by cancer is the doom that looms over these lovers. The movie makes the two leads deal with more than a young life should have to deal with - and it is taking a stand for trying and risking things - whatever the odds are and whichever cards life have dealt to you.
Both leads give a charming and credible performance and it is fun to see how their romance develops with delicate steps.
Overall a memorable movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Interesting movie,I love this movie so much as this love story teaches us no matter how hard our lives are we need to always appreciated what we have and the time we spend. We cannot use money to exchange love. We do not have to afraid of losing each other because it is fate. The only thing we can do is hold on to each other and do not fear of anything. Life is full of challenges. We need to face it positively like the couple in the movie. Seeing each other everyday can be a most wonderful thing ever. Loving who she or he is is the things we should do. We should say thank you to the one who be with us. This is because they take care of us like a precious girl.

May the pain and love be with you,"The first time I heard of this movie was on the front page of IMDb, where new movies displayed as in a showcase. To be honest, I am not a big fan of sad, romantic movie, so I decide to ignore it. While today I was watching a video clip consisting of footage of billboard top 50 songs, all of a sudden, this song, Boom Clap coming on my screen. It's hard not to be attracted by the music video for some certain reasons. First of all, that singer has a peculiar image; then, I find the song rather catchy. So I watched the whole video for like, twice. And I cried.I don't know why this happened. Listening to music was supposed to be amusing, but I just couldn't control myself when I saw two young people hugging and kissing each other wearing a ""I am in love"" expression that can literally drown you in their face. The second I saw the smile on their face, puddles of tears coming out of my eyes, and by that time I don't even know any plots of the movie. Just few seconds and couple of scenes in this film can make me act like this. I'd better see what the entire movie can do.The result is just as what I have expected. I cried. I cried so hard that my dad thought I was having problem with my upcoming test. I haven't cried so hard for a movie, or anything, for years.(The last time I did this was when I watching Hachi as I remembered).People all tend to be moved by strong and beautiful love. No matter what kind of love it is. Sometimes it is the love between families, like Hazel and her parents. Sometimes it is the romantic love that Hazel and Gus shared. Frankly, I don't buy things like true love. However this movie, one of the saddest one that I have ever seen, really helped me regained the faith for finding a person who is there for you, who can give you the best love ever, the love you never ever dreamed of before, the love and forever that only happened once in your life within the numbered days. It's the shield for you to fight while it hurts you with every breath you take. As it said in the book:"" Pain demands to be felt.""""I am in love with you. And I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed. And that one day all our labor will be returned to dust. And I know that the sun will swallow the only earth we will ever have. And I am in love with you.""I bet I would cry every time I watch this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Way More than Just ""Okay""","It's very rare that I leave a movie with the mindset of ""That was a near- flawless film. This is going to become one of favorites."" This has happened twice so far in 2014. The first time was after Disney's ""Frozen,"" which I saw in January. And the second time was after this film.And I didn't expect it, either. I mean, sure, I knew I was gonna like it. I read John Green's novel this past winter and I did quite enjoy it. So yes, I was looking forward to seeing this movie. I thought it was gonna be good. But it wasn't just good. It was incredible. Not only was it probably the most faithful book-to-movie adaptation I've ever seen (save for those bazillion Christmas Carols), but it was one of those movies that was both heart-wrenching and heart-warming at the same time. Not many films can do that, and this one pulled it off superbly.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great overall,"I'd hardly know where to start without giving away spoilers. Even after this long there are those who have not seen the movie ... or read the book. The film does a marvelous job of bringing the book to the screen with its themes and viewpoint intact. For that the filmmakers deserve much praise. The production values were high, the direction tight and on target and the locations, sets and music complimented rather than distracted. It goes without saying that the acting was talented and spot on. To begin, I especially liked Laura Dern. She's always good but I especially enjoyed her here. She reminded me exactly of some of the cancer mothers I've known and she did it with dignity and grace. Thank you Ms. Dern. I can't comment on the part played by Sam Trammel. I can't because his character is me. I should mention that unfortunately, for me, this subject matter was a bit too close to home. Once you've been down this road the world can never look the same again. That has to bring me to Hazel Grace; and the young talent who played her: Shailene Woodely. Ms. Woodley gave beauty, sensitivity, dignity and grace to the most difficult of characters. I could give in to my ceaseless grief and anxiety and say something mean-spirited about her performance because; after all, she's actually healthy and strong and is likely destined for a long, happy and successful life. How could she possibly begin to grasp the gravity of her character and the all-to-real physical pain and mental anguish that her character had to live with every second of her life? But, to her great credit, she pulled it off. At least she did for this film-goer and that's enough of an accomplishment for her young life. I'm glad I didn't have to cut her any slack; she had that line as taunt as it could be. The real question left for this film then, is if they did right by all of the very real Hazel's and Gus' out there. In the final analysis they did as much as could be covered in the short flash of time that is a film. It's perhaps all most audiences could take as well. It was very hard for me to sit through as it was. Had they struck a mark any closer to the source I don't think I could have lasted the film. My own family's experience was far worse than this. My oldest daughter had a brain tumor, the same kind as John Travolta's character in ""Phenomenon"". I guess that's ironic in some way. The only good thing I can say about that is that she very quickly lost the ability to understand what was happening to her. Another irony is that patients like her were mentioned in the book this film was adapted from. It said, ""... Her brain cancer was of the variety that makes you not you before it makes you not alive."" That was the sole blessing in it; a perverse kind of mercy. But enough about me. See the movie. It's bound to give something to each one who sees it. If it does, do yourself a favor and read the book. It is better than the film ... all books are.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great if you are a stupid 16 year-old girl...,"Before watching this film I read the book upon recommendation from friends. I hated the book. It was unrealistic (I can't relate to any of the characters), depressing (in that they had cancer) and boring. With a 12 hour flight across the pacific I decide to give the story another chance and watch the film. Exactly the same thoughts.However, alongside the dull story line you are also faced with the terrible acting, out of touch music and redeeming cinematography. If not for the cinematography this film would be getting a 1/10 rather than a 2.Overall, an easy way to pass a 12 hour flight.

CineSketches_The Fault  In Our Stars (2014),"Size and Scale: Fits All! A romantic flick with an unusual drama. Definitely makes you start loving yourself and the near and dear ones more, after understanding what can be the extreme situations in life. Not exactly 10 on 10 but a lot closer to that.

What if the situations are way too drastic than one can imagine? So unfortunately both of them are cancer patients, at later stages of the disease and knowing that they are not going make it longer. The 2+ hour movie traverses through the graphs of emotional lows and occasional highs in their lives, or probably the efforts made by them, their parents and friends to create those highs, moves us inside out. It is also about the very sensitive element of parenting the kids with such diseases and dealing with very delicate mindset of such kids. It's also about the caring, the enthusiasm, and the determination to realize self and others dreams during the curtailed span of life.BFB (Bang For the Buck): A very apt title. Both the leads were played by very young actors Shailene Woodley (Haze) and Ansel Elgort (Gus). While Shailene has potential to become the next Jodi Foster or Sandra Bullock, Ansel definitely is the next Leonardo DiCaprio. Even after knowing the movie consists of some traumatic situations, you'd watch it for their outstanding performances, and for occasional lighter and humorous moments, for their funny friend Isaac (played by Nat Wolf) and a cameo by none other than William Dafoe.

A young love that's unparalleled in today's standard,"Many times after watching a film I had the feeling 'what a waste of money (for the film maker) and time (for me). It's simply because those films were lack of depth and consistency or the writer simply don't know how to end it....The film titled 'The Fault in Our Stars' is one of the few great ones I've watched lately. It echoed with my views on life and love. Those two main characters are young but their views on love are so insightful. Would they be different if they were like any other healthy teens? Many young or old couples that have been together for ages fail to grasp or achieve that kind of level.Yes, it's a story, a fiction but it is very inspiring and meaningful.

Positive and Inspirational,"Based on a worldwide best selling novel, the Fault in Out Stars made a severe impact with audiences and helped elevate Shailene Woodley's career to the next level. Fans of the novel having many doubts as to how the film would compare and share with the novel. Compared to 'the Notebook', this film is quite arguably better and features arguably better writing and refreshing performances from its leads Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort showing great chemistry.A major reason why this film is as praise is due to the positive message, sensitivity of the issues and characters and the authentic feel of the film. In many romance drama teen films, there are silly and over the top forced comedy and they come off as cheesy. This film although deals with a serious matter, plays out in a relatively lighter tone and it works.

For instance, what kind of a love approach is this ? Don't underline all the time that they are talking about this particular book. What amazed me was the mother in front of her sick child saying ""I will never be a mother again"". What mother would be so selfish in a situation like this ? Evry mother would, first thing first, think about her child. That quote ruined the moment and the mother's every appearances. Te father is there, but absent. Both parents spent their time running in the stairs with a would be sad face. The worst part is that I never felt emotionally connected to the characters besides at the very end.

Great acting that brought the depth of the characters out.,"I think this is the first time in history where I have liked the film better than the book. With all the hype surrounding the book and everyone who read it saying that they cried and loved the book to death, I just didn't see what it was all about. Sure it's a sad story and all, but it didn't make me cry and I didn't get it. However, watching it on screen made a significant difference.The cast I feel, was absolutely a perfect match for the characters, and the acting was superb. The chemistry between everyone was just spot on. Maybe that's why it did even more justice to the book. I feel that that's the way film adaptations of books should be; to bring the characters to life so that readers/the audience gets an insight to the characters which will have a stronger impact. However, I feel that this will be one a in a million.The film followed very closely to the book, but I feel that they made Gus the main witty person. In the book Hazel was equally as witty and the banter between them was what kept the dialogue fresh.And it's not really a problem I have, but more of a questionwhy would the parents let her drive? I mean, I guess it's OK for people with cancer to drive as long as they're not in a critical stage, but she has problems BREATHING. Isn't that incredibly risky? She already has cancer why do they want to risk her dying earlier due to a car accident? I'm thinking the answer to my question lies in the bookbut I can't remember. Maybe they just want her to do whatever and live the rest of her life happily. It just seems pretty risky to me.The ending for me, was really well done. It basically summarized what the whole story was about in one word. A very well made and edited film.Read the full review at championangels.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Okay, it wasn't a bad as I thought it was going to be","The Fault in Our Stars is a tragic love story from the beginning to the end. Going into the movie there was many questions I had...Do I have to read the book?Are the actors going to be awkward?Is the movie going to be awkward?Is it going to be like every other love story?And honestly, coming from a guy who isn't really a fan of spending money to go see chick flicks... The answer to all of these questions is no. The movie was great with an outstanding amount of emotion played by all the characters. Ansel Elgort did a great job in this movie. I think he was outstanding just like Shailene Woodley. Nat Wolff as Isaac added a much needed laugh to some pretty intense scenes. This movie is filled with some pretty intense scenes. The only reason I won't give it a 10 is because it wasn't one of the best, and some of it was dragged. It was a long run time. But you know what, pretty solid movie and I would go see it.

The Cheese in our Stars,"The fault in our stars plot is widely known to everyone whether they have seen the movie or read the book. Having read the book a year ago I was prepared for the story, but still had forgotten enough since reading to make some of it still a surprise to me. I enjoyed traits of some of the characters ie van houten but found most of the characters a bit thin with not many layers. However, this movie does describe the idea and feelings surrounding death and illness unlike any other media I have seen before which is extremely liberating. The character choice was spot on, being practically what I remember imagining while reading it. Augustus's monologues are brilliant and his and hazels relationship is truly touching. Very good movie, heartbreaking moments with some beautiful words and friendships, but at the end of the day who doesn't like a dose of lovey cheesy moments.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Balances the melodrama with humor and romance really well,"""You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful.""The Fault in Our Stars is one of those rare romantic melodramas that succeeds thanks to its talented cast and its believable script. Considering how easy it could've been to emotionally manipulate and exploit the audience with the material, director Josh Boone did an excellent job of recreating a tender love story while avoiding clichés and one dimensional characters. I was unfamiliar with John Green's bestselling novel which this film was based on, but I had high expectations for this film considering the script was adapted by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber whose work in 500 Days of Summer and The Spectacular Now I highly admired. The Fault in Our Stars didn't disappoint thanks to yet another powerful performance from Shailene Woodley (in my opinion her best work), who played her character in such a natural way that she made the story feel believable. Considering the subject matter this film could've been over manipulative, but it never feels this way thanks to a smart and intelligent script and some strong performances. The film balances these dramatic moments with grace and there were also some very funny moments that helped lighten the mood when things got grim. This isn't like other cancer dramas (I'm mostly thinking of My Sisters Keeper here) which have mostly failed by being too exploitive, because this film handles the material with grace. It's still a heartbreaking film, but it is much more natural in the way it approaches the material. This is one of those rare chick flicks that guys will actually enjoy as well.This love story is narrated by Hazel Grace (Shailene Woodley), a teenager who has been diagnosed with stage 4 thyroid cancer and has to carry an oxygen tank with her at all times in order to breathe. In an effort to get her out of the house, her parents, Frannie (Laura Dern) and Michael (Sam Trammell), convince her to join a cancer support group. Despite thinking it's a waste of time, something good comes out of it when she meets Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort). He happens to be there supporting his friend, Isaac (Nat Wolff), who has a tumor in his eye and is about to lose his sight. Augustus himself is a former cancer survivor who lost his leg and is now wearing a prosthetic one. From the moment they bumped into each other at the support group, he just can't take his eyes off her and easily wins Hazel over with his charm and wit. The two become good friends although their relationship seems to be a bit more limited by time than most other couples.In order for a film like this to work it is important that the two main characters share a strong and believable chemistry together. The Fault in Our Stars makes the most out of this thanks to strong and natural performances from both Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort. The chemistry between the two is amazing allowing the relationship to feel authentic and captivating at the same time. We've all seen what Woodley can do, and she has been amazing in every film she's been in, but this is, in my opinion her best performance to date. Ansel Elgort on the other hand completely took me by surprise as I wasn't too impressed with his work in Divergent, but here he is incredibly charming. Nat Wolff, who was one of the main characters in Josh Boone's previous film (Stuck in Love), has an important supporting role here considering his character helps break some of the dramatic tension with several laugh out loud moments. Those scenes really helped lighten up the mood and made this a much funnier film than what I was expecting. Laura Dern and Sam Trammell are also convincing as the parents who are dealing with their daughter's condition. The scenes that really didn't work for me however, were the ones involving Willem Defoe as the author of Hazel's favorite novel. Those scenes were just too weird and took me out of the story, but it's my only complaint for an otherwise incredibly captivating and tear inducing romantic drama.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

I am glad to say though that the film matched my great expectations and I came out of it with a sticky, red splotched face.

I know that I'm being really positive right now, but for real, there isn't one bad thing to say about it, except that I wish the movie had been longer. According to me, the movie lived up to the book. There where of course a couple of places from the book, they didn't put in the movie. But that didn't really matter too me.The acting was marvelous and you couldn't help, but to fall in love with all the characters.

The pace of the movie is excellent and it all the events which take place are at the right time.However, the sheer superb performance undoubtedly comes from Shailene Woodley, she is literally head and shoulder above the rest of the cast. Whether it is her acerbic wit, acceptance of her fate, emoting through her eyes, or delivering gut-wrenching moments through emotionally harrowing sequences and monologues, Wodley, quite simply, knocks every scene and dialogue out of the park.This is an exceptionally young talent and can be easily counted among the decade's best performance from an actress.

The world is not a wish-granting factory,"This movie is a beautiful adaptation of John Green's beautiful novel. It could be better, I admit, but it did not disappoint my great expectations about it.Hazel Grace is a 17-year-old girl who was diagnosed with cancer when she was only 13. She knows that she will die soon, so she considers herself to be a ""grenade"" and thinks that her life is boring, since her routine is based on taking medical exams and watching TV series and reading (always the same book) are her best sources of fun. Like any teenager, she wants to have a normal life and friends (which she does not really seem to have).Her life changes for the better after meeting Augustus Waters, a boy who also had cancer and wants to do something good with his life and not just wait for the worse to happen. They immediately fall in love and start living their own infinity, even though they know that ""some infinities are bigger than others"".What I like about this story is that Hazel and Augustus accept their condition and even make fun of the ""privileges"" that they have for being sick, instead of putting themselves in a condition to make people feel sorry for them.This is a touching and very, very sad movie. You will probably not be able to stop at least a few tears from falling if you watch it with an open heart.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Before this movie, I thought it was going to be one of those teenage love stories that are usually an epic fail, but I was wrong. This movie was a lot more than a love story. It was a true outlook on how cancer can play its scary role in a teenagers life. Hazel and Augustus did so much more than show me a short but amazing love story. Hazel despite her illness, was still a normal teenager. And that Augustus, he was everything but normal. These two have really inspired me and touched my heart.

Lovely movie,"Honestly, I'm not so much for tearjerkers. Especially when diseases are involved, I'm normally not interested. So I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie. Part of this is because of the leading actors. The girl is a strong character who forgets her disease to follow a dream, while the boy is a fun character whom everybody would like to have as a friend. And there's plenty more great characters in this movie, especially Willem Dafoe in his role as the writer of the book that inspires a trip to Amsterdam. Ah, and to see Amsterdam in this movie, it's wonderful. I live ten miles from Amsterdam and have been there too many times to count, so it's funny to see a movie about people whom it mattes so much to, to go there. The city looks grand, and it's a great supporting character. All in all, great picture.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A welcome surprise,"This movie surprised me to say the least. I went in, not even really being a big fan of the book, needing to know how much worse they would make the movie. Imagine my surprise as I watch a perfectly good movie that even moved me to tears (of both joy and sadness). The actors playing Hazel and Gus are perfectly chosen and do the trick perfectly. As I thought the book to be a little bit to ""flat"", lacking a certain amount of depth in the characters, the movie does not give me the same feeling. However they choose their highlights a little bit differently then in the book, it all makes more sense to me this way.A big thumbs up for this movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
So beautiful!,"""This movie is beautiful"" I want to say this as much as gus said to hazel in the movie that she is so beautiful. I enjoyed the first half..it was cute... I was pretty sure that she is gonna die at the end but It was reverse...! Still... It was nice although it was painful. But definitely worthwatching",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A re-watchable cancer-included romance,"The relationships were beautifully natural. In this kind of film, we've come to expect the weird, tense and/or overdramatic family/friends with the cancer sufferer the mature-beyond-their-years stable centre of the universe. I'm not going to say that Isaac wasn't a little loopy but hey, we all have one slightly crazy friend, right! I loved watching the friendship and then romance develop between Hazel and Augustus. Again, it was natural, it was fun, it dealt with the reality of their lives and it was marred with tragedy from the get-go.Living with cancer or another long standing/ life threatening illness has generated a lot of fact and fiction stories, books, movies and documentaries in recent years. What was nice/different about this story was that everyone involved was already at peace with the fact that Hazel would die before her time. There were no big arguments around this fact. It was a sad reality the family lived with, and that was the focus of the story – how they lived despite this. Hazel's concern was that her parents didn't stop when she did go; she wanted them to keep living and not lose purpose. One of the best moments in the film is when they reveal to her that they are preparing for when she is gone.and this makes her happy, not storm out like a drama queen! And can I just say how nice it was to have the protagonist in a relationship that doesn't fall apart when some earth shattering news is dropped! No sad trying to get on with life montage, no big scene argument, just a simple conversation on a bench which pushes the story in a new direction. A relationship which is more about giving than taking, making the other person happy rather than simply enjoying the fact they make you feel good. Yes please.And unlike My Sister's Keeper, I could quite happily watch it again next week rather than waiting a few years! Full review at confessionsofastorylover.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The book is better,"In the book Hazel and Augustus had a captivating dynamic, it felt so real and genuine. It was deep. But the actors did not succeed to portray that, the dialogue fell through completely. Parts that made Augustus so charming, like how he first asked Hazel over in the book talking about vendetta. Parts like that completely cut out. Such parts completely lost their build. I do like Von Houten or what the fictional author now be called. The actor did an amazing job and I really enjoying seeing him on screen, hence the two stars, otherwise it would have gotten zero. Because the movie flopped completely, I did not get that understanding for terminal illness as the book gave me and the love story didn't move me at all.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
excellent,"when i read the book i rated it 4/5 for a reason: i really really liked the books but in my opinion there is a lot of philosophy that can be removed . meanwhile, i watched the movie and i can say it's amazing : it's the first movie i like more than the book . usually i don't like the movies because they are nothing compared to the books . but this is an exception: the movie is so much like the book, nothing new is created . it's typically like the book but the only difference is that in the movie they have deleted a lot of the philosophy i didn't like and they kept the amazing ones . so it's worth a 10/10 and it's the first movie i rated it more than the book",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The best film I've seen.,"The Fault in Our Stars is a 2014 American romantic tragedy film, directed by Josh Boone, based on the 2012 novel of the same name by John Green. The film stars Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort. Woodley plays Hazel Grace Lancaster, a sixteen-year-old cancer patient who is forced by her parents to attend a support group, where she meets and subsequently falls in love with Augustus Waters, another cancer patient, played by Elgort.Since childhood, Hazel has respiratory problems, forcing him to wear an oxygen tube continuously. On her mother's advice, she joined a support group where she met Augustus, who lost a leg to cancer. Charismatic and sure of himself, the young man quickly becomes close to Hazel, showing him the good side of things. He even manages to find the favorite writer of his new friend, planning a trip to Amsterdam to meet him.what i find most impressive about this film is the special effects that are absolutely sensational,and the caractersares are very convincing,The chemistry between Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elsort is astounding and the performances were astonishing.also it is beautifully written .This is the first movie this year that I have given a 10. I don't give out 10's easily, but there was seriously nothing wrong with this film. The pacing was perfect, the acting was phenomenal, the direction, editing and cinematography was exceptional and overall, this movie is one of the best romantic comedies that have ever touched the face of the earth. I encourage EVERYONE to go see this movie no matter what age you are and bring a packet of tissues as well. You'll need it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

All actor's performances are commendable. I would definitely refer this to everyone please do watch. To whoever is reading this, you aren't going to be disappoint. Thank you.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
There is Very Little Fault With This Movie,"Movies about terminal illness, so passionate, so well done, but somehow so sad. Yet for some reason we are drawn to them like moths to a flame, often for the quality tales they spin, and the emotions they stir up. This week The Fault in Our Stars released, another movie based on, yes you guessed it a book. So naturally after coming off my latest science fiction high, it was time for me to return to my local theater and calm myself with this drama/romantic tale. What did I think? As always, please read on to find out.For those who haven't seen the plethora of trailers, or read the book, this movie is the story of Hazel (Shailene Woodley) a girl who suffers from cancer and the associated depression that follows. Just when everything seems lost, a charismatic man named Gus(Ansel Elgort) enters, whose positive outlook and bright spirits send them on a journey of self discovery and wonder. I know, the story sounds like all the other terminally ill stories, but that doesn't mean it's not worth checking out. The Fault in our Stars is an incredibly passionate movie, filled to the brim with amazing scenes of beauty, wonder, and emotion.It all starts with the characters, who at first are like yin and yang, opposite approaches to the same situation. Woodley's portrayal of Hazel was fantastic, the dismay and depression flowing out of her so naturally, it was as if she herself was suffering from the disease. It was so refreshing to see her not playing an overly whiney, teenager as I've seen in her past roles, instead showing the true abilities she had beneath. Yet the character that really brought the movie to me was Gus. This man's positivity and will were infectious, brightening up the negative energy of the situation and keeping the movie fun despite the dire outcomes that awaited. Elgort was like a low key Jesse Eisenberg, arrogant, but not as much of a jerk that makes him lovable. The characters are strong on their own, but together they evolve into a duo that breathes so much life into the movie and hooks you into the two-hour ride. Even when they are not speaking, these young actors portray their feelings in simple gestures, an eye roll here, a smirk there, that translates the thoughts going on in their minds.Supporting the characters is a some creative dialog, that was synthesized from a variety of styles to help get the point across. At first it is nothing more than the ire filled thoughts of a cancer patient that reflects the suffering they face. Depression eventually turns into casual conversations when Gus arrives, balanced in comedy, romance, and other emotions that continue to shift as the story unfolds. What could be a laugh fest at one point can turn into a sobfest at another, but one thing that holds constant is the realism of the movie. Unlike some movies, there is no magical word, saying, or moment that erases all the hurt, but instead a realist approach to handling the cards life deals you. I for one can learn a thing or two from what this movie preached, and perhaps if you open your eyes you can see it too.To help sell the point, the cinematography exploded with symbolism and emotion at the time of the scene. When the characters were down, the camera maximized emphasis on the face, if they were trying capture love, the scene focused on finding romantic imagery to bring out the scene. The musical score they selected only further enhanced the feelings, somehow working behind the scenes to synergistically pull at your heartstrings. You would think I would have gotten annoyed by all of this repetitive themes, but somehow they balanced all of this and kept the pace going, avoiding the cheesiness many romance movies contain in my eyes.Of course what I consider cheesy, others find to be inspiring and beautiful. Being the robot I am, I did not cry in this movie, mostly because I knew what the ending would be well into the movie. Despite the lack of tears, I'll admit that the movie still moved me sending my emotions on a roller coaster ride. As for the other audience members though, the water works flowed through the entire movie. What do these observations mean? It means that you can experience a variety of emotions and learn a lot of things from this movie, which can mean multiple watches of this movie, though the tale will still remain predictable. Another warning is that there are some very tough struggles in this movie, perhaps not appropriate for those with a personal connection to this story. If you're like me though, you'll be able to find happiness in this tale, hopefully being inspired rather than depressed.Surprisingly The Fault In Our Stars impressed me despite the fact it is a story I've seen before. The balance in it impresses me the most, brought to full force with the wonderful acting the cast has to bring. Yes, it is a predictable ending, but the delivery is so solid, I can't really dock it too much. I strongly recommend checking out this movie, hoping that you will take away something from the messages crammed in this movie. Those who have less control over their tears, are warned to bring tissues, or at least the supporting arm of a loved one to get you through the journey. My scores are down below:Drama/Romance: 8.5 Overall: 8.5",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The ending to this movie could have been so much better,"OK, I saw this movie tonight. Alright, not really anything new than others I had already seen. A few things bugged me.1) There were too many references to her time when she almost died... this implied something later in the story would be related, which it wasn't. 2) Was not real enough. After they had met, there next months were almost perfect with a trip to Europe (when the doc said s*** no) and free meal with champagne etc.I was expecting something a lot more twisty at the end than what happened.If I could re-write the ending, this entire movie would have been a dream of the girl after she closed her eyes on deaths door in hospital when she was 13 as she went into a coma. THAT would have been a great ending, dreaming your last days of an amazing love experience that you never got to have and then slipping away into the ether.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love,"I have not read the book that the movie Fault in Our Stars is based on but I have heard good things about it. The movie is good. Interesting in a world of social media and the information age, the one thing this generation is striving for is love and human connection. I watched this film late one night with a room full of tweeners and a bit older crowd. I heard the girls swoon to the characters and even shed a tear or two. The story revolves around two teenagers, Hazel and Gaus, who both are diagnosed with terminal disease. They don't focus on their limited time or share in their anger that they will never grow old but fate has it they find each other. This combination of souls are the ideal of any romantic and what Hollywood seems probable on the big screen is often not true in real life when mixed up with the complexity of life. There are some very touching scenes and even an old cynic like me was warmed by this movie that rekindled my inner yearning for a happily ever after.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I loved the book and i love the movie even more its amazing and so so sad, so you may go through a couple of boxes of tissues.

The outstanding performance of the actors Shailene Woodly and Ansel Elgort make us feel the characters as if they were real.
The soundtracks extracted by different fantastic romantic songs, make the scenes rich of beautiful emotions.
 The plot is very good written, it transmits a lot of ideas, of a pure love that goes beyond the limits such as an infinity.

It was... fine.,"It was a decent movie to watch on a Sunday night I guess. The main problems here were that it was WAY too long. They could've accomplished the same movie had they cut 20-30 minutes off. There were also things that kind of got redundant between the two leads that kind of made the movie drag. The two main leads were really good but I didn't feel much for the relationship with the parents or their friends around them. That part of the story seemed like an afterthought.Had they shaved off some time of the movie, taken out the redundant interactions of the two protagonists, and added in some more of how their conditions were affecting everyone else around them I would've given this a solid 8 - but it's only a 5 from me for now. It's a good, albeit VERY depressing and morbid, movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nyc,"Cancer is such a dreadful disease, indiscriminate in its choice of victim, choosing with aplomb regardless of age, gender, or status. There are a myriad of stories behind the tragedy and many of them remain untold.In The Fault In Our Stars by John Green, he builds a story out of darkness and despair. He takes the tragedy of cancer and immerses us in the lives of characters that could very well be real. Many know of the heartaches in dealing with those who fight the fight, and many of those scars last a lifetime. He brings his story in the form of a teen girl, Hazel Lancaster. Stricken with cancer from a young age, she believes she has come to terms with what her life has become. Then she meets a young man, Augustus Waters, a survivor of cancer. He is drawn to her in a way that is initially uncomfortable, and as she tries to push him away in her sarcastic vein, he finds her to be exactly the type of girl he has been looking for. Throughout the story there is a beauty and humor, a 'candle in the wind' for each of those whose lives have been touched by such an uncaring disease. For cancer touches not just the victim but all those who love and are in anyway touched by them.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

I guess people like fairy tales.,"In case you're wondering, I just happened to come across this film because I think Willem Dafoe is an excellent actor and I was just checking out his work.I guess people like fairy tales. How else could this movie possibly get these rave reviews? If you want to see sad, watch ""Grave of the Fireflies"" or ""Requiem for a Dream"". But despite how the movie is portrayed by other viewers, I believe this film is supposed to portray hope and not what's real. That is the only problem I have with this movie. It is sooooo cliché. Just about everything that happens is like perfect. The perfect guy, the beautiful dying girl. Yeah, it's a princess story rewritten as a cancer story. That's my only problem with this movie. I guess if you're a 12 year-old teenage girl looking for a Snow White kind of tale then this is for you. I was looking for something a little more deep and this did not deliver.If you're not a 12-year-old girl you should probably stay away... unless of course you haven't seen Beauty and the Beast yet in which case go ahead and knock yourself out.

A Compassionate Movie.,"Out of all Cancer/malady movies, I like this the most. The Fault in Our Stars is a heart-breaker for sure, but it's also a sweet, romantic film full of sudden warmth and humor. It gets everything right about being young and in love for the first time. There's a moment when the breeziness powering the story goes away and medical reality takes over, and Elgort's performance goes to a surprising new place. Well comparing to ""A Walk to remember"", ""Now is Good"", ""Safe Heaven"" and other Cancer survival movies, They all are pretty much the same. The grief at the end, Make us viewers cry.

My Inspiration,"the book made me cry and i am watching the movie tomorrow,my friends say they were sobbing, and the book made me cry and i really want to see this movie, the book is an inspiration, because hazel knows who she is, and she knows what might happen to her in a matter of time,but she never lets it stop her, she doesn't let anything stop her, she is basically fearless, because knowing what will happen to her eventually, she cares more about other things and other people this book is the reason i need to do what i want to do, and I'm not going to let anything stop me, just like hazel doesn't let anything stop her. Hazel lets Augustus into her life, knowing the consequences and knowing its not the best idea, but she does it anyway, fearless, hazel is a fictional character, but she could never be more real, her personality is real, her personality is as real as it can be, real means fearless, or strong enough to get over your fear thank you John Green",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Film You Need to See,"As someone who loves books and reading, I'm not sure whether I should be excited or worried when a book gets made into a movie. Sometimes the movies don't live up to the fans' of the books expectations and never does the book the justice that it deserves. When you're reading you create a picture of what you think the characters and scenes in the book should look like and when you see it on screen you can either be disappointed or happy with how it turned out.I'm always bad at describing movies to others because how do you say The Fault in Our Stars is a romantic comedy about two teenagers who have cancer fall in love without it sounding like it could be another sappy love story? But, the truth is, The Fault in Our Stars really isn't another sappy love story at all. This is the type of book/movie that will make you want to read/watch it over and over again and share with as many people as you can so they can enjoy it as much as you did.Not to my surprise, this movie was wonderful. The movie completely did the book justice and followed it in the way I thought it would. I was happy to find that many of my favorite quotes from the book were included in the movie. I definitely cried while reading this book, so I was prepared when I saw the movie. But, being prepared really didn't help in the end, considering the fact that I was almost crying before the movie actually started.Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort had amazing chemistry throughout the movie and I really believed that they were Hazel and Augustus. My favorite kind of movies are the ones that make you just sit there and think about them after they have ended. This was one of them. To me, this isn't a movie that you watch then continue on with your day. This is the kind of movie/book that will stick with you for a very long time and you will come back and think about it over and over again.Even though I would recommend on reading the book first, this is a truly beautiful film that will make you laugh and break your heart at the same time, and you will still love it.""I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.""",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

I wasn't ready for this,"Tonight I watched ""The Fault In Our Stars"". I wasn't ready. Not even close. After pacing through my room for about an hour, I decided to try and write down my thoughts, as scattered as they may be. So here is the weirdest review ever written on IMDb.The thing with over-romanticizing is that it leaves you with doubts. If I can't be like Hazel and Gus, love like them, then what's the point? And I know I can't be like them. My semi-egocentric brain isn't capable of loving that deeply, that profoundly and unselfishly. They share a connection so beautiful, I'll never have that.In order to not just give up on love, I have to remind myself that no one is capable of loving like Hazel and Gus. They are fictional characters. Their actions and emotions are exaggerated, in order to make the audience more invested. Too invested, in this case, because I now have to constantly tell myself that they aren't real. Their love isn't real, and I will find love and happiness in my own, real, way.At this point, many of you will think 'how is this ever a review?' and many more will have stopped reading already. But consider this: if a movie gets a 33 year old man this emotionally invested, how good will it be?",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Lidewij, Play Bomfalleralla","First of all, I'm sorry I watched it pretty late.I don't think most of us have had the heart, and the courage, to see what this really was. No, this was not an over-sentimental, full-of-tears-and-sadness drama. It wasn't even a pure insight into the lives of the afflicted. It wasn't even an adaptation of Green's novel. It was only the pinching, romantic and delicate imagery I've always had from listening to Wait (M83) and its Kygo remix. By the way I'm not adulterating my every-day's empirical observations and imaginations for the sake of this review. Check my SoundCloud account if you've any suspicions. For those of you who actually did, see? I don't lie. Neither does my review.So that's the bottom-line: If Wait wasn't in the movie, this might have been six star movie for me. But because Wait is used, and in the exact places as it should have been, I'll give a maximum, not that anybody gives a cuss, but then see, the movie isn't made for getting cusses. It's made for ""assimilators"" (not a word) like me, who desperately long for content that actually is an honest-to-god discernment of what some lives may be like, and those lives may not be notably similar. I mean I don't have cancer, but something relatable to it.By the way Willem Dafoe was the best of all of them. The scene where he is first shown is absolutely beautiful, and really adds to the ""8"" I've given. His character of Gus Van Houden could not have been exploited the way Willem did. I mean the guy's a natural. He looked a sociopath, and intellectually overdosed freak. And when he said, ""Lidewij, play Bomfalleralla,"" ah man, I was practically hoping with the song that followed. The production is of course by Alfasy & Filthy, but its usage here in Th Fault in Our Stars provided it the vigor and intensity. Gus Van Houden was a total mess, and that messiness is what I like. Irregular is the new regular.John Green's work reached its visualization, and I am not disappointed. It was good, and stick-able because of its eventual sentimentalism, which is the case with most viewers. But with that, I think Green's original work had much more maturity, grip with situation, and smoothness. Everything was too amateurish in the movie, and looked more like a college-typo. Anyways, worked for me; I rarely look for beyond-the-general-standard product when it comes to romance.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Hazel tells him she would not trade their short time together for anything, since he ""gave me a forever within the numbered days.""Augustus dies eight days later. At his funeral, Hazel is astonished to find Van Houten in attendance. He tells her he maintained correspondence with Augustus after Amsterdam and that Augustus had demanded he attend his funeral to make up for the spoiled trip. He then tells Hazel that his novel is based on the experiences of his daughter Anna, who died from leukemia at a young age. Van Houten tries to tell Hazel about the fate of Anna's mother; he gives Hazel a piece of paper. Hazel, still upset with his behavior in Amsterdam, crumples up the paper and asks him to leave. Later, talking with Isaac, Hazel learns that Augustus had asked Van Houten to help him write a eulogy for her. She retrieves the crumpled paper and reads Augustus' words, which state his acceptance of death and his love for Hazel. Hazel lies on her back on her lawn looking up at the stars, smiling as she remembers Augustus and says ""Okay"".It's moving and very meaning you should watch it =))",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hollywood capitalizes on another YA novel,"Hollywood capitalizes on a young adult bestseller and doles out the usual drivel in the hopes of a blockbuster.Not to say that The Fault in Our Stars is drivel, per se, but it lacks the magic and emotion that is captured in John Green's acclaimed young adult novel. I read the book awhile back, and while I had minor issues with the plot, it resonated with me because of this tragic but tender love story.Time to tears: Book – last 90 pages (Don't judge me!) Movie –fleetingly at 1hour 53 minutes (I'm not a monster!)The movie followed the book to the letter, but is vastly ineffectual.The screenplay is lazy and a bad adaptation; writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber did not take the time to translate Green's writing for the screen.The directing by Josh Boone was unimaginative and literal; reverting to lame voiceovers and text bubbles instead of good structure from the screenplay for workable content and acting.Both writers and director seem inexperienced beginners earning their stripes with this film.The acting was not great and the main characters were miscast. I can see why Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort were cast as Hazel and Gus respectively; they were able to pull of the emotional scenes near the end. Lacking was the charm for the entirety of the rest of the film. Woodley is basically a happily bewildered toothy smile while Elgort is overconfident and decidedly not charismatic.I did think Willem Dafoe's casting was spot on and found Nat Wolff to be underutilized as Gus's best friend.This film was a higher budgeted version of some hybrid Disney-Hallmark made for TV-movie trying to be more. Frankly, I am a bit offended at how juvenile the final product seems as the film version was not smart and belittling to readers of The Fault in Our Stars. Yes, it is an adaptation of young adult book about teens finding love while being deemed 'cancer patients' but it didn't need to be this horrible cheese-fest!More film reviews at our website.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Should Be Multiple Oscar Nominations Here,"Shailene Woodley is 2014's Jennifer Lawrence. The Fault In Our Stars is magnificent. Great writing, wonderful direction, marvelous editing and Shailene Woodley.The only question is - will the Oscar nominators remember her performance in a mid year release film?Who is Ansel Elgort? A young, new actor who, hopefully, will not be a one hit wonder - wonderful facial expressions added so much to the film and his smile is infectious.I must ward you that this is a tear jerker - not just at the end; but, throughout the film. The emotion builds throughout the film and the soundtrack had competition from the sniffling and nose blowing pervasive throughout the theater from about the halfway point on.Definitely a must see film for 2014 and years to come!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Extremely sad and beautiful,"I read the book 'the fault in our stars' within the span of 2 days in middle school. I Enjoy the overall plot of the story, but I can't stand the fact John Green made it out as a more romantic storyline and that everyone plays it out to be a 'cancer story'. Now sure I will admit, some things are strongly cancer related, and I know most of the main characters have cancer. But I was going in as a person expecting it to be like 'Blue by Joyce Moyer Hostetter' and came out crying as it was more like an ironically more sad version of 'the hunger Games by Suzanne Collins'. Now, honestly, I loved this story, it caused me to feel an overwhelming amount of depression for a couple of days after reading it, and I honestly can say it has changed my life. It's made me respect the beauty of everything around me, so unless you want to change, I doubt you'll like not only this book, but the movie.
I have to (out of respect) remain quite about the sudden death of someone very important, but have to admit the part where she/he said, ""I lit up like a Christmas tree"" I cried. I've thought the plot of this story more than once over the duration of the past few days (since I've finished it) and I will say, there is no other plausible route for these characters to go other than down. At the beginning they were some-what normal, now their more than just depressed, they are conscious of their insurmountable feelings.
I would suggest this to hopeless romantics, and overall sad and depressed people.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Shocked.,"I am not a guy who cries easily with a movie. That's not my style. I am not trying to sound tough, but that's the truth. I remember I only cried with ""Gladiator"" (when I was 12).

To be honest, my girlfriend wanted to see this one so I said ""Okay, lets see it, to have some fun"". What I found? I found a very, very emotional love story between two teenagers with cancer.The love story between Hazel and Gus will catch you and will never let you go even if you don't like these types of movies. I even want to see this movie again and again!Talking about acting, it was so amazing! I really liked Ansel Elgort's work on this film. I see a new Hollywood star right here.Okay so, this is a movie for everyone. No age limits. Deserves 8,5 + in my opinion.My vote 10 out of 10. Great film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
For the fan followers and everyone else too,"First and foremost, for those die hard fans out there the film does a great job of following the book. Is it just me or are filmmakers finally understanding that fan viewers really like to see the story they read visually portrayed? With that though does come some downfalls. I loved the fact that the story swayed very little from the book. But because it did so, I think the film lost some of its magic. It was less of an emotional journey as in the book readers were in the first person narrative of Hazel Grace, in the film not as much. Not just that, but there were definitely some 'pleaser lines' if you will. That is, the well-adored quotes from the book are loud and clear throughout the film, almost as if picking out the popular items from the novel and using them as items in the storyline to help sell it to the audience. It felt somewhat disconnected to me, like the story existed to tell these insights. I understand the audience will love it, but I didn't think these insights were delivered with the personality the book intended. I was surprised that the title line, the quote that identifies the reasoning behind the popular title, was left out. Unless I just missed it?As for the casting, Woodley and Elgort delivered the personalities of Hazel and Augustus perfectly. Woodley had the cool and distant demeanor and Elgort did a particularly good job with his facial expressions, which were slight but delivered quite the blow. These two are going to become headlining actors after their performance in Divergent and now The Fault in Our Stars. Personally, I think both Woodley and Elgort were more suited to the roles of Hazel and Augustus than they were meant for Tris and Caleb in Divergent.During the film I was most looking forward to the confrontation between Peter Van Houten and Hazel and Gus. This scene was very good! Even though Peter wasn't quite as I expected him, William DeFoe portrayed the actor with ideas I actually liked better than I originally imagined him. The scene followed as expected, but again, lost its touch of magic as we were outside Hazel's thoughts and certain things, such as Peter's assistant and the Swedish rap music, seemed underdeveloped in comparison to the novel.The scene I was most impressed with actually followed the author confrontation scene. When Hazel, Gus, and Lidewij went to Anne Frank's house. Whoa! the symbolism here and Hazel's stubbornness were more dominant than what I remembered in the book. At one point the symbolism became a touch overdone, but I suppose the whole thing suited the taste of the film, following the major ideals and metaphor's of the book. Hazel's comparison to Anne Frank and their two stories, two struggles met in that house. I was impressed with the interpretations in this scene.Even though I continue to say the film had less magic than the book, I understand that novel and film are two completely different mediums with two completely different ways of presenting a story. While I was grateful for the filmmakers to keep the story so close to its original script, John Green's book, I admit I wished to see a touch more interpretation. It's one thing to make the characters move and say the same things as they do in the novel, but another to make the audience feel the same way about them. Josh Boone really did a superb job directing this film, but as usual, the novel holds more emotional impact than the film was able to deliver. Of course, I still shed a tear or two. It is an emotional story after all.As for the elements of film, I'm much less educated to this aspect. However, I was constantly impressed with the costumes of all the characters. Isaac's character probably surprised me the most, but it was a pleasant surprise as I realized I hadn't spent too much time creating Isaac as a character while I read. Hazel's loose, somewhat baggy, clothes suited a cancer-ridden frame of a sick child. She wore simple tees in basic, not-too-loud colors that suited her 'whatever', careful- not-to-get-too-close to anyone attitude. And Augustus wore that brown, leather jacket like a hero. It suited his athletic build – a shadow to his life before cancer, but it also reminded me of a fighter pilot, a motorcyclist, or some other action figure that perfectly suited Augustus's consistent desire for heroism.While I know little about the mechanics of film, other than operating a few digital projectors at work, I really enjoyed the way this film was shot. The scenes didn't hover around the characters, but made them part of a larger picture. The images were sometimes blurred and bright – beautiful, simple, yet artistic. I don't always notice the cinematography (I hope that is the right word), but the way The Fault in Our Stars was filmed seemed another artistic filter for the story directly. It is how Hazel and Gus would have imagined it, I believe.Also, the soundtrack was. amazing. There are probably about thirty seconds of film that I entirely missed (is that Ray Lamontagne? It is, I'm sure of it. Oooh! I haven't heard this song before – and so on). Again, the soundtrack was another artistic element that persuaded the film to be a touch more of John Green's beloved novel.The Fault in Our Stars is a film that will please audiences whether they are John Green fans or not. It is emotional, but happy as well. You shouldn't leave sad and you won't cry uncontrollably so its probably okay for a date night movie.For more, please see my original review on my blog, Rawr is for Reading - and check out other Book to Box Office Reviews",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Oblivion is inevitable and it's true,"When I was 17 years old, I watched The Fault in Our Stars for the first and only time. It was a remarkable experience filled with joy, tears, thoughts, fear, love, and LIFE. And yes, it's THE movie, my favorite of all time. After almost 9 years, I decided to rewatch it again, and to be honest, I was a little bit afraid that my opinion on it would change considering my age and how I've come to understand things.All that vanished away the moment I started the movie again, and I remembered why I loved that movie all over again. The story of Hazel wasn't unique or special; I have watched so many movies taking the protagonist ill like they are a superhero fighting life, but Hazel was a teenager who is afraid of dying, of the pain that it would cause her family. The plot doesn't stop only on Hazel but shows the point of view of her mother and how cancer patients affect the people around them.Hazel said, ""The only thing worse than biting it from cancer is having a kid bite it from cancer."" This quote is enough to reveal to us how dangerous this would be, but also how pain is part of life and the importance of knowing how to live with it. Not just that, but you can see it from another perspective, that cancer is a chance to appreciate your life. So many people live a lifetime full of nothing. But Gus lived knowing what he really wanted even at a young age, so did Hazel.So many life lessons you can take from this story, but mostly for me, it's that life is limited, with cancer or without, and it does not matter if you get what you really want but you need to enjoy what you've had. Hazel wanted to visit Peter Van Houten, her favorite writer, but eventually, he was a bad person and wasn't worth the trip, even though she enjoyed her time with Gus and made her trip worthwhile. We all hear that you need to live your life like it's your last day. It was embodied when Hazel spoke about The Last Good Day concept and how you never know if it's your last.This movie is full of life meanings. When I watched it for the first time as a teenager, I felt sad, I cried a lot, but now I felt like fire in my chest and my heart was dancing when I saw Hazel and Gus enjoying their lives even with what is really going on in it. I am not going to lie, I dropped some tears of sadness at some moments, which is what really life is all about, but it is OKAY.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Could change the way films address people with challenges and differences,"The cure for cancer is still an exhausting search, but the cure for bad movies about cancer has finally taken affect. A few years ago, Jonathan Levine's ""50/50"" changed the portrayal of and dialogue about cancer in movies. Fast-forward to 2014 and the TV show ""Red Band Society"" and this film adaptation of John Green's ""The Fault in Our Stars"" are normalizing cancer in teenagers. It's a weird trend to highlight, but if Hollywood can start treating other ""taboo"" subjects the same way, there's hope for film as a meaningful teaching tool yet.""The Fault in Our Stars"" begins by essentially scoffing at picture-perfect love stories. Its narrator, Hazel (Shailene Woodley), a Stage IV thyroid cancer survivor not even 20 years old, warns us that this story will not have a happy ending. She's right, but that said, you won't be blindsided by some Nicholas Sparks tearjerker move either.Hazel doesn't know her timeline, but she knows her cancer is terminal. She carries an oxygen tank with her everywhere she goes, including a support group that she only attends to keep her mother (Laura Dern) and father (Sam Trammell) happy. But it's there, ironically, where she meets Augustus, or Gus, (Ansel Elgort), an osteosarcoma survivor with a prosthetic leg and an impressively positive yet realistic attitude about life. Both of them witty, sharp and sarcastic, Hazel and Gus become fast friends and their romance grows in spite of Hazel's best intentions to avoid falling in love.There's a terrific sense of humor and approach to cancer in this script that even makes ""50/50"" seem dated. The characters are not defined by their illnesses but by their attitudes toward life, the way they cope with the ups and downs. Hazel and Gus are surprisingly mature for their age, partly because they're written so well but also because they've been through a lot and ripened at a young age. They still feel like teenagers though, and that's key.Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, writers of the outstanding ""(500) Days of Summer"" and ""The Spectacular Now"" nail it again with the chemistry between Hazel and Gus. Obviously much credit belongs to Woodley and Elgort, but these writers know how to craft real, authentic dialogue. They so effortlessly evoke our own memories of love and life's challenges at a young age in addition to creating compelling drama.They've also got modern teenage relationships down pat. There's just enough use of phones here to make texting a meaningful component of Hazel and Gus's relationship, but not so much that the movie is overbearingly ""contemporary."" Director Josh Boone handles these scenes delicately and in a way that's true to those who have experienced romance develop through text. But anyway, these characters are in the business of making real connections; after all, they've been through more hardship than a majority of kids their age.The movie is the story of their relationship, which doesn't become a romance for them as quickly as it does in the audience's mind. Trained to know in movies when two people should fall in love, we are conditioned to look for a first kiss scene well before it happens in this movie, which reflects the inherent, largely unspoken challenges of Hazel and Gus's relationship. As much as teens will gravitate toward this film, it's the adults — who know the heartbreak, who know what teenage romance is like, who would likely tell these two to be cautious — that will most appreciate the story's attitude toward love and relationships. In a lot of ways, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" could be a great film for teens and their parents to begin to have conversations about these things.Even though the opening narration insists that the story won't sugarcoat anything, it doesn't mean it's free of melodramatic twists that ratchet the drama and sadness up to 10. The approach to scene work and dialogue and characters is more authentic, but the plot doesn't exactly follow suit. In the story's defense, however, we'd have a very boring film on our hands without something to really challenge these characters. Even if you might argue their lives have been challenging enough, it's still a movie.Thematic richness is another strength of ""The Fault in Our Stars."" It's an emotionally deep and resonant film just in the way it handles cancer, but it also presents difficult concepts and subplots that even further inform the core story. When Gus uses his ""Make-a-Wish"" to take Hazel to Amsterdam to meet with the author of her favorite book, this seemingly tangential segment in their larger journey brings a surprising number of new layers and ideas to the story, including the author's unexpected reaction and a visit to the Anne Frank House.""The Fault in Our Stars"" is one of the films changing the way we look at major issues. There's nothing politically charged about cancer, but films wanting to approach anything from race to sexual orientation could certainly adopt some of the techniques here to approach those issues in authentic ways. Teaching tool or not, it's still a quality coming-of-age story right next to ""The Perks of Being A Wallflower.""~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Soi..So BAD,I don't usually write movie reviews but this one just had me waste the time to do so. How in God's name can this be rated over 8? The movie is so full of clichés that it had me gasping for air much like the female star.I can't understand how they could take such an emotional subject as the love story between two terminally ill teenagers and DRAIN it of all emotion. The movie is so predictable it is scary and beyond that it fails to make you as a viewer care for their fate at all.Unrealistic pretentious and without substance but hey...it's about kids with cancer of course we are going to sing it's praises.

The suspension of disbelieve kicks in early and you are transported to the world of Hazel and Gus hopelessly. I am one of those who has read the book and I had great expectations from the movie. I was a relieved man that the movie did justice to my imagination.There are few reasons why the viewer will watch the movie till the end. One, it's smart. The conversations between Hazel, the optimist who wants to leave a mark in the world and Hazel, the pessimist who believes that everything finally ends in an oblivion has the right formula for some very fresh rhetoric.Two, even if it'a pathetically sad movie, the characters who are suffering in it do not indulge in self pity. They are unabashed about their illness and they also find room for humor.Three, it has a positive message saying that life is made out of small and big infinities. Hazel is grateful to Gus for giving her their small infinity. So life is not about the number of years one lives but the number of infinities that one lives within it.I would give this movie a ten but I guess I am saving it for later...",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"So, what was an Imperial Affliction?","The Fault In Our Stars is a love story about a teenage cancer girl (Hazel Grace) and a survivor of cancer boy with one leg (Augustus Water), and a sequence of drama surrounding their families and friends from a cancer community group. I usually don't read books or watch films in which I could guess the story is going to be a sad ending. I like John Green, a famous author of young adult books, and read a couple of his books including ""Paper Town"" and ""An Abundance of Katherines."" I bought this book when I took a few pages at a book store.The story is unexpected in a good way with a sprinkle of the author's jokes and humors through the characters, and it's no just a cancer girl story who has a miserable and painful life with supporting family and friends. One of the things I like about the story is that Hazel and Augustus get to know each other through her favorite book, An Imperial Affliction, written by Peter Van Houten. The vague ending of the book has caught her for years to eager to ask questions to the author, and that makes the two teens fly to Amsterdam to meet the author. It's very dramatic and exciting scenes in that a story is created in places from two countries, as well as it makes the handicapped characters overcome the difficulties of traveling for their dream.The whole story about An Imperial Affliction never described, but quotations from the book leave footprint stunningly, seemingly that that casts a meaning of life through conversations between Hazel and Augustus. While the story of An imperial Affliction sounds epic, Van Houten's quirky and socially twisted personality disappoints the two teems. But the trip in Amsterdam builds their bond more tightly, and the story is going to be a moving ending.This is not entirely a sad story, but it involves with sadness and heartbreak towards the characters.

"Superficial and dull, despite the topic","Superficial and dull, despite the topic.A story of a relationship between two teens who both have terminal cancer. Should be an engaging and emotional tale, but is strangely empty. Just feels like a paint-by-numbers midday TV movie, complete with one-dimensional, stereotypical characters and Disney-like lack of grittiness.Had potential initially, but quickly just fell into a pattern of silly sub-plots and style over substance. Ultimately doesn't go anywhere new and ends quite predictably, and inevitably.Has its moments though, and poses some questions regarding life and death.Good performance by Shailene Woodley. She is one of the few bright lights in the movie. Ansel Elgort overacts and is irritating. Similarly, Laura Dern. Willem Dafoe provides the only touch of edginess in the movie, but his performance feels a bit forced.Really a death and faux emotion movie for teenagers.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

A breadth of life,"I want to enter just the words I will keep with me from that film.. A metaphor is what keeps us going, we should care less for oblivion, we should enjoy a days-long eternity, we should daily force hope to be live everywhere inside us. There are no untold stories or unspeakable fate. We 're just experiencing our lifetime scenario. See that great film and you can decipher those words' meaning..... This is a real breadth of life even when the 'expiration' date is reaching out. I haven't read the book yet, I started from the opposite side, watching the film. From the technical viewpoint, is a well directed story keeping up the limits to avoid sadness overflow. The actors were excellent",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Disappointing if you've read the book,"Despite it being a cute movie, whenever I read a book first, the movie falls short. In the book, Augustus is a charming and seriously witty guy....and his relationship with Isaac is hilarious. The movie leaves out some of the most clever lines and replaces it with...nothing. It's not a terrible movie, but I think the script was a little flat and missed the essence of the characters described in the book. I feel like they just blew through the entire movie too quickly, like they were trying to cram it all in. If there was too much in the novel to make a movie, they should have picked some of the key scenes and developed the story around that rather than barely scratch the surface.

Favourite book adaption to date!,"I am an avid book reader and I'm always skeptical about watching movie adaptions because they never really seem to do the book justice.The Fault in Our Stars, on the other hand, was an incredibly poignant and inspiring movie that did the novel every bit of justice it deserved. The director was able to make the right moments incredibly sad (to the point of tears) other parts witty and funny without effecting the overall mood of the movie.As a viewer, you are able to develop a deep connection to the characters and feel their emotions as though you're on the journey with them.

Touching but sad love story,"It's about this beautiful girl with a terminal illness falling in love with a guy who survived the same..or is it? The story winds around their quest to meet the author of their favorite book and how their love becomes stronger over time. Hazel, played by Shailene Woodley, gives an inspirational performance which I think was done marvelously and way better than Ansel Elgort who plays the role of Gus. The movie runs for more than two hours but you hardly feel it due to the emotions flowing around. It's a beautiful movie just like the Nicholas Sparks stories that we instantly fall in love with.

Painfully smug.,"Now when a film tells you it's more honest than other films you can tell it's full of crap. Just because it has a morbid premise doesn't make it anymore real than the rest of the teenage melodrama. The Fault In Our Stars is painfully smug as it relishes in its idiotic quirks. Each one deserves a ferocious eye roll. Its Manic Pixie Dream Boy Ansel Elgort encapsulates everything wrong with its smarminess, contrivances and pretence. Thank god the film got bored of him by the second half. And we're trapped with these two characters, only offering us a Laura Dern or Willem Dafoe to look at occasionally. I quite like its fantasies and it has a few decent moments where actual obstacles confront the characters without the film opting for easy solutions. But they're swiftly ruined by baffling decisions such as having an audience clap for their kiss in Anne Frank's house. When it isn't schmaltzy, the film revels in its trivialities and indiscernible philosophies. Shailene Woodley's conviction of the trite material is decent, but the film has such an ugly production that there's little to redeem it above mediocrity.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A tale worthy of viewing.,"This film, was touching and beautiful, but nevertheless, it failed greatly at times, which is exactly why this picture is slightly overrated. In favor of the film we had great performances by the lead actors, and a rather good performance by Willem Dafoe, but poor performances from almost every other actor/actress. We had a beautiful and emotional story that explores a classic love tale, it was directed nicely and the music was decent. But the script suffered greatly from unrealistic plot points, cringe and unbelievable dialogue, the character of Gus didn't have much realism. So the writing in general wasn't anything exceptional. In terms of directing, i thought the rhythm was terrible at times. The cinematography was alright, not bad but it didn't do much (if anything at all) in terms of visual story telling through composition and such. With that being said, it is a very beautiful story with very beautiful people that was told in a beautiful way, and it is definitely an experience to enjoy, it is not a cinematic score, therefore do not expect much from it if you are looking for a rather cinematic experience, but trust me bro, its not Twilight, :)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Thumbs Up for Shailene and Ansel,"Confession is, I am the book lover, and I expect highly from this film, even after countless disappointment of other adaptations. I even forgot to compare it to the book while watching it. So, trust me, if you have the understanding of movie and book are two different things to tell a story, you would come to appreciate the effort the team put into this movie.One flaw though, is that there is nothing particularly new in this movie. Basically the team have done a good job of creating an extension of the book, but there is no new exploration in there. The movie is amazing because the book itself, and the story, is unbelievably good.Shailene and Ansel stunning performance remind me of Gus and Hazel every single second. This movie is a quick way to get access to the story and it does an amazing job, but I still prefer the book myself, with nothing against the movie and I truly love it.10/10 rating is base on my love to the story John Green gives me, more than any things else.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Powerful,"The Fault in our Stars (or Tfios), is a faithful adaptation of the book by John Green. Green was inspired to write the book after working in a hospital setting with sick children and young adults, when he was contemplating being a chaplain.Tfios, like the book, shows cancer patients as your everyday person, not as just victims of misfortune. This movie had two strong lead actors portraying Augustus and Hazel.The actress who played Hazel's performance is especially memorable.Though the third act dragged (as some critics agrees) a little, it was so minimal. At no point during the 2 hours+ length was this movie dull. The movie has enough comedic touches to give a delightful viewing, with also a lot of highly emotionally-charged scenes. It really shows a realistic inside view of people who live their lives with a ""foot in the grave"".The love story is central. It is really incredible that these situation surely happens in real life; where two people with highly limited life spans find each other and are meant for each other, as compared to people that are healthy and live a long time that may never find or appreciate that kind of love.The movie is powerful. It is hard not to be emotionally affected, and moved by it. I highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The actors themselves were very believable and had shown really clearly what its like to suffer with a terminal illness.The soundtracks used display the emotion of the scenes perfectly.

Agony of Star-crossed Lovers......,"The film has gained a lot of popularity among the young audiences. The reason is obvious, the agony of young star crossed lovers depicted through few emotional sequences. To be fair, the film doesn't create the flair of a nice melodrama. Perhaps due to lack of a better script, the characters somewhat don't appear sympathetic which they ought to be. However in certain instances, the film does work; and particularly, the performance of heroine overshadows the hero's role, which unfortunately doesn't look very natural. Nowhere the signs of disability or the affliction appears in the hero's character. The biggest flaw in the script of the film was its failure to depict the dreadfulness of the cancer they are ongoing which makes the film appear not more than a feel good time passer. The affliction of the disease and their scorn or desire with life doesn't just come in this teenage romance. Only the sequence shot in Anne Frank's museum catches the agony of the protagonist.Rating: 1.5 stars out of 4",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

The movie is great for several reasons: it is a simple love story that occurs in an unexpected scenario, and emerges as the true stories of real love, where that are, with only look, feel they are known to always come up. I say it's the Love story of 2014 because it reminded me of Love Story with Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Oneill (1970), a story of tragic love like this and it was all a success in those days. Elgort and Woodley performances was very good for a drama. I like a lot of the naturalness of both. With a budget that is a fraction of the budget of dozens of movies that are made every year, I seem to manage to create the perfect environment to frame the story.

Despite small detail differences(wasn't Monica's car pink in the book?), the movie follows the book's path. Go out and watch this, you won't regret it.

This movie is beautiful because you can see the true meaning of what I'm sure John Green intended the book to show: ""The world is not a wish-granting factory"", ""Pain demands to be felt"", and ""Some infinities are better than other infinities"". And if you haven't read the book and are planning to go see the movie, it's still worth it.

A poignant and heart-affecting love story about two teenagers with cancer squaring off against death.,"Most love stories end with 'and they lived happily ever after'. But what happens when you may not live another day? Will you still fall in love, knowing your time is limited?
The Fault in our stars Stays faithful to the book. What you see is what you get. When a practical Hazel (Shailene Woodley) meets the charming and cheerful Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort) at a cancer support group, sparks fly. He fears oblivion, while she believes it's inevitable. In his company, she discovers there's a world beyond hospitals, medication, pain and cancer. Their shared passion for books, common fears, and heartfelt talks make the two inseparable, until death comes knocking...
If you like feel-good, escapist films, this one's not for you. The Fault in Our Stars is one of the most unpretentious tragic love stories told in a heart-warming manner. 'Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened' pretty much sums up the story.
Earnest performances lend depth to the characters, making them come alive. Shailene Woodley is brilliantly melancholic while Ansel Elgort displays the complexities of his character with great maturity. The film is not about crying over what you may lose, but learning to live with what you do. After all, it's not the fear of death that makes you bitter, lack of love does.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sometimes I had this weird feeling that it is all too beautiful to be true bla bla bla but, you forget about it really quickly when the current of the great story carries you off.The movie is forcing you to think about lots of things... especially about appreciating what you have got... and teaching you to attain the best of it.""The Fault in Our Stars"" is the kind of movie you can watch with everyone. It is perfect to watch: with your girlfriend, wife, family etc.There is one thing about it though, watch it only with someone with whom you don't mind seeing you crying, otherwise you might go to a toilet awfully a lot... if you know what I mean...""If you want the rainbow, you have to deal with the rain."" - Gustgchan's rating: 9.5 /10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Cried but in a good way!,"I have looked after young people who face death from cancer. This film adaption of a much loved book deals very honestly but sympathetically with these themes. Went with my daughter, who is not much older than the main characters portrayed in the film. A lot of my emotion came from realising again how I need to value our relationship in the present, as you never know what is coming. Was very funny in parts and the leads played this strongly all the way through, really believed in them as people. Have thought about it quite a bit afterwards, which is always a mark of a good film for me.Some of the character development was really well judged, the guy leading the support group appeared to be a stereotype but then a later scene shows his ability to cut to the heart of an issue.I thought the parents were not very well developed, particularly Gus's parents but the film was already long enough and focusing on the leads was probably the right choice.We went on a 'habit breaker', just turning up and seeing what was next on at our local cinema. I think on any other night we might have seen something else, so a good idea if you have not tried it!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

As it had everything I like in movies: a deep soul, humanity, warmth, but also funny moments. For me Ansel Elgort is absolutely outstanding in his performance, that he could become one of my favourite actors. There are few actors that in my opinion are capable of such intensity. Shailaine Woodley is also great. Wish Hollywood would deliver more of this kind of movies rather than some action stuff.

Searching for my Hazel Grace,"This is my first review and very well my last, as I find that time could be spent in many more meaningful ways. That said I felt compelled to give kudos where they are due and when a story grips you like this one does its worth a few minutes to reflect even to yourself.I know there have been many great love stories told throughout hollowed halls of time past but this one must be included in mention of the greats. I normally will reject plots that I can see coming but with this story it was journey of getting there that made it suffer-able.Two more quick points as this is one I would highly recommend for my friends that are softhearted enough to admit as guys we enjoy a good love story as much as the girls do (now and then). I must say the character build up was very well done and acting on both sides was phenomenal and worthy of award consideration my issue is with the bigger picture of how a story like this could very easily have had a deeper meaning.This was done on a strictly naturalistic level and the lack of ""God"" is very depressing because truth is so very taboo on the silver screen. My wish of course would have painted them finding true joy and coming to the Lord but that is my wish for all major movies so I guess outside of that I couldn't have asked for a better film.A MUST SEE AND WORTH WATCHING AGAIN.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Really difficult not to love it,"I don't really know why I add to seven hundred and something comments. I don't think anybody but the very passionate for this movie will read it. Probably because it made a difference.Being in the movie category of: 'Doesn't matter for how long you live, but how you live"", artistically conceived and beautifully played, this movie surpasses the ""Five feet away"" one. To quote Shailene: ""Not too many had in their full life what we had in a few weeks"" was the main theme of the movie. As ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" continues to teach generations about the importance of living every second of whatever is being given to us, this movie does the same from adolescents' point of view. And it does it beautifully. I strongly recommend it for all those who accept to be reminded about the sense of living.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

top 1%,"I just want to add I have never actually read the book because films appeal more to me. I am also a male and I felt the almighty feels.When I first heard about this film I shrugged it off as one of them ""not as good as you say it is movie"" oh how I was wrong.I really felt for Hazel in the last part of the film you could easily make a connection with her feelings even though she was trying to act strong and put on a brave face it was amazing the acting skills of this woman are amazing and all credits to her.Now Augustus the wise cracking 18 year old who brought the comedy the this wonder of a film. The way he could make the bad things seem good by adding a joke or being sarcastic really help lighten the mood of this feel his attitude in this made me think of my favourite quote of all time.The storyline was amazing but sadly a little bit predictable what is like most films in this genera but that was its only fault wink wink. The way this was edited was amazing the clean cuts the perfectly placed music added to the atmosphere and overall experience of this first class masterpiece not many films like this make it to my top 1% and this one will take a long time to get knock off I would like to leave you with a quote that sums up this film to me in a paragraph.The longer I live, the more I realise the impact of attitude on life. Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, the education, the money, than circumstances, than failure, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness or skill. It will make or break a company...a church...a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past...we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude. I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how I react to it. And so it is with you. We are in charge of our attitudes.LC",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Fault in My Stars to Watch it,"Seriously, I'm upset after watching this movie. It's so not for me. It's just so painful and boring that I can't sympathize with the characters for some reason.The writer just tried to make a romantic story based on pain and sickness. It doesn't work that way. Even if there are specific cases where this can be true. It's still no where near truth. So, I'd say that the creators of this work were trying hard. I din't even feel the need to cry once, and I'm a man. One should never heed to recommendations from strangers. To each their own as they say. I'd classify this as non-romantic one. Seriously! No romance in this movie but pain.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why? No spoilers just facts,"I gave this 2 stars. One for Laura Dern and one for Willem Dafoe. This movie is terribly written kind of like the book. It reads like a bad book by John green. Not only was the premise absurd and offensive, but the characters were 2 dimensional at best. Laura dern deserves compensation for the bland simpleton of a character she was forced to work with. Willem dafoe is such a good actor that I actually found myself captivated by his character despite how hamhanded Green wrote his character. Willem forever! <3 The only saving grace of this movie is the fact that is is going to be forgotten much like Augustus is afraid of. But I can't neglect to mention something in this movie that made my body recoil and my soul leave my body (in a bad way). The Anne Frank annex scene. How dare you John? How dare you diminish Anne Frank's suffering and have these horny teens to kiss where she hid in a cupboard from Nazis. Tasteless. This was so offensive I actually forgot where I was and who I am. And I still don't know. And not only this, but everyone claps? When they kiss? So disrespectful. No one who has been to a Holocaust museum would ever feel like kissing someone, but rather disgusted and sad for the victims of the Holocaust. I am still baffled that this was put to paper and then the big screen. RIP my happiness.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Fault in Author Stroking Own Ego,"Based on a book about a girl's dying wish of meeting the author of her favorite book, it doesn't get much more self-serving than ""The Fault in Our Stars,"" a tedious, young-adult fiction tear-jerker concerning a romance between two cancer kids in addition to the annoying author. I viewed this Hollywood adaptation after seeing the Bollywood version, ""Dil Bechara,"" for which I now have a greater appreciation in comparing it to its American counterpart. The Indian movie replaces the book-within-a-book with an unfinished song (Bollywood's reputed fondness for lousy tunes proving true again), but more importantly it adds a cinematically reflexive layer by adding a film-within-the-film and equating the story's fatalistic narrative with cinema itself. Now that's a metaphor--a much more interesting one than that stupid unlit cigarette. Albeit, the rest of ""Dil Bechara"" is melodramatic drivel just as with ""The Fault in Our Stars,"" but at least there was the skeleton of a compelling idea there and not merely a couple trips to Funky Bones park and a revolting make-out session at the Anne Frank House.The one thing ""The Fault in Our Stars"" does better is story continuity, but that's just the stupid soap opera junk. Weepy histrionics with a message of living life to its fullest but that doesn't itself enrich lives. A book about an obnoxious author who doesn't have anything substantial to offer. Veteran actors Laura Dern and Willem Dafoe are wasted.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Wasted Opportunity,"This was the director's first film and it shows. Almost every instinct about the filmmaking is wrong. Both he and the director of photography should have been fired. How can you go wrong with such a great story - the book is wonderful - and this amazing cast - not a sour note in the whole cast - kudos to the casting director - but the bricks and mortar of the shots and locations make this like watching paint dry. The lighting makes everything so drab and not in a clever way to mirror the action or progression of the cancer, just bad lighting. This is shot like a movie of the week and if those are your expectations then you won't be disappointed - but if like me, you were aware of the buzz around this book to screen adaptation, you would be forgiven for expecting a little more. If you don't have the budget to shoot an epic love story then find the epic in nature - 0/10 for cinematography. To go all the way to Amsterdam and have nothing more than commonplace ambling along the canal shots - just shocking. Back to the drawing board. Perhaps I will live another twenty years to see the remake with a cameo from Shaileen as the nurse administering the cannula.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
An overly contrived and deliberately depressing slog,"Based on the best-selling novel by John Green and starring Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort, THE FAULT IN OUR STARS is an occasionally poignant, but contrived, story about love and life. The plot is really easy to summarize, as it follows the basic YA formula of having two people who are quite different enter into a romance with each other. The only difference, and what I feel to be most contrived part of all, is that both of them have cancer. I wouldn't necessarily call myself cynical, but this seems to me like one of the cheapest ways to get audience sympathy. I suppose John Green set out to write a ridiculously depressing tearjerker of a novel, and for its target demographic it seems to have worked like a charm. However, I am not so easily swayed and this film didn't work on me the way it might work for others. That's not to say it wasn't well-made or well-acted, because it is, but the story felt deliberately constructed to get a certain reaction and in that respect, again for me, it failed. Neither one of the leads was particularly likable or interesting to me, and some of the dialogue they were given to say felt odd and unnatural: stuff I can't really picture teenagers actually saying. I also thought that the voice-over was a weak point, as it kind of gives away the endgame a little too early and removes tension about the main character's survival. Still, it wasn't all bad. I did enjoy the segment of the film in which Hazel and Augustus travel to Amsterdam to meet the writer of Hazel's favorite novel, ""An Imperial Affliction."" I won't spoil the cameo for those who haven't seen the film, but I enjoyed his character and the brutal honesty he portrays, despite him being somewhat of an a-hole. I also did appreciate some of the conclusions that the film draws about the relationships we have with others and what we leave behind. It's just a bit sad that the film wallows in so much misery and self-pity to get there. Not having read the book and not usually liking this type of film, I already know that this probably wasn't meant for me. Still, I like to go in with an open mind and give certain things a shot, especially when they're generally well-received. I'd hesitate to call this a bad film, but I will say I didn't like it. Fans of the book will probably love the hell out of this, but I was left mostly cold.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woodley's great but a lot here feels unrealistic,"At the risk of sounding like some type of Grinch or cold hearted meanie, The Fault in Our Stars left me strangely unaffected. Sure there are many moments within this cancer set tale that are quiet emotional but to say that they are overwhelming affecting would be a lie for the Fault in Our Stars is a well-made movie with some fine acting especially by Shailene Woodley but nothing here struck me as wholly original and when you look at the success of the John Green source material, it feels like there was more for this movie to give.I can't claim to have read Green's book but from many acquaintances that have, it seemed like a witty, smart and touching tale of young love and the horrible disease that is cancer. It would be interesting to hear from those people that were touched by the book and there experience with this film for a while as mentioned Woodley is great in her role as Hazel Grace Lancaster all other players feel somewhat slight and untrue with Ansel Elgort's Augustus a fast talking and hyperactive persona who is supposed to be endearing, but comes off as an untrue like love interest. Hazel and Gus's relationship should've felt more engaging here as well and unlike the book it seems to have missed the mark in making a love story for the ages and for young teenagers everywhere. Dialogue also that may have popped off the page in the book feels a little tripe on screen and comes off as either to mawkish or grandstanding to ring true for the viewer.Without Woodley's top notch performance the film finds some much needed intrigue in the important yet not overly used Willem Dafoe as Amsterdam based author Peter Van Houten. Dafoe's character is sadly far more interesting than Augustus ever is and it shows up the fact that this central figure is less the sum of his parts. Director Boone also gives the film a nice feel, his direction is breezy and effective (although there is an overuse of an Indie set music soundtrack) and in material that could of gone full steam ahead on all things Nicholas Sparks like, it's nice that he doesn't overplay things although at times as mentioned things feel a little too cold and you start to wonder just what you're supposed to be taking away from all of this sadness? A great movie for teenage girls and all those with similar emotional ties, Fault in our Stars is a nice movie but that's about it. Woodley is the main reason to watch this film as she is consistently showcasing an acting talent that blows most other young performers out of the water, yet the film could've been so much more than the Hallmark tale it has seemingly ended up as. Mind you perhaps I am just a Grinch or a cold hearted meanie? As when this tale ended, so did my thinking about it and this movie clearly wanted to be a life affirming journey that makes people hug there closest by loved one.2 and a half un-lit cigarettes out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check into -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

"The fault is in the script, but still beautiful nonetheless.","First off, i hate to be that guy, I really do. The Fault in our stars, or TFIOS for short, really did play up the tumblr, edgy teen culture. For those who are familiar, will definitely understand. For those who can not fathom the utter confusion that is click clacking from my keyboard, let me explain.TFIOS really did have some questionable script writing and just weird, trying too hard metaphors. Augustus, the young boyfriend to fellow cancer patient and main character; Hazel, followed the cheap bad boy gone good image, topping it all off posing with a cigarette. Because, you know, it's definitely NOT to appeal to the edgy ""look at me, Im young and I smoke, i'm so deep"" scene.HOWEVER, the movie is good. very good. It's sad. Very sad. There's something oddly heartwarming about a young couple who fight through pain together. The pain in this story however is the fact the couple share cancer. Although, it indeed hide the gore and scars of the devastating disease, it needs to be remembered it is a love story, NOT primarily about having cancer.To keep in relatively short, Shailene Woodley (Hazel) great performance,, Ansel Elgort (Augustus) stole the show at the petrol station (you'll see) , Nat Wolf (Isaac) (Gus' friend) one touching scene, Parents (mum: Laura Dern, had great moments) (Dad: Sam Trammell, about as moving as a sleeping snorlax without the poke flute).I suggest watching this with plenty of tissues as this will make you cry. Too many times to count.

well-made and thoughtful despite some flaws at the end,"Reality shows, doctor's appointments, prescription drugs, and (ugh) a support group...that is the life of downbeat Indianapolis teenager Hazel Grace Lancaster, a Stage IV thyroid cancer patient who for pretty obvious reasons has a chip on her shoulder. It's at this support group where she meets and befriends kindred spirit Gus Waters, an upbeat amputee who refuses to deny himself the simpler pleasures of existence, and who helps Grace find a new lease on life. Despite what could definitely be an exploitative set up, for the most part this avoids falling into the trap of being just another maudlin weeper thanks to a confluence of genuine emotions, gravely important themes, and performances of the highest caliber--Woodley and Elgort especially who do find the real truth in their characters.

A great Romantic Drama Film,"""The Fault in our Stars"" directed by Josh Boone is one of the excellent movie which I have watched till now. It is based upon the number-one bestselling novel by John Green. The main characters in it; Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley), a 16-year-old cancer patient and Gus Waters (Ansel Elgort); with their chemistry, have made this movie mesmerizing and captivating. The movie is worth thousands of praises. It easily won my heart to become one of my favorites.It shows the journey of two extra-ordinary persons which takes us through an unforgettable journey. It is funny, thrilling, romantic as well as tragic. It is a simple movie with powerful impact. The dialogs in this movie are spell bounding. The credit goes to the director and the flawless acting of actors. I salute their performance which was so realistic and heart touching.Hazel and Gus are two cancer patients who meet at the cancer support group and become friends. Their friendship was a fate which brought them together. Gus supports Hazel to fulfill her last wish; which is to meet her ideal book writer Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe). The quest to fulfill her dream and put an end to her curiosity regarding Van Houten's book ""An Imperial Affliction"" leads to an unforgettable journey with Gus, which however has a painful ending by the death of Gus.I highly praise the overall team of movie crew which has portrait the novel in such a lovely way that nobody can deny its positive vibes and feeling of warmth after watching the movie. The movie is so enchanting that it takes you to a land of Gus and Hazel keeping you spellbound till the end.",,Anonymous,Romance
Surpringly good and for the most time not even kitschy.,"I'm really glad I didn't watch any trailers for this movie because I probably wouldn't even have watched it. They look so damn kitschy but gladly the movie isn't. The best thing are the characters. They feel so real, it's like watching the everyday life of real people with real problems to live with. Mainly because of the smart dialogue which is filled with beautiful metaphors about life and the incredible acting especially by the main character played by Shailene Woodley. This is underlined with a great score and some little turns within the story. If you don't need action or a lot of suspense to enjoy a movie I can definitely recommend seeing this one. If you are a sensitive person chances are high that you'll end up crying although the movie is very life affirming for the most time. Enjoy.",,Anonymous,Romance
