"The Force will be with you, always.","""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...""Pre review:Its writing started in January 1973, ""eight hours a day, five days a week"", George Lucas said by taking small notes, inventing odd names and assigning them possible characterization... After many drafts, he finally came to a satisfactory conclusion.Then, Lucas presented Star Wars to the United Artists, but they refused to budget the film, so he went to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed American Graffiti; however, it was rejected, as the film concept was ""too strange"".Suddenly, Alan Ladd Jr -head of 20th Century Fox- appeared, a man that trusted in Lucas' genius. And that's how Star Wars became a reality.The shooting of the movie was full of mishaps, problems with practical effects never done before, a bad first edit of the movie, but that didn't stop George from fulfilling his Space Opera. Due to those setbacks, Fox Studios began to put pressure on Lucas to finish the movie. Finally, the movie was done. On the eve of Star Wars release, 20th Century Fox, George Lucas and his cast and crew braced themselves for the worse. One way or another, May 25, 1977 would be a day they would never forget...Review:Star Wars is a modern tale of mythic adventure. It follows the journey and growth of the protagonist: Luke Skywalker. His journey of discovery is set amidst a larger struggle between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance; both parties are embroiled in a civil war. The Empire is comprised of corrupted power within a small group of leaders. These sullied leaders abuse their power over the masses with impunity. It is oppression and repression of the masses. The Empire wants to destroy the hope of the rebellion to ensure the small group of leaders can keep their power...One of the most important features of the movie are the special effects. The use motion control was even superior to Stanley Kubrick's revolutionary masterpiece: ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" thanks to the creation of The Dykstraflex, the first digital motion control photography camera system developed for Star Wars on 1976. Along with an incredibly iconographic character and production design, the movie became stylistically unique.The story and the characters are original and relatable. R2-D2 and C-3PO: the astromech as the optimistic adventurer's desiring to move forward. In direct opposition C-3PO, the protocol droid filled with doubt and reservations. Luke Skywalker, the brave hero, often haunted by doubts and hopes about his future journey. Obi-Wan Kenobi, the wise master and moral guidance of our hero. Han Solo, the rebellious smuggler whose personality represents tenacity. Leia, the damsel ""in distress"", a fearsome princess and general. Finally, Darth Vader, the most iconic character in the franchise, the merciless tyrant in a black suit, representing evil and final conflict of the journey.The film score presents an emotional resonance trough a romantic 1930s Hollywood orchestral score that was commissioned for composer John Williams, who succeeded to create a haunting constellation of operatic leitmotifs.The visual composition is authentic, as Lucas wanted a nostalgic ""filtered look"" so he kept changing key lights for a ""flashing"" effect. He used a loose, ""nervous"" frame, as in newsreels. The dramatic center was displaced, deflecting the eye to background activity, which in later films would include poetically changing weather. This first film gradually turned darker, following a symbolic color scheme where organic brown and warm gold yielded to high-tech black, white, and steely gray."" This is authenticity is reflected in it's most iconic shot: the 'Binary Sunset' sequence, which establishes the narrative through-line of the story and the world it takes place in, the main value of the scene lies in how powerfully and economically it develops Luke's character: As the suns begin to slowly sink in the evening sky, he gazes towards the horizon, his sense of longing for something more is palpable. Taking things further, he goes on to squint into the distance as if he could see his new future just out of reach, and for the first time we get to see him not as a kid, but for as a new hope.Books such as ""The hero with a thousand faces"" by Joseph Campbell structured the story, The War of Vietnam inspired the battle between the Rebels and the Empire, the lifestyle of buddhist monks characterized the Jedi, real shots of warplanes made the space battles real, Kendo foreshadowed the epic lightsaber duel, Akira Kurosawa's storytelling influenced the focus on minor characters, Fritz Lang's it's iconic protocol droid and John Ford westerns determined it's soul.The fascination with filmmaking and anthropology are the components that allowed Star Wars to be compelling and human, besides being located on a galaxy far, far away.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the most successful movies of all time (and I'm not talking about the Box Office take),"What made this the hugely successful triumph it was? Was it casting, music, imagination, ingenuity, or luck?I remember opening day at the theaters. I was old enough to remember every scene, every character, every nuance of this film; having committed it to memory forever, as if I would never again be able to see this beloved, instantly loved masterpiece.I also remember that the HIT factor of this movie was so unexpected that you had to wait literal MONTHS to get the action figures promised on the cereal boxes. The pieces were still in the manufacturing process and we had to settle for coupons promising our toys in a few months. I wound up seeing this in the theaters a grand total of 36 times; much to my mother's dismay. She loved the movie as I did, but felt I was obsessed. Today, thirty years later, sitting here writing this review, I realize how right she was. I'm still obsessed with this movie, and with the subsequent movies which followed. I wait in great anticipation for Episode 3. I'm a fan, and I don't care what other people say about Episodes 1 & 2. I don't even mind the ""prequel"" factor, as the situation at the time, dictated to Lucas which movies he would do first.See, I remember the studios saying to him that he had to choose from the three central climactic books, and trash the rest, or just trash the whole idea. He didn't exactly ""sell out,"" he did what he had to do to get his movie...his vision...out there for us to see and experience. I admired his decision then, and I admire it now. Episodes 1-3 are being filmed now, because Lucas had the clout, the money, and the patience to give us his vision...his complete vision and not just the three center books of a 9-book series. I realize that now, there are dozens of books, but at the time, there were nine. And while most of us were happy with Episodes 4-6 and would not have missed 1-3 and 7-9, I personally am so very glad he has taken it upon himself to give us his full vision. I have enjoyed each and every installment with the same sense of awe and joy as I did this one.The casting was the first triumph for this cinematic milestone. Ford is a charismatic and magnetic personality and portrayed Han with a professionalism that you'd expect from more seasoned actors. Sir Alec Guiness is an absolute joy as Obi Wan. His casting was precise and excellent in that part. Carrie Fisher portrayed Leia in a way that, up until then, had never been experienced. Most ""princess"" types before her were whining, whimpering, little snots who were incapable of anything beyond tripping and twisting their ankle in times of peril, while Fisher portrayed her character as a bold, brazen, yet sophisticated and educated woman who was aware of her surroundings and capable of defending herself and her realm with the utmost authority.And Mark Hamil. He was perfectly cast as the whining little boy who wanted more, but was afraid to reach for it. He grows up quite well on film in these three installments, and endears himself to the audience so much the more for it. But a cast member who is almost always left out of these reviews is Peter Mayhew. Chewbacca. His character, as a supporting character to Han's, was exemplary. It's not easy portraying a walking carpet, yet holding the attention, admiration, and love of virtual millions. I am VERY happy about his being cast as Chewy in Episode 3. Couldn't happen to a more deserving...or capable...fellow. Bravo! And James Earl Jones's voice being used as the voice of Darth Vader, was pure genius. His commanding voice haunted the dreams of countless thousands of star-struck children for generations to come. I also have to say that this movie would not have had the charm it does had it not been for Anthony Daniels' C3P0. He is a gift and a joy.The musical score by John Williams featured in this masterpiece was one of the contributing factors. But honestly, this movie's success was such a total surprise to everyone, including Lucas, that nothing could prepare the world for the aftermath of having witnessed this bona fide legend, first hand.The story itself; replete with sub-plot after sub-plot, rich in dialog and detail, was beyond anyone's greatest expectations. Everyone, including Lucas, expected this movie to fail. It is a timeless classic, which I will not repeat here. There are too many movie reviews giving full details of the plot, and I won't be redundant beyond what I have already said.However, that being said, there are a few points I would like to make concerning the symbolism of this endeavor. The Force is a metaphor for the psychic abilities with which we are all born. It was also a metaphor for hope and faith, dedication and commitment to the greater state of being. The Empire is said to have been a metaphor for the Germanic Nazi ""storm troopers."" While the Rebellion is said to have been symbolic of (what would later become) the NATO forces who defeated them.And then there are the effects. The effects were, in 1977, so awesome; so creative; so ahead of their time, as to ensure this movie's vast success for the next forty years. George Lucas enjoys an almost god-like status among sci-fi/fantasy fans worldwide.This movie does not rate a rating. Usually, when I say that, it is because the movie is so bad, or disappointing that I don't have the heart to rate it.But in this case, it far surpasses any 10/10 rating I could give it.The Fiend :.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A film that changed the industry forever.,"The Empire look set to continue their relentless war effort, new technology means they are pretty much unopposed, but a small band including Like Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo, look to fight back.I'm not sure what I can add that hasn't already been said, instead I'll try and imagine what it must have been like for someone, someone young perhaps, heading to the cinema in 1977, seeing this film for the first time.Consider what had gone before, people had Star Trek, and various other shows, but this film must have left audiences speechless, as there was quite literally nothing else like it.This film changed not just sci fi, but film making in general, the sheer scale and imaginative of it shame many of today's mediocre offerings.You have to admire the sheer bravery and audacity to get this film made, you wonder what doubts George Lucas had, he must have been elated when audiences turned round and fell in love with it.It's funny, entertaining, exciting, jaw dropping, moving, it's everything you want from a movie, years on, it's still a masterpiece.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The original version was brilliant...,"I was actually born about a year after this film first premiered, but being a member of a family that was the first on the block to get such things as the VCR and the proper Hi-Fi system allowed me to catch this film in a number of different formats in the years ranging from 1982 to 1997. I think it is safe to say that without this film, I would have had no idea how truly evil a thing Pan And Scan is, or why multi-channel audio is such a damned important thing to have in the home theatre environment.Of course, I also knew that the film wasn't perfect. I could see a number of small problems where Lucas' budget just didn't quite go far enough, or where there just wasn't enough time to accomplish what was wanted. So when the announcement was made that in 1997, each film would be presented with improved special effects and footage that could not be integrated in the original cut for reasons of budget or practicality, I was excited.For the most part, I was overjoyed to see the new footage or effects. Mos Eisley now looks like a real city or port of commerce, without the viewer's sense of disbelief at the seemingly deserted streets needing to be suspended. The flight of the X-Wings towards the Death Star in its original form was very good, a marvel of its time, but when George finally got to show it the way he wanted to, it was almost the equivalent of watching the helicopters of Apocalypse Now decimating the village to the tune of Ride Of The Valkyries. The wonderfully composed tracking shots especially made the battle look almost as if it really happened and Lucas was just there to take pictures. And Jabba? Well, he doesn't look all that real, granted, but it was just nice to have that one piece of footage in order to make the appearance of Boba Fett in Episode V and the entire prologue of Episode VI make a bit more sense, especially to dullards.Unfortunately, there are a number of times when Lucas just goes too far in his quest to improve his work. Sometimes you can only do so much to anything before it starts to look overdone. Of course, I am talking about the scene between Han and Greedo in the cantina. In the original version, we are led to believe Han is a scoundrel who only cares about himself, giving us one of the best character arcs in the whole trilogy. It is also a great tribute to Sergio Leone, a nice reference to when Tuco shoots a potential assassin from his bathtub and tells the corpse ""When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk!"". Modifying this scene so it looks like Greedo shot first is an insult on a few levels. It insults Greedo as a character, making him look like one of the most incompetent bounty hunters in the galaxy. It insults the audience, who even at the age of six should no that you'd have to be blind, drunk, brain-damaged, or all three, to miss from that distance. Lastly, it insults the character of Han Solo by destroying a vital piece of said character arc. Watching Han go from scum to a leader of men, a space-age version of King Aragorn even, was one of the best things about the original Star Wars trilogy.The story itself is the stuff of classics in that it shows the most unlikely of heroes doing things that everyone else claims to be impossible. What Lucas got right in terms of pacing and plot here is exactly where he went wrong in the prequels, in that he makes the jump from location to location seem important to the plot and totally natural, rather than forced and choppy. The story and sense of adventure makes one forget that there are really only three major locations other than the inside of a space ship.Overall, the original Star Wars rates an eight out of ten. If Lucas had applied some common sense in conjunction with his rampant desire for revisionism, I would give it a ten, but as one critic who is famous for his negativity once said about Episode II, when was the last time anyone told George Lucas no? Still, this is a classic that should be shown to future generations as an example of how an imagination and enough literacy to realise it will open doors for you when nothing else will.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The film that changed the world,"Star wars made epic fantasy real. For a generation of people it has defined what the cinema experience is meant to be. Today it is probable that pc games will offer a deeper and more satisfying entertainment solution, but for pure visual and aural pleasure, mixed with basic emotional manipulation, there has never and will never be a better example of cinema than when star wars appeared over 25 years ago. When you think of star wars, you must remember what else was happening at the time. In America, the war in Vietnam had been lost. In the U.K economic disaster was occurring(a 3 day working week, and the army collecting rubbish). It was almost like the two most technically advanced countries in the world were going backwards. Star wars let everybody escape from that reality and reach for a future that was uncertain but ultimately good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Where It All Began-----10/10,"I can never pick a favorite movie because different movies have different effects. Goodfellas is my favorite drama. Face/Off is my favorite actioner. But when it comes to pure amazement, nothing beats Star Wars. We are introduced to a whole other universe with different creatures, different lifestyles, and different history. We are dropped in the middle of an intergalactic war between an empire and a rebellion that has raged for years and left the universe in ruin. It was the most fascinating thing to see when i was eleven, but to this day i am still a Star Wars nerd.The cast of characters includes some of the coolest, funniest, and most tragic in film, and the actors who play them fit seamlessly into this new universe. Alec Guiness is flawless as Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Jedi on the run from the evil Empire. Harrison Ford is awesome as Han Solo, a smuggler and thief who helps the gang rescue the princess. But the my favorite character of all time is Darth Vader. Not only is he the coolest bad guy, but we learn in later films why he is evil and start to feel sympathetic for him. Not to mention that badass booming voice that can make ordering a pizza sound threatening.This was not only the beginning of the best movie series ever, but it was the beginning of my love for movies. George Lucas is a genius for being able to come up with a great story and an incredible backdrop for what was supposed to be a flop, but turned into one of the best films ever.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The beginning of a great story...,"The beginning of one of the most legendary franchises with one of the most elaborate worlds in the history of cinema.There is no denying, even if you are not a fan of this franchise, the contribution to cinema that this film has made.A charming and memorable soundtrack combined with strong and soulful scenes gives a wow effect.It is this movie that includes a huge number of events that capture you and immerse you in history. The powerful and dramatic first half, contrasting with the cheerful and humorous second, gives a very complete and versatile film.Characters - there's nothing to say here. Darth Vader - who can compete with him in popularity among villains except the Joker? The ""kind"" characters of the film - Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Han Solo and others - are known to almost everyone. And for good reason!Yes, the graphics here are still a bit weak, but after such thoughts, look at the release date - 1977, and then remember the atmosphere and elaboration of this picture and think about whether you gave the right claims to this story?And the same ""old"" special effects are still very cool for those years and the eyes are not too sore.The only thing is that because of the possibilities of that time, Darth Vader does not look as cool as in new films and animations, and fights on light swords not best. But, unfortunately, these were the conditions before.George Lucas came up with an interesting idea - to start the franchise with the 4th film. But there were conditions for that - filming the first three episodes was impossible at that time.In general, this is the beginning of a great saga that is worth watching, it is not for nothing that it is considered a classic and revered by more than one generation.My rating is 9/10.

"The Best of Sci-Fi Times,the Worst of sf Times","Though now known as ""Episode IV-A New Hope,"" for many of us, namely those of us who first saw this exhilarating entertainment in theaters back in '77, this will always be the first ""Star Wars."" We will always think of it as just ""Star Wars"" - plain & simple, no pretensions, no aspirations to deep film-making or high art. This is where we first met them all: Luke, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi (old 'Ben'), Chewbacca, the 2 robots C3PO & R2D2 and, of course, Darth Vader. They were instant pop culture icons; you got the sense you'd seen them before somewhere, but were sure this wasn't possible. But they'd been there before in our minds. We'd read about them constantly in science fiction novels and short stories - tales of outer space civilizations, of spaceships zooming through asteroid belts, of exotic-looking aliens hanging around space ports. We'd dream about them at night and try to imagine ourselves in their midst; up until then, we could only imagine such things - there were no projected images to realize such dreams. ""Forbidden Planet"" from 1956 came close, and then there were the ""Star Trek"" and ""Lost in Space"" TV series, both hampered by dime store budgets and cheesy sets. We ate 'em up since there was nothing else. Then Lucas made it real.I remember when I first got wind of the upcoming movie, to open in May of 1977, I think. I saw the first publicized poster and bought the novel adaptation. On the poster, a young man stood with some light sword raised, a princess at his feet, numerous spaceships flying all over the place. I was in my mid-teens and felt the first pulse of building excitement as I realized all those fantastic tales I'd been reading the past few years were going to come alive on the big screen for me. It didn't disappoint. Luke Skywalker, who stood in for all the boys pretending to be on a galactic adventure, gets swept away from his mundane desert home smack dab into the middle of an honest-to-gosh galaxy-wide civil war! The strength of the narrative is / was amazing. There are no slow spots and you can't wait for the next scene during the entire experience; and, experience is the better description for it, rather than just 'movie.' You can't wait, for example, for the moment when Luke actually meets the princess; what will happen then? It's a textbook case of an exciting narrative and what I believe makes this superior to all the sequels (knowing that many feel ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is superior - I must disagree).The one character you really can't wait to see again is the ominous Vader, naturally. The instant he steps into view during the first few minutes of the story, you just know this is the ultimate villain. This is the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool, the supreme uber-evildoer of the entire galaxy. You just know it by his stance, by his attitude, and by the electric chill that runs through your frail form as he steps down the corridor, moving into the annals of film history with one fell swoop. You can't wait to see what he does next, what nefarious action will send someone or some planet to its doom. Sure, he seems under the control of Tarkin (Cushing) here and later, the Emperor, but you just know he's simply biding his time until he takes over the whole damn universe. There is no precedent for Vader, and nothing close to him after. He's at his best here where there's still much mystery attached to his dark frightful form, a minion of Satan and Nazi stormtroopers all rolled into one.This was also the movie-experience which catapulted Harrison Ford (Solo) into superstardom. He seems almost childish here, not really straining to create a character, and it's this flip charm that makes it work, against all odds. He really does appear to have stepped out of the pages of some juvenile space opera, laser guns blazing, all snide remarks and foolhardy bravado. But he also becomes the older brother figure to Luke, who cannot carry the story by himself. Hamill, whose movie career began & ended with Luke, epitomizes the center of destiny for a galaxy. Both humble and arrogant, he's perfect in the role. Fisher's main surprise is that she's not all sugar and sweet as one would expect of a princess. These three characters evolved in the next two films, but they were always at their best here, icons given life for a short period - but also forever in film. The same could be said for Alec Guinness as Kenobi, a first class act all the way. You almost believe this elderly warrior could topple an empire, given enough time. Unless he runs into Vader...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A fun film,"Filled with great characters and a fun story, Star Wars is well deserving of its reputation as a classic. John Williams score alone makes this a film worth seeing. The characters are unforgettable and the special effects impressive for its time, but very outdated now. The different alien species are one of the best things about the film. The Cantina scene showing an array of Lucas' creations is particularly fun.I give this film a 7/10. Looking at it subjectively, it isn't a really good film. A lot of clichés, bad dialogue, cracker jack philosophy, and unimpressive acting. Yet, for some reason, I find it hard to say anything bad about this movie.

The greatest cinematic epic of all time begins here.,"Here begins the greatest cinematic epic of all time, and arguably one of the greatest stories ever told. Originally conceived as a serialized popcorn movie in the manner of the old action movies that Lucas grew up with, Star Wars surpassed even George's keen and bombastic imagination to become a central part of movie history.There are countless tales of the making of this movie; how Lucas never believed he would get the chance to complete the series, how it spawned an industry and made the name of nearly everyone who touched it a household word. But what that does not reveal, nor do the much diminished prequels, is the sheer joy and excitement these movies generated.It was a once in a lifetime experience. You could feel it from opening day, earlier if you paid attention to such things. We had never seen anything like it, and we are not likely to again.This episode finds young Luke Skywalker yearning to leave the agrarian life he has with his aunt and uncle, and chase after adventure as his friends before him have already done. And what adventure there is. The galaxy is in the grip of a massive rebellion against a tyrannical and oppressive empire, but on Luke's home planet, it's something you only dare speak of in a whisper.Along come two robots, ""Droids"" for short, who inadvertently involve Luke in a stellar attempt to contact an old wizard named Ben Kenobi, who lives in the caves near Luke's home.The rest is history, and there isn't a person alive in the civilized world who doesn't have at least some awareness of the epic story that unfolds. Luke's rise from adolescent obscurity on Tatooine to a leading role in the greatest struggle of all time is told with humor, action, adventure, and always a sense of story that is unmatched on the screen or on the page.With the completion of the prequel trilogy, these films are enjoying a renewed popularity among a generation that never saw the films on the big screen, and the theatric revivals are almost guaranteed.

Such an overrated made-for-TV flick,"Back in 1977, I was able to go to the theater and go right into the theater in Kankakee, IL, and thought, ""Wow! Everyone everywhere else is standing in line, and we got right in!"" Then, two hours later, I was asking myself, ""What the hell? THAT was what all the hoopla is all about?"" I'd seen better science fiction flicks as a kid in the 50s.Prior to seeing it, a co-worker had gushed about it, and I asked him what it was about. He told me the plot, and when he got done, I asked, ""And then...?"" I thought he'd described the opening half hour. And he said, ""That's the story. That's all of it."" After watching it, I was still asking that question, ""Where is the rest of the story?""The plot was simplistic, the dialog inane (when everyone thought that about the three new Star Wars episodes, they were in the majority), the characters really 'flat' and not very interesting. C3P0 and R2D2 as comic relief were just plain inadequate.To this day, I think people were just sheep, thinking that they had to say wonderful things about this movie, so they did. The amazing thing to me is that 30 years later, they are still not seeing this as the average B-movie that it is.Look, I LIKE Harrison Ford, and I LIKE the other actors in the movie, especially Alec Guiness. Okay, Mark Hamill wasn't Larry Olivier, but he is at least likable. And James Earl Jones has the best voice ever. But for this movie to be considered one of the best 20 movies of all time?

"In 1977, in a galaxy far, far away...","This great classic has so many good elements it's almost impossible to list them all: The breathtaking visual effects, still awesome 28 years on; the brilliant script, which mixed epic battles and duels with matinée-serial-style characters and dialogues; the debut of one of the greatest villains in cinema history, Darth Vader; John Williams'amazing and unforgettable score, among the Top 10 best scores ever...All those things are just some of the reasons Star Wars is among the best movies (not just sci-fi) ever made: viewing after viewing, it never stops being impressive, and words are nearly useless to describe the impact it still has on the audience.George Lucas basically took a medieval story and moved it to a distant galaxy, on weird and fascinating planets. Almost everything is taken from the Middle Ages: there are knights, sword-fighting, evil Empires, unsatisfied people who want to overthrow the system, beautiful princesses waiting to be rescued...Then we've also got speeders, light-sabers, peculiar (and, in the case of Jabba the Hutt, disgusting) creatures, the Death Star, and of course the Force, that fascinating energy which is supposed to bring balance to the galaxy.The cast is a gas, both the newcomers and the veterans: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford are great as Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo (Ford in particular is hilarious as the arrogant but ultimately nice ""scoundrel""), but the most memorable performance is of course Alec Guinness'portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi, the old, wise Jedi who returns one last time to initiate Luke to the mysteries of the Force.But let's not forget what everybody immediately thinks of when Star Wars is mentioned: Darth Vader. Feared by his opponents as well as his servants, this completely emotionless foe has become the very symbol of Lucas'masterpiece. He's one of those movie-characters people will remember as long as films will keep being made and his unsettling breathing noise still echoes in our memories...The beginning of a wonderful saga, whose only rival is The Lord of the Rings.May the Force be with you...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great impact on cinama but also incredibly cheesy.,"Star Wars Episode 4 A New Hope tells the story of a farm boy Luke Skywalker who upon his purchase of two droids R2-D2 and C3-P0, and running into the old and wise Obi-Wan Kenobi he is thrown into a world bigger then his own.A New Hope has great sense of pacing and having a flowing narrative build up to its conclusion almost flawlessly. The characters feel like real people with fleshed out motivations. The effects although aged today definably inspired what we have today in the art of cinema. The score just like all the other films in the saga is fantastic. But what this movies greatest feat is just how much it inspired a generation of cinema, as well as is outstanding impact on pop culture that keeps this film fresh.In spite of how much we can all appreciate this movies impact it is still far from a perfect movie. Most of the acting is hooky, and the effects are hard to by today. And although it has a good sense of pacing it still has many plot conveniences. The action is also pretty slow which prevents it from feeling like a real fight is going on. Even the dialogue is pretty hooky and hard to by. This is a problem because if characters are unable to talk like people do it makes it hard to relate to them and get invested in there conflicts.In conclusion I can appreciate its impact on culture, as well as love the movie. I personally consider myself to be a Star Wars fan. Keeping in mind that I feel on an objective level I consider this picture to be above average instead of great I'm giving this one a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Cinema Classic,"Star Wars is simply a fantastic film, on every level this film is amazing.Each of the characters in this film are so well developed and so interesting that you just cannot wait for the next scene with them in it, the interactions between the characters us at times tense and at times downright hilarious, leaving no room for boring or lacking dialogue. The particular stand outs in this respect I feel are: Han Solo, the wise cracking bounty hunter with a tendency for arrogance that makes every scene as entertaining as possible. Secondly there is Darth Vader, who is the optometry of cool, scathing evil who poses as the ultimate villain.Surprising to me, the cinematography and special effects have held up all this time. Although there are some minor issues, one particularly notable one is during the scene where Luke is training with the training droid aboard the Millennium Falcon there are a few frame skips where Luke extends and contracts his lightsaber. Other than this though, the cinematography and special effects are amazing to have held up, particularly the shots of the Empire's space fleet moving through space which are absolutely stunning.One of the things that absolutely makes this film for me is the magnificent score, composed by John Williams. This score, while being one of the most iconic scores of all time, manages to make every single scene, fitting the mood of the scene perfectly.The story as well is fantastic, there is never a dull moment; every second of it an absolute thrill ride. Whether its the attack on the Death Star or the Cantina of Mos Eisley the story takes you through the twists and turns of this classic space opera.If I could recommend one sci-fi adventure film to someone, it would be this, it's an absolute must see.More Reviews at: http://12yearsacinephile.tumblr.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A product of its time. A classic,"When Star Wars came out in 1977 there was nothing like it, it came out of nowhere and was so different. It is indeed a product of its time and would have fascinated many kids of the era.As a film it is very simple and easy to follow. There are no big twists, dilemmas and the good forces come on top. The special effects and film have definitely aged but it has some classic elements. Darth Vader, the army of storm troopers and the mighty light saber is unlikely to be forgotten. Star Wars as a franchise clearly benefited from coming out at the right time, this was the day before competitive television, streaming services or films like Inception.The immortality of Star Wars lies in its simplicity, linear story and vast imagination. This appealed to millions of kids who grew into adults who still loved identified their childhood with this series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A milestone in film-making- a superlative sci-fi movie,"I couldn't have asked for anything more. Star Wars: A New Hope had it all. If I had to sum it up in one word, superlative would be my answer. I saw the film for the first time three months ago and loved it, and since then I have watched all the Star Wars movies. I was disappointed with the prequels (Attack of the Clones was my least favourite), but this, Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back were perfection.I have to say that the film looks absolutely amazing even after thirty plus years, with highly imaginative sets and dazzling special effects. And the action sequences were superbly choreographed and brisk, the Death Star climax was a knockout. The music by John Williams is absolutely outstanding, by far one of his more exciting and rousing scores. The story is fast-paced, intelligent and has an essence of sophistication, and the screenplay is sharp and decisive.And the performances were flawless. In the prequels I had problems relating to some of the performers, namely Hayden Christensen as Anakin. Here, all the actors played their parts with superlative skill. Alec Guiness, one fine actor and will be sorely missed was a standout, likewise with Peter Cushing and Harrison Ford(hilarious here). Carrie Fisher was a fine Princess Leia, spunky, beautiful and sexy, and Mark Hamill was a completely likable Luke. And the villain Darth Vader, without doubt one of the best and in-depth villains in cinematic history, and James Earl Jones's deep booming voice was perfect for the character.All in all, a definite sci-fi classic, that blew me away. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
In A Galaxy Far Away................A Franchise Was Born,"The awesome special effects and the creation of creatures that are part of the vivid imagination of George Lucas are not the reason for the enduring popularity of Star Wars and the franchise it spawned. Rather it is because of the characters Lucas created that will live as long as we have cinema and the means to display it.The spectacle is behind some real, but simple people. No shadings of gray in the first Star Wars we know without any doubt who the heroes and villains are of this piece. On an isolated planet a galaxy wide dictatorship called the Empire and the revolt against come to wear young Luke Skywalker as played by Mark Hamill and his family reside. So does Alec Guinness, a reclusive and mysterious hermit.An escape pod crashes there with two androids, C3PO and R2D2 and in the latter is a message for Guinness who was at one time a Jedi Knight, fiercest of a warrior class, from Carrie Fisher playing Princess Leia. Also in R2D2 are the schematics for the Empire's ultimate weapon the satellite size death star that can deal killing out on a planetary scale.This starts an adventure with young Hamill who teams up with futuristic soldier of fortune Harrison Ford as Han Solo and his simian like sidekick Chewbacca to rescue the Princess and defeat the Death Star.Those are the good guys. The bad guys are the blackest of black villainy. Peter Cushing cold bloodedly commands the Death Star, but the mysterious Darth Vader, clad in black with a helmet completely covering his head, has mysterious powers and even his superiors are wary of him. The voice of James Earl Jones is unforgettable as the black prince of the galaxy.These are characters that bring out the kid in all of us. The ones who claim the most sophistication in their lives will cheer on for Hamill and Ford and will be fascinated by the double dyed villainy of Darth Vader.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Star Wars and I speak now of all the films is the way such non-humans as the robots and Chewbacca the Wookie became characters. C3PO had dialog, but R2D2 had a few clicks and bleeks and all Chewbacca did was grunt, still they became as identifiable as the human characters.Star Wars set the standard for science fiction films to come for the next several generations. It was given six Oscars in a bunch of technical categories and it's got a re-release value that Gone With The Wind used to have.The Force Will Be With Us Always.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
40 of age and still enjoyable.,"George Lucas was exhausted - and had lost several pounds - when his finished work finally was to be shown to the public officially on the big screen.The recordings had been very troublesome, and was on a budget shoestring until the end. (Did it stop at 11 M $ ?) In 1977 the movie landscape was very well mixed, but It lacked Space Adventures who was far out there.Spielberg's ""Close Encounter"" from the same year did not speculate in fantasy as deep as Lucas' adventure; here we got a whole table of pure imagination and creativity from a guy who just wanted to show us the eternal battle between good and bad, dark and light, his way.And by 1977's standards and special effects options of the era: What an enjoyable classic!It's an adventure who has a good mood from start to finish. Great locations, great humour, great acting.Don't want to cherish the old trilogy in front of the ""sequels"", but it brings heck a lot more charming and warm feeling re-seeing those 77- 83 flicks.I leave it that way......""Star Wars"" is probably one of the 10 most important movies of the 20th century.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
From the Lucasian Chair of Entertainment - a masterpiece,"I first saw this film on a warm March Sunday evening in 1978, after queueing for a whole hour to get into the cinema. Oh, the anticipation! The excitement! The magic! And here was a film that changed the whole concept of cinema forever, for no matter how many times I return to it, in the flickering dark of the cinema, or the wondrous, glittering DVD release, or in where the film really scores - at the centre of my imagination, that night will live forever in my memory. ANYTHING was possible, wonders could be achieved. Miracles in the here and now. And how lucky I was to share in it.To the squares that loathe it - I pity you daddyos; you'll never experience what millions of us have felt these past three decades. Go and see Henry Jaglom again; I'll stick with Mr. Lucas - he is THE MAN!I love this film. Forget what flaws it has - minor they are indeed. Star Wars has become a mystic myth and that sorcerer supreme, Jedi master George Lucas, has given me more pleasure than I can measure. My favourite bit? Almost impossible to choose. Okay, if I must...the stunning Tie Fighter battle with the Millennium Falcon, a work or art in the editing room.

Not just a great movie. It's important,"This story happened 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away'. The galaxy is under the dictatorship of the emperor. Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is part of the rebellion but is capture by the evil Darth Vader. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) the young hero, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) the brigand, his sidekick Chewbacca, and the wise master Jedi Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) must together rescue the princess and save the galaxy.The characters are icons pulled from classic storytelling like Akira Kurosawa's ""The Hidden Fortress"". George Lucas was able to assemble such iconic characters into a well told story. Rarely is a movie change the nature of movie-making, and even the wider culture. This may be on the list of the most important movie ever. It changed the tone of movies from the gritty morally-confused 70s to the popcorn selling blockbusters that are soon to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
6 - Decent,"At it's time of release, it was really progressive and an influential classic, but it's quite average when judging it by its enduring quality. For what it's worth it's entertaining, the costumes are well done and it's good fantasy.Technology ages fast. The script is average, the acting isn't particularly well done and the characters aren't deep, the story is simple and there aren't a lot of human emotions on this one. It did successfully introduce the franchise so that the later and better entries could build on it. But I'm calling it over-hyped on this one (sorry). Maybe I just had to see it when I was 11 years old (or have grown up in the 70's) to see what Star Wars fans adore about this one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

This movie is great at setting up a large cast of characters and an immense world to explore, but something about this movie (after two watches) just doesn't get me rearing to keep watching Star Wars.

This is the first film I ever saw...,"Having read a lot of the other comments here, I have to say it's interesting to see how many people begin by saying how old they were when they saw ""Star Wars"" for the first time(Full disclosure: I was three. My parents saw it at a drive-in theatre, and all I can remember of that experience was seeing Darth Vader for the first time, and knowing that he was very, very bad). I think that speaks to its extraordinary impact. ""Star Wars"" was an event, I suppose in the way that the Beatles on Ed Sullivan for the first time was an event. It dates you, to a degree, but the reason it was important-- the reason it remains important-- is that it showed you what was possible. For much of the 1960s and 1970s, filmmakers had concentrated on showing us the brutal, heartbreaking truth of our world(The Godfather, Chinatown, Nashville-- some of the best movies ever made), and many of them succeeded brilliantly. But there's a place for dreaming dreams of things that have never been, too, and ""Star Wars"", with its epic tale of an Empire and a rebellion in a galaxy far, far away, was the dream a generation didn't know it wanted to have until George Lucas gave it to us.Is it juvenile, at times? Simplistic, even? Sure. So's the truth, sometimes. We want to believe there's a Force, and that Luke can master its use in time to defeat the forces of darkness. So we believe it. Are the effects a bit dated now? Sure, although I still believe them. Did the success of ""Star Wars"" possibly kick off the modern blockbuster era, which gives us more and more special-effects-drenched dreck every year? Sadly, it probably did. But the thing the wannabe heirs of ""Star Wars"" usually lack is the one thing that made ""Star Wars"" such an event--courage.Back in 1977, nobody was making movies like this. Nobody thought a film like this, with its mythic storytelling arc and its sweeping vision of intergalactic war, could possibly work...with the exception of George Lucas and his fellow filmmakers.I didn't know all that at the time, of course. Like I said, I was only three. But having watched more movies than most people my age now, I feel comfortable saying that in its way, ""Star Wars"" is as much an independent auteur's film as anything by John Cassavetes or Woody Allen-- it has the same sort of daring, the same desire not to settle for less than showing us something we've never seen before. A bold, grand sense of old-style craftsmanship infuses everything in ""Star Wars"", and the film delivers on the promise contained in its subtitle. At the time, it really was a new hope.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A cultural landmark,"Film History began with A New Hope in 1977 and to this day its effects are being felt in Hollywood. Much has been said about A new hope and I do not need to add to it except for the fact that this film is fantastic- well paced and featuring the appearance of so many memorable characters and scenes. Lucas as a young man sure had an eye for details and it's a pity how he lost this ability by the time he started filming the prequels. The locations, atmosphere and camerawork is so different than the later films it is hard to imagine they were both directed by the same man. Anyway if you haven't already then please watch A new hope and then slowly make your way through the entire saga.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great movie for its time, hasn't aged very well though","This movie immediately captures your attention with an incredible starting sequence after which you're left wondering what is going on. It sets up not just the story at hand, but a whole world far, far away. What makes this movie shine are the memorable settings, characters and locations. The effects were ahead of its time, but have not aged well. This shows the most during fight scenes. They are not choreographed very well and look just like a couple of old dudes trying to punch each other with sticks. It's done so much better in the prequels, less so in the new movies. The lightsabers feel like a traditional novelty more than like a weapon feared by the galaxy. What the movie does very well are its twists and pacing.

"Primitive-Looking By Now, But A 'Must"" To Set Up The Series","After seeing all six episodes of the Star Wars saga several times apiece, I still think this initial entry is interesting but one of weaker ones in the series. Perhaps that's because by now, the special-effects look primitive but also because it's a little slow in parts, slower than the other five films. Sometimes, though, it's nice to have more lulls as these modern-day action films many times overdo the violence. This one, however, is just a bit too slow overall.The first hour of this film sets up the second hour plus the two sequels that followed in the 1980s, showing how the principal characters were united, who they are fighting against and what mystical powers they have at their disposal. Note: it was even interesting to watch this film decades later after the final installment, episode 3, was viewed. It made this first entry make a little more sense, knowing the complete story (who was related to whom, how some died, etc.). It was also a shock to go back and see the special-effects in here after viewing those final three films issued in recent years.I always got annoyed, to be honest, at two things in this initial Star Wars film I felt were overdone: the ""Rambo"" mentality in which hundreds of shots are fired at the good guys and never hit them and the constant arguing between Carrie Fisher (""Princess Leia"") and Harrison Ford (""Han Solo""). By the third film, thankfully, that bickering stopped and everyone was ""on the same page.""Despite how old this film is, it's a ""must"" for this collection since it sets up so much of what is to follow. It's also kind of fun to look at this again and see how young everyone looks!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Star Wars: The iconic world changer!,"It is now 36 years after this movie hit theaters, but it is not too late to write a review! This movie will and already is in the history books as the movie that changed the world! Star Wars, created by George Lucas, is the most iconic, awesome, epic and action-packed space opera ever made. This movie contains everything you want to see in a movie, for example: action, adventure, mystery, humor, emotion and, above all, creativity. The great visual and imaginative mind of George Lucas made it possible for other filmmakers to get from realistic movies to a generation of movies containing imagination and fantasy.The beginning of the movie is so perfectly written and makes it almost impossible for people not to like it. Firstly, the title scrawl. Although this scrawl was the same as the Flash Gordon series, in Star Wars this iconic and epic beginning was made great by the extraordinary music by John Williams. The music he composed made this movie what it is today and what it was then.

Classic bit of fun sci-fi  a space western!,"The Republic has fallen and the Empire rules the galaxy as a dictatorship, seeking to destroy dissenting voices.  The Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, is fully on line and capable of destroying whole systems.  The Jedi have been destroyed, save a few living in hiding, unable to compete with the force of the Empire.  However Princess Leia has the plans showing a weakness within the Death Star.  Before she is captured by Darth Vader she gives them to droids C3PO and R2D2 and they escape.  When they land on a nearby planet they find Luke Skywalker and set out to find the owner of the droids Obi Wan Kenobi, or Old Ben Kenobi.  Obi Wan begins to train Luke in the way of the force as they try to get the information to the Rebellion before the Death Star can be used at full power.It's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking  lets be honest, Lucas isn't the Shakespeare of our generation.  However what it is, is a good story of good v's evil, a western of goodies v baddies set in space.  The story is simple but contains clear characters.  The thing that sets it apart is the fun  the sense of wonder for kids but also the enjoyment it brings to adult. The story is good for a sci-fi with a lot of history and back-story clearly set out up front.  The action scenes are mostly great  not dry effects but with a real sense of action and excitement too.This may be the 4th part but it's also our first chapter, it is light and enjoyable but hints that this is only part of an ongoing battle.  The way it relates to kids and adults is obvious as it broke records and everyone of a certain age knows about Star Wars!  The effects still look good today  in many ways the model work looks better than all digital effects simply because they are `real' and don't just exist within a computer.  Sound effects, comedy, music  it's all pitch perfect and sets up the rest of the series really well.Hamil is ok as Skywalker (`Blonde hair, blue eyes'  Chasing Amy!).  He is suitable for a kids film and he does well with his role.  However like part 1 has Anakin at his least interesting, part 4 has Luke yet to develop into darker areas.  Ford is perfect as Han Solo  he adds character and flair to some dry performances.  Alec Guinness adds maturity to the whole film and is so good is Obi Wan that even Ewan McGregor just does an impression rather than recreate the role.  Darth Vader is just the right side of silly camp villain, Jones' voice is a perfect fit and he has real menace and power. Bits players such as Chewie, C3PO, R2D2 etc all add comedy in spades.Overall this film is even better now that we know how it all fits together in Star Wars `history'.  But even without all the hype this is a really fun sci-fi that is enjoyable, simple and really good fun to watch if you're in the mood.  Having a deeper perspective on it just makes it all the better.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""A New Hope"" is not the Star Wars I want to see","(Short Review)
Here is something that George Lucas does not seem to understand about film: Movies DO get finished--they are finished when they are published to theaters (whether Mr. Lucas likes it or not), and finished movies are relics of the time in which they were first released into the world. I am not a Star Wars fan, and I probably never will be, because I am alienated by the definitive so-called ""special"" editions and I will never get past the fact that I can never, ever see the first film in its original form. A film (as well as its subsequent sequels) so pervasive and inescapable in American pop culture should not be tampered with at the whims of one man's ""vision.""Watching ""A New Hope,"" the obvious edits are very jarring and distracting, and it is frustrating to know that there may be several more alterations that I didn't notice because I can never compare it to the original. I can never evaluate the film ""Star Wars"" because, for all intents and purposes, it doesn't exist anymore. Who knows what rating I would give it? ""A New Hope"" is only a defiled remnant of what is widely considered to be one of the greatest films of all time, and for that it only deserves a 6 at best.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
tedious,"I wanted to like this film and I had created memories about how good it was when I saw it 20 years ago. But after seeing it again as an adult, I found it really really tedious. The special effects were still good for that time and absolutely does not distract from the film. What made this movie awful was the dialogue ... George Lucas simply cannot write decent dialogue nor can he write jokes and it shows painfully over and over again.The pacing at Tatooine was too slow. A lot of doing nothing and that's fine but then it would need more interesting camera angles.

A long time ago in a childhood not too far away...,"Princess Leia is captured and held hostage by the Imperial Army as it seeks to rule the Galactic Empire. An old Jedi Knight by the name of Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi may just be hers, and the rebels only hope. Teaming up with farm boy Luke Skywalker, scoundrel Captain Han Solo, and a couple of quirky droids, Kenobi sets off on a mission that could well shape the destiny of the Galaxy, and all who dwell within it.Back in 1977 I was but a wee 11 year old boy, weened on films from all genres by my movie loving parents, I had no idea that Star Wars was to have the same impact on me as Jaws had two summers previously, where yet again I found myself queueing around the block for two whole hours to see a film in a one screen theatre. My love of cinema firmly cemented, Star Wars was the start of a love affair that lasts to this very day.As the years have rolled by and my love of cinema has taken on more in-depth and serious tones, I have come to realise that Star Wars proves to be a far from flawless picture. Certainly its detractors do point to some frayed acting and call the plot structure a jazzed up good versus evil axis, while the charge of George Lucas referencing many prior pictures most assuredly stands, but really do those things matter? No they do not, because Star Wars opened up a new world of cinema, something of a portal to youngsters such as I, it got people talking and debating about the merits of model work in films (which is of an extraordinary high standard here), it nudged film makers to explore being bigger and bolder in their approach, and crucially, above all else, it got film goers hungry again, a hankering for more please if you may. Now it has to be said that all that followed 20th Century Fox's historic blockbuster didn't run with the baton, in fact most pale into comparison on impact value, but for better or worse (depending on the discerning viewers peccadilloes), Star Wars stands as a bastion of adventure laden entertainment.It is by definition one of the most successful films in history, George Lucas perhaps didn't know it at the time, but in what was to become an almost operatic anthology, he didn't just make a movie, he created a whole new world seeping with style and rich texture. Almost as amazing as the success of the series, is how it has become part of modern day pop culture, anything from religion to everyday speak has at some time or another referenced Lucas' baby. Ultimately, though, it's one single thing that made (and still does make) Star Wars so great, it's that it has the ability to lift the audience into a rousing united feel good cheer; and that is something that few films can ever lay claim too. In 1977 it was an awe inspiring event to watch in the theatre, now here in my middle age it's an event that is like hugging a dear old friend, a friend that I know will never ever let me down no matter how many times I turn to it. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The film that shaped pop culture,"Star Wars is great cinema. One of the great things about it is the visuals, the opening shot where the Star Destroyer flies over while chasing the Rebel Blockade Runner is amazing. The music is also fantastic, it evokes early epic movie scores by the likes of Erich Wolfgang Korngold and Miklos Rozsa and also hearkens back to Classical music in the romantic period, especially to Wagner and Holst. The characters and story are somewhat basic but that's part of whats great about the movie, it has an archetypal, mythic quality.Some have said that the only reason this movie is highly regarded is because of people who as as children and idolize it for nostalgic reasons, well as someone who saw for the first time at the age of 16, I can attest that it's stands on it's own very well.It does have a few flaws. The dialogue can be corny at times. Luke's remorse over his aunt and uncles death seems rather short lived, particularly compared to his sadness over Ben Kenobi's death. Despite these flaws Star Wars is still an excellent film. Highly recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"One of the most popular films of all time, and understandably so","I was never a ""Star Wars"" guy growing up. I wouldn't say that I was a ""Star Trek"" guy growing up either (""Doctor Who"" was my sci-fi franchise of choice growing up, and still is, even though I'm not a big fan of Russell T. Davies' version of the show), but I would definitely choose my favorite episodes of the original series or ""Deep Space 9"", ""The Wrath of Khan"", and ""The Undiscovered Country"" over any ""Star Wars"" film. I've seen the original trilogy a couple of times previously, once as a kid, once in my mid-teens, and now I sit down to watch ""Star Wars"" again, having been inspired by catching half of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" on TV recently and being enthralled by it.The first thing that struck me is how great the opening shot is, just after the scrolling text that is. The rest of the movie was pretty much how I remembered it being- a collection of great set-pieces and memorable characters, and a great mythology, but with a story which wasn't nearly as grand and great as ""The Empire Strikes Back"". Although a point of criticism aimed at ""Star Wars"" by its (relatively few) detractors is that it doesn't quite match the real feel of a 30's/40's serial, I think that it really does, and not only in the way it is shot and the transitional wipes and all that, but in the writing, the acting, and just about everything else. It has that same sense of adventure, and although this particular film is nowhere near as good as some of my favorite serials, it remains something which very accurately captures the feel of watching one of those, and its popularity (and the popularity of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"") is hence quite understandable, as very few of even the big summer blockbusters have the same sensibility and sense of adventure, and well, fun.Watching ""Star Wars"", in spite of it not being my favorite of the original trilogy, serves as a reminder of the talent which George Lucas had at one point. I don't think this film is as good as his previous effort, ""American Graffiti"", which is the greatest 'coming of age' film I've ever seen, and one of the most beautiful films ever made from a visual standpoint, but it's still got spirit and energy which his later efforts just don't. It's quite sad, really.There's really nothing I can say that hasn't been said already (which is true, certainly of many popular films, but this is freakin' ""Star Wars"", so trust me, I have NOTHING to add to what has already been said). There are ""Star Wars"" devotees who swear it is the greatest of the trilogy and one of the best movies ever made, there are detractors who think it's cheesy nonsense, and then there are others like me who like it quite a bit, but aren't sure where all the extravagant praise comes from. ""The Empire Strikes Back""... Well, that's a whole other story.8/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Rather Good...,"Star Wars begins as a really dull, flat, and boring film. 25 minutes into the film, and I still couldn't care less about the main characters. To be perfectly honest, I considered turning off the movie at that point, ranking it a 1 on IMDb, and writing a harsh review. But about 5 minutes later, the film really picks up, coinciding with the first appearance of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness). That's when the film becomes ""watchable"". It becomes entertaining as soon as Han Solo (Harrison Ford) appears.What's wrong with the first 25 minutes? It's just plain boring. Perhaps the biggest error is having the majority of the first 15 minutes spoken in an incomprehensible alien language. It is just so flat, that the appearance of Luke Skywalker does almost nothing to balance it out. But as soon as the plot picks up, it doesn't slow down.I also hate George Lucas' direction. His eternally wooden camera does little other than panning throughout this movie, and in fact, his career.James Earl Jones delivers an amazing performance as Darth Vader (O.K., I know he does only his voice, but still, that guy's voice is AMAZING!). Vader is the perfect choice for a movie villain: that mask is creepier than any deformed or disfigured face could be: always expressionless, constantly breathing heavily He's just plain, old-fashioned scary! This movie certainly has some fantastic acting, particularly from Harrison Ford, Alec Guinness, James Earl Jones (of course), and Mark Hamill (who would later voice the Joker in Batman: The Animated Series).Of course, the movie has its faults, especially when it comes to characters. Chewbacca and R2-D2 are quite possibly more annoying than watching Ace Ventura: The Animated Series.So overall, Star Wars begins very boring, but is very entertaining by the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Masterpiece in disguise,"Some claim that Star Wars is nothing more than a simple morality tale that borrowed from classic mythology with good special effects.  Comments have been made about the film that it has a simple story and that the movie has simple characters.  While all of these claims may have some validity, to say that the film has no depth is unfair.  When one studies how much thought really was put in Lucas' trilogy, they should be amazed. While the film borrows from mythology, Lucas has made sure that each film has a major twist from its ancestors.  In the first film for example, Luke goes to rescue a princess, but instead she is the one that ends up saving him. Not only does the story telling have a twist on classic mythology, it has an underlying theme and many sub-themes that no other movie can match. After studying the trilogy, redemption is the theme most often explored. Every major ""good"" character in the trilogy at one time falls and then redeems himself. The ultimate redemption being Darth Vader who will be the main character in the new trilogy being developed as I type. As for the characters being simple, this seems unfair.  They are archtypes.  Characters common throughout all cultures.  Also, all the major characters have motivation for their actions unlike most good guy/bad guy movies.  The bad guys in the films are bad because of human flaws such as the struggle for power and greed.  They are not simple bad for bad's sake. Even the main villain of the trilogy becomes very human by the end of the trilogy when he redeems himself.  The film doesn't show the bad guys only as something to shoot at, but as human beings that have been lead astray.  The two trilogies are ultimately about how a human being can become a monster, and that a monster is still a human being in the end. The Star Wars trilogy has more depth than at first glance.  Though it does have spectacular effects, this is only to pull the viewer into the great story-telling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
a film that opened new doors,"It is a shame that not any other of George Lucas's films were as fun and inspiring as his unforgettable epic ""Star Wars: A New Hope"". It was a film that has since been spoofed and ripped-off in many forms of media. It has five sequels, and has many branch-off television series. And it is undeniably one of the most financially successful and definitely one of the better science-fiction films of this or any other age.""Star Wars"" has one of the most brilliantly constructed and detailed alternative reality settings ever. Literally everything in it makes the ""galaxy"" seem like a real place. Not only is there civilizations of humans, but civilizations of other creatures, and there are livestock and other creatures like in our world. Names such as droids, banthas, and wookiees work out. But I do feel that the ""sandpeople"" could've had a more compelling name. The concept of blasters and lightsabers were pure genius and the effects used on these weapons were state-of-the-art for their time. The props and CGI used for the other creatures, such as Chewbacca, may not be acceptable if ""Star Wars"" came out today, but were great for back then. Costume design was magnificent, especially the great details put into the villainous character of Darth Vader, who is perhaps the most memorable movie villain ever. Although he wouldn't really make his terror so profound and complete until the first sequel ""The Empire Strikes Back."" The concept of the Death Star is also a fine one.But while ""Star Wars"" most certainly looks great in terms of detail and special effects, and even moreso on the entertainment level, there are some details that I have a really hard time accepting. Mostly, it's concerned with the screenplay. George Lucas is truly a great screenwriter when it comes to developing story, but when it comes to dialogue, he's not the best there is. Some of the dialogue in the film, mostly the lines spoken by Princess Leia, make me wince. For example her quote ""I should have known it was you holding Vader's lease. I smelled your foul stench when I was brought onboard."" What sensible person would even think of saying a line that dumb? I also personally felt that Luke Skywalker asked WAY too many questions and too many times. In the Tatooine part of the movie, he asks ""Do you know what he's talking about?"" numerous times, more than necessary. And all of the lines featuring the word ""sandpeople"" just seemed weakening to the script. The ""sandpeople"" were suppose to sound frightening, but they just sound pathetic.Basically, the one and only thing that I have wrong with ""Star Wars"" is its dialogue sequences. And that is because George Lucas's weakness at writing is dialogue, which he freely admits to. But that does not make ""Star Wars"" a bad movie. Perhaps I was disappointed with it, but it's still a great movie to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The most over-rated movie of all time.,"I liked this movie when it first came out.  As a teenager, I saw it about seven or eight times (there was nothing else to do on weekends.)  About twenty years went by before I saw it again, on cable.  How time dulls the memory!  ""Star Wars"" now has an odd, nauseating effect on me: the 70's haircuts, laughable costumes, cheesy dialog, fake visual effects, corny music, uninteresting soap-opera plot... (I could go on and on.) I sat there, before the flickering screen, enveloped in ""Star Wars'"" suffocating stupidity, wondering how in the hell I could ever have liked this thing. I finally came to my senses and turned the channel after hearing John Williams' irritating ""Darth Vader"" theme for the 600th time in the first 40 minutes. Why George Lucas decided we needed to hear this high-volume musical cue EVERY time we see Darth Vader on screen is beyond me.  Maybe he just thinks his audience is extremely stupid and is incapable of remembering that Darth Vader is supposed to be evil.  I don't know...It would be easy to dismiss this movie as nothing but fluff to entertain kids (because that's all it is, and all it was ever intended to be) but unfortunately, for many people, this thing has become their religion. Folks, get a life before it's too late! It's just a movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The movie that changed pop culture,"In 1977 Star Wars was released and 40 years after its release, pop culture still feels the impact that Star Wars brought it. Fantasy and sci-fi was combined in this classic cult, but the most charming thing about this movie is its characters, although being just introduced and not developed, but that's not a problem at all, in the following episodes they gained more development and deepth. Luke, Han, Leia and Kenobi were all interesting characters, and C3PO and R-2D2 are the most charismatic characters of the movie. Darth Vader, with such a magnificent and well-done design, have a strong presence in screen and keeps you interested about what are his motivations and backgroung, aside from what Obi-Wan told about him in the beginning, we don't know so much about the character.The movie is something unique and keeps you captivated from the very first minute, first with the opening crawl text, and then with the Rebellion's ship looking so small before the imposing and powerful Star Destroyer of the Empire, and now on you're on great piece of pop art. George Lucas marvelously manage to entertain with his space opera adventure, inspired by the Flash Gordon films, and the movie follow ""The Hero's Journey"" structure, from the work of Joseph Campbell ""The Hero with a Thousand Faces"", structure that now are already done beacause of its countless uses.The visual effects, something pioneering from its time, are astonishing, even to today's standards, I think, and of course I'm removing the changes that George Lucas has it done in the DVD and Blu-Ray releases, as the addition of Jabba the Hutt.The soundtrack of John Williams adds SO MUCH to the film. The theme song of Star Wars is something that everyone knows because of how iconic it is, and sounds like a anthem. The scene when Luke is looking at the sunset of Tatooine, and then The Force Theme begins to plays, is really, really something special and out of this world, and I know that everyone had goosebumps when seem it.The cultural relevance of Star Wars will continue to the foreeable future, and it's all thanks to George Lucas and this incredible movie, that will be relevant to generations to come. A New Hope is timeless, wonderful and one of the best fantasy movies to ever exist.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Brilliant, entertaining space epic of good versus evil","This is an incredibly entertaining and well crafted space epic that has become a modern day legend and spawned several (for me, disappointing) sequels and prequels. This classic is a basic story of good versus evil, combined with a futuristic space setting and special effects. While it may be kind of fun to jokingly tell others 'May the force be with you', no one should seriously be getting their theology from it (as a few cult like followers seem to) since really, it's essentially a science fiction fairy tale.As everyone must surely know, this original Star Wars tells the story of a handsome young farm boy and our hero, Luke Skywalker, who teams up with Han Solo, Chewbacca, a couple of 'droids' (C-P3O and R2-D2), and of course the grand master, Obi-Wan Kenobi to protect the galaxy from the villainous Darth Vader and save the beautiful Princess Leia from the clutches of the Evil Empire.The movie became part of everyday life in the late 1970's and 1980's, and the phrase 'Evil Empire' so commonplace and universally understood that President Raegan used it to describe the Communist regime of the former Soviet Union. His proposed plans for defensive space weaponry even became known as the Star Wars missile defense program.The actors are all perfect in their roles. Mark Hamill gives a charming boy next door heroism to the young Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford a charismatic magnetism to Solo, Carrie Fisher a vulnerability, yet smart and feisty competence to the captive Princess, and Alec Guinness a mature wisdom to Kenobi. Of course the real stars of the show are C-P3O and R2-D2, an extremely lovable character who never actually speaks but simply pops and whistles. Each droid has a clearly defined personality and their interaction together is priceless.It's a great story with wonderfully noble, courageous heroes and dark, dreadful villains. Wonderful special effects of course and star fighting action sequences. In fact, the problem for me with the later Star Wars movies is that, apart from developing the character of Darth Vader and revealing the origin of his wickedness, the other films are primarily effects, star fighting, and galactic bars. Short on plot for adults, in my opinion. I really enjoyed this original picture, but found the prequels and sequels boring to sit through. Also, the Star Wars movies do not have anything comparable to the character interaction present in the Star Trek TV series or films, which I much prefer to Star Wars, even this original episode.However, George Lucas and his string of Star Wars pictures are a legend, and this first movie at least is a barrel of entertainment for both kids and adults.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Perfect adventure movie,"How many influences did Lucas bring together for the first truly big sci-fi (ish) box office smash? Classic Samurai films, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Buck Rodgers. He took a clash of the greatest adventures of the first half of the twentieth century and brought them all into a single, sublime movie.Read/seen/played a kid with his parents/guardians murdered by the bad guys? Or a slightly mysterious/wise/cooky old teacher to teach the protagonist the ""ways"" of whatever? Or perhaps a grinning, sarcastic buddy that gets the protagonist out of trouble? Odds are if it was made sometime past 1977 you have Star Wars to thank for that.Heck, the very idea of background characters being named and rising to prominence is thanks to this movie. Or more specifically thanks to the toys eventually born out of it. Lucas negotiated the toy and merchandising rights and went right to work putting out every character there was, and since they had to have names in order to sell they were given names. Thus birthing the idea that characters once thought totally unimportant might be more than they seemed for fans of an IP.Oh, and as for the movie itself? One of the best scored movies in history, there might not be another movie in history with music more easily or widely recognizable than Star Wars. It was also written in a way so easy to wrap your head around that much of the dialogue can be recognized even by people that have seen it maybe once or twice.But the biggest claim I would make for the original Star Wars is that its the best edited and paced movie in history. Every movie study and screenplay writing example I've seen (and having taken college classes, and seen quite a few I have wide sample) has the original Star Wars as its perfect example of how to pace a movie. If you want to look for the perfect example of ""the roller-coaster"" of movie excitement, rising action spaced out with occasional dips, rising to a peak and then falling as the story ends are tied together; well, you're going to find its the original Star Wars.Like with any category of product or scientific field, forms of entertainment have things that shove them forward, that innumerable people after the fact owe a lot too. ""Standing on the shoulders of giants"" as it were. And Star Wars is one such thing, a giant of entertainment that so many works after it have stood upon to reach for their own heights.But even more important than that, it's just a damned fun movie. I've seen it more times than I care to admit. And yet even years later, years after the rabid Star Wars fanhood of my preteens has long faded, after I've grown bored and have little interest in seeing most any movie a second time I can still watch the original Star Wars and by the end have a huge grin on my face.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The start to an epic adventure,"A New Hope will forever go down in history as the start of one of the greatest cinematic adventures of all time. This movie is everything - from characters, to character development, to the introduction of John Williams' famous score, to crafting a great conflict between the protagonist and antagonist.The character development of Luke Skywalker in this movie alone shows nothing less than great storytelling. At the start of this movie, Luke just wanted to go to the ""Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!"", and by the end of the movie he's using the force to help destroy the greatest weapon of all time: ""That's no moon. It's a space station.""While I was not alive in 1977, I can only imagine the audiences reaction after seeing this gem of a film.

"A classic tale of heroism, of magic and revenge","Before there was a trilogy, before there were prequels, before there was an expanded universe with hundreds of books, comics and video games, before Greedo shot first and before Jar Jar Bink was a speck of light in George Lucas' eye, there was Star Wars. Even if it's not the best film in the series (it's not), Star Wars deserves its own place in the history of cinema, as a work that changed Hollywood forever. It brought back the grandness of the epic cinema of the 30's and 40's and multiplied it, creating a new era of spectacle and excitement.Unlike the rest of the films, there's absolutely no need for an expanded universe or a complete saga to appreciate the original Star Wars by its own right. It's a complete tale, a classic saga that takes its queues from historical epics, samurai films and serials, and contains every aspect of the timeless hero's journey. The fact that it takes place 'in a galaxy far, far away' is trivial - though it did help the film have a bigger impact.Star Wars has very little to do with science fiction; not much of the science in it makes any sense, it might as well be magic. But that's what made it so powerful, and what made the prequels - that tried to explain everything away - so disappointing. Luke Skywalker's story is a classic story of the simple farm-boy who leaves his home and becomes a hero, and for that reason exactly it's timeless, and resonates with audiences even now.Now go see The Empire Strikes Back.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The coolest STAR WARS ever!,"STAR WARS EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE is a film that I really enjoyed when I first saw it and I knew from the beginning I would love it and this was the first in a much bigger series and the fourth film in the STAR WARS franchise overall (in chronological order).The story is amazing for a 2 hour film and the film does not feel like it's 2 hours because it goes by really quick and I really think it's just amazing and spectacular and fantastically well-made and there are reasons why it is the best movie of all time and it's the best film ever made.THE CHARACTERS: Luke Skywalker is our main protagonist and he is played by Mark Hamill and he is really spectacular. He is my favorite character, along with Yoda, Chewbacca, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Darth Vader, C3PO and R2D2, Mace Windu, Padme, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Emperor Palpatine.Hamill does not fail in anything and his performance was really great and just amazing. Carrie Fisher was really fantastic as Princess Leia and she is not the normal damsel-in-distress in today's movies and she was the right choice for the character. Harrison Ford is really nice as Han Solo and all three actors would later become famous for their roles in these films and they really do a very well good job.Harrison Ford would play both Han Solo in the original STAR WARS trilogy and Indiana Jones in the INDIANA JONES franchise, which I will get to.The next performance is the late Alec Guiness in the best role of his career as Obi-Wan Kenobi and he should have won an Oscar for his part. Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Peter Mayhew plays C3PO, R2-D2 and Chewbacca in this film and they do a really outstanding job.George Lucas does a very good job creating an epic space opera series that starts off with the middle of the series and that is not possible in today's film making world, but was possible for 1977 and he does a very good job writing and directing and the screenplay he wrote is one of the best screenplays that I have ever read before in my life.John Williams composed one of the greatest musical scores ever created for a film and his Star Wars theme song is one of my favorite musical themes ever credits.The visual effects back then were amazing and so were the lightsaber battles and the dogfight sequences and they were really cool back in 1977 and it was really cool and just amazingly created and today, they still look amazingly well-done. I have seen the 1997 special edition of this film and I think it is really good, but I also love the theatrical version is just really cool and just fantastic.Overall, I love STAR WARS EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE and the movie is getting a 10 out of 10 from me because everything is just really great and fantastic to inspire a lot of filmmakers including Christopher Nolan, Joss Whedon, Ridley Scott, James Cameron, John Singleton, Dean Devlin and Peter Jackson and it also inspired future filmmakers including myself.It's a smash hit, 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Unforgettable Episode,"During the attack of the Empire's forces under the command of Darth Vader (David Prowse) to her spacecraft, the rebel Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) hides in the memory of R2-D2 the plans of the powerful Empire's Station Death Star that spies from the Rebel Alliance have stolen. She assigns the droid to deliver the plans to Obi-Wan Kenobi with a message to give the plans to the rebels. R2-D2 flees to the Planet Tatooine with his fellow C-3PO in a space pod and land on the desert, but they are captured by Jawa traders. They are sold to Owen Lars (Phil Brown) and when his nephew Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is cleaning the droid, he accidentally activates part of the message and he wonders whether it would be addressed to the old Ben Kenobi. On the next morning, Luke discovers that R2-D2 is seeking out Obi-Wan Kenobi and he goes after him with C-3PO. They are attacked by the Tusken Raiders and saved by a drifter, who is Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) that tells part of his past as Jedi to Luke. He also tells that his father was a Jedi Knight and gives a light-saber that belonged to his father to Luke. Obi-Wan invites Luke to travel with him to Alderaan and when he finds that his family was killed by the Imperial soldiers, he decides to join Obi-Wan in his quest.

What will happen to the group and Princess Leia? Will they succeed in delivering the information to the rebels?""Star Wars"", later retitled ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" is the unforgettable and charming sci-fi adventure that surprised the world in 1977. The strategy of George Lucas that claimed that there was no technology available to the cinema industry in 1977 to produce the three first chapters was part of a marketing strategy that kept alive the interest of fans fro the whole six chapters, In sequence, great part of the mystery would not have raised. All the films are engaging, but none of them can beat this one rated #19 in IMDb. Harrison Ford in the top of his career and the cast show a wonderful chemistry.

Excellent Excess,"The very first note of John Williams's horn-blaring score as the film's title in thousand-foot-high block letters flashes on screen is the very moment when American film-making turned inexorably to big-budget, grand-themed audiovisual extravaganza strung together with simple stories, snappy catchphrases & cutesy jokes. But if George Lucas decided to follow Henry Ford rather than John Ford, he built a Shelby Cobra & left Pinto-making to his many, many imitators. Ironically, he himself remade one of the finest works of film master Akira Kurosawa, the Western-themed ""Hidden Fortress,"" with one scene (the fight in the bar) lifted from ""Yojimbo."" As a result, ""Star Wars"" has a bit of the jittery discomfort of characters trying to fit into a story that wasn't quite made for them, like people with past life experiences that intrude into the present. Kurosawa's hero is split not into two but THREE heroes in ""Star Wars"" (four if you include the princess, who has a more prominent role in ""Star Wars""). Hamill's Luke is often overshadowed by Kenobi (Guinness, whose skill had aged better than any fine wine) and Solo (Ford, in the role that deservedly made him a star), though he often holds his own as the clueless but determined farmboy-turned-hero. In less than five minutes, ""Star Wars"" sets the standard of outer-space audiovisual special effects that the industry was bound to follow from then on, forever sweeping away the earnest, toylike realism that Gerry Anderson was then giving us in ""Space: 1999"" in favor of exhausting but beautiful orgies of fast, violent, sweeping movement culminating in explosions of bright color & blaring sound. No wonder there's never any sex. ""Star Wars"" is science fiction only because it's set in outer space, by which standard ""Dirty Harry"" is a detective story & ""Last Tango in Paris"" a romance. Little attempt is made to explain the technological wonders depicted (we never find out why light sabers never have to be recharged or get even a cursory explanation of the Death Star). What little science there is can't be counted on, as when Solo extols the drag-racing abilities of the Millennium Falcon in parsecs, which are units of distance, not elapsed time. But Lucas never means to educate, only to entertain. Solo is a smuggler, not a science officer, while the others are not doctors or engineers but warriors, royalty or villains. Lucas's hammerhanded excess works because it never lets up & never goes for the cheap & easy. Though the heroes are unconvincing, ""Star Wars"" creates an array of badguys in the Galactic Empire that remain unsurpassed in cinema, headed by Darth Vader, who makes the Wicked Witch of the West look like Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle. In another irony, the most memorable scene in ""Star Wars"" is the motionless roundtable conference chaired by Tarkin (Cushing, in the greatest role of his long career) which yielded phrases long & gleefully repeated by a delighted America (""This station is now the ultimate power in the universe!"" ""This bickering is pointless!"" ""I find your lack of faith disturbing""). Perhaps, with the space program petering out & the hard realities of nuclear energy coming home to us, our fascination with scientific exploration was wearing thin. In the 1960s it enabled the cast of ""Star Trek"" to bring the writings of sci-fi geniuses to life with cardboard & aluminum foil. Never again. What better honor, or infamy if you like, could there be to ""Star Wars"" than that the ""Star Trek"" movies of the 1980s followed the simple themes, cuteness & spectacular effects of ""Star Wars,"" turning their backs on their own heritage of awed exploration? Perhaps that first detractors and then supporters of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative nicknamed it ""Star Wars"" so convincingly that the original name was quickly forgotten. The film might be a bit dated with its holistic, New Age mysticism (feel the force FLOWING through you!) which likely owes more to Jack Kerouac than Musashi Miyamoto & which became more difficult to depict with a straight face the farther the sequels & prequels went. Nevertheless, it was a worthy successor to the Code of the West, especially in contrasting Darth Vader with Luke & Kenobi. ""Star Wars"" can't really be judged by the standards of other films, partly because it reset the standards & partly because it became, most unusually, the fourth in a series of six! But there's no doubt that it's a heroic sensory extravaganza that will leave the viewer at once exhausted & exhilarated--and will do it over & over again, without offending, condescending or making one think too hard.

What really gets me,"It's what movies are all about, really - sitting in a seat that's already been worn in by a thousand other tushes, crunching as much popcorn under your feet as you crunch in your mouth by handfuls, sipping a soda that's three times as big as you would ever really need... and then there's this very quiet little opening line written on the screen, like a new way of saying ""once upon a time..."" and you know the fairy tale is beginning, but before you can even get ready to get interested, that fateful, stirring, uplifting and scary chord throws you deep into your seat, in time with a logo that's too big for the screen... and the rest is just a ride.

"A Cinematic Feat Of Imagination, Vision & Creativity That Hypnotized An Entire Generation!","This is the film that started it all. The first instalment in the Star Wars saga that would later go on to revolutionise its genre, change the landscape blockbuster filmmaking & become a cultural phenomenon, Star Wars (also known as Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope) is a cinematic feat of imagination, vision & creativity that hypnotized an entire generation with its freshly envisioned & awe-inspiring world, first-rate adventure, interesting characters, state-of-the-art visuals & an epic soundtrack.Having no nostalgic relation whatsoever with this epic space opera, all I can say is that my first stint with Star Wars didn't go as well as I anticipated. Where others heaped praise upon its visual effects, set pieces & other stuff, I found it to be a picture that wasn't just awfully dated but also terribly juvenile, filled with cartoonish creatures, unintentionally hilarious & pretty mediocre in all departments. The ingredients that made it a revolution of its time are visible beneath its degraded visuals but it's not as timeless as they say it is.Set in a galaxy far far away, Star Wars finds the galaxy in a state of civil war for a conflict brews between the Galactic Empire & the Rebel Alliance. The plot focuses on Luke Skywalker, a young boy on a desert planet who inadvertently acquires a pair of droids that possess vital information from Princess Leia regarding the Empire's latest weapon plus her request for help, following which he joins forces with a Jedi Knight, a couple of smugglers & his two droids to rescue the princess from the evil Darth Vader and save the galaxy from the Empire's tyranny.Written & directed by George Lucas, Star Wars is his pet project that permanently engraved his name in the annals of cinema and later spawned a franchise that would go on to redefine epic filmmaking. What's commendable is the mythology Lucas created from the scratch, taking inspirations from different sources but adding an original touch to it. The movie features a simple good vs evil storyline, but what elevates it above mediocrity is its then-sweeping special effects, innovative filmmaking techniques, fascinating set pieces, stunning score, few excellent characterisations & a sense of something new yet familiar.Considering the time it was released, Production design team makes efficient use of its limited budget to come up with wonderfully detailed set pieces, the stupid-looking aliens are brought to life with puppetry or whatever means was available back then, Cinematography exhibits some inventiveness which is quite evident from the first frame. Visual effects was groundbreaking in the 1970s but has severely degraded over the years and looks very cartoonish nowadays. Editing provides a consistent pace & fine flow to its narrative but its 121 minutes can become suffocating if you're not intrigued by its fantasy world.And then there is John Williams who contributes with an iconic score that evokes a sense of epicness at all times plus his soundtrack comprises of tracks that beautifully compliment the story's adventurous ambiance. Coming to the performances, Star Wars is notable for launching the acting career of many and features quite an ensemble in Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alec Guinness & others who chip in with fine inputs in their given roles. Although nearly all the characters present in this film became part of the modern culture, Darth Vader is the only one that was impressive in my opinion, plus James Earl Jones' voice did add an intimidating quality to him.On an overall scale, Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope may not look as dazzling & revolutionary today as it was during its time of release but its influence on later sci-fi space operas & other films cannot be understated. For me, this was more or less disappointing for its severely outdated visual encapsulation never allowed me to take any of the unfolding events seriously and for the most part, it was downright laughable. It may have evoked an entirely different reaction from me if I had seen it at least 15 years ago but as of now, even though the effect of Star Wars on its genre, blockbusters & film marketing can still be felt, I feel no love for the saga that many happen to be so crazy about.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"As an individual film, it's good but could be better","For reference, I'm a 21 year old female in search of the best comfort films/series. My favourites include Harry Potter, The Vampire Diaries, The Summer I Turned Pretty, and more. If you have similar taste this review is for you.I think that what's so off about this series ""openers"" is that they truly didn't plan anything around the future prequels.This was, and would've been a great introduction to the series if they'd left it as is, but watching it after the first 3 prequel films, it's just too flat. Honestly, if I had my time back, I would've watched them in order of release instead.We already know almost all of the characters (besides Han Solo and Chewy), and their purposes are extremely predictable. Of course, they needed to find a way to bring the main three together, but that's basically all that happened in this film. There were no great twists or anything surprising in this one, so for that reason, I can't rate it any higher.But there are a lot of positives too. All of the characters have large personalities and great chemistry. In my opinion that's always the most important thing about a series.The plot was entertaining, and it has a very specific vibe. It just gives off that classic Star Wars energy (obviously), but I think that's so important. It makes it irreplaceable.It's definitely grabbed my attention, and I'm happy to continue watching.

I get all choked up just thinking about it.,"There was no way my review of this classic slab of pulp sci-fi was ever going to be anything but glowing; as a nine year old I saw George Lucas' space opera on its original release and instantly became one of a legion of fans who spent the next twenty years worshipping at the altar of the great turkey-necked director (until The Phantom Menace shattered all of my illusions).Thirty years on, and I'm revisiting Star Wars with my two children, hoping that they will fall in love with it as much as I did, way back when all that seemed important was having a bag-full of marbles and a decent sized pile of comics to read.I'm not going to describe the plot (surely you know that!), nor am I going to go into great detail about how Lucas borrowed elements from the movies he loved to bring us his epic about a farm boy who becomes a legendary warrior; all I can say is that the film has lost none of its ability to astound and my kids sat entranced (despite not being able to follow the story without the benefit of some additional info from their sci-fi geek dad). My son (who is only three and a half ) might not understand what a 'rebellion' is, and my daughter (nearly six) may struggle with the concept of 'the force', but both got a kick from witnessing the whole Star Wars universe for the very first time.Chewbacca was an instant hit with my boy, whereas my girl identified with Leia, the gutsy princess. Both of them loved the brilliantly realised landscapes, aliens, robots and spaceships that have wowed film-fans for three decades (and who can blame themthe attention to detail and sheer creativity in design, costume, and make-up is staggering).It has since become evident that old George ain't always the greatest writer or director in the world (the last three Star Wars movies are proof of that); however, when he does get it right, he works miracles (he wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark tooanother solid gold movie).Star Wars is perfect family entertainment that delivers amazing spectacle, unforgettable characters and enough movie magic to last a lifetime. In fact, why not do yourself a favour: get off the internet and go watch it right now (even if you have seen it hundreds of times before).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Ultimate Modern Fairy Tale,"This film single-handedly changed modern cinema to what we know it to be today. It is the ultimate modern fairy tale. A young knight runs off with a wise old wizard to save the princess from the clutches of evil. Of course, it runs a little deeper than that, and makes the old tale of good versus evil so much more compelling. Setting it long ago in a galaxy far, far away is pure genius and it introduces us to a futuristic galaxy of beautiful style and diversity that leaves us with a fantastic space opera. Despite its unfamiliar setting, we can relate to all the characters. There's the handsome maverick, the beautiful heroine, the aspiring young knight, the wise old mentor, and the darkly clad villain. Even the droids are characters we can recognise and relate to. What is so special about this film is that the distractions of things like politics, geography, and nationality are eliminated to leave us with simple humanity.

The 4th movie of the Star Wars trilogy, but the first and original Star Wars movie filmed, it starts with a ship being invaded by Darth Vader, who has kidnapped Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). Later on, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) teams up with Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), Ben Kenobi (Alec Guiness), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) in an attempt to rescue the Princess Leia, who leads a group of rebels to defy the evil empire controlled by a ruthless Sith Lord and guarded by his trusted servant, Darth Vader. They must also stop the Death Star from destroying the galaxy. The result is one huge mission to save the galaxy, supported by superb direction and story from George Lucas and a memorable music score from John Williams.Each character was given his/her unique purpose in the movie, but all are committed to achieving triumph of the dark forces of evil.

Different things to like about this,"Well, I just re-watched this on DVD. I first saw it when I was 10 in 1981, and I still love this move (one of my all time favorites), but I guess I love it for some reasons different than most other people:1) The movie has no love story to speak of. This is such a huge bonus that it cannot be stressed enough. For kids a love story is sheer boredom - and there are unfortunately very few films without one. For adults the love story is usually pure BS (as the over romanticizing that goes on in Hollywood movies make any love story a nauseous experience. Episodes V and VI scrape the line of how much love story a movie can take before being totally corny. Lets not talk about how much the love story ruins episodes I and II (and will probably kill episode III also))2) There are no lengths in the movie. It dumps you right in the middle of the conflict after the opening (no opening credits to bore your pants off! This is almost unique amongst films). It practically grabs you before you have gotten comfortable in your seat. The DVD does add some lengths with gratuitous CGI which actually hurt the film more than they help (the ride into Mos Eisley and the Falcon approaching Yavin seem interminable compared to the fast paced cuts of the original version. These scenes break the rhythm of the movie badly, they add neither story nor depth nor information - luckily they are far enough apart not to hurt it too much)3) The special effects are still spectacular after all these years. Not in what they look like but how they are shot, the dynamics of it and the ideas for cool POVs (taking old aerial battle films as scripts was a stroke of genius)4) Detail. This thing is all about attention to detail. There is nothing out of place here. Nothing glossed over by large plastic sheeting. everything has structure and depth and looks used. The world it portrays becomes believable. economies are worked out. This has the look of a good role playing adventure.5) The plot isn't explained by the characters. Characters involved in such a plot for some time are supposed to know what the background is without having to talk to each other about it (nobody needs to be told that the empire is evil, this is common knowledge with these people as they have lived under it for decades). Putting things into the scroller at the beginning which could not be said by the characters because it would be akin to them holding up neon signs displaying ""For the audiences' information"" was a stroke of genius. I cringe at other movies that insert 'let me explain what is happening' scenes.Overall I can see nothing wrong with this movie. The soundtrack and the sound effects are amazing. Some scenes seem to be re-recorded with different sound standards and thus stand out uncomfortably, but this isn't much of a problem. The actors do their jobs well (especially Harrison Ford when he flashes that roguish grin - he is practically the archetype of the lovable, charismatic scoundrel). This DVD is definitely a keeper (10/10).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Evil Force,"I recently revisited this, and remembered first seeing it.It wasn't the first movie to be heavily hyped. But I recall it as the first one to appeal to kids as a big adventure.In a couple ways, what's come since have ruined this. Lucas himself ruined it by deciding to make all those extra ones, making up the story as he went. And of course, every month on average we now have a new special effects movie that matches the star wars franchise in visual ambition. Many of these in fact are fueled by Lucas' several companies.So its impossible to recapture that thrill. At the time, yes we knew he stole from Kurosawa, and leaned heavily on Joseph Campbell's notions of myth. But it all seemed so fresh, and Lucas himself came across as a visionary genius. And we needed that more than we needed entertainment.Remember, the US had just been through its first sleazy republican scandal and the nation as a whole was discouraged. But the world of movies was exploding. Woody Allen gave us ""Annie Hall."" Scorcese became known. And then this. The thing that impressed us at the time was how seriously it took itself, despite how childishly goofy that intergalactic bar was. Also how powerful the sounds and images were.The mythology was so clear. We had it for decades in science fiction and fantasy novels, indeed much better. But this was the first time we had them cinematically, and cinema when it works may be the most powerful of packaged imaginations. Oh how I wish we could see it as we did then.Now we notice, for instance, how ordinary the dogfights are. These used to thrill. We don't have all the mystery that made the thing deep. Now we know who everyone is and what is going on, and it is all so much more ordinary than what we imagined at the time as possibilities.In later years, Lucas would let us down, as a person and in this saga. In fact, I think he ruined some things. But for the year of this event, he was the most celebrated singer in the choir. And by me as well.What do I mean about ruining?Things evolve. When one thing finds a niche and flourishes, it pinches off other things. When ""Birth of a Nation"" became a huge success, it froze movies as filmed plays with a larger stage instead of one of the several other directions it could have taken.Again, there was a period after talkies reinvented the medium where there was a struggle among various different directions. This you can clearly see in the period. In retrospect, it appears as if the world could have only turned out the way it did. But the trends that win aren't the best at all.So ""Star Wars"" opened up a gateway for how effects could transform cinema into something far beyond what we had before. And then it closed that gateway, so that effects now cannot show you something unfamiliar. Instead, it all has to be the familiar taken to some extreme.Yes, it was a goose at the time. But Star Wars killed the greater possibilities of science fiction. In film, at least, and because books are inherently cinematic now, in books too.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I watched six by now (in chronological order) and this was the weakest one.,"After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones and Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, and Rogue One, it's now time for A New Hope. I get it that it's the oldest one and so the special effects are not of the same level as more recent ones but from all the ones I watched by now I thought this was the weakest one. I probably watched it as a kid and gave up after that as it's just not that good. I don't know why this one gets such a high rating, it's definitely not better than any of the previous titles mentioned. I agree that the used special effects at that time might have looked good for 1977 but still it doesn't make it better. For that the story and the acting were just not of the same quality. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing.The Star Wars saga is great because of the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, for that I just love it. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and will probably squeeze The Mandalorian between it, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the sixth movie of eleven in barely 48 hours for me, next one today will be The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi in the hope the quality improves compared to this one, looking forward to it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It never ceases to entertain me.,"George Lucus stunned audiences with this outer space saga when it was released and deservingly so. It was a film quite like nothing anyone had seen before a truly visual and cinematic achievement. The story begins on Chapter IV and takes us on an action packed journey filled with aliens, intrigue and adventure. The success of Star Wars is ultimately due to the wonderful imagination of its director and of course to the extremely well orchestrated cast. I think George Lucas was riding high with his previous film success 'American Graffiti, but this is far removed from Star Wars, no similarities at all. I was simply captivated the first time I saw this film in the cinema's back in '77 and still amalthough the big screen does give it more of an impact. Everything about Star Wars will definitely appeal to a vast audience from children to adults alike.it's a 'must see film' in my opinion. Then when you're finished watching Star Wars, just think; you have only 5 more chapters to go. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

the death of American cinema,"A Macdonald's meal of a movie, all fat sugar salt and caffeine, supersized with whiz bang special effects. Tastes great while you're eating it, but short on nourishment. They did it well enough that this junk food has squeezed pretty much everything good off the menu. The pic is just mediocre, but the trends it started have been horrid. Cornball plotting and dialog is one thing, but the simple-minded good vs. evil masquerading as some sort of authentic spirituality is vomit inducing. The sequel, with its Freudian undertones, has some real conflict and character development and is actually a pretty good popcorn movie.

Star Wars!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Star Wars, now known as Episode IV: A New Hope, is the perfect showcase of everything that makes a movie great. It is one of those occasions where everything in the film seems to of perfectly fell in place(although if you know the story behind the making of it, it wasn't so smooth). The acting, directing, writing, production design, special effects, and anything else I've forgotten, is simply top-notch. This movie did so many things for film, most notably the special effects, but it also gave us three of the greatest young actors of the late 70s and 80s, Mark Hammill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford. Then the film also created the blockbuster, and is the definition of what a blockbuster should be(humor, emotion, action, heart). On the last point the action is probably the most exhilarating and exciting action I've ever seen on film, the Death Star Trench Run is the definite highlight of the film. This film is just simply superb and is picture perfect, and is definitely one of the greatest and most memorable films of all-time. It's hard to believe that this all sprung from one man's imagination, George Lucas(writer/director of the film).

A Fairy Tale Set In Space,"May the fourth be with you everybody! Today, on Star Wars day, I figure it only fitting to review the film that started the whole starry craze, Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress! Nah, just kidding, it's Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope of course. It has been said countless times that Star Wars was based upon the Kurosawa samurai films as well as the Flash Gordon serials of the 1930s and 40s, but in my eyes, it's an all around fairy tale in space. Think about it, you've got the dashing, optimistic hero in Luke Skywalker, the wise, old mentor and hermit in Obi-Wan Kenobi, the damsel in distress mistress in Princess Leia, and the terrifying wizard with black attire in Darth Vader. It's like a Brothers Grimm tale or a tale written by L. Frank Baum, who you all know as the mind behind The Wizard of Oz. But what makes Star Wars great is something I can't sum up in one single review, but I'll certainly give it a try for your sake. This is 1977's Star Wars, the film that changed cinema forever.I can relate to this film on so many levels. I see a lot of myself in the characters of Luke Skywalker, C-3P0 and even the cocky Han Solo, a rebellious lad with a devil may care point of view. I can also look up to Obi-Wan Kenobi, who has become a lot like his master Qui-Gon Jinn by this episode. He has gone from a brash, outspoken padawan who viewed many creatures as useless to a wise old man who saw the potential in all creatures. I love Obi-Wan's wisdom and it's wisdom I live by every minute of everyday of my life. My favorite line of his is ""Who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him?"" He has such a rich perspective of everything and his knowledge of the Force can give you the push you need to go about even the deadliest of tasks. It's his guidance that finally allows Luke to demolish the Death Star at the film's finale and it's probably something that will carry onto mentor Luke in the upcoming Star Wars Episode 7. Obi-Wan is the kind mentor we all wish we could get knowledge from so we could become wiser souls.Darth Vader is a menacing entity and is up there with the Wicked Witch of the West as one of film's greatest foes. The emotionless mask and deep dark voice of James Earl Jones really makes him ever more terrifying than he already is, but if you saw what he once was in Episodes 1,2 and 3, you tend to fear him less and less. It's hard to believe that underneath that breathing helmet is the charred face of Hayden Christensen, a once proud hero with a charming charisma. Little did we know that it would take him two more films until he finally reached his redemption and even than, it was before his untimely demise. Darth Vader is a motion picture icon, not only because of his wickedness and evilness, but because of his tragic past and his fight to gain back what he lost all those years ago. That's what makes an incredible villain, a villain that never wanted to be bad, but was thrust into badness because of one fatal decision.The other characters are also worthy of mention. Mark Hamill prevails as the adventurous, yet good hearted Luke Skywalker who would become the galaxy's most acclaimed hero towards the film's conclusion. Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia is a lot like Dorothy Gale or Alice in Lewis Carroll's classic Wonderland stories. Sure, she gets captured, but she's perfectly capable of defending herself and even defending her companions. She's a fearless woman who is not even afraid of kissing her long lost brother straight on the lips. Harrison Ford's Han Solo is probably the film's most memorable human character and with his headstrong and hipster attitude, he was what a lot of children wanted to be like when they first saw Star Wars back in 77. He's the ideal punk, but he's also the gallant hero and tough guy who's not scared to shoot down some green aliens (Who cares who shot first!) or stormtroopers.Personally, I became more fascinated with the non human characters like Chewbacca (Why didn't he get a medal!), R2-D2 and C-3P0, for like the humans, they were always trying to get the spotlight and give their share to the story. I feel like C-3PO is the most underrated character in all of Star Wars, for he is often seen as a symbol of homosexuality and annoyance. But Star Wars has a timeless story first and for most and this story gets better and better every time you experience it. Every time you experience it, you spot things you never spotted beforehand and that adds to the film's overall charm and magic. Even though it was made in the 70s, it still has the touch of a story that will last forever and never wear out. With all it's grand special effects (no matter what version of the film it is) and alien lifeforms, Star Wars is a storybook with a grand scale and a powerful, prudent moral that all creatures have a force flowing through them, allowing them to reach out and achieve the impossible.I'm not quite sure but I think that's why we love it so much. That's the reason I love it at least.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Simply The Best Of It's Kind,"Since its release way back in 1977, George Lucas' epic masterpiece ""Star Wars"" has gone on to become quite possibly the most popular franchise in motion picture history, with one of the biggest fan followings imaginable. But no matter how much money this franchise makes, or how many people see it, no matter how many sequels or prequels or re-releases or remasters it endures, the original classic still remains to be a very personal film. Despite the success it has undergone since its release, the production of ""Star Wars"" was a highly troubled one, many people expecting it to not even get completed at all. The hard work and dedication that Lucas and his cast and crew went through to get this thing made definitely shows through, and that makes the movie all the more endearing to watch. Quite simply, it's an incredible achievement in movie-making.Now, these films have been discussed to death, but I feel like I'd like to give my own two cents on the subject, and my thoughts could easily be summed up in five words: ""Star Wars"" is absolutely amazing. Everything about it, from the acting, the effects, the story, the mythos, the music, the incredible intrigue that has keep this series alive for so long, it all started here, and it's great. I don't feel like I need to go too in-depth with a plot summary, because this is one of the most iconic films in history, but basically, ""Star Wars"" follows a simple farm boy living on a desert planet named Luke Skywalker, who yearns to fight with the Rebel Alliance against the evil Galactic Empire. Before he knows it, he's thrust into an intergalactic adventure, along with an inventive cast of characters, as he tries to help rescue a princess and destroy the Empire's newest weapon: a space station with the power to destroy planets, called the Death Star.As I said, this movie is awesome. The acting is fantastic all around, each one giving a perfect performance in these incredibly iconic, and unforgettable roles. The inventive special effects are some of the best of their time, and the action sequences are gripping and fantastic, never allowing a dull moment to come through. The story is incredibly fascinating, managing to blend science fiction through the space travel, droids, and aliens, with fantasy through the mystical Force, a defining trait of the Jedi Knights. The intrigue levels are really high here, and it's that intriguing quality that allows viewers to really get invested and really talk in depth about this movie.This film defined a generation. To this day, people still talk about it, and I doubt that it will ever stop being discussed. ""Star Wars"" is one of the best sci-fi fantasy epics ever made, and will always be a binding Force of cinema for the rest of time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This film holds up,"When I was 12, I went to see Star Wars in the theater 32 times. This is the film that made me want to make films. Star wars is a classic in my mind, full of fun, and campy lines..

Luke asks his father's friend Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness) about this, and he discovers that Ben and Obi-Wan are one and the same. Kenobi tells Luke of the battle of the rebels against the ruling Empire and the spiritual energy called ""The Force.""

"Another experience I delayed far, far too long","George Lucas' Star Wars is a project unlike one I've seen before, as cliché and as empty as that statement might sound. It's a monumental achievement in the cinematic world, arguably the biggest one ever, that pioneered special effects work and accommodated for other science-fiction projects to follow in the next decades. When released in 1977, with sufficient hype and outstanding reviews, it was a movie-going experience; thousands of showings were sold out (something you never hear about anymore), universal audiences were captivated, cultists and enthusiasts were born, and the eye-popping technology was cherished and admired by many.Watching Star Wars today (now called Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope with the release of the three prequels), there is still a uniquely affecting vibe that it sends with its compelling visuals and wonderfully articulated characters. It's over thirty years old, but it effectively holds the torch that makes it timeless. No matter how far technology progresses, and even with the onset of computer-animation and a heavy reliance on digital cinema, the look and beauty of Star Wars will likely never die out.Since it appears that everyone has seen the Star Wars movies except for myself, I will spare you the boredom of hearing the plot reiterated for the umpteenth time. Besides, I'm not sure if I could explain it accurately. The film is fast-paced, dynamic, and just works so competently, that after a while, I began to dissolve any questions I had about the plot and just go along for the ride. Consistent readers know what I think of constant cinematic evaluations, and that I find them to often be without a reward and potentially lethal to the likability of a film. Things happen in Star Wars; crazy things, logical things, smart things, frightening things, but above all, enthralling things.Speaking of enthralling things, I must admit how often I felt tension build and suspense become prevalent during the course of this film. For one thing, it's blatantly obvious to people who haven't even seen the series that these characters will make it (hence the two sequels). Yet, during several sequences, I found myself tense and extremely worried for these characters (most notably the scene in the trash chute). When a film can make you fear when you know the outcome is when you know true filmmaking tactics are at hand.Something I have notice happen with older science-fiction films is that one of their downsides is their length due to their special effects showcase. Let me explain; Star Trek: The Motion Picture was a visual marvel when it first came out, but its story was extended out about twenty-five minutes longer than it needed to be because they were showcasing the technology, which was breathtaking at the time. It appears, too, that many fans even recall this fact with a bit of sourness, which is why when people refer to the ""original trilogy"" of the Star Trek films, they usually mean the second film through the fourth one. Star Wars doesn't bear that same quality; it doesn't need to turn the story into a methodical plod just to show off its creative design and visuals. It doesn't feel like a showcase. We get a perfect feel for the environment without having to stare at for an upwards of five minutes.One thing that disheartens me greatly about this series is how controversial it has become. With numerous releases on DVD, and a new one on Blu-Ray, to my knowledge, the only original cuts of the Star Wars films you can see are on the Laserdisc/VHS versions. Because of this, fans have found themselves lambasting decisions made by Lucas, criticizing all the changes he has made to the series on the new releases of the DVDs, his re-releases of the movies in theaters, and lucrative branding/licensing of the figures in the money that, in 2013, continue to flood the store aisles of a Wal-Mart and Toys-R-Us near you. I believe that's one of the contributing reasons to why I never saw or even felt like seeing the original films until now; I felt alienated and bullied, with the series seemingly shoving itself down my throat.On a final note, another impressive element is the charisma and talent of a young Mark Hamill, portraying no one else but Luke Skywalker. Hamill seems like the kind of guy who, after breaking out in Lucas' trilogy of films, would have gone on to do unprecedented projects, but alas, no. Hamill has only acted in either small roles or cameos in films, and hasn't really worked on any other mainstream picture aside from the Star Wars trilogy. While this fact is slightly depressing, as one can only imagine what he could've done, it's fortunate we weren't burdened of seeing him in anything atrocious.Star Wars is, in short, an incorruptible masterpiece on film. A film that launched the genre of science fiction, propelling films about outer space to unheard of heights. It's just incredibly unfortunate to see what dismal treatment it, and its fans, have had to endure since its release.Starring: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford. Directed by: George Lucas.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Objectively well-made film,"Star Wars is very impressive for its time. The story is easy to follow, some scenes are unnecessarily long and some dialogue could have been left out to make the film more compact and re-watchable.Before watching Star Wars I had seen Amercian Graffiti from 1973 and I find it amazing how George Lucas went from a coming-of-age teen film to a sci-fi epic in just a few years, truly inspiring.It goes without saying that this is a trailblazing film, but the re-released version with forced CGI sadly makes it feel less like a 70s movie. Overall quite legendary. Luke and Leia are the best characters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An insult to everyone's intelligence,"The best film ever made, period! Allow me to take a contrary view. Not the best film ever made (Les Enfants du Paradis, The Godfather, The Bicycle Thief). Not the best science fiction film (2001, Bladerunner, Gattaca, Code 46) Not even the best film about periods (Carrie).Star Wars brought two things to the audience for the first time; decent sound and visual production and mass marketed toy tie-ins. The first is laudable; the second is where you suspect George Lucus' real talent lies.Like most adults in their early thirties, I got my first taste of Star Wars when I was too young to know better. We were too poor to afford the cinema then, so I watched it on the small screen and still liked it. But now I know better. Star Wars contains some of the hammiest, crummiest dialogue ever uttered by respectable actors. ""Feel the force, Luke!"" Yeah, whatever. If that wasn't enough, Lucas then went back and mucked up that tiny amount character consistency which made it out of the first cut.Star Wars, made at the height of the Cold War and the nadir of American foreign policy, is the good ole story of good ole America spreading its good ole values against a dark, satanic empire. Sound familiar? It's also the story of a poor orphan boy who runs away, rescues a beautiful princess and saves a kingdom from an oppressive tyranny. Sound familiar? Oh yes, and on the way he meets an old man with strange powers, an untrustworthy adventurer and a band of rebels hiding in a forest. Sound familiar? Of course, there is a reason for this. A simple reason. A long time ago in, well, America, Mr Lucas picked up a copy of Campbell's A Hero with a Thousand Faces. This book outlines the fact that all stories have a core of elements in common. Indeed, at a plot level, most stories are essentially the same. Excellent, thinks Lucas, that means I can legitimately rip off better films like the Hidden Fortress and the Dam Busters, better stories like Hamlet and Robin Hood and bastardise Buddhism and Confucianism into the bargain. No need for any original thought whatever, in fact.And thus it was to prove. From the ghostly mentor to the father bearing a terrible secret, Star Wars rehearses every conceivable cinematic (and indeed sub-literary) cliché. Along the way, it inflicts upon us some truly awful dialogue and a paper-thin plot.But these are not the biggest crimes of the film. The worst is that Lucas did not even copy effectively. He forgets, for example, that perfect characters are uninteresting. Mark Hamill may be a fine actor, but his goody-goody clean-cut character grates after just a few minutes of screen time. Harrison Ford fares rather better as Han Solo  so why does Lucas go back and make him fire second in the space bar? It's not just petty, it's puerile.Possibly I should relax, hang loose, go with the flow and not get so uptight. But I just can't help getting irritated. Star Wars is puerile nonsense of the worst kind. The best you can say of it is that it brings the McDonalds experience into the cinema. The worst it is a borderline insult to everyone's intelligence.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One for the history books!,"This movie, along with the whole original trilogy, just blows me away! It truly has all the elements a good story needs. The characters have suction cups all over them that glue them to your memory, because they're just so great! The story revolves around young Luke Skywalker, a farm boy who wants more adventure in his life. Adventure finally arrives to him in the form of two droids, sent by Princess Leia, a beautiful woman begging someone named Obi-Wan Kenobi for help. Leia is a huge part of Rebel Alliance, a group of people determined to stop the Empire's reign of terror and evil. When Luke meets up with Obi-Wan, they set out to deliver plans inside the droid to Leia's father, plans that can stop the most destructive weapon ever from destroying any planet that stands up for good. Teaming up with a cocky pilot who is more caring than he lets on named Han Solo and his CoPilot Chewbacca (big dog/ape/bigfoot like creature) the heroes are thrust into adventure beyond Luke's wildest dreams, complete with a heroine, henchmen, space ships, battles and the most menacing villain a movie has ever seen.Star Wars is a movie you won't forget soon after watching it. It's full of excitement, humor, romance (more so in the ESB, the sequel), great dialogue danger, and a never tiresome fight between good and evil. I recommend the trilogy to anyone and everyone who hasn't seen it (that would be...3 people...don't worry though, I'm a pretty newly converted fan too!) Han Solo rocks!

Pure uncut escapism,"In all honesty, I didn't plan on watching ""Star Wars"" on its 38th anniversary, but a happy accident nonetheless. To see this movie is to go back to a time when the mythology was in its nascent stages, before all the merchandising and parodies (really, a testament to its cultural impact, which is immense). It's deceptively simple; all of the classical elements are here - clearly defined heroes and villains, robots, space pirates, wizards, princesses, sorcery - remixed and flung off into a faraway galaxy. It all makes for a potent brew, to say the least. And when all is said and done, the movie's real power is its ability to tap into the kid in all of us. This is just plain fun, and not even Lucas' shoddy CGI rejiggering can tarnish that.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The opening crawl probably still brings a tear to my eye. Han solo just rocked and Luke skywalker was just adorable.

Epic in every way,"A classic story with a perfect cast, memorable score and dazzling special effects. Movies don't get any better than this. More space opera than true sci-fi, Star Wars takes you on a magical ride through a galaxy far, far away.The first moment of genius comes right at the very start with a written crawl which gives a basic plot outline and without which all that immediately followed would be hard to place in context. After John Williams' now legendary opening theme we are thrust into the first of many thrilling space battles to come. Almost immediately we are introduced to one of the great movie villains of all time, Darth Vader who is voiced with true menace by James Earl Jones, and it becomes clear that this film is not quite like anything we have seen before.Star Wars may seem to be your typical good versus evil swashbuckling adventure but there's a lot more going on here. The hero, Luke Skywalker, is your typical simple, clean-cut farm boy who will soon be thrust into the middle of a galactic war of as grand a scale as could be imagined. But he is not our only hero. Princess Leia, a leader of the rebellion against the evil Galactic Empire, is certainly not your typical helpless fairy-tale princess. She gives as good as she gets. Obi-Wan Kenobi is the older, wiser more seasoned hero and the mentor young Luke will desperately need. Han Solo is a space pirate in it only for the money, not for any revolution. Solo's first mate aboard his ship, the Milennium Falcon, is Chewbacca, a giant Wookiee who is remarkably adept at space flight for a creature which resembles a hairy two-legged dog. Also along for the ride to help our heroes are the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 who provide not only critical help for our heroes but some comic relief for the audience.The performances in Star Wars are all first-rate. Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker plays the young, naive Skywalker very well and Hamill grows right along with the character throughout the film. Carrie Fisher brings the appropriate smarts, skills, sophistication and determination to Princess Leia. Without Fisher's quality performance it might be hard to believe that this young woman could play such a pivotal role in a rebellion of this magnitude. Alec Guinness is reliably brilliant as old Jedi master Kenobi. He is mysterious, quiet and reserved yet very strong indeed. Stealing the show is Harrison Ford as Han Solo. It seems Ford gets all the best lines and he makes the most of them. Luke Skywalker may be the nominal hero of the film but it is Ford as Solo from which Star Wars gets most of its personality.George Lucas has crafted a true masterpiece here. The classic struggle of the underdog against the evil oppressor takes on many new twists here. The mysterious Force, the foreboding and menacing Darth Vader, alien creatures of all imaginable shapes and sizes, the epic nature of a battle which rages across an entire galaxy...in the end it all comes together to form something unique and truly wonderful. With action and adventure on a grand scale, fascinating characters on both sides of the fight, special effects that were revolutionary for the time and an ever-building sense of drama and excitement Star Wars is an absolute triumph.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A break from the cynical films of the 1970s,"The latest TCM production entitled TCM Presents A Night at the Movies: George Lucas & The World of Fantasy Cinema, was really 2/3 about Lucas's films and it seemed that 2/3 of that was about Star Wars - but that was OK because it finally drove home to me what I have suspected for years - that George Lucas did not and does not have a clue as to what made Star Wars great. He got lucky with the first one (this film) because it was a product of its time and was what people WANTED to see in 1977 - something hopeful and fun. Remember - or maybe you are too young to remember - movies in the mid 70s were extremely cynical post Watergate and post Vietnam. This one was different and even religious in an ecumenical way. Lucas got lucky with the second one because of the director and his input. To me, all the ones that came after The Empire Strikes Back were special effects filled duds. Now back to the original.In that cynical era in which nothing was black and white and everything seemed at least gray and a little tainted came this little space western. The sound effects were hokie, the graphics were poorly rendered, and all of the creatures were real men and women in rubber suits not CGI. But that was not the point. The point was that HERE was a force of pure evil - The Empire - that everybody could be completely against. The heroes were imperfect yet you could rally around them. You have a young boy of about 19 who is treated well by his farming aunt and uncle but wants a bigger destiny, you have an old man living in the hills like a hermit that wants that young boy to join the fight against the empire, and not until The Empire touches the boy personally does he make a rather hasty decision to do so. There is a girl, a princess, who is not waiting for somebody to come rescue her and helpless. She's tough, she can handle a weapon, and she can handle the fourth in their little band, Han Solo, who sticks his neck out for nobody a la Casablanca's Rick Blaine and seems completely mercenary, yet he gets involved.If you like science fiction and good old fashioned adventure you'll like it. If you are young and feel that your destiny is slipping through your fingers and are itching to make a difference, or if you are older and want a chance to right a wrong that you feel at least partially responsible for you'll love it. And you CAN shoot first in the face of danger, have lived a pretty self involved life, change, and become the hero.

Where it all began,"A New Hope (1977): Much has been said about A new hope and I do not need to add to it except for the fact that this film is fantastic- well paced and featuring the appearance of so many memorable characters and scenes. Lucas as a young man sure had an eye for details and it's a pity how he lost this ability by the time he started filming the prequels. The locations, atmosphere and camerawork is so different than the later films it is hard to imagine they were both directed by the same man. Anyway if you haven't already then please watch A new hope and then slowly make your way through the entire saga.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A fantasy well realized....,"A few years ago, the New Yorker magazine wrote a fascinating article on Star Wars. It explained the whole phenomenon of Star Wars and how it happened. I was like other 5 year old ""Star Wars"" fanatics in 1977 and when I saw the Millennium Falcon zap into hyper-drive, it was an overwhelming stimulation of the imagination. Suddenly every 4 and 5 year old child was teleported into a future that existed long ago and in a galaxy far away. ""Star Wars' gave reason to why we see movies in a big and darkened theater. Yes, Star Wars was a phenomenon but it was not THE film changed the movie industry. That was Jaws.Star Wars's greatest achievement is that the film was such a grand and ambitious project and yet, writer, director George Lucas was able to realize it. No other science fiction film has had so many creatures, planets and special effects as Star Wars. It is a universe in and of itself. Looking back on ""Star Wars"" many year later, I can see problems that seemed to permeate in the other films from the saga. Don't get me wrong, Star Wars is a masterpiece, that is up until the story leads Luke and the others into the Death Star. By that point, the film turns into an exaggerated cartoon. When Han Solo is chasing after an army of stormtroopers, we get the idea that he's really not that scared. Okay, he's scared but not to the point where his life is at risk. We see this type of problem in all the Star Wars films (with the exception of ""The Empire Strikes Back""). Characters are running around shooting each other like a bunch of kids playing tag. Where's the suspense and drama that leads us to believe that this is supposed to be real? It worked for the first half of Star Wars.The first hour of Star Wars is beautifully written. One of my favorite scenes is when Luke and Obi-Wan are sitting at Obi Wan's home. Obi wan is talking about the past and also talking about Luke's father and the ""force"" which is an ""energy field created by all living things."" This conversation is one of the moments of the film that always enhanced my imagination for the film. I not only believed in the film, but I also believed that there was all of this history and supernatural elements that existed prior to this film. Too bad, the history was later realized into another series of cartoonishly dull adventures in the Episode I, II, and III. Oh well. It is after all the imagination come to life that makes all of these films important. That's what counts. The rest is mediocre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The first is the best,"I loved this movie. I have always loved this movie. I always will love this movie. It is simply amazing. The actors, Harrison Ford, Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher all did an excellent job. However my favorite character was Darth Vader. He is evil with being ugly or digusting. The high level of quality from a film made in 1977 is astounding. Still being from the seventies, this film has some pretty interesting hair. But it is THE film that defined how science fiction movies are supposed to be. I did my term paper on the affects of Star Wars on the science fiction genre and the movie industry itself. Needless to say I didn't have to work that hard, the movies speaks for itself. If you haven't seen it, watch it. I love this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I've grown up,"I felt in love with the Star wars movie saga when these movies were released again to movie theaters in 1997. I was just a teenager back then. I just watched them again in Blu-ray and some of the old excitement is gone. I guess almost 15 years of becoming familiar with great directors and great movies and also with Sci-Fi/Fantasy works done before 1977 have made me unable to close eyes to what is wrong with Star Wars. Though the movie is still a fantastic entertainment in a childish way, it has some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard in a screen –big or small- and terrible acting. Luke Skywalker is the archetypical hero and the character has great potential. However, Mr. Hamill wasn't skilled or talented enough to flesh out the character as it was written paper thin. As result, poor Luke is just a whining teenager. Harrison Ford fares much better as the rogue space cowboy because he was a very charismatic person not because he was the best of actors. Carrie Fisher is equally flat as princess Leia. Only Peter Cushing saves the day with decent acting as well as the powerful voice of Mr. Jones. The direction is mediocre but serviceable. The soundtrack sounds better than ever in its Wagnerian intensity and use of motifs. Watch it for old time's sake. Luckily, Empire Strikes back holds the passing of time much better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An ordinary farmboy must learn the ways of a Jedi knight to save the rebellion which stands against an empire.,"Star Wars is no ""masterpiece of synthesis"" or ""triumph of American ingenuity;"" it is a fraudulent copy of several good works of literature. Lucas steals the ideas of Frank Herbert in his work entitled Dune and plagiarizes even more off of unknown novel I cannot recall as it is so obscure, he felt no need to give it credit. I have heard arguments which claim that The Lord of the Rings is just as childish, but those arguments ignore the fact that The Lord of the Rings is a blatant and outright statement, a parallel to the horrors of the First World War. Additionally, the acting is phenomenal, the characters have depth, and the story has meaning. The authors of such arguments clearly view the battle scenes as similar to Star Wars, only having appeal because of the special effects. But things such as the gigantic war elephants actually represent something, whereas nothing is representative of anything in Star Wars. These elephants represent tanks, the new and deadly weapon that were finally used more frequently in war. I can overlook the discrepancies, such as the fact that the first time the Death Star was used it took but a few seconds to fire, but when the are attacking Yavin, they must maneuver around the planet to reach the moon, as there are such discrepancies in most movies. However I cannot ignore the lack of depth each of the characters has: Luke is like Dakota Fanning in War of the Worlds--he is paid to whine, and whine, and scream, and whine. ""But Uncle Owen, I was going to go the Anchorhead Arcade, I don't want to work on the droids."" His character is painfully dull, and the actor, Mark Hamill, lacks any sort of talent. None of the characters are relatable, none of them have any complexity. They are all straightforward representations of archetypes, with no combinations of emotions--in fact, they seem like the have no emotions whatsoever. Everything is superficial--I enjoy Star Trek: The Motion Picture ten thousand times more than Star Wars, and The Motion Picture is one of the most painful movies I have ever watched. Watching Star Wars, I can picture each actor--if they may be so honored by such a title--with a script in front of their eyes. It seems they are only reading; a common acting saying goes, ""Show, don't tell,"" but I have never been told a more boring story. Besides the painful, shallow acting, the plot is poorly written. There are no twist or turns, no interesting facets or components which one does not expect to appear; everything is predictable, everything is as plain as can be. Star Wars is ""a masterpiece of synthesis:"" I don't think I have ever seen a movie so perfectly blend plagiarism, horrid acting, a lack of depth and emotion and complexities, and so many other despicable aspects. As for its ""ingenuity:"" well, if plagiarism and poor writing, acting, and characters constitute ingenuity, then this movie deserves a 10 out of 10--if not, Star Wars most definitely deserves nothing but scorn. Why so many have found this movie so enthralling I will never understand.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I'll tell you why this movie is so great...,"I was four years old when I saw this movie and I remembered the whole thing, from beginning to end. It was summer and my family was spending a month at our camp. One day my sister (2 years old at the time) and I had been fighting all day. My parents sent us off to bed for a nap before dinner and I grudgingly complied. I was awoken by my father, he was asking me if I wanted to go see a movie. ""It has spaceships, and robots, and lasers, you'll love it!"" I looked at him through swollen eyes and asked, ""does Jenna get to go to?"" When I heard him say no, I knew I was in for a HUGE treat. We arrived at a nearly empty theater, and took our seats. When the first jarring chord of the theme hit me, and my father began reading the opening story, I was captivated. It was the happiest day of my life. To hell with all your nitpicking. When something makes that great an impression on a four year old, you know it has to be something truly special. By the way, I'm wearing the Boba Fett t-shirt my son's mother gave me as a gift. And no, I'm not some greasy, Star Wars obsessed dork. Well, not any more...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
nostalgic and really beautiful,The one that started it all and thank god that george's wife heavily edited this movie otherwise we would probably get something like the phantom menace.the thing that lucas did great is that he gaved us this wonderful universe and some of the best characters in the history of cinema so us as the fans should always be thankful for what he did.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
What can you say...pure greatness,"Star Wars changed everyone's lives when it came out in 1977, including mine. I can still remember the anticipation as a little kid waiting in line to see this amazing movie I kept reading about.It definitely lived up to every bit of hype I had heard up to that point. I got my popcorn and my soda, sat down with my cousin and we watched in awe at everything we saw on the screen.I am definitely a Star Wars kid, and feel very lucky to have actually seen the original in the theater, something that today's kids can never experience because all big event films are all children of Star Wars after all. But there will never be anything like this first movie, the greatest film of all time! If you haven't seen it yet, see it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The ultimate space adventure!,"I don't think there's any denying that Star Wars changed cinema history and deservedly so. At the time of its release, science-fiction was considered a dead genre with the only major films from Hollywood's recent cannon being the work from Stanley Kubrick and cheesy, yet still fun flicks like Logan's Run. Yet, no other futuristic movie wowed more than George Lucas's space opera. From that infamous opening scroll, featuring that amazing heart-pumping score, to the end credits, people were gripped and hoping their heroes that had grown to know those two previous hours could come out alive. While, George Lucas did give his Jedi knights more adventures, I don't think any of those sequels and certainly not the prequels have managed to come close to the original Star Wars that practically defined the baby boom generation. Watching the film again recently, I am still impressed by the awesome power of the movie and the fact that even after thirty years after its release, it gets me more excited than the latest Hollywood blockbuster. Sorry, Michael Bay, but you're no George Lucas, that's for certain.After two droids crash-land on the desert planet of Tatooine, they are immediately captured and sold to a young farm boy called Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who desperately wants to leave the rock he lives on with his aunt and uncle. While fixing one of the droids, he finds a message from Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), requesting the help of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness). Luke finds Kenobi, a hermit living in the mountains, who tells Luke of his family history. His father was a Jedi knight, killed by the evil Darth Vader and now Kenobi decides it is time to teach him the way of the Force. After Luke finds his family's home destroyed by stormtroopers looking for the two droids, they decide to find their way to another planet. They enlist the help of space pirate Han Solo (Harrison Ford), who decides to give them a lift. On the way, they find the Death Star, a giant space station run by Darth Vader, with the ability to destroy any planet of the solar system. Now, they must enter the Death Star, find and rescue the Princess and destroy the station before it produces anymore harm.George Lucas has been criticised for his so-called lack of direction and screen writing abilities, but I don't think most people can deny that Star Wars packs a mean punch in terms of solid entertainment. While Star Wars is playing, all eyes are on the screen savouring every delicious moment, whether it be a fantastic lightsaber duel or a quiet scene between Luke and Obi-Wan. The visual effects (including those in the special editions) are seriously some of the best in motion picture history as they manage to make the viewer believe they're in space, surrounded by various creatures and flying ships. Lucas has gotten a lot of negative criticism for the fact that he believes that the updated version of Star Wars is the ultimate way to see the film, but I don't mind. The special effects are better and they certainly do add to the experience. Greedo shooting first? It's such a quick, minor scene that goes by at such a fast rate, that I don't really mind. I understand where the die-hard fans are coming from, but for the casual viewer, it's practically nothing. Adding to the impressive technical delight of Star Wars as well is John Williams's magnificent score, the best in any Hollywood film. I seriously don't think the film would be as highly regarded as it is, if it wasn't for the fantastic music. I seriously would probably enjoy the film even less without it.Yet, I think the lasting appeal of Star Wars has to be the characters. Every child growing up wants to be like Luke Skywalker, the young Jedi who just wants to save the universe from possible destruction. Meanwhile, the older folks in the audience have the wise Obi-Wan Kenobi to relate and as Yoda shows in the other five films, that old age does not remove one of their abilities. Han Solo represents the coolness of Star Wars and Harrison Ford plays him with enough spunk and gusto to warrant what might be a minor character as a personal favourite of mine. And then, there's Darth Vader, the most famous character and the most chilling villain of the 20th century. James Earl Jones will always be connected with with this constantly breathing menace with a past of many hidden secrets. Even the stormtroopers tremble in his wake, for fear that he will force-choke them to death. With thrilling action, impressive visuals, lovable and both frightening characters and a world full of fascination and adventure, it's hard to go wrong with Star Wars, the epic journey of our hearts and inner wants.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing,"This was quite possibly the greatest film of all time, I agree the acting was somewhat lacking, but the effects were beyond amazing, you got to remember, this was 1977. Lucas' vision was realized to its full potential and William's score carried the film to being the most successful film ever made, behind the hunk of crap titanic. The story was one the most original I've ever come across and the movie itself sparked the career of Harrison Ford, quite possibly one of the biggest actors in the 1980's and 90's. Although this was the first and last original Star Wars film to be directed by Lucas, it was quite possibly the best film to hit the market in the 1970's.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Quit dissing Star Wars!,"I have been reading some of the comments on this movie that some people have been putting up and frankly, I'm not happy. I know that there are a lot of flaws in this movie but so what? This is still a great movie. I've read comments on how the special effects suck and such. This just shows how ignorant some people are. The special effects in this movie were ground breaking. George Lucas basically founded modern special effects on this movies. If it were not for Star Wars there would probably be no LOTR. Which brings me to my next issue. I read someone comparing Star Wars with LOTR. They commented on how Star Wars sort of ripped off Gandalf using Obi Wan. WRONG! Gandalf and Obi Wan are both inspired by the ""old wise man"" template. That's right, I hate to break it to ya but Gandalf was not the original ""old wise man"". If George Lucas had never made Star Wars then he would probably never have started ILM (Industrial Light and Magic). Which would have set back the special effects in movies by decades. Meaning that without Star Wars there would be no LOTR. I am not saying I don't like LOTR because I love it. Comparing the movies Star Wars and LOTR is like comparing the authors Tolkien and Robert Jordan. It simply should not be done. I think Star Wars is a great movie and It deserves to be in the top ten. So before you try and comment on how bad this movie is try and realize where the special effects in the movie industry would be if it were not for this movie.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Beginning of a Wonderful Trilogy of Films,"Well, the only way to begin this review is to mention when I saw ""Star Wars"" for the very first time. I was merely a baby, from what I recall my parents telling me before their divorce. I wasn't even born when this first feature film hit theatres. I'm nineteen now, but I must admit that ""Star Wars"" was one of the many things that decorated my childhood. I always adored it, and always looked-up to Luke Skywalker. It was the type of view I can only assume all boys had; we all wanted to be a Luke Skywalker. We wanted to be the cool hero with a lightsaber. In this review, I will do my very best not to give you a biased review. However, forgive me, for I have always been a ""Star Wars"" fanatic. This was my first re-viewing in quite a while, so at least I'm reviewing the film with a clear set of eyes.When two droids, C3-PO and R2-D2, escape the clutches of a shoot-out on a spaceship, they land on a desert-covered landscape, only to find themselves captured as slaves. They are reunited among the slavetraders, called Jawas. The Empire realizes that Princess Leia Organa had sent a message along with one of the droids who managed to escape the attack, so they begin to hunt for R2-D2 and C3-PO. Little does the Empire know that a young man, Luke Skywalker, and his uncle, Owen, had just purchased the two droids from the Jawas. While cleaning the two droids up, Luke stumbles upon the message Princess Leia had left for an ""Obi-Wan Kenobi"". Luke considers ""Obi-Wan"" a possible relative of a man named Ben Kenobi and goes on the look for him. For now, I will end my synopsis for the fact that I just described the first half-hour of the film. I want there to be more for you. All you need to know is that Luke is taken on a journey that changes his entire life and purpose, helping him make a transfer from a teen who longs to leave the ranch he is stuck living on to a man seeking the fall of the Empire. This film isn't just a film; it is a true adventure.When it comes to the acting in ""Star Wars"", I truly don't believe it could get any better whatsoever. Mark Hamill was born to play Luke, Harrison Ford dominated his role as the swift Han Solo (a bounty hunter Luke ends up traveling with), Carrie Fisher is courageously independent as Princess Leia and doesn't fall into the shadows of her co-stars, but Alec Guinness was exceptional as Ben (or Obi-Wan) Kenobi. There is something magical and hopeful about the way Alec portrays Obi-Wan in this film. Also, Anthony Daniels is perfect as C3-PO! He may have been the simple comic relief, but I promise you he was the perfect choice for this character. I truly cannot see anyone ever playing this golden-plated character, who has practically become the symbol for any outsider who may have not seen the films. Without a doubt, the acting was exceptional in all respects. I believe the trickiest had to have been David Prowse, seeing as how Lucas ended-up not using Prowse's real voice for Darth Vader. With that thought, I must say that I enjoy James Earl Jones' voice much more for the character.Anyways, moving along! The writing of each character was phenomenal. I feel that the banter was so well-done that it brings these characters to life even more, seeing the situations each of them are in within the duration of the film. ""Star Wars"" was also plotted very well, with all events and scenes not feeling out of place once.The special effects, I must say, are top-notch, even if they have aged a bit in 2013 viewer's eyes. At some points, the effects look fantastic, while other scenes look like a ""Star Wars"" fan film from YouTube. That's common with classic cinema, so I don't mind it. I sincerely believe that people aren't the only ones to age.This ""Star Wars"" film is definitely not my favorite, but it runs right behind ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"", on my list. Overall, it is still very enjoyable with set designs that look like legitimate places amongst the galaxy. The detailing of the sets in this film are just shockingly realistic.""Star Wars"" deserves the eight stars that I have rated it. I like it, hold it as a memory in my heart, but find it to be an action-fantasy film, for the most part. It is brilliant, it is intelligent, and it is worth a try. I highly recommend the film.May the force be with you all! God bless, and Merry Christmas!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Entertaining! Innovative! Original? No.,"I'll say what I enjoyed first:
The score- Wow, easily one of the greatest scores of all time. Makes the movie for me honestly. Scenes that would've been terrible without it were redeemed, it's completely original and John Williams killed it.
Alec Guiness and Harrison Ford- The two best characters in the movie acted by the two best actors in the film.
Special effects- It's fairly obvious as the movie goes on that it focuses heavily on its, at the time, crazy good special effects. The work and love that went into this movie are most evident in its countless sets and practical effects.
Now to the bad:
It's not original- It's simple really, Lucas even admits it, the plot follows the basic mono myth of the young farm boy taking on an empire. Nothing we haven't seen before except this time it's covered in gibberish names and space garbage.
The Acting, Dialogue, and Characters- It's so wooden. It's not the worst I've ever seen but the way people talk about this movie is as if it isn't bad. Mark Hammil and Carrie Fishers performance are so over exaggerated. All the side characters such as the imperial officers and Luke's uncle and aunt are just terrible. Their are some great quotes spattered around that are memorable and great but the in-between is just cringey and cliche. The great Alec Guiness would agree with me and he's a part of it. The characters are just card board cuts of classic personalities. Luke is a dislikable protagonist who whines and complains the whole movie and is somehow a master at everything he touches. Han I have no complaints with, he's great. Obi wan is cool and all but nothing we haven't seen before in an old wise mentor. C3po is so freakin annoying and such a useless character, he gets far to much screen time. Leah doesn't do anything except sit back and watch the other characters do all the work. This would be fine if they even tried to have any character development with her but no, she's pretty one dimensional.Overall it's an entertaining and enjoyable movie but definetly not deserving of any of the accolades and praise it continually gets. No way is it in the top 15 movies of all time, for me it barely scratches the top 250. Yes it broke boundaries for its time...in special effects. So have fun watching it call it a classic, but in no way whatsoever should this be considered a high quality, top 15 movie of all time...cause it's not.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Still remember seeing it after all these years,"Of all the movies I've ever seen at the theater, I remember this one the most. Not the actual movie really. I remember coming OUT of the theater. Why? Because we had just seen THE final frontier! We had seen space ships! We had seen other worlds! And not in black and white '50s style sci-fi. This was full color with incredible computer generated graphics. There were real live BELIEVABLE aliens up on the screen! We were flying at light speed across galaxies and star systems! And then the movie was over, the house lights came up, and we had to WALK on CONCRETE to our FOSSIL FUELED vehicles and DRIVE on ASPHALT to get home. How B-O-R-I-N-G. How mundane. I had just seen the future, and then when I left the theater it was all jerked away from me. I'll never forget that feeling. The disappointment of ""reality"". I've never experienced it with any other movie since, not even any of the other Star Wars episodes. I guess I was just the right age at the right time.At the time I hated Han Solo.

Deserving of Its Reputation,"Star Wars (1977)**** (out of 4)Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) joins forces with Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) as they plan to go after Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) who is being held hostage by Darth Vadar.Whether people like it or not, STAR WARS is one of those ground-breaking movies that became a massive hit and it eventually took over the world. Watching the film so many years later it really is amazing what George Lucas was able to do with this film and what would follow. I will gladly admit that I'm not a fanboy of this series and in fact this recent viewing was the first time I had seen this since it was released in its Special Edition form. With that said, even though I'm not a ""fanboy"" it's impossible to deny that power that this film contains.Storywise there's really nothing overly ground-breaking here but in my opinion that's what makes the film so darn good. There's no long-winded or drawn-out story to drag things down. The basic premise is rather simple as an up-and-coming fighter gets his opportunity to be great and sets out to do so. I think this simple story makes the characters stand out all the better because it really gives them a chance to shine and come to life. It certainly also helps that Lucas was clearly a fan of those cliffhangers from previous decades because he knows how to build up scenes and milk them for everything they're worth.It's really hard to say anything fresh or new about this film but watching this first one it's easy to see why people like Hamill and Fisher became iconic in these parts. Both are quite good in the film as are Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing, the two veterans of the picture. With that said, I think it goes without saying that it's Harrison Ford who really stands out in the role of Han Solo. His comic timing with Chewbacca has made for some of the most memorable moments of this film and he's simply delightful to watch in the role.Of course, fans will debate the tinkering that Lucas has done with the picture but I think both versions hold up extremely well. I understand the purist who want to view what they originally saw in theaters and I understand those who defend the updating of the effects. Either way, STAR WARS is a rare blockbuster that also manages to be extremely well-made and deserving of its reputation.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best film ever made.,"This is quite simply a masterpiece.By far the film that has progressed the film industry the farthest. This is the breakthrough in films. This film set raised the benchmark for standard of films that is still not being reached by many films today, almost 30 years on.This introduces us to our characters and sets the story for out trilogy. A little slow to get started i grant you. An exciting opening scene is followed by what to my mind is a little too much of Threepio and Artoo traipsing through the dunes of Tatooine. After that though it is a non stop ride of action, adventure, drama and comedy. The excitement of learning about the force will never be surpassed and never has an idea been so gripping.Watch this film if you only watch one film in your life. Of course if you are only going to watch one film in your like then after seeing this i am afraid that will drastically be changed into only watching 6 films in your life!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
About As Good As I Remember,"I was raised on all six Star Wars movies, and due to the recent release of Star Wars VII I felt the need to re-watch the series. My opinion of this movie has remained generally unchanged.The plot of A New Hope is, although not particularly original by today's standards, still a good one. The galaxy is ruled by an evil empire and a rebellion forms. I actually never knew why the rebels fought the empire when I watched it as a kid, nor did I know what a rebel was. So the plot didn't feel old or boring to me.The characters were decent, but once again, not horribly original by today's standards. I still found that they were just as likable as I remember them.Star Wars as a series is one that, although did great when it first came out, doesn't stand up to that nearly as well by today's standards. Reason being this series set the standards, so we've seen so much of Star Wars already in modern science fiction movies. The series does not age well, but when you think about it from the perspective of when it first came out it really is quite a good series.Overall A New Hope is a solid addition to the science fiction genre, and one of it's most important contributions. Despite not aging very well, it manages to hold up as a classic that I will never forget, and I think it will hold a special place in every person's heart who watched it when it first came out (or as children like me).

beginning of the end,"Paul to the Corinthians - 'when i was a child, i thought as a child and played as a child; but when i became a man, i put away my childish things.'i was living near new york city when this film was first released - i think this was a test release in the new york area; the original promo suggested a serious science-fiction story, along the lines of the cult-favorite 'dune'. it bombed. shortly afterward, on re-release Lucas got the promo he really wanted - part fairy-tale, part Jungian Ur-myth, part retro-serial - and the rest is history. but the history of what -this film marks the beginning of the end of serious film-making in America. fairy-tales are for children; the old serial films were fun, but badly made; and 'Jungian Ur-myths' constitute a debatable psycho-babble theory; thus what Lucas was really telling his audience, in both film and promo, was that we all needed to be children watching bad films written by Carl Jung - or at least Jungian literary theorist Joseph Campbell, who was actually hired as consultant on this film.humans, to maintain their self-respect, need to grapple with difficult moral issues, we need to mature, and to learn how to relate to other human beings in complex and sometimes difficult situations; and we need the freedom to think for ourselves in such matters, to risk our own happiness and to live with the consequences. no one is saying that children should not enjoy fairy-tales, and perhaps they really do need these for psychological development. but even eventually children need to 'grow-up' - to stop being children.'star wars' would not have been so damaging to this culture if it had presented itself as a children's film. but Lucas was quite explicitly targeting, as audience, burnt out hippies, participants of the failed 'cultural revolution' of the '60s; and in doing so, he began steering them toward the political decisions that would at last put our culture and its economy, and its future, into terrible jeopardy - voting for Reagan, selfishly demanding tax cuts, mockery of dissent and dissenters, and flocking into paganistic 'fundamentalist Christian' churches seeking 'spiritual awakening' and, as many now proclaim, apocalypse.well, obviously, just one movie isn't going to accomplish all that. what the success of star wars did was to distract adult attention from ethically mature films where moral choices could be examined in their complexity; to such an extent that Hollywood - never all that supportive of such films, anyway - simply stopped making such films for a time. the bottom came in 1985, when the 2 best films to use truly cinematic storytelling to wrestle with mature choices were from japan - Kurosawa's 'ran' and 'Godzilla 1985'. and you know the world's doomed when a big green lizard has to be the one to make you ask important questions about the ecology, and history, and whatever place in the larger universe our tiny species finds itself.i mention Godzilla not simply for rhetorical effect. like the old fairy-tales, Godzilla is best appreciated by the young and the young at heart; like the old serial films, the Godzilla films are filled with gaffs and silliness; like the typical Jungian Ur-myth or archetype, Godzilla calls to some deeper part of our psyche, which is why we are entertained by his appearance.but unlike star wars, the Godzilla films never insist that they are the only show around - or at least the only worth viewing. and unlike star wars, they never pretend to be better than they are, or that they're accomplishing some necessary cultural mission. and unlike star wars, they do not insist that we remain 'forever young', only that we respect our having once been young, and that we respect the youth of others. and unlike star wars, they are inherently democratic - not because they insist we all be individuals, but rather that they insist that we all are already individuals, and yet to survive, we must come together and learn to depend on one another - democracy only has value to a collective of individuals, a human society. rabid individualists are monsters - rather like Godzilla's most intractable foe, king ghidorah.well, that's the big argument. for those who prefer simple solutions - star wars is a crude, fascistic, socially-retarded scam that the ex-hippies foisted on what was once a great culture. whether it will ever achieve greatness again - or whether it shall have cinema when it does - remains open to question.'now we see as through a glass, darkly, but then face to face.'",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Classic Science Fiction,"""Star Wars"" became a movie classic because it was intelligent science fiction that went beyond what had been done before in the genre.  Lucas' space opera incorporated themes from world mythologies into a movie that both adults and children could appreciate.  The result was a franchise that had both popular and intellectual appeal.  I have heard college students discuss the Star Wars trilogy as if it were the ""Illiad"", and it does not seem silly at all for them to do so.What was the appeal of ""Star Wars.""  The first film in what is now sometimes referred to as ""the original trilogy"" (to distinguish it from the prequel trilogy) introduced the movie audience to ""the force,"" which had both a dark side and a light side; as well as a ""will"".  The universe at the beginning of Star Wars is controlled by an evil Empire, which is in turn being resisted by the ""Alliance.""  The movie begins with the capture of an Alliance ship by an Imperial cruiser.  As the movie's villain, Darth Vader, boards the ship in search of secret plans stolen by the Alliance, two droids (including one who has the missing plans) jettison to the surface of the planet around which the Alliance cruiser was orbiting.  There they encounter a young farmer (Luke Skywalker), whose father (Anakin Skywalker) was a pilot in the ""Clone Wars"" (an important war, as we later find out), and an aging jedi knight named Obi Wan Kenobi (the jedi's having the power to use ""the force"" for combat and enlightenment).  As the movie progresses, the jedi knight teaches the young farmer the jedi skills, and they join forces with a blockade runner named Han Solo and a princess named Leia, to fight the evil Empire.This movie brilliantly sets the stage for events that occur during the next two films, but you have to see the entire trilogy to fully appreciate Lucas' contribution.**Note: While it might be tempting in light of the release of the prequel trilogy to see them first, I think that it is best to see the original first, with the prequel trilogy filling in the gaps later.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The movie that made me a movie fan!,"This was it! When I was growing up, this was the best and more influential movie of my childhood. Classic good versus evil tale. I love watching this even more now that newer episodes have been releasing. Their are a lot of references to what is going on in the new movies. This movie is a classic and ranks as one of my favorite movies. I love the story lines and for its time, the visuals were incredible. I watch other movies that came out around the same time as this movie, and visually, you cant even compare them. This was a movie that raised the bar. Nothing felt forced even though many movies were going to be spun off of this one. One of the greatest heroes and villains in the same movie. Everything about this movie is great, even if it is a little cheesy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Nothing short of a classic,"This film is a milestone in cinema. It changed the way movies were made with its ground breaking special effects. It launched the Star Wars saga, one of the most successful film franchises of all time. Along with Jaws, it essentially created the blockbuster genre, and on top of all that, many aspects of this film are now a cultural icons (The John Williams theme, The Millennium Falcon, The Death Star, Darth Vader, Chewbacca, Lightsabers, C-3PO and R2D2 and so much more!)However, even if you took away this film's impact on both Cinema and the world, you would still have a very enjoyable thrill ride in the science fiction/fantasy genre! A lot of elements of Star Wars are a bit cliché: The orphan protagonist who goes from average Joe to hero, the wise mentor, the non violent duo put in for comic relief, the anti hero, the dark threatening villain and the princess. However, what makes Star Wars so great is how likable it makes it's heroes, how intimidating it makes it's antagonists and the unique spin Star Wars puts on these otherwise cliché factors.Enter Luke Skywalker! He's a little whiny at first, but you can't help but get behind him. Mark Hamill's performance definitely helps, but it's also the character's sheer compassion and determination to become a part of something bigger that makes him so relatable. You can't help but sympathize with him as his Uncle Owen holds him back from leaving the farm. Luke also has a firm belief in the force and places a lot of faith in it.Complementing Luke's character is that of Han Solo. Han has far less compassion, and refuses to put any faith in the force. He is certainly more a bad ass in traditional sense and is on the other end of the ""hero"" spectrum. This is great because it gives the audience options on who they'd like to get behind. If Luke is too much a boy scout, you still have Han to get behind. If Han is too pig headed and selfish, then you have Luke to get behind! Not to mention, Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford have great on screen chemistry.Darth Vader is done so well as antagonist that he's arguably the most iconic villain of all time, perhaps tied with the Joker. Everything from the unique mask he wears to the size and stature of David Prowse (the actor inside the suit)accompanied by the voice of James Earl Jones gives Darth Vader a highly intimidating presence. However, what makes him interesting and gives him more depth is that he was once good, but was seduced by the dark side of the force and is now evil. He was a victim of his temptations.Alec Guinness is a brilliant actor and makes Obi-wan Kenobi very likable as well very well spoken and wise. It's very easy to see him as a wise Jedi Master. Princess Leia is a damsel in distress, but she's also tougher than the average one and isn't afraid to take charge.Aside from the great characters, Star Wars just introduces a very distinct and unique universe. There are so many great vehicle and character designs that are imaginative, interesting and original. All of these things keep Star Wars from being anything from generic. Then there's the pacing of the film. The film starts off with a great attention grabbing introduction, then the film starts to slow down a bit for exposition, but then the film becomes a roller coaster ride throughout the entire second half! The action is very thrilling and leaves a big impression.Overall, Star Wars still holds up today as a great film. It hasn't aged a bit; non of it's special effects look dated or silly, the characters are still very likable and soundtrack is just epic. Star Wars, in my opinion is the definition of a timeless film. It is now 36 years old and is still better than the vast majority of blockbuster films that have been released within the last year, if not all of them! Star Wars lives up to it's name of simply being a great film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars film review final draft 2.docx,"Brock Hunt Mr.Hicks ENG 101-008 September 20, 2013A Space OperaStar Wars is a movie which focuses on a rebel alliance that fights against an oppressive regime set in a fictionalized universe a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. We're introduced to the main characters Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Darth Vader (David Prowse) for the first time. Luke is a farm boy who doesn't have a clue of what is about to happen. Darth Vader is an evil dark lord of the Sith who is trained in the dark side of the force and wants to defeat the rebel alliance. After Luke's family is murdered by the empire, he trains to be a Jedi by Obi-Wan Kenobi to defeat the evil Galactic Empire.George Lucas made Star Wars: A New Hope in 1976 and was released in the summer of 1977. He made episode four first because the story didn't require any high dollar special effects and wasn't sure how the movie would be accepted. When the movie opened, it received great reviews and audiences were amazed at the special effects. He would go on to direct the following sequels Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Little do people know that George Lucas had the stories and screenplays of episodes one, two, and three already done before episode four was ever released. He did this because at the time technology didn't exist to produce the first three films with the fight sequences and settings that were in the first three films.I personally love the Star Wars films because of my personal connection with them. My grandmother introduced me to the Star Wars franchise as a child. On Saturday nights I would stay with my grandmother and she would play the movies on VHS. I never get tired of watching the films. Because every time I do, it takes me back in time when she was alive. Star Wars also opened up my interest in Sci-Fi movies. Some can say I'm a nerd but most don't know my extensive knowledge of the Star Wars franchise.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Reduced,"Obviously this was a straight 10/10 all my life, however, I just saw the adulterated version at the Duke of York cinema in Brighton and, if George and Disney insist this is the version I must watch, then it has to be reduced to a 6/10. Return of the Jedi suffers worst from the horrendous tampering but everything in Mos Eisley is practically ruined, and these scenes were simply perfect. A frame is there for the original reason: two people explaining or doing something, yet we now have dated, crappy monsters yawning and moaning in the side of said frame, ruining scenes that could not be bettered in the history of film. The final edit of the Death Star run also ruins what was perfect, even if there are some cool shots.I read a great article about the updated effects, to the point that they have immediately dated and made this version look sh£t. It's so interesting as old effects filmed at the time just do not have this effect: they still look good or forgivable as they fit in with the overall aesthetic. The new additions do not. They stick out like sore wampa thumbs. Rubbish.Anyway, that's enough. I am downgrading all three Star Wars films to 6s, Return to a 4 because the vandalism is that much worse, until such time as Disney atone for George's sins are release the upgraded original versions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Magical and unique experience,"What else can there be said about this galactic masterpiece which has not already been said? Now in times where the saga is (hopefully) complete, ""Star Wars"" still stands out as one of the most important movies of the film history.Even though some dialogs may be silly (but memorable nevertheless) and in spite of several logical mistakes, George Lucas' Science-Fiction-film can easily be considered as one of the most entertaining works ever. The spectator is introduced in a universe full of fantastic concepts and locations and meets there some archetypal characters, such as the beautiful and innocent princess, the keen, naive hero, the dark, evil villain, the wise, old man, etc. The mixture of fairy tale and western elements is extremely fascinating and seems almost perfect. Lucas' direction is so skillful that even the above mentioned drawbacks eventually appear as positive characteristics of this space odyssey.No matter its meantime rather bad reputation, ""Star Wars"" is and will always remain one of the most magical cinematic experiences you can make.

A nice fantasy movie,"Star Wars (1977) is an interesting fantasy space movie,but the lack of action scenes and the slow pacing makes it boring(at least for me) a few times throughout the movie.Do not get me wrong,i like the movie and it's the one that started the saga. Maybe i am a bit unfair because it came out in 1977 and then it was something completely new, but that's the way i feel. There are some interesting and funny characters,the plot is pretty good,but the pacing is extremely slow for me.

1977: A galaxy much too far away,"I saw this marvellously old-fashioned hokum with my girlfriend at the packed out Pics on March 25th 1978. Exhausted at all the screen wipes by the end all we were thinking of was hopefully not waiting too long in the cold for the last bus home; so much for intergalactic travel. Star Wars was a phenomena then, and still is – although I did warn a big fan I knew at the time that it wouldn't take too long for the special effects to go dog-eared with age and even recommended Kurosawa's original to him instead. However, he probably still disdainfully thinks, along with many others that movies, indeed history, began with Star Wars.Young stereotype joins forces with a disparate group of stereotypes to save the white universe and Princess Stereotype from stereotypical space baddies in a adventurous story bordering on corny with then innovative now dated film technology. Definitely nothing wrong with any of that, just that when stripped down it's not only incredible but incredibly ordinary and merely reflects back to me some lovely sunny days from the mid '70's. Even the sinister ugly aliens had somehow listened to the cleaner music of Frank Zappa. Fancy spending trillions of trillions on an immense battleship complete with a titchy flue with a security implication. I saw Lucas's 90's cgi cartoonery revision at the Pics with my daughter, the spacecraft still wobbled and there were many white borders on display but overall his team had done a good job trying to stem the onslaughts of Time on his cash cow. Many of my favourite films are pure - and poor - old fashioned corn but no one on planet Earth thinks they're life changing works of Art in the same way as they do this monument to Luck.The film I saw was Part I full stop; if Disney ever gets to Part XXVII what if they want to do a prequel to the prequel and more pathetic re-numbering and retrospective digital title re-jigging ensues, will Lucas let them? I've always favoured the originals of anything generally and also draw the line at altering future history.I enjoy it immensely whenever it's on UK TV, as I can feel the persuasive Force of not having to think for a couple of hours and to simply enjoy the ride.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
War of the Stars,"The one that started it all...Spunky Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is captured by the evil, satanic bastard known as Darth Vader (body of British weight lifting champion David Prowse, also the same man who trained Christopher Reeve for 1978's ""Superman - the Movie""; voice of James Earl Jones) and exposed as a traitor to the evil empire that has enslaved the galaxy and is challenged by a heroic Rebellion. Two of Leia's robots, the hapless C-3P0 (Anthony Daniels) and the handy R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) escape the ship and crash land on the desert wasteland planet known as Tatioone. After being captured by Jawas (Hobbit like people who wear cloaks) and traded to a farmer known as Owen Lars, his wife Beru and their nephew Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill, the future voice of the Joker). Luke is a callow youth who would like nothing more than to leave Tatioone and find adventure in the universe, then he stumbles upon a message in R2 from Leia asking for the help of an Obi-Wan Kenobi, AKA: Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness). Luke doesn't know anyone named Obi-Wan Kenobi but he knows a strange old hermit man named Ben Kenobi but is unaware that Obi-Wan & Ben are the same man. When R2 sneaks off in the night, Luke and 3P0 chase him down in the day and are attacked by Sand People AKA: Tusken Raiders. When the Sand People try to raid Luke's hover-car, they are scared off by Ben Kenobi, who reveals himself to Luke to be Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke tells him that R2 claims to be his property and has a message for him. Obi-Wan checks out the message and we find out that he was once a great Jedi Knight and that he was a friend of Luke's father, the late Anakin Skywalker, who was also a great Jedi Knight but one who, as far as Luke knows died of mysterious circumstances; actually, according to Obi-Wan, Anakin was murdered by O's former pupil, ""a young Jedi named Darth Vader."" Luke, however, has yet to discover the horrible truth behind it all... well, Luke is later persuaded to help Obi-Wan and study the way of the Force, which is what gives a Jedi his power (it helps that the Imperial Storm Troopers mutilated his aunt and uncle while he was out). Luke, Obi-Wan and the robots head off to Mos Eisly space port where they join forces with rogue pilot Han Solo (Harrison Ford in the role that made him a star) and his wookie companion Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Though they're supposed to go the planet of Alderaan, they are intercepted by the Death Star, a giant space station orb that blows planets up real good and was responsible for the destroying Alderaan before our heroes could get there. Once on board the Death Star, our heroes rescue Princess Leia and get into all sorts of hijinx that will change their lives forever.Obi-Wan is tragically killed in a duel with his former student, Darth Vader. In the rousing finale, Luke, Han and Chewbacca become big time heroes for destroying the Death Star. The adventure, however, is only beginning.Well acted, great special effects in both the original theatrical version and the over done special edition, the classic ""Star Wars"" trilogy is a masterpiece that, for better or worse, helped usher in the age of the blockbuster.

The movie that taught my generation how to dream.,"If there is one thing about my childhood I can be thankful for, it's the fact that I was a boy between 1977 and 1983. I got to grow up with three of the most inspirational fantasy films ever made. It all started with Star Wars Episode IV in 1977.We all know the story about this battle between the forces of good represented by a fragmented rebel alliance and the forces of evil represented by an intergalactic EMPIRE. And yes, my sister and I had all of the toys, clothes, sleeping bags, trading cards, etc...Let's just focus this review on the last twenty or so minutes of the film. Perhaps the greatest and most inspiring scenes in film history. I'm talking about the rebel assault on the approaching Death Star.Who couldn't be moved by a dozen or so tiny ships flying out to face this massive battle station positioning itself to wipe out their entire army tucked away on a little moon. How about the shot of these ships locking their wings in attack position with the giant Death Star looming in front of them?Some really neat camera shots as the battle begins. The rebels seem to be wreaking some havoc in their concentrated attack, until Darth Vader and some Imperial fighters join the battle. The rebel fighters are searching for a tiny ventilation shaft to drop some ""proton torpedoes"" into. It seems this is the only vulnerable point on this massive space station. One of the fighters actually gets a good shot at it...We get a shot from inside the Death Star. Moff Tarkin (played superbly by veteran horror film actor Peter Cushing) is approached by one of his underlings.""Sir, we've analyzed their attack pattern and there IS a danger. Should we have your shuttle standing by?""Tarkin's over-confident reply:""Evacuate? In our moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances!""The battle rages on. Most of the rebel ships are blown to bits. It looks like Luke Skywalker will be one of them also until...""You're all clear kid, now let's blow this thing and go home!""Luke, without the aid of his targeting computer, takes one last shot. The Death Star has the moon with the rebel base in sight...Luke lets out a sigh of relief as his torpedoes drop down the shaft...Tarkin gives the order to fire:""You may fire when ready.""We get a shot of about four remaining rebel ships turning towards home.We hear a technician inside the Death Star:""Stand by...""BOOM!!!!!!!!!!We see the gleeful medal ceremony back at the rebel base.Thank You George Lucas!!!!I'd give it a million of ten stars if I could.So sayeth the Hound.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A classic when it first came out and now, still a 'classic' almost 30 years later on DVD.","My five children were all under the age of 10 when Star Wars came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, 'Star Wars' filled our imaginations like no other movie before it. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.The Star Wars movies also were responsible for jump-starting the career of Harrison Ford, and today he is probably better known for his next trilogy, as Indiana Jones. The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track.My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi -- compliments of our local public library.

One of the most influential science-fiction movies of all time.,"Next to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" this is the most influential science-fiction movie of all time.Yet the movie is way more than just simple science-fiction. It's adventurous, epic, fantasy sparkling. The characters and settings are amazing and are truly something that should speak to your imagination. When you just think about it makes you realize how brilliant and ingenious the story and the movie actually is. Sure, it's obvious that George Lucas was obviously inspired by ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Kakushi toride no san akunin"" but Lucas knows to put in such great and original moments and characters that the movie still deserves much credit for its originality. Basically Lucas came up with an entire non-exciting universe complete with planets, races, technology and politics.""Star Wars"" is one of those rare movies in which everything works; The story, the characters, the pace, everything makes sense and work well together and are what make ""Star Wars"" a rare movie that in a way changed the way we look at movies.The movie is well casted. Casting Harrison Ford as Han Solo is probably the best choice of the entire movie. He's perfect as arrogant space pirate and extremely believable in his role. Casting old school actors Alec Guiness and Peter Cushing was also a great move. Alec Guiness is perfect as the old mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi and Peter Cushing is brilliant as Grand Moff Tarkin, next to the emperor the only person who dares to speak up to the biggest villain of the galaxy Darth Vader. In a way he is an even bigger bad guy than Vader in this movie. But still there is no denying that Darth Vader is really the ultimate bad guy. Never has there been a movie with a better bad guy. Vader's character introduction alone is what him a classic character already. And then there is his suit, it makes him mysterious and ultimately evil looking. How can there ever be a bigger bad guy than him?What make the movie work more than anything is the brilliant music by John Williams. He knows to come up with some amazing and some of the most recognizable theme's in movie history. His musical score is what makes most of the scene's work and is truly a tool that helps to tell the story. Like in all Star Wars music, his music is present throughout the entire movie, one of the reasons why Star Wars is also sometime's regarded as a space opera.The special effects are truly amazing, even these days. The final space battle with the death star is really one of the greatest special effects achievements and really edge of your seat stuff.The people that worked behind the camera are the one's who deserve the most credit for the cinematic classic that ""Star Wars"" has become. People that worked on the special effects like the ILM guys and persons such as John Dykstra, Dennis Muren, Joe Johnston and John Knoll, paint artist Ralph McQuarrie, production designer John Barry, make-up artist Rick Baker, composer John Williams and of course director and writer and person ultimately responsible for the huge success of it all; George Lucas.I seriously really could go on and on for ever about the brilliance of this movie but I'm afraid that I'll probably bore a lot of people with that. The brilliance of everything about this movie is simply something you've to experience for yourself and luckily a lot of people already have. ""Star Wars"" is really one of those you movies you simply have to see at least once in your life.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Combining the retroness of the 1970s with that of the future, ""Star Wars"" is in a different breed of sci-fi entertainment - nothing cheesy like the old 1950s monster or space drive-in movies, and nothing too arty and ordinary like the space movies of recent fare. Lucas and his team have done an excellent job with ""Star Wars."" Oh sure, the recent movies may not be up to par like the original ones do, but still, this is a movie series that will forever be stuck in every human's life.""Star Wars"" is one movie that should never be missed.

Those poor stormtroopers...,"Star Wars is one of those films, I fear, which, while undoubtedly good, has been idolized to a ridiculous degree: to such an extent, in fact, that I believe there are actually sad losers out there who have turned Star Wars into some sort of religion or way-of-life (a bit like the Trekkies with Star Trek).  While I must admit that I enjoy the film and its sequels myself, they're not THAT good, and some of their scenes and special effects (especially in the first) are looking embarrassingly dated by now eg the computers in the Death Star, and virtually everything in the climactic final scenes over that feared Imperial construction.Anyway!  As the above summary may suggest, these are not my main beefs with Star Wars.  My main gripe with the Star Wars films (especially the first), and something that I feel does not get enough of a mention, is the appalling treatment meted out to the stormtroopers in them.  I must admit, I have something of a stormtrooper fixation.  Their uniforms are very cute (and what I wouldn't do to be able to slip into one myself), and I was actually led to believe that they were halfway decent at their jobs (they are, after all, in the frontline when it comes to enforcing the Empire's feared and evil rule).  So why, then, are their lives so cheap in Star Wars, and why do so many die such humiliating deaths eg falling off ledges or into pits, or being shot almost as an afterthought by show-offy arseholes like Han Solo. It's a disgrace!  Those guys deserved a lot better.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"'Star Wars' created an amazing universe and media franchise, but isn't so great as a standalone film...","Star Wars has a very basic and standard plot if you really think about it: A bunch of good guys are on a mission to rescue the princess and save the universe from a bunch of bad guys, who work for the main evil villain, Darth Vader. A simple and cliched film really - Avatar (2009) of the 1970s, as the predictable story goes.The plot is very generic. That said, the film gave us a beautiful universe of its own with unique alien characters/races, planets and other material (such as the Rebels and the Empire) that became more developed and intriguing in the latter films/books/shows/etc. Not to mention that the thematic score by John Williams was phenomenal.I see this film as a starter pack or an introduction for those who want to get into the 'Star Wars' universe. But does this mean that it should be regarded as one of the greatest films ever made? Not really. I mean, the first Fast & Furious (2001) film wasn't well received, but yet its 5th and 6th films had universal praise.So yes, you can be the first film in a franchise and not be seen as the best of the bunch. And this would apply for 'Star Wars' in my bold opinion. You can watch it for reference and see how it all started, but I wouldn't bestow it with all the rave reviews.Compared to other Star Wars film (yes, even the dreaded prequel trilogy), this one seemed rather campy and, dare I say, more of a satire of Star Wars (Han and Luke acted like typical 1970s twerps). It just didn't have depth and the seriousness that the latter films possessed. I felt as if the characters are one dimensional and frivolous. Only Alec Guinness's Obi-Wan was respectable, developed and had depth.Say, if no Star Wars films were made thereafter, this film would be forgotten - You may probably find it in such lists titled ""70s Films That Time Forgot"" or something. Because, I believe, the sequels, the prequel trilogy, the books, the SW fanbase, etc and etc, made this film as famous as it is now.If it weren't for the Star Wars fanbase and growing universe, this would be just another 1970s science fiction film that many people had forgot about, albeit on the innovative side. But definitely not the greatest film of all time. So yes, watch it for the innovative concept and the music.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Best Movie of my Life,"I grew up behind the iron curtain in Hungary. We hardly had the chance to see Western movies. I was 8 when I saw it, in 1982. I remember we were late from the movie (I went with my brother and grandmother) and we arrived to our seats when R2D2 was trying to find a way out from the icy base of the rebells on Hoth.I started to watch the film in awe, as I have never seem anything like it in my life. It's difficult to describe what impacts it gave me. Yes, on first level the special vision complex of the movie, the freedom fight against dictatorship, the novel landscapes and then the modern technology, but also the Asian (Buddhist, New Age) philosophy, that I had never encounter until then.I couldn't get out of its spell for several years.

Mixed feelings about the DVD,"Doesn't it drive you crazy that George Lucas is only releasing the special editions of the original Star Wars movies? I've been looking forward to these DVDs since DVDs began, and boy, hasn't George Lucas made us wait? Star Wars used to be the greatest movie ever made. Not good enough for George. He had to fancy it up with computer generated bits and pieces that, like plastic surgery on a beautiful woman, only served to fake it up. It used to be chunky and real. You felt like you could reach out and touch the spaceships. Like you could really smell the Wookie. But now it's just another Lucasfilm cartoon. At best, a trailer for the current unholy trilogy. I want my Star Wars back. My old reliable beloved Star Wars. Where is it George? Why isn't it on DVD? I'm hardly alone in my feelings here. Star Wars has a massive fan base but how come it's been so roundly ignored? Surely everyone wants the original versions. At the very least, the option to watch the original versions on the special edition disks. That would be great. Maybe Lucas is going to make us pay for the special editions and then, in a few years time, release the originals and shake us down some more. He knows we'll pay, and money does appear to be the only thing he cares about. When George was young he was like Luke Skywalker, then for a while he was Obi Wan but now he's forever Jabba, vile gangster and ravager of fans. Thanks. I had to get that off my chest.

Defining movie of our culture,"I was shocked to see this movie was only rated #4 on the top 250.  Sure the other movies were good, but none are of the same cultural magnitude as Star Was (and associated movies).Star Was is more then just a good entertaining movie, it is a culturally defining element.  I think it is more important / impacting to the world culture today then any of the ""culturally significant"" books I read in school.  Star Wars is a movie they should show in school because it is a cultural norm that people need to understand in order to interact with those around them.It is more then a fad of a movie that will be really popular for a while and then fade away (like most contemporary and popular titles), this is a movie that will be around for generations to come.For many people it defines a lot of who they are, especially those who saw Star Wars as a young child.  It introduced them to new ways to dream and think.  Out of all the movies in the Top 10 of the Top 250, Star Wars is the only one I have plans to show to my children when they are old enough.  Star Wars plays a very important role in connecting generation together, and will for generations to come.And amazingly, I am by no means a really big Star Wars fan, nor a fanatic in any since of the word.

worls best movie,"I couldn't have asked for anything more. Star Wars: A New Hope had it all. If I had to sum it up in one word, superlative would be my answer. I saw the film for the first time three months ago and loved it, and since then I have watched all the Star Wars movies. I was disappointed with the prequels (Attack of the Clones was my least favourite), but this, Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back were perfection.I have to say that the film looks absolutely amazing even after thirty plus years, with highly imaginative sets and dazzling special effects. And the action sequences were superbly choreographed and brisk, the Death Star climax was a knockout. The music by John Williams is absolutely outstanding, by far one of his more exciting and rousing scores. The story is fast-paced, intelligent and has an essence of sophistication, and the screenplay is sharp and decisive.And the performances were flawless. In the prequels I had problems relating to some of the performers, namely Hayden Christensen as Anakin. Here, all the actors played their parts with superlative skill. Alec Guiness, one fine actor and will be sorely missed was a standout, likewise with Peter Cushing and Harrison Ford(hilarious here).",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The beginning of a new era!,"Before the genius George Lucas was about to go help Spielberg make the majestic "" Raiders"", he decided to do something, something that many were surprised when it was announced and didn't take a lot of faith on, which after his release was an absolute success both at the box office and critical, and today the masterpiece of Lucas is a classic that will live forever in the history of cinema!""Star Wars"" (not Star Wars IV A New Hope, please), begins with the yellow title suddenly appearing on the screen with an amazing soundtrack from the master John Williams giving us a resume of the history we are about to watch. It all starts with a small spaceship full of rebel soldiers start being invaded by imperial troops led by the sinister and cruel lord Darth Vader (David Prowse). Suddenly the film transports us directly to another side of the galaxy where we have the story of the young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), a simple machine repairman teenager who lives with his uncles. A day after his uncle buy two servant robots, R2 - D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), which inadvertently bring Luke the chance to realize his dreams of becoming a rebel and fight against the tyrant of the empire, a mission that will take him to the ends of the galaxy and will bring new friends but at the same time extreme dangers.From the beginning, ""Star Wars"" revolutionized cinema forever, especially the genre of sci - fi that at the time was just ""Star Trek"" with great success. Lucas of course certain elements form ""Trek"", since the crew of a spaceship with name style and friendship among the crew, but everything else was a tremendous attack of originality. Unlike ""Star Trek"" Lucas took the story and the great adventure with a lighter and fantasy tone, not childish but humorous, fun and even a certain religious point when the Jedi Obi - Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) appears in Luke's life with secrets of him and Luke's father past.And just like ""Star Trek"", Lucas gave his masterpiece unforgettable characters, of course: Luke, R2, C-3PO, Obi-Wan. But also the unforgettable Han Solo (Harrison Ford), the bounty hunter from space who ALWAYS shoots first and asks questions later, giving the film a great humorous touch and a lot of fun (never one character caused such influences as Han Solo did), and even Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) no royal woman before her in a film had never taken up arms showing she knew very well how to take care of herself. Not only the good guys who stand out perfectly in the story, but also the great and unforgettable antagonist ever put to film, Darth Vader, no villain was so cruel and yet so adored by fans.Characters and stories fitting perfectly, but the adventure to be full completed it needed the huge Galactic scenario, which is not lacking in this film. I think Lucas should have thanked Kubrick about ""2001"" because if it were not for this film, visual effects would never be the same. And thanks to that Lucas gave the film with beautiful scenery and a vast galaxies and an unforgettable and thrilling final battle.The classic that redefined cinema forever with a story well-crafted and told, full of suspense, humor and adventure thanks to its unforgettable characters and stunning visual effects , the legendary George Lucas gave the world a film with tremendous quality and early one of the best trilogies ever made.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It is not just nostalgia,"Recent ripoffs like Rebel Moon once again reminded me why the original Star Wars is so damn good.It's not the special effects, which were of course mind blowing in the 70s but look very dated by now, it's the storytelling and the world building. It's the little things e.g. When Luke is playing with a space ship model or just wistfully watches the double sunset that do so much for characterization with so little effort. It's the masterfully crafted sets, be it the dusty streets of Mos Eisley or the cold corridors of the Death Star, that reveal so much more about the world than the movie is telling us vocally. It's the love and dedication that went into every aspect of this production and is sorely lacking in many modern movies.Yes, Star Wars has so far stood the test of time and still has a lot to teach to present day filmmakers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

What we got was a fantasy void of any science that takes place in OUTER SPACE.

Great Flick,"Star Wars (later to be known as A New Hope) was released in 1977 after a particularly difficult production directed and written by George Lucas and staring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Alec Guinness. It is the first film in the Star Wars trilogy (fourth if you count the prequels which we're not) which went on to be a huge unexpected success. To this day Star Wars and its successors are considered some of the greatest and most influential sci-fi films ever made, changing the way films were made and revolutionizing special effects.I think Star Wars is fully deserving of its mass amounts of praise because it really is an excellent film, right from the beginning I was impressed. The amazing and now iconic score by John Williams booming while brilliant models (which aren't even noticeable as so) soar across the screen, a small Rebel Alliance ship and a huge Imperial Star Destroyer offer as some great visual storytelling, showing us where each side stands in this massive conflict. The good guys are heavily outnumbered and you feel this immediately as the suspense of watching the Rebel soldiers fear for their lives as the ship is attacked and quickly overrun by hoards of Storm Troopers during an exciting and thrilling action sequence.While the action is superb throughout, it's not the only thing that the film has to offer. One reason these films are as timeless and memorable as they are is because of the brilliant characters that are all for the most part well acted, even if Mark Hamill does show that this is his first major role, often coming off as annoying and poorly performed (something he greatly improved upon in the sequels). The dialogue was well written and felt very natural with great humorous moments which are just a delight to watch. That being said I felt the interactions between characters was something greatly improved on in the sequels.I mentioned before that the special and practical effects were seamless and stunning and the same goes with the costumes, make up and sets. All felt stunningly real considering the fact it was mainly strange aliens and far away worlds. You become immersed immediately in this huge expansive world.A huge player in what makes this film so entertaining is how mysterious all of it is, you are introduced to more names and places you want to learn more about and when you do even more questions arise, some mentions you don't even get a resolution for until Return of the Jedi. It all added to the excitement and tension of the film which put a huge childish grin on my face.Overall Star Wars is a brilliant film, it's exciting, it's epic in scale yet manages to be so close to the characters and emotions that drive the film and make it so classic. The effects are to this day excellent and the score is simply amazing. If you have not seen this film yet (how?), I highly recommend it, something as universal as this will be enjoyed by pretty much anyone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's impact on cinema was incredible,"Not being around when it was released, the first time I watched A New Hope was in the 2000s, after the prequels were released but this was my first Star Wars film.I was mesmerised and frankly couldn't believe it was made in 1977. The space scenes are breathtaking, and blew up the sci-fi genre and redefined it, building on the Star Trek TV series a decade earlier. Obviously, viewing it in nowadays, the duel between Vader and Obi-Wan is quite poor but this was the first one ever and does the job.I've watched the original 6 movies at least 20 times, and I get joy everytime I watch each of them (except possibly Ep2) but this one has a special place as the first. The Original. And it doesn't fail. Thank you George Lucas.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The start is fun but rough. Lucas is an idea guy,"A New Hope has the distinction of being the first Star Wars film and I think a lot of people overrate the film as a result. It is a wonderful film, on the whole and the Star War franchise is a cornerstone of American culture. But ANH is not without its problems. The start of the story is needlessly convoluted and overextended by about 15 minutes. There simply is not a reason-for theme, character, plot or world-to separate R2D2 and C3PO only to have them reunited 10 minutes later. Indeed the film has about 20 minutes of fat that could have been tightened up on the page. This is hardly surprising as Lucas is a weaker writer. It is not enough to ruin the film or anything but the writing is not crisp.The film's budget also leaves several sequences that feel less epic and more quaint in context of the franchise. The battle of the death star is almost laughably small in comparison to what comes after. And upon re-watch this aspect makes the film feel quite dated. Lucas direction is fairly good for him but there is a flatness to the film's classical structure that leaves much to be desire. In a lot of ways this film is a good first draft of the Star Wars formula.The film's endearing cultural power comes from the acting and the moral simplicity of the universe. Guinness and Ford aside I don't think any of the actors are great actors but they are all so earnest and committed to this story that their performances are charming despite, by way of example, Luke being whiny. This a classic good vs evil, underdogs vs overdogs, republicans vs fascists story and as escapism one can't do much better than this film. There is a comfort to seeing the Death Star go boom that few escapist films capture at this intensity. But with all things the film suffers from time moving on and this sort of moral simplicity is no longer as elegant as it once was.Overall this is a milestone in American culture that showed great promise for what was to come but that on its own is not fully satisfying. Lucas is a much better producer and ideas guy than writer and director; that most other Star Wars film's are better than this one is good evidence of that.A few words about the special edition: on the whole the special edition is a cinematic abortion. Almost all of the additions are at best superfluous. Most actively ruin the scenes they are in. However, the Jabba the Hutt scene is a neutral addition and at least ties the OT together better than the original cut.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A monumental cinematic experience but maybe not as perfect as some would have you believe,"While sci-fi is not not my preferred film genre, I cannot deny the sheer majesty and magnitude of the first and best Star Wars movie. A visually stunning and highly creative piece of artwork with one of the all-time great scores by John Williams. Some of the characters are brilliantly devised (not least the droids) and the landscapes and spacecraft are generally incredible. I cannot even imagine how astounding this would have been to innocent eyes back in 1977.Having said that, I have never particularly enjoyed George Lucas' writing very much and find the usual banality and lazy plot structure is well in place here. Much of the dialogue is incredibly corny and the storyline itself is quite childish and predictable. The pathetic inability of the Stormtroopers to hit a SINGLE bloody target is infuriating and ridiculous. It makes the battle scenes almost completely pointless given how much divine intervention the main characters seem to be afforded. This type of lazy plot armouring has always been my main gripe with action films and Star Wars is as bad as any.In spite of this, it is hard to be too critical of such a groundbreaking piece of cinema.

Defining Moment Of The 20th Century,"""Star Wars"" is perhaps the most successful movie franchise of the 20th century.  From movie ticket sales alone, it has made George Lucas a very wealthy man.  Add the toys, games, t-shirts and other merchandise and it should establish Lucas as part of history.  A person has just got to start wondering how this movie ever become so incredibly profitable.  Although this movie is watchable and even innovative, I really cannot put ""Star Wars"" in the same categories as impressionable films like ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""Stagecoach"", ""Casablanca"", ""The Bridge On The River Kwai"" and even ""Pulp Fiction"".My reason for saying that pertains to one factor, director George Lucas. Although many would argue, I think that Lucas is not a good director.  He always seems to be lacking focus with Star Wars' story, in which was almost the case with ""American Graffiti"" (Thankfully, he didn't).  I'm very impressed with the innovative visual effects of ""Star Wars"" as I am with any film afterwards that ever utilized it justifiably in connection with the certain film's story (it's sequel, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is much better in many aspects).  Unfortunately, outside of it's visual delights, it just doesn't have anything that other films hadn't already shown (even if this was made for children).  From the whole ""boy leaves home"" beginning (Mickey Rooney has done it before with more feeling) to it's much appreciated ""bar room scene"" (straight out of many westerns and even some war themed films), there isn't anything we haven't seen before.  Although the whole galactic twist on which the movie is based is totally original, majority of the ideas are still pretty much re-hashed from greater films (Kurosawa's ""Hidden Fortress"", Errol Flynn/Michael Curtiz movies, etc.).To re-evaluate, the bad parts consists of lack of originality.  The idea's, topic's and situations' originality in which a film's greatness lies are sadly missing.  The good parts which are visual design in terms of special effects and costumes definitely proves it's place in being a great landmark picture.  I just don't recognize it as the one of the greats.  This reaction could be the result of years of watching movies again and again and unexpectedly realizing a certain film's depth and lasting capabilities.  A good, not great movie full of innovation yet lacking any depth that is only realized when seen again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Arguably the most important film in Sci-Fi history...,"STAR WARS is, without a doubt, one of the most *influincial* films of its time (and perhaps even _ever_). When it was released, people began standing in line for hours in order to watch this movie for the fifteenth time -- something that had never happened before. STAR WARS changed the way we think about movies; it changed the way we market movies; it changed the way we think about sci-fi and fantasy in film; it killed the second STAR TREK series in pre-production at the time; it was important.Let me say that again: STAR WARS was important. That fact cannot be stressed enough. STAR WARS launched George Lucas into history, and created an industry legacy: ILM, THX, and so on. Suddenly, the idea that special effects needed to be of superior quality, and that the technology of movie making was something that needed to move forward became evident.STAR WARS was a ""great"" film in the sense that it was so important. But as a film, taken away from its context historically, it is not such a ""great"" film. The acting in many cases is sub-par; the dialog is painful to listen to at times; and Luke Skywalker has got to be the whiniest kid that ever lived (asside from, perhaps, his father, as it turns out).Still, STAR WARS stands alone as a fun, entertaining ride through the stars with an adventure that some fans, these days, can practically quote line-for-line.George Lucas has made some slight modifications to the film over the years -- the most note-worthy being the Han Solo-Greedo match-up. Although I am not really happy with that particular change, these are George's films and he can do what he wants with them. This makes George Lucas and his films unique in the industry: George really does not care if his films are popular, or if anyone likes them at all. Geroge makes movies for George to enjoy. We are all just along for the ride.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Almost 40 Years Later, This Movie's Lame and Boring.","This movie might've been interesting for a 20th century audience, but that's probably only because the technology and visual effects were all new and thrilling back then. To those from the 21st century, who've already been exposed to much more exciting (improved) technological effects several times, this movie will be a waste of time. To me, besides the fact that the graphics that have been enjoyed by perhaps billions in the past were nothing in comparison to the graphics of the average 2010s sci-fi movie, this movie was horrible because of the fact that it lacked a reasonably good plot. The plot was all over the place, at times difficult to follow but mostly just downright boring. Even if you must watch this film because you're a devoted Star Wars fan, you're probably not enjoy this film.Lesson learnt: a movie doesn't need to be good just because it's at the top of the IMDb 250 list.If you're interested in sci-fi, I'd recommend watching more recent films, like (1) Interstellar or (2) The Matrix, or even something animated like (3) WALL·E.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Set the stage perfectly,"I do not like to throw out 10 ratings very often, but considering this was the first film of a 9 film, 3 trilogy series that was incredibly successful means it had to have set the stage well for a great story.The early character development of some of the essential characters were important for how they were depicted in episodes 5 and 6. Despite being released in 1977, the CGI and animations were ahead of it's time and revolutionized how films used them.The personalities of some of those main characters helped impact how they were portrayed or written about in the future scripts. One of the most distinct personalities in all of film history is Han Solo, and without the early representation of him, he would not be so universally loved by all.The feel and nostalgia the movie brings also adds to how great the film is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Amazing,This film is amazing I would go as far to say it's one of the best. Everything about it from the Oscar winning score. And the acting is amazing the standout is Alec Guinness who got an Oscar nomination for playing obi-wan kanobi. If you have not seen it stop what you are doing right now and go watch it. In this film you can see the influences from Stanley Kubrick's 2001 a space odyssey and the wizard of oz. And I also like how it doesn't set it at an exact place and time so it doesn't get outdated. And the visual effects still hold up. I should also put Im talking about the special edition not the original edition. A+,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Sublime story-telling,"As a sci-fi/fantasy-loving teenager, I was quick to catch the Star Wars 'bug' and in fact went to the cinema 14 times to watch this movie over and over again in the summer of 1977.As I later learned, the plotline is straight out of the Hollywood text-book (of old - much less so modern, Woke-lywood)
At the time, the SFX were just awe-inspiring but are probably the one area which Disney have been able to improve upon, with their extensive and considerable resources.Star Wars, and its two related episodes in the original trilogy, will live on in history as a remarkable movie moment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Don't Underestimate The Force,"What can I say about George Lucas's 'Star Wars' that hasn't already been said? It's one of the most authentically shot films, whether we're talking about visual effects, cinematography, sound, music, art direction and of course Lucas's direction. Perhaps this was the movie that tagged Lucas as one of the all-time greatest directors. Revisiting this movie more than twenty years later brought back a lot of memories. Obviously it has a lot of nostalgic value.More than two decades after its release, Lucas attempts to make its prequels and the consequences are disastrous. With CGI dominating sci-fi films since the late 90s, the look of Lucas's later Starwar films (movies 1,2 and 3 made in the 90's and 2000's) could not match up to the early classics. They lacked the authentic look and atmosphere and suffered from poor editing. Most of all they were so boring (lacking in energy, lacklustre story, dreadful performances etc) that they failed to engage the viewer.Coming back to the movie at hand, it is easily sci-fi action adventure at its best. It's rich in dialogue. The level of energy and tension is excellently maintained. Even the quieter scenes have you engaged with beautiful visuals and what's also amazing is how simple they are, no complex or intricate designing but at the same time very detailed.The characters are a delight. The casting is solid. Harrison Ford is charming and funny as the laidback and slightly self-centered Han. Carrie Fisher redefines bring a princess in films. Before that, princesses were cast as damsels in distress. Mark Hamill captures Luke's innocence and essence very well. Peter Mayhew, James Earl Jones, and Alec Guiness are great. Aside from the human cast who portray the characters so well, who could forget C-3PO and R2-D2 (voiced brilliantly by Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker)?I could keep going on and on but I'll leave it here to watch 'Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back'.

"People say is a masterpiece, i can't understand that.","The film is good. Interesting characters, interesting plot, but for some reason people say is a masterpiece.
There is nothing perfect on this movie, is just a fun action film. The villain is boring and Obi Wan has no personality. The final spaceship battle is a joke. I can understand that this film has some weird looking effects, but the final spaceship battle looks horrible. Everything seems boring and we see more of the pilots on the spaceships than actual the spaceships. The battle of Obi Wan against Darth Vader is also pretty lame. There is no actual battle, we only see Obi Wan moving his lightsaber randomly.
But it also has some great scenes. Han Solo is a very fun character, and every single scene with him is incredibly memorable. C3PO and RD2D are also great, some of the funniest comedy reliefs in history.
Nothing much to say. Fun film, some fun action sequences, some fun characters, but not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Still amazing,"The original and the second best, ANH is still amazing in its ability to entertain. The effects still hold up and the breakneck pace is as good as anything from Marvel.

grandiose.,"One of my co-workers, who's about my same age(40ish), was talking about an argument he was having with his 17yr-old son. The argument was whether or not the new ""Marvel"" films were bigger and better, and whether or not the whole ""buzz' around them was bigger and better than the original Star Wars trilogy.I don't think the younger generation will ever fully understand the scale of the first trilogy. They MAY get a better understanding after JJ Abrams returns the trilogy to it's awesome roots.The first Star Wars film, known simply as Star Wars, was a land- breaking milestone of film-making, with a story, characters, and effects(not all effects are cgi people) that melded together into the greatest interplanetary adventure of all-time(at least until the sequel came out).Today's generation can pick between Spiderman, Ironman, Captain America, and the Guardians of the Galaxy to find the film that they love the most, but when I was a kid there was one film, or should I say one trilogy, that stood far, FAR above the rest.The number one argument that is made today by the younger generation is that the effects are outdated etc, but it was in fact Lucas' commitment(at least early on) to use models and make-up to create a world like no other. SOmething that CGI just can't capture. When I saw Guardians in the theater I thought it was amazing, but later I saw it on the 4K 60"" TV, and like many flicks, it kinda accentuated the small flaws of the cgi and the set-pieces, whereas I watch Star Wars and it actually shows how amazing the film was in that aspect.CGI isn't necessarily an improvement. It's films like Star Wars and Blade Runner, whose ""Gritty"" qualities actually add realism to an unreal world. The only problems I have with the first three Star Wars films are the ""digitally enhanced versions"" that Lucas added later. That's why I eagerly await the original untouched films' release on Blue-Ray.Scores usually drop a bit over time, and as it stands now, the weakest of the original trilogy is scored 8.4(Return of the Jedi), and that is higher than Avengers, Guardians, Cap 2, and Ironman, and FOR GOOD REASON.And the original Star Wars is a superior film in every way as well. No Hokey opening like ""Avengers"", no lack of storyline like Guardians, no under-menacing not required to act Villain like Cap 2, and while I can't nitpick anything about Ironman, overall it just doesn't stand- up against Star Wars, it's a beatdown.Simply put, it's EVERYTHING about it that makes it better. The acting, the story, the character development, the scale of the production, the start, the finish, the middle and every minute in- between.Part of the problem here is that the added material in the re- released versions really detracts from the original films flow. The stupid dancing crap in Jedi, the Walking Jabba in Star Wars, etc... it did nothing but hurt the original films. The only added footage that didn't detract from the original films was some of the added bells and whistles to ""Cloud City"" in Empire, and Biggs early appearance in empire, which was wasn't an 'enhancement', it was cut-footage from the original tapes, other than that, the added stuff only hurt the overall quality of the original films. He basically added stuff that was the kind of stuff that ruined the second trilogy, so the original untouched films are still the real gem here. And that's not what these kids are watching either, because the untouched versions are HARD TO FIND!DOn't even exist on DVD or blu-ray. One of the times I'm glad I still have my VHS. Uh-Oh, Gotta-go, Re-tro:)And WHile I love the new marvel films, they don't have what Star Wars and it's two sequels(i'm a purist) have.. that tangible something you CAN put your finger on - because it's REAL.. they built those ships, they designed and made those costumes and set-pieces. That kind of attention to detail, and scale just isn't in the Marvel films. Sure, it's cool to see Hulk crumbling down a building, but this galaxy really doesn't ""SEEM"" so far away in Star Wars. It has that 'realistic' edge to it. It's the reason that you couldn't make a legit remake of Ben- Hur, Ten Commandments, or other older ""epic"" films... it would literally cost Billions.Even some of my favorite Sci-Fi's of all-time like Blade Runner and 2001, while milestones in their own right(especially visually), just do not have the sheer entertainment value that Star Wars has.97/100Star Wars and Empire are 2 of the 42 out of the 3400 films that I have ranked 10/10, and they are two of the most deserving, if not THE most deserving.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

For it's day, the special effects were unbelievably spectacular and totally groundbreaking. I could watch this film over and over again and never get bored and I do. This is a film that everyone should see at least once. Without the following 2 sequels and the 3 prequels that form the entire series, Star Wars can easily stand alone head and shoulders above any other film, ever made.

"Star Wars was great, A New Hope is total crap","I just got the box set of the first 3 Star Wars movies, only to discover that it contains A New Hope, not Star Wars...for those who don't understand the distinction, Star Wars is the film that was released in 1977, capturing the hearts, minds, and dollars of movie-goers everywhere. A New Hope if the crap that Lucasfilm released in the late 90s that includes really poorly done CGI and new scenes, many of which contradict things that we've previously seen in the film (just why was that bounty hunter looking for Han Solo? for Jabba? Jabba finds Han in the very next scene... dumb dumb dumb).Star Wars was great, and if i could buy that I would watch it a thousand times. As it is, Lucasfilm ripped me off for another $43.

"With All Due Respect, This is Not a Great Movie !","The important points about this movie are very..The first of the ones around it; is that overwhelming success. It was incredible to see how the audience declared ""war"" over the entire hippie, realistic, experimental American cinema, whatever the name of the problem was, which prevailed since the end of the 1960s. And they celebrated a real glossy and entertaining another one. Apparently, this movie returned the word commercial to movies, being Hollywood's perfect revenge out of TV, previous expensive ""not hit"" movies, or the else illnesses, and the birth of the modern blockbuster as we know right now.Additionally, I think that (Star Wars) gave the movies such a fundamental influence; which was pushing powerfully the teenagers as the cinematic heroes, and sci-fi to the commercial rank. Yes, Disney movies used the teenager heroes before, but on a short-range and not with a gigantic prosperity, and sci-fi was there, yet artistically. So (Star Wars) paved the way to venturesome leads, who range between 10 and 18 year old, in next sci-fi, or fantasy for that matter, hits. Recall: E.T., The Goonies, Back to the Future.. etc, which defined the ages of the moviegoers for years to come, and manifested that fantastic cinema could be popular and profitable.Then, the important points ""in"" it. For one is the combination of the script. It's smart to gather factors of the western legacy, the old world's legends and the sci-fi space adventures. And it clicked. I loved the most that team of: strong mystic knight (Obi-Wan Kenobi), reckless bounty hunter (Han Solo), willful Princess (Leia), heroic immature farmer (Luke Skywalker), English - so devoted - butler (C-3PO), and clever little robot (R2-D2); instead of the mythical animals of the ancient legends. And not to forget the metallic Commander, and magical evil guy (Darth Vader). That selecting of soul, mind, and heart vs. viciousness, coldness, and inhumanity was so creative despite how using them wasn't mostly as creative.And, these special effects. I believe that was a milestone at its time. The next stops will be (Terminator 2: Judgment Day - 1991) and (The Matrix - 1999).Let alone that music score. (John Williams) is the one who can make the symphonies so marketable. What I love about him is his understanding when it comes to expressing many themes so passionately. And the way how he gave that plain tale a profound shadows and enthusiastic spirit. He can turn any light cartoon into a Shakespearean epic, with load of credibility and likability. Without his music, this movie could have lost good deal of its personality and prestige.Away from all of those points, the script wasn't that competent, which is something to be assured of with the next, not written by (George Lucas), sequel. And to hold by your own hands with the next, wholly doomed, wholly written by Lucas, 3 prequels! In this movie, I don't remember a twist or surprise. The thrill wasn't that super. The characters were so comics; namely funny and naive. And I hated points like, for instance, how (Chewbacca) was so unnecessary, rather unused!I watched it more than once, and I can't deny the feel of bore in some places. For one reason, the dialogue is so-deeply-insightful-it's-uninteresting, seeming so geeky and no entertaining. It's things to be written but not to be said; exactly as (Carrie Fisher) referred to (Lucas) once. And for another, the direction was ordinary; many scenes were tepid and humdrum.The action sequences weren't the best. The long climactic sequence, of exploding the death star, was yes kind of new image, but surely artificial, monotonous, and lacking any high suspense. Although the lightsabers idea was impressive, but the swordplay wasn't. Generally, the movie relayed more on the cool look more than the smart directing.Unlike many of the movie's attackers, I didn't hate the acting. It was suitable and fresh. The thing is that script didn't endow these actors with many characteristics, or hard situations to make them enjoyably watchable and deeply effective. (Alec Guinness), (James Earl Jones) and (Harrison Ford) were the winners. (Ford) in particular stole the show. Aside from his wit, the lovable cowboy was absent for years. And simply his character was the more human; the type that will be nonexistent in the prequels. On the other hand, (Mark Hamill) and (Carrie Fisher) lacked charisma, and (Peter Cushing) was wasted to the degree of being unnoticed.The ""New Hope"" matter was a new nonsense! I don't know how (Lucas) did that in cold blood? But clearly he did it only for himself. Otherwise, it's a practical lesson in how to toy with an old movie to change and alter, how to irritate viewers by some useless CGI, and how to destroy the history since it makes you totally out of the mood and distracted between the original 1970s's quality and the 1990s's one!The sequel is way better. Mainly because (Lucas) was out of the writing and the directing. These previous defects, that I mentioned, would be doubled in the next trilogy of prequels; where the script would go down, the action would be so missed, the direction would be downright tedious, the CGI would hugely and provocatively rule as if it's the point, and the acting - sorrowfully - would hit the rock bottom also!Nostalgia got a big hand in the top rank which (Star War) achieved. No doubt, the viewers of the late 1970s were so thirsty for that substitute dazzlingly-made world, being extremely fed up of countless anti-heroes, needing desperately a portion of sheer noble adventures or good American values. Not the (""Dirty"" Harry), not the ""British"" (James Bond). So they got all the reasons to adore this movie. It looked different and desired for them, unlike someone who watched it in 1998. Because deep down inside, (Star Wars) is averagely entertaining time. And despite my admitting that it has great effects, it is not a great movie in my book.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Just... Star Wars, man.","There are over 1,022,000 words in the English language and that still isn't enough to describe the absolute brilliance of Star Wars.Unlike most people who have seen and loved Star Wars, I actually watched this film a little late - i.e. I wouldn't say it was a childhood film of mine, as it was for most people, rather, I watched it a few days ago at my current age. This was partially because I a) didn't think I'd like that kind of thing and b) because I found it to be so hyped and so talked about, it couldn't possibly be *that* good. Well, let me just say that I have never been happier to be so wrong in my life.By the way, I should probably note that what I'm saying in this review largely applies to all three films, because I love them all pretty much equally, but I'm going to write it under the original because, well, it's the original, and also (despite a very close competition), my favourite of the three.Every single facet of this film captivated me from start to finish. Not for a dingle moment did I feel its 2 hour runtime, I was always too busy staring at the set pieces... or trying not to laugh... or trying not to cry... or biting my nails in anticipation. Speaking of the set pieces, the fact that this was made all the way back in '77 is actually beyond me. The effects have held up mind-blowingly well almost fifty years later, and I honestly prefer this a thousandfold to the green screen trash we get nowadays. I can just see how much care and time was put into those beautiful practical effect spaceships and everything. I can definitely see some influences of 2001: A Space Odyssey in the effect work, and I mean that in every good way possible.Now, the plot. The story. Just. Wow. I mean - Star Wars has been referenced in popular media so much that I was pretty familiar with the series, as pretty much anyone is, even before I watched it. So I thought I had it all down. But the reality was that I was hit with such a massive... FLOOD of visual and narrative beauty that I didn't think that my tiny insignificant human mind could handle it all. And seeing all those aforementioned references finally click together and make sense...and the characters were all awesome in their own ways and the worldbuilding was incredible. It's just so original and beautiful, and the ending left me smiling from ear to ear. I didn't think that somehow you could have moments that were both hilarious and heartfelt, with drama and impeccable action scenes and beautiful FX in one movie, all while still being rated U.Writing this in 2022, I know that Star Wars has grown into a multi-million-dollar franchise, with spin-offs, prequels, sequels, side movies, books, and a hell of a fan base. I actually haven't seen anything apart from the original trilogy (at the time of writing), and one of the main reasons I want to keep it that way is that before Disney got its greedy little hands on it, these three films were basically THE science fiction films - the new, industry-changing, Big Thing that everyone was talking about. I'm a big fan of old 80's-90's science fiction (The Matrix, Blade Runner, 2001, the old Dune, etc), which is why I gravitated towards watching it in the first place. And I really do want to keep it as a perfect trilogy by not voyaging into the wider world of Star Wars. Who knows, maybe I will watch the other stuff one day, but my heart will always belong to the originals.Getting to see a film just so iconic at an age where I can genuinely appreciate its greatness was actually really nice. When the opening crawl started with its iconic yellow letters, the double sunset on Tatooine, the lightsaber fights, the Millennium Falcon, ""That's no moon"", the X-wings, C-3PO and R2-D2, Han and Leia, Luke using the Force, I could go on and on. You know it's going to be amazing when, within the first 10 minutes, you think to yourself, ""Damn, what a film"". And then continue to think that throughout the entire runtime.Honestly, I could talk about this film for hours, but in short, giving this anything less than 10 stars is a crime.-Sasha.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Sci-fi is now kiddies' world.,"From ""Star Wars "" onwards,sci-fi became the most popular genre for a while.It as a return to simplicity,in spite of the huge special effects.Actually,the screenplay could have been written by a ten-year old,and the characters ,stereotyped and Manichean ,will not do any harm,will not raise intellectual dilemma.Princess Leia Organa is totally sexless and seems to come from some forgotten fairy tale.Luke is a pale shadow from a knight of the round tables without a Graal to conquer,and Han Solo is the masculine raider we've already seen in a lot of movies. Humor,like in Fredric's Brown tales?none,unless the two robots count. Mystery ,like in AC Clarke's 2001?none,unless Darth Vader 's hidden identity counts? The last quarter of the movie recalls a giant video game. After ""star wars""(and close encounters of the third kind) ,intellectual sci-fi was over the hill;now two kinds would share the market between them:the harmless sci-fi for toddlers and brats(Star War saga,ET,the black hole)and the horrific ,brainless and witless sci-fi (Alien and sequels)""2001"" became an ET movie and its overwhelming genius did not influence anymore,alas.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Where The Whole Thing Started - For Some Inexplicable Reason,"A confession right off the top: I'm not a Star Wars fan. This original came out when I was a teenager. Everyone was so into it that I finally had to watch it. I did. And I didn't like it. I realize that puts me very much in the minority, but - whatever - I just didn't like it. I was totally bored with it for the most part and I've never watched it or any of its sequels (or prequels) since, until I rewatched this just a few days ago. My brother in law decided that my daughter had to be introduced to the Star Wars phenomenon, so he brought the DVDs of those first three movies over and we sat and watched the first one. My daughter's 11 - and wise. She agreed with me. ""Do we have to watch the other two, dad? I was bored."" ""Yes, honey, your uncle brought them over to watch with us, so we'll watch them when he's over."" So, eventually, I'll get to watch ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi."" I'm as enthusiastic as my daughter.So, to this movie. I was still bored with it. It has one of the least interesting beginnings I've ever come across. It's a struggle to watch the first hour or so. And once the action really starts - it's just a gigantic space battle, and I just don't buy that good old Luke Skywalker can go from farm boy to ace fighter pilot like that. And really you have to mix in some pretty weak performances - especially from the two main leads. There's a reason that Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher never really did much after Star Wars. They're just not that good! Harrison Ford is the only one who managed to turn his role in this into a big-time acting career - but, let's face it, most people remember him as Indiana Jones and not Han Solo. Granted that George Lucas got some big names in this - Alec Guiness as Obi-Wan Kenobi and James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader. But the newer, younger crowd of actors just wasn't that good. And then there were the aliens. Some of the worst looking aliens I've ever seen - especially in the bar scene in Mos Eisley. I really loved the alien who looked like a green-ish burlap sack with bright buttons sewed on for eyes. Add on some ridiculous dialogue and irritating droids who get far too much of the ridiculous dialogue to top it off.Those are things that stand out for me that just didn't work for me. I'm not dissing ""Star Wars"" completely. There were some good things about it. Give George Lucas credit for imagination. This was a very interesting and imaginative universe he created. And the space battles were pretty well done - I just thought there was too much of it. And let's face it - Darth Vader has become an iconic character; one of the greats in Hollywood history. Everybody knows Darth Vader - whether they like Star Wars or not. And ""the Force."" Who doesn't know about ""the Force."" Something has worked well when characters and other things get sealed in the popular imagination. And I admit again that I am in the minority. You can't deny that Star Wars has become a cultural phenomenon. I may not understand it, or buy into it, but I can't deny it. To some extent, it really re- invigorated what had become a tired concept - space-based sci-fi. (I'm sure it's no coincidence that ""Star Trek"" - which was being planned as a TV relaunch as I understand it - actually ended up appearing on the big screen not long after the amazing success of ""Star Wars."") So Star Wars changed a lot of things and created a legion of fans that lasts to this day. I can't deny any of that. And yet, I still can't bring myself to really like this movie. But since I can't deny its impact and importance - it gets a 5/10 from me.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
10/10 for the time,"I saw this in August 1979 on the first theatrical re release. I was 7 turning 8. It changed my world and blew my mind. To be 8 when Empire came out and 11 when Jedi premiered , I was the generation that was lucky enough to experience these in the theatres where they belong. Having just watched the whole series on Showcase this weekend, albeit with commercials on a 30 inch screen, I find the last three insufferable. Noisy commercial filler. I get frustrated with the young generation rating the originals poorly, that lower the IMBD overall rating. They have no ability to realize how life changing these were for a generation. Compared to anything at the time, Star Wars was Wayne Gretzky, the GOAT. Of course, the pace is a little slower, but I will take them any day of the week over 1-3 and 6-9.

An Epic Saga worthy of the highest merits,"One of my earliest cinematic memories was that of Luke Skywalker flying his fighter ship into the long canal in the Death Star and using the force to accurately fire two shots into its core to blow it up. Ever since I was 5 I've loved this movie and I have never tired of it's story and excellent special effects. This movie was well ahead of its time and was a true trend setter as is evident by how many movies after Star Wars have taken from it. It was masterfully written and directed with a great story to go with even more magnificent special effects. This movie was all inclusive for every movie goer: there was the science fiction part of it with glimpses of the future not too far from reality. There was the tale of good versus evil and even a sub-plot of religious versus irreligious with those who believed in the ""Force"" and those who didn't. And there was even a bit of chivalry with the rescue of the damsel in distress, Princess Leia. The characters were intriguing and all had their niche in the movie. Ultimately, how could you not like the movie that gave birth to Darth Vader, arguably the most notorious screen villain ever. This is just an epic saga which I can't say enough about.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

George Lucas has vandalized a classic movie,"I remember fondly the original Star Wars movies in the theatre when I was a child. They were an excellent combination of special effects and plot development which made them the great classics that they are.Then the prequel trilogy came out...The prequel movies abandoned plot cohesiveness in favor of creating more opportunities to showcase the computer generated effects which are produced by Lucas' firm, Industrial Light and Magic. Foolish plot holes were created and the overall tempo of the movies was compromised to achieve the goal of more and more special effects scenes.Most people have been able to simply offer a dismissive sigh, accepting that George Lucas really isn't a very talented screenwriter, and shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a script when it's being written. At least we still had the original trilogy, which rests in our memories as great cinema.That all changed with the release of the new DVD version of the original trilogy. Lucas jumped in with his clumsy editing and rewrote whole sections of these movies so that they could be more like the prequel trilogy. ""Modern"" CGI effects were inserted into the classic movies in a seemingly random manner, breaking the continuity of the originals into a sick parody of the memories that we all have of these classics.One of the sadder botched edits done to the first Star Wars movie (now called Star Wars IV: A New Hope) appears to have been done out of political correctness. I guess Lucas now believes that a good guy would never shoot first in a gunfight, so in the bar scene where Greedo confronts Han Solo it appears that Lucas had to make some changes. I remember as a kid watching the original movie at the theater in 1977, and cheered as Han Solo covertly drew his gun under the table and shot Greedo without warning. I was surprised to see this scene edited for the DVD release to show Greedo actually firing first, missing badly from about five feet away before being shot by Han Solo.Special effects added throughout the movie seemed to do little more than break the flow of the movie in the same manner in which they cripple the prequel trilogy. The worst examples of these edits actually occurred in the final movie, Return of the Jedi, so I won't comment about that here.I wonder whether this isn't some marketing game, where Lucas expects to make a bundle of money off the badly edited DVD, and then in about 3 years will repackage the whole thing again without the modifications to release a version of the first trilogy that we would all run out and buy. However, much like the whole ""New Coke"" conspiracy theory, I really don't believe that there is any plan involved in this badly edited product. This is just the final product of the inflated ego of George Lucas, a man who believes that his special effects can make anything better.If that is the case, then he is badly mistaken. His additional special effects have vandalized a cinema classic.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It really is a kid's movie,"Star Wars is one of those movies you have to see as a kid. I saw it in 1997 and it instantly changed my view on movies. However, six years later, my tastes in movies have changed and Star Wars seems disappointing. The acting is mostly lacklustre, even from Alec Guinness, who looks bored of the whole exercise. It seems a shame that Sir Alec would be doomed to be remembered as Obi-Wan Kenobi for the rest of his career, as it's hardly a good part. Elsewhere, the effects are getting worse as the years pass, although the Death Star trench run still excites after countless viewings. And anyway, at least it's better than the prequels.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Having been captured by one of the empires most sinister agents Darth Vader, Princess Leia sets off a chain reaction that will forever change and define the galaxy...The movie that ushered in a new era for blockbusters and ground breaking special effects that brought forth a new precedence in what can be achieved in film and storytelling. At one time the highest grossing film of all time. The story, sweeping, the characters and locations memorable and what many have dubbed the greatest sci fi movie of all time.Lucas takes you on a roller coaster ride of action and adventure that had as of yet to be every experienced in film. Once again John Williams scores this movie where in this instance the soundtrack only strengthens and endears the film for legions of fans across the world, having spawned 5 sequels and with an upcoming 6th film coming out in 2015, Star Wars is simply put one of the finest gems in all of film history.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Harrison Ford Saves this Movie,"""Star Wars"" is a good movie, but it is nowhere near the cinematic masterpiece fans and the AFI claim it to be. It is an interesting and often exciting adventure story with elements of mysticism and Kurosawa flicks spun into a science fiction landscape. It's fun for a Saturday afternoon matinée, but it seems a bit silly to compare this movie to, say, ""Citizen Kane"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""The acting is fair. None of the stars, with several big exceptions, wowed me with their portrayal of allegedly mythic heroes. Mark Hamill, as Luke Skywalker, still seems a little green around the edges, and is far from being a mature hero. Princess Leia, played by Carrie Fisher, also seems a bit immature as the ""damsel in distress,"" and her acting is a bit wooden. No, the most intriguing character in this movie, and arguably the biggest star and electric dynamo of the ""Star Wars"" franchise, is Han Solo. He, unlike Luke Skywalker, is a fun guy to watch: a brilliant antihero with ambiguous morals who actually undergoes a moral transformation in the movie, from gruff space pirate to reluctant member of the Rebel Alliance. Ford clearly know how to make this character come to life. Unlike Luke, Han Solo is a macho man's man, a guy who's tough and not a pure hero. Ford's acting, unlike Hamill's or Fisher's, is the most convincing, most emotional, and the most fun to watch. It's no coincidence that ""Star Wars"" made a Hollywood A-list star out of Ford, rather than Fisher or Hamill, and that Spielberg and Lucas later chose him to be the title hero for the equally successful ""Indiana Jones"" movies. The reason Ford came out on top above all the others stars is that, well, he's just that good!Other actors who do well include Alec Guinness, as Obi-Wan Kenobi, and body-builder Daivd Prowse as Darth Vader. I think poor Mr. Prowse has not gotten the credit he deserves for donning the Darth Vader costume and making the role truly menacing. Sure, James Earl Jones is Vader's voice, but Prowse IS the man behind the mask, and he is just as responsible as Jones for making Lord Vader one of cinema's most iconic villains.Overall, this is a good movie, but again, not a timeless work of art for the ages. Watch it for Harrison Ford, who is one of the greatest action heroes of all time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A New Hope is the closest I came to seeing one all the way through. While origin stories are always more interesting, I just wasn't grabbed by the George Lucas fantasy world. If all you've seen are the ""new"" ones (or God forbid the ""new new"" ones) you owe it to the franchise to see how it all began. Yes, you'll see feathered 1970s hairdos, special effects that haven't stood the test of time, and actors you only think of as ""old men"" when they were young and handsome.

The start of a saga,"Back in the 60s, it was mesmerizing to see Stanley Kubrick create an out of this world (literally!) film known as 2001: A Space Odyssey but what George Lucas made in 1977 started a huge trend in culture known as Star Wars.Star Wars: A New Hope follows Luke Skywalker as he teams up Han Solo, Chewbacca, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO and R2-D2 to destroy the Empire's most destructive station and save Princess Leia from the evil mastermind named Darth Vader.Just imagine watching a movie like this in the late 70s. It would have been nothing like anything else shown in the theatres before. The film had a reported budget of $11 million and the effects even today still hold up. It's astounding to see something so original and unique be made for it to become one of the biggest pop culture phenomenons. The film looks gorgeous. A lot of creatures shown and fight sequences look real making the realism stay throughout.The characters are really well written. Mark Hamill portrays Luke perfectly. His transformation from a whiny kid to a mature leader was great to see and this arc added so much depth to him. Carrie Fisher fit right in the role of Princess Leia. She's not the standard damsel in distress you would see normally because Lucas fleshed out her character completely accompanied with Fisher's mannerisms and dialogues. Then we have the almighty Harrison Ford playing one of the best characters to ever exist. Ford lives and breathes as Han Solo as he is so entertaining to watch and has great chemistry with Hamill and Fisher. We also have Alec Guinness who played Obi-Wan Kenobi perfectly. Finally we have one of the most iconic villains, Darth Vader. Lucas made Darth Vader also interesting to watch by showing off his power and leadership to audiences to really show how evil he may be.A New Hope has so many great scenes (the bar scene) and character interactions that keep the flow going without a second of boredom. The concluding battle is something so intense and fascinating to watch. You being to wonder how they created it in the 70s. It must have been spellbinding and hypnotic to see something as cool and fun as Star Wars at the time of its release. It's filled with many memorable characters, awesome VFX and action sequences that'll make you root for each and every one of the protagonists.

I, being a die hard Star Wars fan, believe that anything that is remotely related to Star Wars deserves a good look over and this definitely beats a lot of other movies to the top.  The only thing that I can fine wrong is the acting.  Most of the actors have gone on and improved very much in their acting abilities like Harrison Ford. But in the beginning he was not very good in fact I would even call his acting stiff.  But we should give him a break because, this was his second movie after ""American Grafitti.""

Easily the best movie in the Star Wars-saga,"I have seen the first three movies evolve from their VHS-releases to their newest DVD-releases. Of the three movies of the ""ancient era"", this really sticks out as the best of them all.I was very young the first time I saw this, and it captured me with its fantastic creatures, the action, the whole universe was so convincing to me, and the characters were really good and left a good impression on me. Seeing it again more than 15 years later, still makes me feel like I did back then.This movie is obviously very influenced by 2001: A space odyssey, as seen in the interior design of the rebel space ship in the opening scene, and the docking scenes with the Death Star. Not that it's a bad thing, it is something I felt added a lot to this movie.Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi both fail to keep up with the goodness of this movie in terms of consistency and use of scenes. In particular, there is this new CG-enhanced music scene in Return of the jedi that is so embarrassing to watch it almost destroyed the movie, and the coming of the Ewoks just goes from bad to worse. Luckily, Star Wars does not have this sort of bumpy-ride feel to it, and one that had the most graceful evolution of the three movies with the new releases, except for the ""Han shot first""-scene treatment.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The film that started it all,"It's 1999, 22 years since the original release of Star Wars, and we still have people flocking to SW conventions, dedicating entire web sites to SW, spending hundreds of dollars on posters and action figures, and generally assuring that the SW frenzy will live forever. Okay, I'm not critical of the die-hard fans, since I am one myself and very proud of that.  I am told I bear a striking resemblance to Carrie Fisher, so I dressed up like Leia for Halloween once, complete with the cinnamon-bun hair.  (I wanted to be Yoda but the costume shop said the outfit only had one ear.)  Regardless whether you're nuts about SW or not, it is a masterful exercise in filmmaking and the original movie was, of course nominated for an Academy Award.  Pretty unheard of for a sci-fi/fantasy.George Lucas famously described the trilogy as a ""three-act play."" Everyone is introduced in the first act, SW; they are placed in a dark, desperate mess in the second, ESB; and finally they get out of the hole in the final third, ROJ.  This setup works fairly well for the trilogy, although some find fault with Lucas's idea.  They say Star Wars has too little character involvement, Empire is too dark, and Return is too happy.  Everyone is entitled to his/her opinion, but I think Lucas's strategy works well in the long-term effect.  We grow to love the characters after three movies; things like that take time and sometimes multiple movies!!!Although SW is not my favorite of the three (I find it somewhat campy and unemotional,) it was a fantastic starting block and lead-in to The Empire Strikes Back, which was one of the most anticipated sequels of all time. Mark Hamill was adequate as Luke Skywalker, although the whining was a little irritating.  The aerial battle above and around the Death Star is fabulous.  James Earl Jones immortalized the ominous voice of Darth Vader. Carrie Fisher is young and tenacious (and not as drugged out as in the second movie.  I'm not cruel, just honest!) And Harrison Ford was absolutely perfect as the rough-n-tumble Han Solo.Judging by its cult-like following (heck, even Wedge has his own fan club!), Star Wars is one of those immortal things, so you might as well love it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Overpopularized, but good","""Star Wars is the greatest movie of all time"" claim the pundits. Nonsense. Star Wars is a good action movie, a reasonable science fiction movie, and a bad character movie. There is insufficient plot to fill out the amount of time you have to sit, and the special effects look like they were made more than 20 years ago. At its time this was a very good movie. It is a very influential movie, but it is not as watchable as Aliens or even Star Trek: First Contact.Of the lead 6 good guys:Two are incapable of human speech, and make noises that are supposed to provoke emotion, but just sound stupid.Two are now famous actors, one (Ford) showing what he does that makes him so popular, showing off his strength as an actor, and the other (Fisher) showing why she is no longer famous.One is an annoying weak wooden robot...and the other is C3PO.Mark Hamill is one of the weakest lead actors of our time, and the fact that three of his movies are rated in the top 50 movies of all time is very questionable.On the other hand, the special effects were impressive then, and are mildly impressive now.

Lucas ruined a great thing,"There's been so much said about this movie. The expansive lore that came from this film is stuff of legend. Probably one if the largest franchises in all of cinema history. With all that hype, does it hold up? I'd say yes!This could be the perfect movie; it's never boring, each scene is distinctive and memorable and the events transition into each other seamlessly. The music is incredible, the production and set design is jaw-dropping with the world it created. The characters are likable.The framing device of being from the point of view of C3PO and R2-D2 and we essentially follow them the entire time but they're not even the main characters is insane.Side note- there's a lot of anti-droidism, almost an allegory for slavery and classism- in this that I don't think gets talked about enough.This movie really does have much to discuss and appreciate- the big bad taste in my mouth though is the only way this film is now officially released is the awful edit George Lucas did in the late '90's.

Possibly the pivotal point of my life.,"Star Wars. The theater was black except for the small light coming from the projector onto the big silver screen in front of a 7 year old boy. His eyes glued and wide in anticipation of a film that he knew very little about other than an adventure in space, a place where he always dreamt of escaping to. When the first note trumpeted out of the speakers for the first time, his heart pounded and his soul was free. This universe that George Lucas had captured and the young man, Luke Skywalker, was the embodiment of the dreamy eyed young 7 year old now watching, vicariously living in that universe. From that point on, I grew a little more hopeful for the future, that 7 year old's spirit still laughing, smiling and even crying inside, encouraging me to escape what I thought a terrifying life of abuse from peers and my own subjugating voice telling me I'd never be anything but a loser. This movie's storyline was inspiring to me as an artist, writer, actor and human being. The underlying religious connotations I've never considered religious overload, merely to believe in something bigger than oneself, an energy that encompasses everything, everyone. At this point at the end of 2015, almost 40 years after its release, I am still drawn into that flicker of light and that very first note, a glimpse into what can be, a piece of my own new hope.May the Force be with you all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""The Force will be with you, always.""","In the summer of 1977, during a time when most motion pictures were all about being rough and gritty, Star Wars exploded onto the scene with its fresh take on classic adventurism and epic storytelling. The immense popularity that followed ensured that it beat the odds against a skeptical studio that never saw the viability of the franchise, and ensured its resounding success for decades. It has since become the progenitor of all modern blockbuster films.Whether you start the series here or with the modern prequel The Phantom Menace, you'll be immediately submerged into a unique and original universe. Great care and consideration is placed into every person, place, and thing in the series, with an exceptional level of background and detail. Entering the Star Wars universe is one of the deepest and most lively franchises, even to this day.The story kicks off right in the middle of a big space pursuit, and maintains steadily fast pacing throughout. The original special effects have always been impressive, with loads of quality models and matte paintings that still hold up. There are a number of added CGI scenes from the '97 update, which haven't aged that well. But what really matters is the spirit of the movie; whether lurking around the seedy underbelly of Mos Eisley, or storming the decks of the Death Star, the movie is loaded with action and comedy, and it takes itself seriously only when it has to. The resulting thrill ride is as lighthearted as it is exciting and memorable.Borrowing directly from Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress, and with some influence by classic sci-fi serials like Buck Rogers, the story for this is not terribly original, but it is a solid and fresh take on the genre, with a cast of fine characters. The biggest and most original contribution is Luke Skywalker's journey from being a humble farm boy to being the hero of the Rebel Alliance (featuring themes that echo Lucas' previous film American Graffiti). The film's structuring allows for a steady introduction to all the characters and concepts, making it easily digestible and continuously iconic.The film is competently-made, with solid photography and editing. Special effects are groundbreaking for its time. At times, I feel that the imagery with the given camera angles, lighting effects, costume and set designs, are like an evolution of THX1138, lending the film a slick futuristic appeal. Acting tends to be a bit hammy in all the Star Wars films, but are probably at their best here; Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Sir Alec Guinness bring the characters to life in a vivid and memorable way. Writing can be quite nutty, but the dialogue is memorable. All of the film's sets, props, costumes, and special effects are swell, even if they do show their age a little. And the music is excellent; John Williams' original score matches the movie perfectly, and is exceptional.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars: More than Anything We Could Ever Imagine,"STAR WARS: A NEW HOPESTARRING: MARK HAMILL, CARRIE FISHER, HARRISON FORD, AND ALEC GUINNESSLet's face it. No matter how many movies come out with BIGGER special effects, MORE evil characters and UNFORGETTABLE good characters... none will be better than the first Star Wars. From the get go, we fell in love with curious young Luke Skywalker, and we felt we wanted the adventure Hans Solo was constantly looking for. We felt grief for Princess Leia when she was captured by the evil Darth Vader and we all wanted a grandfather like Obi Wan Kenobi. Hell, we even wanted Chewbacca as a pet instead of a dog. This movie is a classic, hands down. Who cares if it's not your type of movie, acknowledge the fact that we're lucky a movie so wonderful like this even exists.

Overrated,"Star Wars well deserves its reputation as a classic but it's overrated in general. John Williams score alone is a masterpiece. But if we want to be objective this isn't a really good film.

"Great! Don't get cocky, kid.","OK, this was a pretty good movie with some pretty good effects (just make sure you don't overwatch it, or you'll get bored with it).The idea for Star Wars is pretty good. I loved the character of Darth Vader. I'm not saying I'm rooting for the bad guys, I'm saying that the idea of Vader is an interesting idea. I mean, think about it. The Jedi order is abolished, and the only one who is allowed to use the Force is the Sith (the dark side of the Force).My favorite characters are Han Solo, Chewbacca and R2-D2. I like Luke too, but I don't think he became a real big big favorite until ROTJ. I also enjoyed Obi-Wan Kenobi.The effects are fantastic, especially for its time. The aliens are interesting, the bad guys are well-done (though how humans came to be the dominant species is a little surprising. Sorry, but compared to some of the other beings I saw in the Star Wars universe, it's a little surprising). I love the lightsabers and just about everything about this movie. The only problem I have is with the Force, as pretty much all Christians do. But we're able to draw enough Christian elements out of it to tolerate it.humor, action, and a lot of tension with Solo and Leia, very, very good. I don't know if it deserved the standing ovations it got in the theaters, but still great. A new hope indeed!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
a fun flick that spawned too many dire imitators,"Though I like ""Star Wars"" in isolation, I'm angry about what it did to science fiction and to movies as a whole.Let's be honest; although this is great entertainment, it does lack depth and sensitivity. The characters are all archetypes: the roguish Han, the sagely Kenobi, the brash youngster Luke. And let's not forget Darth Vader (""Dark Invader""?), who seems to have stepped right out of a 1950s pulp magazine. I like these folks - I grew up with them - but fascinating people they ain't.The film only works because it plays to very basic emotions and themes. Luke wants to leave home and see the universe. The Empire is evil - just evil, who needs an explanation? And though there's hardware and technology on display everywhere, it's ultimately faith and spiritualism (in the form of the Force) that saves the day. It's a very positive flick, but what is really the message? If you have a moment of Zen in the cockpit of your X-Wing, you'll be able to guide your torpedoes right down the throat of that evil space station? Strange that this moment means so much to so many people.Don't get me wrong; I love good sci-fi. But I was actually raised on the more cerebral stuff - the sci-fi that discusses issues instead of wages wars. ""Star Wars"" is firmly in the latter camp; it has great combat, but not great drama. And it has inspired so many feeble imitators (pick one, there's a million of them) and forced the advancement of special effects so far that movies have been forever changed, for the worse, because of it. After this, movies were all about faster paces and bigger bangs. The 1970s, a very meaningful decade for cinema, gave way to the shallow sci-fi spectacle of the 80s...and this is the movie that's responsible for that regrettable shift in emphasis.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
it remains a classic of its genre...,"Star Wars, despite the butchering of the film in the late 90s remains a classic example of what Hollywood does best....great entertainment.Although highly derivative of just about every fairytale and comic serial, the film is so well put together that once you are on board for the ride it doesn't matter.Lucas has a very grand vision and the visual effects, whilst not quite up to 21st century digital effects certainly are effective.This film ushered in the modern era of use of sound which had languished since the early days of stereo soundtracks in the 1950s.Who can deny the impact of the opening sequence, especially in the cinema, of the starship zooming over the audience. It is one of the most brilliant beginnings to a film ever.(Even if the film unions despised not having opening titles!)It is a pity that DVD release does not have the original versions of the Star Wars trilogy. The bastardised digital updates from the late 1990s are simply not as good. Sorry Mr Lucas you are wrong to think they are better. The few extra special effects don't work and are very obvious.The new Star Wars movies simply do not have the magic of this film and its companion originals. The overuse of digital effects and the annoying JarJar simply emphasise this.But Star Wars is THE original and it is a must have in any film buff collection.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Luke Skywalkers unforgotten adventure,"I was but 7 when i first saw these movies, and needed my dad's elbow to hide my face in at the scary parts. I didn't understand the main plot and ideas of the movie at the time but now, I am older and watching the movies again, i can watch the movies without my dad and I love them. I have even started reading the books. Take it from me, if you haven't seen these movies, you should. So whats the basic plot? Luke Skywalker, otherwise know as son of Anikan leaves his home to begin a journey as a Jedi knight. He receives his first training from Obi-wan Kenobi, or as Luke calls him, Ben. He encounters many dangers, and meets new friends along the way, such as Princess Leia, Han Solo and his Wookie, Chewbacca. R2D2, and See-Threepio.

Do movies get much better than this?,"Not really. Almost 30 years later, Star Wars is a household name. It would be a challenge to find someone who has never heard of Mr. Lucas's little adventure story. This highly imaginative story is one that almost anyone could find enjoyable. The weaving of action, adventure, drama, conflict, and a plethora of other genres and literary devices is absolutely remarkable. All of this encased in a theme of science fiction is a clear cut example that great writing is just that, great writing. A New Hope along with its sequels, especially the two that followed, TESB and ROTJ will be remembered for a very very long time, even in a galaxy far, far away.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I won't get in to that except to say that they are his films, and he can do with them as he will. That aside, this film is one of those great movies that has just a purely awesome story, is not boring for adults and yet it is MPAA rated such that the young can also enjoy it without being bombarded by violence or vulgar language. I'm all for films with those elements, but it takes a special film to be successful without them.

This movie is a Masterpiece, flawless, never aging. George Lucas greatest work (followed close by the Raider of The Lost Ark).

Deserves its staying power,"It is misunderstanding to call Star Wars science fiction. Science fiction needs to develop, dwell on, and often to strike the audience with awe over a plausible scientific or technological development greatly surpassing what we know.  Lucas pondered early on with John Williams whether the character of the music should be electronic- mystical, as science fiction would suggest.  They decided against it-- and can anyone doubt that Williams's actual score captured the true texture of the film much better?  Set in ""a galaxy far, far away"" though it was, the music and almost everything else stressed the familiar rather than the strange. The parallels with our own culture were deliberate and a source of amusement. We are to feel at home in this world.  More on this later.I remember seeing this film for the first time, being in my mid twenties but catching upon in many ways on that adolescence which had passed me by in my teens.  I was with a wonderful, unorthodox friend, a little younger than I and different from anyone I had ever been friends with before.  He led me all the way down the aisle to sit in the very front row.  I had never done that.  Something so, well, extreme hadn't been my style.  I was, in short, prepared already for a different kind of experience, and Star Wars provided it.Part of the initial success of Star Wars was due, I think, to its simple and straightforward morality.  As others have detailed, everyone knows who the good guys and the bad guys are here.  The good guys are brave, confident of their cause, and they win decisively.  I'm not sure it has been remarked, however, how ready we were for something like this.  When it came out, the U.S.  was disillusioned and demoralized.First Vietnam.  Then Watergate.  Inflation was eating the economy alive.  We had become guilt-ridden and unsure of our instincts. We were tired of shadows, ambiguities, and catch-22s.  By seeing clear-cut heroism work in a galaxy far, far away, just maybe we could bring it back home where we were missing it badly.Also, at that time, I detested where I was living and working.  It had been a mistake to move there, and I seemed trapped and wondered if I would ever get out.  Are we in charge of our own lives, I wondered, or leaves tossed randomly in the wind? So I really empathized with young Luke's despondency, stuck on a dismal backwater of a planet when he wanted to be where some action was.  It was exhilarating to follow him as he was drawn into the vortex of important matters.  I daresay we we have all felt like that at times; so this is one more fantasy which Star Wars plays out for us.It is stunning to reflect on how well I remember first seeing this film, and how long ago it really was: some of its adult fans today weren't even born then.  But One can't even say that this shared admiration crosses generational boundaries. It simply obliterates them. How many films become blockbusters, and their delighted makers rush to cash in on the craze with one or more slipshod sequels which can be counted on to suck?  Lucas never did that. His craftsmanship and creativity have been consistent, and now his patience has got to be almost unique.  He has now been working on the fourth episode for almost two decades; and the world is still waiting for it with bated breath.  It had better be damned good.  And something tells me it will be.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Good film even though it doesn't live up to all the hype,"I know that there are few movies out there which are as much loved as ""Star Wars"". So, I think I should say this straight away; I do *not* think that this film deserves all the praise and all the hype it's gotten over the last 22 years. However, I do like this film, it's just that it is so full of clichés that one more cliché would've made it a very silly film. As it is now, it's not silly, it's a good film for kids. I don't say that to try to put the film down, there's nothing wrong with children's films. Look at the best Disney films for example! Some of them are masterpieces. And I really like fantasy films like ""Star Wars"" even if I think that e.g. ""Time Bandits"" is a better film. Having said that, there is nothing really wrong with ""Star Wars"", it's good entertainment. It's rather funny (I like interplay between R2-D2 and C-3PO) and apart from the clichés (though they are overwhelming) it is a rather nice story -- for kids. Not being a child I do demand much more from a film's script than this, but I was still very entertained while I watched ""Star Wars"" and my vote for it here at IMDb was a 6 (out of 10).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A Long Time Ago, It Started","The one that began it all is also the best in the series. Whereas the later films become too bogged down with plot and perhaps take themselves too seriously, this one is just plain fun. It pays homage to the great adventure films of yesteryear, including ""The Searchers."" Hamill and Fisher failed to capitalize on the success of this series while Ford parlayed his role as the wise-cracking Han Solo into super-stardom. Despite his disdain for the film, Guinness is masterful as Obi-Wan. The majestic score by John Williams definitely adds to the excitement. Interestingly, Lucas did not direct the two sequels, but returned to direct the second trilogy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Charming, but time took its appeal","I think everything about this sci-fi story is known to everyone. ""Star Wars"" grossed 460 million $ in U.S. cinemas making it the most commercial movie of the 1970s. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe for best picture, director and supporting actor Alec Guiness. For all those categories it was nominated also for an Oscar. The movie won 7 Oscars, but only in technical categories, while the one for best picture went to Woody Allen's ""Annie Hall"". Many were outraged at that Oscar decision, but I think this is one of the few times I would agree with the academy.I like ""Star Wars"", really I do. It made so many people nostalgic but I noticed that I truly loved it only when I was a kid, and not now while I'm a grown up. Strange irony; back then I hated ""Annie Hall"", today its one of my favorite movies( Grade:10/10 ). What's the problem with ""Star Wars""? I think it has only about 15 % of the magic that is anticipated while you watch its poster.-------------------------------Take the characters for instance. They are all one dimensional. We never find out more about Luke's life on the farm. We never see him taking a bath, sleeping, going out with his friends or being in love. Chewbacca is so silly that you don't know if he is a animal or an intelligent being that's mentally ill. The only character that is developed is the cynical Han Solo ( I wish there were more lines from him like the one when he says to Obi-Wan that he thinks that the whole Force theory is a joke ). Look at how quirky the characters are in animes like ""Slayers""! The best scene was the one where the two Sunsets can be seen from Luke's planet. That was real magic, unlike other sequences which were more action oriented. I guess the thing that is the most problematic is the almost total lack of emotions. The utopic story is cold and not interested in drama. I wonder what Jean-Luc Godard or Joel Coen could have made if they had directed ""Star Wars"".""Star Wars"" is a good film and its creation of Darth Wader is classic, but looking at its wooden story you just can't but not to wonder if the whole cult thing around it( its no. 9 on IMDb's top 250 films )may have never been started if the special effects weren't so grand.Grade: 6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Kiddie movie with decent SFX,"The problem with this movie is the script.  It just never rises above the level of a Flash Gordon episode.  The camera work is pedestrian.  The pacing is glacial except for the last ten minutes and the back and forth storytelling (a problem in all the Star Wars movies, but especially those directed by Mr. Lucas) never lets any momentum build.  Like ""Phantom Menace"" and espcially ""Attack of the Clones"", Lucas just doesn't know how to write a ""scene"".  What we get is like a quilt of little bits that are cobbled together.  Each with basically the same pace.  The saving grace of ""Star Wars"" is some of the acting.  Alec Guinness really brightens up the screen whenever he's on.  And Peter Cushing brings some genuine class and star quality.  I saw this movie again recently and I was stunned by what a big bore it is.  I can't imagine how anyone over the age of 20 could be thrilled by it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Luke lives on a desert planet and longs to join the rebellion, but can't because his Uncle Ben doesn't want him to.

The nobodies who played the parts became huge actors of the time, Harrison Ford is hailed as the most successful actor of all time.

"How I love thee Star Wars, let me count thy ways","The reasons I love Star Wars, especially episode IV, are numerous. I love it because it opened space opera to the masses. I love it because of the humanity of the characters. I love it because of the relationships between the characters. I love it because it's fun, it just is, it's a fun movie. I don't see how people can dislike the actors, to me the acting is charming and enjoyable and even a form of escapism.I think the reason some don't like the film is because they do not appreciate it for what it is. Perhaps they prefer films that just provide entertainment in it's simplest form. In which case I would not say it is for you. The entertainment in this film comes in many layers.What this film is, is an escape to a galaxy far, far away, yet it feels so close to home. A nobody goes off and becomes somebody. Adventure is the order of the day. Knight rescues damsel from sinister fortress. The film is extremely fast paced and not in key with traditional sci-fi, that is why it is so accessible to so many.With the prequels I felt I just didn't care about the characters. In the original trilogy the characters are bonded to you by steel. The death of (so and so) is so powerful. When the old man with the white beard dies, you care. Gandalf? Who the hell is Gandalf?It doesn't have the darkness of the empire strikes back or the digital polish of the prequels, but it does make up for it with sheer good-natured, puppyish enthusiasm.

I would have given Harrison Ford an Oscar nomination because he has the best character which practically made the first three great.

Greatest Sci fi adventure ever.,"Star Wars was the film that changed cinema forever. It had everything, brilliant special effects, a scary villain, fully built set pieces that you had never seen before, a brilliant music score from John Williams and likable characters in Han Solo and Obi-wan Kenobi well played by Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness. It was a film that had blazing action from start to finish, it was a film that the writer and director George Lucas had intended for children, his target audience was twelve and under, but it became a true mega blockbuster and people of all ages came again and again, dragging their friends with them.My favourite scenes include the opening sequence: the massive imperial Star Destroyer roaring over the screen attacking the fleeing rebel cruiser, that scene is mind-blowing on a cinema screen, i love the introduction of Darth Vader emerging from the smoke of the laser battle between the Stormtroopers and the Rebels, i also like the way Vader is established as an evil killer right away when he crushes the neck of some poor hapless rebel prisoner holding him up with one hand and throwing him to the side like a rag doll, this gives Vader's character a sense of malevolence from the kickoff.I also like the lightsaber duel between obi-wan and Vader on the Death Star more so for the verbal exchanges between the two Jedi 'When i was with you i was but the learner now i am the master.' Obi-wan:'Only a master of evil DARTH!!!' The duel is not as energetic as Luke and Vader in The Empire Strikes Back, but it is still a powerful and moving moment especially when Luke, Han and Leia make a dash for the falcon and Luke sees Obi-wan cornered by Vader. That scene is one of emotion that Lucas hits right on the head, Luke sees Obi-wan's plight, Obi-wan smiles at Vader, he raises his sabre and closes his eyes, Vader strikes as look screams 'NO!' and John Williams score swells with tragic loss as Luke blasts away at the Stormtroopers. Its the one scene that sticks in my mind about A New Hope, that isn't special effects or cgi.The final aerial assault between TIE fighters and X-wing fighters over the Death Star is perhaps the most exciting finale of any movie, the tunnel chase with Luke's X-wing and Vader's TIE fighter thrills ALL the time. Finally i have to say when i talk to people who have seen Star wars in any shape or form, rarely do they say they don't like the movies, but when i do meet someone that hates these classics they ALWAYS say the same thing: 'Im not really interested in films.' That says it all, does it not?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My favorite movie,"When this movie came out back in the days I couldn't understand most of it. I was young, I didn't knew a thing about space travel, plasma stuff or force fantasies. Over the time I must have watched it over 50 times and bit by bit I understood more and more and this movie grew into my heart.The effects were colossal at the time, unheard and unseen. Can you imagine a light saber back in the 70's? I mean wow... And the costumes - glorious. And the story was marvelous on it's own, it was a space western. A new, unexplored genre full with space action. The music was made by geniuses, it was powerful and memorable. Acting not so great I presume...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
What's left to say?,"It seems that the honoring of George Lucas with the Lifetime Achievement Award could not have come at a better time for the visionary and imaginative filmmaker. With ""Episode III"" still raking in sold-out crowds six weeks after its release, Lucas is pretty much on top of the world. But what about the film that started it all, ""Star Wars"" (1977)? What's left to say about it? Every good thing that has and can be said about it has been said already, ever since it debuted in the summer of '77 and changed the way we looked at movies, and the way people made them. ""Star Wars"" is sheer imagination run amok, taking place a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, with farmboy Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) discovering the two droids C-3PO and R2-D2, the latter droid of which contains a holographic image of a distress call from Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). The Princess is being held captive by Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) and his fearsome military commander Darth Vader (played by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones), the dark lord of the Sith, on the newly constructed Death Star battle station. Skywalker, taking advantage of an opportunity to leave behind boring farm life, seeks out the mysterious Obi Wan Kenobi (the late Alec Guiness, in an Oscar-nominated performance) and the two journey to a Mos Eisley watering hole to enlist the aid of swashbuckling space pirate Han Solo (Harrison Ford), pilot of the Millennium Falcon, and his Wookie sidekick Chewbacca - their adventures resulting in them joining the Rebel Alliance - culminating in one of the greatest screen battles, which is the Rebel assault on the Death Star at the film's climatic conclusion. Lucas brought forth this ambitious vision to stunning reviews and a devoted fanbase that has established ""Star Wars"" as a subculture within pop culture. It's impossible to call this film dated in any fashion, given that Lucas often had to resort to imagination to get things done on this project since budget constraints allowed for such creativity. When I saw ""Star Wars"" for the first time when I was kid, it took my breath away, as I'm sure it did to everyone else that saw it for the first time. That initial viewing sticks with you, and as a result the film never looses its impact. ""Star Wars"" was of course followed by the somber ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980) and the triumphant ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983), both of which are also considered classics in themselves. And with the prequel trilogy (1999's ""The Phantom Menace,"" 2002's ""Attack of the Clones,"" the aforementioned 2005 conclusion ""Revenge of the Sith"") out of the way, there is word out that Lucas isn't done with ""Star Wars,"" and may be looking to start a new trilogy. But with all this, we still need to look back at the film that started it all, the film with nothing left to talk about, the original ""Star Wars"" (1977).10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Maybe I Never Got It,"I will never forget the hoopla associated with this movie.  Having seen articles in Time and Newsweek, my friend and I took off early from work and made our way to the one theater in the Minneapolis Metro area that was showing ""Star Wars"" (boy have times changed!).  There were local news stations, reporters, models, everywhere.   How we were able to just walk to the window and purchase tickets, I don't know, but we did. I still have my blue button with ""May the Force be With You"" emblazoned on it.  I'm told it's pretty valuable.  A reporter approached us and asked my friend, ""What do you expect.""  He responded in his sort of wise ass way, ""A sprawling intergalactic epic.""That was all very interesting, but when we finally sat down and the movie began, I found it was less than I had hoped for.  Part of my problem was that at that time, most of what I read was science fiction.  As I watched the events unfold, I realized that this movie wasn't really science fiction--it was a Western.  It was the good guy versus the bad guy and an effort to save the old ranch that the bad guys have pillaged.  Take out the awesome special effects and the cool aliens and it just wasn't very interesting.  I realize that most of the people that have seen this consider it just slightly below the second coming--nearly a religious experience--but it wasn't for me.  I saw nothing new or complex about the character or the themes in the movie.  As far as speculative science fiction it is barren. Don't get me wrong, I still think that there are amazing things to watch, but I can't get past the fact that the storm troopers can't hit the broad side of a barn with laser weapons but the good guys can pick off about a dozen from behind a post.  Where did these guys get their training?  How has the Empire survived so long with these incompetents. Having read ""Dune"" years before this film came out, I have to be brutally honest--how George Lucas didn't get sued for stealing from that book, I'll never know.  I always wondered if he made a deal with Frank Herbert.The worlds are exotic.  The aliens are wonderful (although, I thought the second and third movies were much better), especially that bar scene. But the bottom line is that it's an adventure movie.  Maybe someday someone will convince me otherwise (I have had about 50 people try). If I'm going to watch a Western, I prefer the Earps and Doc Holliday.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Terrific space age epic,"Star Wars is a film that started it all.  Not only the beginning of a 6 movie saga, but many other things as well.  The film takes many things as influence (Shakespeare's Hamlet, Flash Gordon serials, old voodoo stuff, and Stanley Kubrick's 2001) and it turns it into a terrific movie experience. Some scenes are not all there, but they are made up for the extraordiary space fights and great quotes ""May the Force be With You"".

"Not great cinema, but good fun.","Star Wars is not the greatest movie ever made. The plot is essentially ""the brave knight fights the dragon and saves the princess from the dark castle."" A lot of the characterization is pretty silly.However, it is still a very entertaining film. It's full of action, adventure, and good-natured heroism. The special effects now look somewhat cheesy, and a lot of the dialogue is just ridiculous, but heck, that just adds to the fun. Star Wars may not provide deep insights into the human condition, but it sure delivers good, swashbuckling escapism.The recently-released ""Special Edition"" is in fact inferior to the original. While the special effects have been ""enhanced"" by Industrial Light and Magic's digital whiz kids, these slick computerized FX look out of place beside the rest of the movie's more ""primitive"" visuals. As for the much-ballyhooed added scenes... well, let's just say that there was a reason that they were cut from the original. Some other alterations are just foolish.

Review of the Original Theatrical Edition,"The 1970's is most likely the best decade of films released. Films that were released in that decade set the templates of most film genres. ""Superman"", ""Animal House"", ""Grease"" ""Halloween"", ""The Exorcist"", ""Jaws"", ""Halloween"", ""The Omen"" and most importantly ""Star Wars"". Those films are just the tip of the iceberg.In 1977 there was little fanfare about this film coming from George Lucas. The studio (Fox) though their big release that year was going to be ""The Other Side of Midnight"".""Star Wars"" however was an over budgeted film that Fox did not put much marketing behind (At First). This film however was the first film ever promoted at ""Comic Con"" and that help spread the word that this film was coming.From the first moments on the screen to the closing frames the film the film was a huge feast for the senses.In a nutshell the story is about Rebels trying to destroy ""The Empire"". They control everything in the universe and basically everyone lives in fear of them. The main weapon of ""The Empire"" is the death star. The weapon can destroy a planet.THe Rebels have stolen the plans of the death star and have given them to Princess Leia. The Empire has now captured Princess Leia. Before she was captured she hide the stolen plans in R2d2. She has now sent R2D2 on his own mission to find Obi-Wan Kenobi. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a Jedi who she thinks they can help destroy not only ""The Death Star"" but ""The Empire"" as well.The film is one of the greatest. If you have never seen it on a big screen then you should.This film is always entertaining. It doesn't matter how many times you have watched it!If you can watch the the original theatrical edition.

"Yee-hah! - Ride 'em, spaceboy!","How do you hypnotize millions of film-goers into a quasi-psychotic state in which they honestly believe that have seen something, when they are just watching high-school kids masturbate? George Lucas seems to have that down to an art. I think he does it by rewriting every cliché in the book so that they all seem to have come out-takes from ""The Wizard of OZ"".This is definitely aimed primarily at the Mid-West US - listen to these voices - rather like hearing Johnny Carson make a serious pitch for the Jerry lewis Telethon. And these supposedly ""weird"" other worlds look an awful lot like Missouri and Oklahoma. And the big spacecraft - isn't that some Ford factory they closed down in Minnesota a few years back? What's alarming here is the sad lack of imagination. Really, you need to have taken too much meth and stayed up one night too many to be able to appreciate this film - to be allow Lucas and co. convince you that there's a film to watch here.An old Republic matinée western remade as a Saturday morning cartoon by/for survivors of one acid trip too many - or too few.Save your sanity; find something real to do.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A true landmark in science fiction and filmmaking.,"The problem with reviewing a film like Star Wars is that it has been scrutinized and analyzed and poked and prodded for decades, which leaves little left to be said about it that has not been said already (and, consequently, probably means that virtually no one will read my review of it!). The thing that allows Star Wars to really get under your skin and have such a powerful and lasting effect on you lies in the combination of its simplicity and complexity. It is no secret that the vast majority of film plots revolve around some version of the ancient `good vs. evil' storytelling structure, and Episode IV is probably the most widely given example of this. The original Star Wars is a shockingly simple presentation of this structure, but it is also an immensely enlarged version of it. Lucas uses good vs. evil to structure his plot, but at the same time, he adds a story that entails such a level of complexity that it is impossible to reduce the film to a tired exercise of an age-old story structure.George Lucas's superhuman visual imagination is one of the things that plays the largest role in making the original Star Wars film such a joy to watch. Every single scene is packed with visual curiosities that fascinate the viewer time after time, making the re-watch value nearly endless. Lucas is able to walk the fine line between using visual effects to carry his story and using them to enhance it, and this is an even stronger testament to the quality of the film, because the special effects, while obviously not the most technologically advanced in the world, are far superior to the complexity of the story, at least on a structural level. The thing that really counts against the newer Star Wars films - rather ironically, as it were - is that they replace the physically creative genius of these earlier films by simply creating everything through computer generated images, making the effects slightly more lifelike but immensely less realistic. A cartoon is more lifelike than a hand-puppet, but not more realistic by any stretch of the imagination.The old Star Wars films are the happy home of Lucas' extinct belief that less is more, and we can see this in the tremendous amount of material that is discussed but never seen on screen, because it doesn't need to be. Lucas understood how powerful an effect he could create by having Obi Wan Kenobi give the young Luke Skywalker a brief description of what the Force is, and then use it to influence the weak mind of an Imperial Storm Trooper (`We don't need to see his identification. These aren't the droids we're looking for.'). This is great stuff, and there's not a single CGI effect in the film necessary to create it.Consider, also, the extent of creativity involved in the making of the human portion of the film. We don't just see good guys and bad guys, but entire governments created with uniforms and even wildly elaborate outfits for their dark leaders (Darth Vader is, undoubtedly, one of the most recognizable figures in film history). This is an extremely well-presented hierarchy of characters, but it goes beyond just the leaders to include lower levels, all the way down to the scum of the run-down trade cities, as well as other characters such as the infantry-level Storm Troopers, who always seem to travel around in amusing little idiot packs, no doubt chanting `We are the moron brothers' to themselves and each other all the while. It's amazing that the Imperial Forces have managed to become so immensely powerful when their most basic watchmen are such boneheads. Didn't Lord Vader notice how pathetically weak-minded all of his troopers were? Obi Wan sure did!Harrison Ford fits perfectly into the film as the greedy Han Solo, a character who is so one-sided that Ford has recently revealed that he has no interest in ever playing him again, which is too bad because there are sure to be a lot of interesting things that he could contribute to Episode III. Mark Hamill delivers a brilliant performance as Luke Skywalker, who has nearly as much charisma and charm as Norman Bates, without all that stuff about his mother. Carrie Fisher is spectacular as Princess Leah, although unfortunately so spectacular that her role in the early Star Wars films has immensely overshadowed the rest of her sadly dismissible career as an actor. She and Mark Hamill were both, in fact, horribly insulted by their roles in the latest idiot film from Kevin Smith, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. The title makes it immediately clear that the movie is to be largely a parody of the Star Wars films (specifically the older ones), and the parody that is made in that film makes it very clear that some people (Kevin Smith) haven't sense enough to respect such tremendously successful and brilliant movies like the old Star Wars films, but rather know only to try to feed and capitalize off of them, regardless of how low they have to sink to do it.It's sad that movies come out these days that are so insulting to old classics, and that this almost always happens in spoof films, which always have the potential to be tremendously hilarious and entertaining films, but they rarely do. I hope that someone with some power in Hollywood will notice that the spoof films that blatantly exploit the films they are parodying in order to get some cheap laughs are unequivocally the awful ones (Jay and Silent Bob, Scary Movie 1 and especially 2, etc.). I wish it wasn't so hard for them to see that films that poke fun respectably, like Spaceballs or even Wrongfully Accused, to some extent, are always the ones that generate the most satisfying laughs, and retain the most staying power.Regardless of how the spoofs deliver moronic parodies of the original Star Wars films, however, they continue to stand as some of the greatest science fiction films of all time, and they remain that way even compared to their computer aided descendents. It is a testament to any kind of movie when it can stand up to nearly endless childish parodies as well as to theoretically improved versions of itself and extensions of its story, and still remain as powerful and moving as it was on the day it was released.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Best. Movie. Ever.,"Whatever else George Lucas does in his career, and no matter how Episode III turns out, what no one can take away from him is that in Star Wars he created, IMHO, the greatest two hours of film in cinema history. And that's ignoring the fact that it's the first part in what is, again IMHO, the greatest movie trilogy of all time. There's probably nothing I can say about this movie that hasn't been said before, but who cares, I'll say it anyway. My thoughts on what makes this film so good are difficult to list in only a 1000 words, but here goes.It's the most exciting two hours of film you'll ever see, featuring beautiful princesses, scary baddies, likeable rogues, daring-do and success against impossible odds. It has a masterfully crafted script, one that any student of  screenwriting or film history should study, utilising a template of Joseph Campbell's hero's journey theory and Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress. It's the perfect standalone adventure film, with a classic good against evil battle, yet at the same time hints at the existence of a much grander story that lends it a feeling of incredible depth. It's a film which can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike, and shows that the best kids movies, the ones that really stand the test of time, are the ones that don't set out to be kids movies in the first place, but just to be really good movies that will appeal to kids. It has the greatest opening sequence in film history, featuring the best special effect of all time. It has John Williams fantastic score, featuring the best title theme ever. And of course it has Darth Vader, quite simply the best villain in movie history (I still remember absolutely cacking myself as a kid when he breaks that Rebel troopers neck!).I could go on, but there's really no point. It's been said before but I'll say it again, if you don't like Star Wars, do you really like movies at all? Yes, the dialogue is extremely ropey in places and some of the effects are starting to show their age, even allowing for the changes in the Special Edition. But like the ridiculous 70's hairdo's everyone sports and the fact that C-3P0 is so obviously gay, this just adds to the films charm. And so what if the fact that Star Wars still commands such affection is based on nostalgia? Even stripping all of that away it remains a tremendously exciting, brilliantly conceived film. The fact is that if I could only watch one more film in my life, then it would have to be Star Wars.(Note - while I'm rating the film as 10/10, I have to subtract one point from the Special Edition, just for the fact that Greedo shooting first really detracts from Han Solo's hero's journey, and Han as a character, not to mention looking stupid.)Rating - Original Edition - 10/10 Special Edition - 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
More credit to Gary Kurtz,"All-time classic of cheezy pop space battle opera.  Poorly developed characters are given life by the excellent cast, especially Ford (who rose to fame in the role) and Guinness.  Story from the Kurosawa film ""The Hidden Fortress"" is full of climaxes, but Lucas keeps the pace moving and the film never fails to entertain audiences of all ages.  The goriest of all the series (just look for severed arms and bloodtrails);  Ford is more convincingly ""hardboiled"" here than in the sequels (in the last of which, sadly, he is reduced to trading one-liners with the robot comic relief duo).A few notes on this film.  I was surprised not to see the uncredited script contributions by Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck here on IMDB.  As Lucas' more recent solo efforts show, a lot of the credit for ANY believability in the dialogue, not to mention good structure to the film, should be credited to them.  In fact, a lot of the reason this film is great has nothing to do with Lucas; it's a solid production that came in under fire, and more credit should go to Gary Kurtz than is generally given.  In fact, although you won't have much trouble finding a ""Star Wars"" fan who can tell you all about the eating habits of the Wookie (or whatever), you won't find many who even know the name of the film's producer.  Most fans agree that the first and second films (""Star Wars"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"") are far and away the best he has made, but few people have connected this fact with producer Gary Kurtz, who has been absent from Lucas' subsequent efforts.Although the second film is more polished and is much better directed, this first one is I think the true all-time classic because it's just so much fun and it has no shame in being what it is.  You don't yet see the infusion of puppets that followed Lucas' semi-merger with Jim Henson Enterprises in the 80s, you don't see fuzzy teddy bears killing professional soldiers, but you do get a princess with a really weird hairdo (all respect to Carrie Fisher for even being able to carry off the part without laughing; some of the lines she has to say are just too much), guys with laser swords fighting, and cool space battles.  That's another thing -- hasn't anyone else noticed that the cool space dogfights that were the high point of the first trilogy are totally absent from Lucas' last two Star Wars films?  The battle in Episode I was very short and unexciting, and there was no outer space battle at all in Episode II.One thing that makes the film such a classic is that it is so involved.  No matter how many times I see it, I always seem to notice some new object lying around that I can wonder about, or some nuance in the acting (which is mostly very broad, I will admit) that has implications I haven't considered. There are also some technical flaws and continuity errors that are fun to look for.One very smart move Lucas (or, more likely, Kurtz, since this looks to me like a ""frozen funds"" film for Fox) made was to involve 2 very solid British character actors:  Guinness and Peter Cushing.  These 2 anchor the movie in case the robots and guys in suits hadn't proved convincing (which they did). A lot of people don't comment on Cushing in this movie, but I think he's great here as always at implying a menace that is carefully controlled within a strong personality.  There are some interesting scenes were Vader appears to defer to Tarkin, making him the senior power in the Empire, while there is a suggestion that Vader is simply humoring Tarkin.However you break it up, though, this one is for all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The film deals with a young man (Mark Hamill) who must rescue a beautiful princess (Carrie Fisher) from the evil clutches of Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones).

"Not the greatest film in the world, but still magic.","Let me get the most important point of my review out of the way first. I do not, like many, consider this to be the best film ever made. Further more I don't even consider it the best science fiction film ever made and I do not even consider it to be the best Star Wars film ever made (that distinction, in my opinion, belongs to The Empire Strikes Back). However, there is no denying that this is one of the most enjoyable blockbusters from Hollywood ever made. Setting in stone the foundations that blockbusters need, such as a high number of special effects, action sequences, a bunch of heroes and a good looking female lead, George Lucas has not created a work of art, but he has created one of the most perfect examples of what can be done in Hollywood. A hugely enjoyable adventure that amazes the eyes and senses. There's no point saying that the acting and script are great because they aren't. While Alec Guinness, Harrison Ford and James Earl Jones are fantastic, don't get me wrong, there isn't really anything here that could be considered award worthy, but that's not the point here. This is a film that will leave with a smile on your face for the simple reason that this is a blockbuster that is exciting, emotional and at its heart simple. The story is easy to follow, the characterization never complex and we can like all of it because it's so easy to watch.There is a lot that is right. Darth Vader's entrance almost seems to have been done with the knowledge that he would become one of modern cinemas most famous villains, the Death Star battle is superb by 1977 standards, while Carrie Fisher is undeniably one of the most beautiful females to have graced the screen (less so now, but then she was a stunner), while Harrison Ford has 'star' written all over him, it's not surprising that Indy, Jack Ryan and Blade Runner followed. George Lucas makes his film in the same way that a skilled magician does a trick, with style, ease and in a way that the audience is left awed. It is easy to why the fans have taken with it, even if it is less so why it tops films polls voted for by the public. Then there is John Williams music score which is deserving of its status while C-3PO is without doubt the best 'comical' robot to appear on film.The sense of magic about this film is undeniable. Empire may be the better film, but it is also the darkest, while the Ewoks were entertaining enough, but they still can't beat this, while the prequels, undeniably with better special effects and light sabre fights, concentrate too much on the CGI sets to have us fully engage (even if I must say, they aren't as bad as everyone makes out, if you ask me.)So there it is Star Wars. The greatest film of all time? No. The most cerebrally stimulating? No, it's not that either. Is it the most entertaining and fun film ever made? Yes it is, and for that we should always be thankful.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I guess, may the force be with it, always.","Well, everyone knows ""Star Wars"": a long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) battle Darth Vader's evil forces. Obviously, this is probably one of the top five most famous movies of all time, and it has truly withstood the test of time. It doesn't suffice to call ""Star Wars"" a sci-fi, a fantasy, or anything really; it is everything that a movie could be. Looking back on it, we notice that it was actually pretty low tech (which is part of why ""Episode 1"" was so bad).Well anyway, the point is that George Lucas created the ultimate masterpiece here.

One of the greatest sci-fi films ever made!,"Rated PG for Violence The Star Wars saga is one of(if not the most) popular saga out there.The first film came out in 1977 and ever since then there have been plenty of fans who go as far as dressing up and waiting in line for days when the sequels come out.In my opinion I think the original Star Wars trilogy(Episodes 4,5 and 6) are the best.Episode 1 was a disappointment, Episode 2 was better and Episode 3 was closest to the original three.The special-effects may be dated as of today but back in 1977, it was simply amazing.Darth Vader is a very cool villain as well.The film is basically about a farmer named Luke Skywalker who with the help of a princess named Princess Leia,Han Solo a pilot,Obi-Wan an old Jedi-knight,two robots named C3P0 and R2D2(who are in all six Star Wars films) and Chewbacca, Han Solo's wookie friend, they must destroy Darth Vader's death star.Star Wars is a very entertaining sci-fi film and if you haven't seen it(you're in the minority) you must!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fun movie and monumental achievement,"The dialogue and acting at times turns Star Wars into a straight comedy. That being said, the power of this sci-fi spiritual space western about a hero's journey from broken farm boy to the champion of a rebellion immediately resonated with an entire country.

STAR WARS--The Original American Film Epic,"A long, long time ago, I was never familiar with STAR WARS until this familiar sound of music played on the radio. Later, visions of action figures on TV commercials dominated my Saturday mornings. This sure was a completely giant success story that even I couldn't understand way back in my pre-school years, but it was just happening. It took years of waiting experience to get a new VCR, and I finally took advantage of the Force. If you were like me, your early childhood days have been rough because you never got to see the STAR WARS trilogy. Fascinated by flying spaceships, bold warriors, and especially C-3PO and R2-D2, the days were a joy to behold. George Lucas' sci-fi epic that includes this first original movie is a timeless treasure, thanks to his establishment of a fantasy adventure that goes galactic. He's not just an ordinary director, but a director of technology. The excitement of its epic combat battles are worth infinite viewings, and was destined to blow away the audience with a rapid-fire force of impact. And this revolutionary piece led to numerous imitators!You can very well remember how George Lucas and the whole ILM gang made this trilogy through its history of complications. The original STAR WARS was a terrible undertaking for Lucas because he wanted a movie that feels true to realistic. When JAWS was playing in 1975, it showed off some new special effects technology of a great white shark, and managed to achieve in editing. That hit film was released at a time when production values remained tight, which they were often called ""B"" movies. STAR WARS has been the same thing, and it wasn't exactly clear that high-quality visuals would ever be possible. It would take more than the entire National Football League to create a 70s masterpiece. Lucas tried, and won by displaying a thrilling speed of action with a lightning fast pace. One example is the brief ""hyperwarp"" scene, where one blink of an eye ruins your day. When you have an incredible view of the fireworks, there's always a big plot to make more excitement. Like the movies themselves, one good story leads to another.Without characters, there wouldn't be a movie at all. Make them appealing and then everyone can enjoy the fun. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) lives the adventure; Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is always the bold type; Chewbacca The Wookiee adds to the chemistry with his furry appearance; likeable droids C-3PO and R2-D2 are loved by the kids. But there's always the villain, Darth Vader whose familiarity would still be hated through fun, but always recognizable. This first installment actually serves as an introductory platform for the characters and their potential of things to come. We know them well, but this is only the beginning (in Episode four!). Keep in mind, though, that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has always been the central hero of the series. Pretty fascinating!Always take notice of the 1997 Special Edition. This is a mandatory must for STAR WARS newcomers who still haven't taken advantage of the Force in all these years. The myth is that there aren't a whole lot of changes. The truth is that they're saying quite a lot because the editing of these enhancements is phenomenal, and hasn't been done before. It's a remarkable achievement in modern film technology, and the scene with Jabba The Hut explains why. Remember that some of original pieces of footage remain the same with a certainty of noticeable glitches, which is still a minor offense. Add to this some incredible restoration and we still have a sci-fi gem that will stick around longer while the new trilogy slowly builds on. Think of this, you're watching an entirely new movie!I hope this original movie and the whole trilogy in itself doesn't fall victim to a terrible amount of backlash when EPISODE ONE arrives. That one will do excellent business based on our cravings for special effects; they actually sell the movies! Should it happen, this would be a fatal blow to preserving a quality image to American cinema, past or present. We must take for granted that movies are essential as entertainment, and how the many possibilities can be discovered. Judging a movie's popularity against the odds is only going to hurt it. It is currently being demonstrated with E.T. (1982) and TITANIC (1997), two highly acclaimed films that are receiving tons of negative criticism and scrutiny from the public. They do this by pushing popularity off the wall. At least we know how to handle STAR WARS movies carefully, and while we enjoy science fiction as a make-believe cushion, it's important to know that it took a genius like George Lucas to create a universe where excitement exceeds the imaginable. Without him, the movie industry would be in deep space beyond the far reaches of our galaxy. The greatest movie ever made? Only on a cult level; it is the best one for the crowd, but consider this a fine American piece of movie art for all.The Force will be with us.....always.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Greatest movie ever!!!,"Star Wars is probably the best movie ever made. Even tough i've seen it more than 30 times, I never get tired of watching it over and over again. Sometimes when I'm feeling down, watching Star Wars is the only thing that can really cheer me up. One of my favorite things about this movie is the music!! John Williams has done a wonderful job on this movie as well as the other ones, in fact he won an Oscar for it. I don't know how George Lucas came out with something so perfect, but I'm glad he did. The acting was great, I think Harrison Ford is one of the greatest actors of all time. In this particular film of the Star Wars trilogy I think that my favorite character is Han Solo, the cool tough guy whose best friend is a walking carpet. Alec Guiness plays wonderfully his part as Obi-Wan Kenobi, the old Jedi master who trains Luke on Tatooine. In conclusion, I would like to say that this movie has changed the world and has opened my eyes to an incredible new universe. A galaxy far far away.....",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Cinema Personified: Incredible Movie,"Rating: 9.5
Overall, an important movie to watch in what created one of the most iconic franchises in the world and helped jump-start a story that is beloved by many through its technical achieves and story-writing, even though the direction is a bit lacking.Very Good Direction (The actual moving of the story and making sure all pieces come together is incredibly managed and executed, it is just the actual direction of characters was pretty poorly done (which kinda reveals the truth that George Lucas is a visionary in storytelling, but not that Great in actually directing people)), Very Good Acting (Good to Very Good from the Live-Action Cast; Very Good to Great from the Vocal/Costumed-Characters) (Very Good from Mark Hamill (Really excelled at playing the naive kid who is interested in helping very well, shows a bit of inexperience but that is to be accepted when he is playing a very young character that is the hero), Very Good to Great from Harrison Ford (The real star of the show in all his scenes as his smooth/cool nature really helps show how great of a character Han Solo really is (though there are moments that are kinda iffy with the awkwardness and silence from line deliveries)), Pretty Good from Carrie Fisher (Her performance does not compete with the others but she does play the damsel in distress character trope very well (though it is a bit annoying when she is changing between accents as it sounds like she is putting on a fake English accent at times)), Pretty Good to Good from Peter Cushing (Not really that much in the movie despite his high billing), Great from Alec Guinness (Really shows his experience as an actor in this performance as he has much range in showing both care for Luke yet trauma from his past that still effects him), Very Good from Anthony Daniels (Really brings C-3PO to life as he tries to help but panics in not knowing how much he can (the anxious nerd-savior trope); also, plays a great role in helping vocalize the relationship and friendship he has with R2-D2), Incredible from Kenny Baker (Really brings R2 to life through the difference mannerisms the character has in sort of a comedic relief yet important way (making R2 one of the best characters in all of Star Wars); also, helps bring the flare that makes the character's friendship with C-3PO one of the best in pop-culture), Very Good from Peter Mayhew (Played the adorable, yet extremely dangerous Chewie and played off his co-star very nicely, similar to the R2/C-3PO relationship), Incredible from James Earl Jones/David Prowse (Created one of the most iconic voices in pop-culture as his menacing voice and performance showed why Darth Vader is a villain to be scared of), Very Good from the rest of the Live-Action cast; Very Good from the rest of the Vocal/Costumed-Characters cast), Brilliant Story (Created a world that is one of the most iconic today; the character writing is incredible as they are some of the most iconic characters in pop culture; the way the story ties all the different movies together (both prequel and later films) is very well done and visionary), Very Good Screenplay (The actual dialogue was not that well written as it felt very unnatural (as was seen from the characters trying to say the words), but where the screenplay shines is the foreshadowing to future Star Wars events, symbolism, iconic lines, and character writing to introduce the Star Wars universe as a cinematic achievement), Brilliant Score (One of the most iconic scores in cinema history and is very well used throughout the movie), Great Cinematography, Incredible Sound (Especially when giving the movie a space/science-fiction feel as well as bringing the sounds of the droids (especially R2-D2) to life), Very Good to Great Editing, Cannot rate Visual Effects (The original Visual Effects were incredible for how revolutionary they were at the time of the release, but the added CGI from the re-release makes it very hard to watch as it just feels so forced and out of place with the original effects), Incredible Production Design (Created some very iconic sets that are well remembered in history), Incredible Makeup (Helped bring to life aliens that are not from this world), Incredible Costumes (Created some of the most iconic outfits in pop-culture history, with the Darth Vader costume being one of the most well remembered in any historical context), Plot Structure was very well written as each piece builds on the previous one as everything matters in building up the movie and moving the story forward (so nothing to really add or remove), Pacing can be a bit slower at times but does maintain a very steady pace throughout the movie (pace very typical of movies from that time-period), Build to climax was very well done as the movie treats the actual build as the climax (so we are building to this build very nicely throughout the movie); Climax was kinda thrown at us as in the grand scheme of things we did not build to this (we built up to the build as previously stated) but it was very well executed and really shows off the technical marvels that the original film was very groundbreaking for; moreover helps provide some insight into Luke's quest in finding the force and taking his first step in becoming a Jedi, Tone was that typical to a space opera or science fiction epic but does have some unique feel to it that makes it very Star Wars, A ground-breaking movie not only in Cinema-history but actual history as well as it ushered in a new way to view and create stories and was an inspiration for the rise in the Science-Fiction genre in the 80s and 90s.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Geeky Randy's summary,"George Lucas' groundbreaking saga starts here, a epic space opera about rebels trying to save Princess Leia (Fisher) from the tyrannical Darth Vader (Jones/Prowse). Fun story with many of film history's most beloved characters; not to mention the impressiveness of its success and inspiration. However, the story-arc seems so light-weight knowing what follows in sequels ""Empire"" and ""Jedi"", and the absence of Yoda, Palpatine, Admiral Piette and Lando Calrissian certainly make you realize how dull this film is in comparison to the following two when you re-watch it. The most interesting conflicts of the series happens in the sequels, making ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope"" the least intense and impressive of the original trilogy.**½ (out of four)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I love this film. A New Hope for Cinema...,"Full disclosure - I LOVE this movie!How many times have I seen this film? I really don't know? 30?There are so many reasons why I love all 3 of the original Star Wars films. I'm not even going to try to start here, but I do want to say a few things...I'm not sure if I can describe to today's readers just how dead cinema was by the time 1977 came along? Just DEAD. Boring films that nobody went to watch. Sure - a couple of interesting ones, but generally nothing worth queuing up for. Cinemas closing down permanently.Throughout 1976/7 there is increasing talk of a ""new"" kind of film being made in studios in the UK: Star Wars. It hits US cinemas in May to an absolute crescendo of approving critical acclaim.The hype grows as the rest of the world has to wait its turn to see this new movie phenomenon...Fast forward to an afternoon matinee in early January 1978, and I'm sitting in The Dominion, Tottenham Court Road, London waiting for the film. This cinema is vast - one of the largest in the UK, and yet there are only about 20 people here. Star Wars is only showing in two places in the UK - and I'm in one of them!The lights dim.... ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away..."" STAR WARS... That magical music comes in with its trumpets and fanfare... AND THEN I have to look around as I think a Jumbo jet is crashing into the back of the cinema! It's Leia's little space craft pursued by this ENORMOUS Battle Cruiser shooting and blamming! OH MY GOD! THIS IS BRILLIANT!!!....And that was just the first minute of the movie!Surround sound - a super clear picture and a cinema experience unlike anything I could ever have imagined. The impact of this thing is just awesome! This is STAR WARS and it's absolutely breathtaking! Fantastic!I think it may well be the case that today's new viewers of Star Wars: A New Hope, do not see it or experience it the way I did that day back in 1978. Today's viewers may not appreciate that it was precisely THIS film that set movies back on their feet again - made cinema going brilliant again.After that it's all pretty straightforward. Star Wars: A New Hope has a fairly simple story, and was acted by (in those days) fairly unknown players. The formula worked then and still works today.What isn't perhaps recognised fully today is that Star Wars set new standards in movie making. It set new expectations about what could be achieved. Set new standards in entertainment. It remains a masterpiece.In 1977 cinema was dying. Star Wars was its New Hope.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Two Hour Techo-Shock,"So many millions of reviews have been written of this movie that its hard to imagine what else there us to say about it. Iconic? Sure. The special effects, certainly. Cannabilised from westerns, Japanese folk lore, 30's adventure serials, yep, heard it - seen it. We could talk about incest, the minimalist direction, the slumming Alec Guinness, Lucas's tone deaf ear for dialogue or the double entendres that cause the entire screenplay to list toward the Carry Ons but instead lets talk about what this thing is REALLY all about.Star Wars is a film about domestic violence and sexual abuse. Don't believe me? Well it just goes to show that no matter how many times you've seen it, you haven't paid attention once. Lucas may have had the intellectual chutzpah to take the subject head on but his ability to hide the subtext amongst the dogfights and the cod-mysticism, is meticulous - daring even, and has escaped serious documentation. Tim Roth would do it better with his 1999 film 'The War Zone' but his debt to Lucas, for his tale of a sexually abusive father can not be be overstated. This is a film about childhood dreams, the destruction of the family, the sexual confusion born of repressed abuse and the gradual shift to confronting that sordid past. Lucas sets out his stall immediately with the infamous 'a long time ago in a galaxy far far away' card, deliberately evocative of childhood fairy tales and fantasy. What follows acts as an ironic counterpoint to this innocent introduction with the arrival of the Star Destroyer, a searing phallus forcefully pushing its way across the frame; its size and intimidatory potential calculated to mirror the perception of the Father's reproductive strongbox from the child's perspective. Symbolically we've barely grasped the significance of this opening scene and its horrifying implications until we realise that the pursuing vessel contains Vader: The violent parent with the abusive past, chasing his now teenage daughter under the pretext of searching for architectural blueprints- a hollow ruse. Vader, we come to realise from his monstrous appearance- an evil black visage, is a deranged psychopath, barely human and in denial of his parental status (he doesn't mention it once) and its this, Lucas suggests, that allows him to later administer an interstellar confection of drugs to Leia to gain her absolute 'co-operation', when she is held prisoner on the Death Star and is subjected to her Father's intergalactic insertions. We don't see it of course; Lucas's camera joins the complicit guards in the corridor outside, but the look of recognition, horror and resignation on her face, speaks to a forgotten childhood of sustained attacks. It's no coincidence that the man's speciality is constricting the flow of air to his victims. Prior to his mechanisation, its all too easy to see a gloved hand covering a small mouth; a size and weight advantage exploited for sadistic ends - a mother cowering and crying in an adjacent room. The dark side indeed. So why has Luke and Leia been forced to disavow their blood-ties and take refuge on the other worlds and in Leia's case, under an assumed identity? Split up as children and hidden from their father by Guinness' guilt ridden Jedi Knight (of whom more later) to protect them from his predatory impulses, they have begun the movie apparently unaware of their childhood horror. It is repressed as the Freudian paradigm would suggest, in the sibling's unconscious. However, several scenes hint at what we can only imagine...Luke's Aunt and Uncle who have raised him since his impromptu separation from his parents, react with horror when Luke looks like emulating his father. Little wonder. Anakin's shift to the 'dark side'(note the constitution of his mother as a sexual object in Episode II's under the covers scene), a euphemism for his descent into infanto-perversion, lead to the absence of Luke and Leia's mother from which we can read consistent beatings with bricks wrapped in stocking, the branding of flesh with a cow-iron and ultimately murder, from which an eruption of sodomy gushed forth like a Mustafian geyser. Skywalker the elder was an animal,Lucas intones via notably disgusted composition, who did unimaginable damage as his old friend Obi-Wan looked on, slow to act and gripped by a failing of moral courage. Obi-Wan DID act of course but too late to halt the traumatic tide. His scenes in his Tatooine dwelling set up an interesting ambiguity in which we're invited to speculate as to whether or not he participated in, or was tempted to do the same before his moral compass finally pointed north. The more we know about Vader, the more it makes a frightening amount of sense. His own mother murdered by sand people, he allowed himself to be wooed by a princess with a predilection for men she met as children and then allowed himself to be groomed by a leering father figure who we know to be interested in the exploitation and subordination of youngsters for unspecified 'evil' purposes. In conclusion Star Wars is at turns both touching (the brother's noble rescue of the sister from their father's clutches) and horrifying (witness the scene in which Daddy literally and metaphorically destroys Leia's world - one of many allegorical episodes in which the psychological crimes of the past are represented in the present). Its a brave, misunderstood film that doesn't flinch from the exploration of its sinister subject matter and we can only hope that subsequent DVD editions will tackle the film's issues head on..",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Why Star Wars is one of the most memorable motion pictures of all time.,"Of the critics who didn't like Star Wars, the primary reason was that Star Wars was a movie with great special effects with no substance.  Star Wars is more than just the special effects.  If this were so, this movie would fare a little better than Stanley Kubrick's ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" which appeared in 1969.  ""2001"" had great special effects, an excellent musical score, but the movie had long periods of boredom with some exciting scenes thrown in.The reason for the popularity of Star Wars is a unique mixture of new special effects techniques, fantastic musical score (John Williams) and character interaction.  The humor and sarcasm between Luke(Hammil), Leia (Fisher), Han (Ford), combined with the special effects make this one of the most memmorable motion pictures of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Happy Birthday Peter Mayhew (Chewy),"Has it been 30 years since we first enjoyed one of the most spectacular films of the 20th Century. This film is older than many of the people I know.Volumes have been written on the creativity and innovation that was brought forth by George Lucas. This film had it all: sets, costuming, visual effects, music, writing and directing. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences were light years behind the rest of America when they ignored this film for some Woody Allen comedy. They really showed their bias there! It is hard to believe Harrison Ford had been around for 10 years before this film. He seemed so young and fresh, and we know he goes on to some great work after wards.

Still awesome to watch,"The ground breaking visuals never seen on cinema was a shock to many of us who's seen this movie for the first time. After over 30 years, it's still the best movie of its type.I didn't notice this when I first saw this movie but Ben Kenoby does mention about the ""Clone Wars"" in this episode. If this was a far reaching foresight on George Lucas' part, my hats off to him. This movie has more visceral impact compared to the CG filled episodes 1-3. It just shows that you can't beat the real thing. More I saw it, more I was in awe of all the fine details that was put into this movie. Each of the scenes were directed precisely without a flaw. George Lucas was an awesome director when he made this film. Ben Kenoby also mentions about Darth Vader who killed Luke's father - as we find out in the next episode, this was only a metaphor. The movie is both simple and complex at the same time.There's no word to describe this movie. Made on a relatively modest budget, it's still the finest movie of its kind.

What's left to say?,"Honestly... what on earth could I say about Star Wars that has not already been said?

I love these movies,"This one especially. It all started right here, and despite the cheesy lines and some of the bad effects (even though most of them are pretty incredible, especially for that time), I can't help but love it.Maybe it's the actors. Because let's face it, these actors were born to play these parts. Mark Hamill never really had another hit, and really, honestly, he's not a very good actor. But he was perfect for this role- some may say he's too whiny, but isn't that really what Luke was at the beginning? The same goes for Carrie Fisher- she never had another big, important movie like these, but I can't imagine the movie without her. Maybe other people can, and that's okay for them, but for me, I can't see anyone else as Leia.And what would this movie be without Harrison Ford? I have a theory that the reason the newest three Star Wars don't match up at all to the old ones is because the characters aren't interesting at all. Anakin is vaguely interesting, but we already know his story and Hayden Christensen doesn't do anything with the part to keep us intrigued. Amidala is boring, and while I think Ewan McGregor is a great actor, there was nothing he could do to instill anything worth watching into the character they wrote for Obi-Wan.And that's why these movies need Harrison Ford. Han Solo is without a doubt the most interesting character. In the new ones, there's no one with snappy retorts and sharp comments to keep the pace of the movie up. In the new ones, there's no one to give us the surprise ending we knew was coming but we didn't know how they were going to pull it off. I don't know about anyone else, but when I first saw this, I thought Han had actually left for good. It didn't even occur to me that he would come back to save the day in the end. And I'm not stupid. At least that's what they tell me. And without Harrison Ford, Han Solo would not be near as interesting as he is.Alec Guinness deserves plenty of credit too. His part is without a doubt the most boring in the movie, yet he makes it worth watching. His lines are usually descriptions, clichés, or they provide backstory. The actors in CSI will tell you that lines like that are hard to make entertaining. Yet Guinness is able to do so with years of training. It's no wonder he was nominated for an Oscar for it.Oh, and there's the awesome action sequences with the light saber duels that, even though they tend to repeat themselves over and over, are incredibly dazzling. There's the epic feel and the neverending story of it all. There's the beautiful scenery and realistic set pieces. There's James Earl Jones's and Anthony Daniels's respectively foreboding and entertaining voiceovers, with Vader's wonderfully addicting breathing. There's the sweeping cinematography and that even makes the intimate scenes seem big while still retaining the urgency and the, well, intimacy of it all.It's a good movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
2nd best of the trilogy,"first seeing the movie, I thought it was just Blast this and blast that. It wasn't bad. after seeing the other two(ESB, RTOJ) I ranked this at second because there was no interesting twists like in Empire Strikes back(you know what I'm talking About), and Return Of the Jedi, which ranks three in the trilogy for me. in this one, Luke developed the school boy crush on Princess Leia, and I thought that was funny. it was long before that scene on the Bridge in return of the Jedi(BLLeeeechh!!)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I don't understand,"This movie has, possibly, the worst script I've ever come across in a film.So, we meet Luke. He lives with his aunt and uncle in some sort of extraterrestrial farming. The get killed, we never hear from them again. A passing shot is it. Luke never even recalls them once.He meets a strange man, this man he has been told is crazy and possibly senile. The man tells him about a mystical ""force"" that lives in everything and without any demonstration of it, or the man's sanity, Luke declares he wants to leave everything behind and follow this man and learn about the force. What?! We meet Darth, a man portrayed to be villainous by the mere fact we're told he's supposed to be and that he dresses in all black and wears a cape. The story never builds on him at all, and I was left wondering why I should I even care about him.The characters are all shockingly two dimensional, with little to no back story and nothing else ever added to them.The only thing that salvaged my viewing of this was the relationship between C3PO and R2D2.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
George Lucas' world and its beginning,"I can't say anything about George Lucas coming directly from my opinion. I have never (maybe) seen any of his work; It's not interesting for me. I don't hate science fiction and futuristic films (because that's why he's known), it's just that those are not my types of movies. Anyway, I know some people that say he's great. He made ""Star Wars"" thinking he would make a trilogy, this was number 4, then he did 5 and 6; he probably thought it was over, but some years later he showed us the beginning of something we had already known the ending with ""Episode I"" and ""Episode II"". What happens before this film, departures from a movie that has not been released yet: that's ""Episode III"".There's a time (now) where the special effects are ""show ups"". I like to think there was a time when they were used to serve the story; for sake of entertainment. Now, plots are merely complex, but effects are totally outstanding. ""Hero"" was lauded by critics, but it was just the visuals for me; beautiful visuals, of course. Then the plotThat's why I'm thinking of passing by ""House of Flying Daggers"": same actors, same directorNo, thanks.Well, special effects weren't remarkable in ""Star Wars"", but they were definitely the best they had at that time. I didn't care about them, anyway, because Lucas has fun creating his own world of adventure, fantasy and whatever you want so say; but it was fun! What can you expect of some big letters flying in space that say: ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away""? The thing is Lucas' whole team worked their asses to develop this fantasy full of pleasure, and gave us the costumes, the sceneries, the charactersUnique stuff!I wasn't alive at the time the movie was the phenomenon it was, and still is; but it's a thoroughly enjoyable ride that everyone should take the chance to experience.Getting out of TV, and very young, Mark Hamill looks natural as Luke. He seems very promising in his role; the role that assured his career's ""take-off"". Alec Guiness passed away some years ago, with the Oscar in his merits, and the recognition for his performances; including his classy and for always remembered Obi-Wan Kenobi. In this film specifically, Carrie Fisher wasn't much used and not as pretty as her character should be. However, intelligent enough to provide the qualities that launch a career.One paragraph should be dedicated to Mr. Harrison Ford. I heard he wouldn't have a career if it wasn't for George Lucas. The whole story I won't say, but I'm glad Lucas discovered some of the genius in Ford. Lucas gave Ford the character of Han Solo that would bring Indiana Jones after the trilogy. After Indiana Jones, Ford's career would be irregular, with some little peaks. But here, hereFord is magical. Incredibly natural and very good""Star Wars"" is one of those movies that make you be supportive with the characters. We want their good, we want to join them in their journey and watch them survive; even when we already know what's going to happen. Excellent performances by Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca and Kenny Baker as R2-D2: considering they hadn't got much to do but they were important They were funny and an excellently teamed up for their rolesThe ending announces a sequel; filled up with happy images, simple shots and that wonderful music by the amazing John Williams; who hasn't been more than five years without being nominated for the Academy Awards (he won it for this one).All of this, of course, all of this wouldn't exist without George Lucas' mind (he'll be remembered for this!). How he did it is a long story hidden behind one of the most fascinating cinematographic experiences of all time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Best Ever...,"SW is a terrific classic. It has everything. Action,  Suspense, humor, spectacular special effects(even for today), romance, and almost anything else you could want.

SW is also very special because its sequels are even better. The prequels aren't as good, but they're awesome too. SW is definitely my favorite movie. I think almost everything is perfect.

Truly a movie for the Stars,"I first saw this one back in '96 or '95 I think, with absolutely no expectation (my brother convinced me, and since I had seen a few Star Trek movies (in which I thought sucked) I thought all movies starting with STAR sucked...) and from I saw the great holy words ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away..."" I was surprised by the great quality, story etc. The special effects rule (most are actually stop-motion done with a gigantic number of frames, but if you watch closely on Hoth in V you can see an AT-AT missing some frames) and the music by the legend John Williams is beyond anything.

Wow. Just wow.,"I have a book entitled ""Alternate Worlds: The Illustrated History of Science Fiction"" by James Gunn published in 1975. It describes the culture of science fiction B.S.W. -- Before Star Wars-- and what a world it was!It was one of God's blessings on his nerdy children that science fiction existed then, and each and every geek and dweeb who endured the hazing from assorted dimwits could crawl into Asimov or Heinlein and find a sanctuary, floating on a dream of distant places and times in a far-off future where people weren't cruel. petty, greedy and vile.In the science fiction world, big ideas were okay. It was perfectly fine to be smarter than most people. It was okay to be different. Science fiction was the one place where an outcast could find some peace and understanding. And it was fun. Hell yes it was FUN. Nothing, absolutely nothing on this particular planet could come close the amazing high energy jolt of pure exhilaration that came out of something like ""Citizen of the Galaxy"" or ""A Canticle for Leibowitz"" or ""1984."" By God, something great lived there.Then some skinny guy named George Lucas, who had an uncanny way of reading pop culture and exploiting it, opened the taps of the imagination and gave all the straights, the stupids, the averages and the ordinaries a glimpse into that wild and strange and amazing place.I never thought I'd see it happen in my lifetime. I can still hardly believe it.And...wow. The ""masses"" just LOVED this stuff just as much as the geeks. Sure, ""true"" science fiction was ""deeper"" and more ""technical""--but the real heart of what the geeky minority found so appealing was the very heart of the human race itself-- the ancient mythos of Western Civilization.Who knew that SO MANY people all over the world would dig it so much?But seriously, folks-- lighting doesn't strike twice. Lucas and Fox made a lot of money but they found that once they'd tasted the honeypot they could not put down the crack pipe (sorry). They had to keep on squeezing that chicken until the last sweet, sweet drops of life had been removed from the dead corpse of lost ideas, and now, so many years later, we find the unholy mess that is the ""Star Wars Franchise"" having died and been reanimated by Disney-- an undead thing prancing about as the rest of it try to figure out how to kill it once and for all.But there was a time.......there was as time, boys. When young Skywalker wanted to be a Jedi Knight like his father. When an evil demon in a black killed for fun, and a crusade of children could save the galaxy. A simpler time",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great science _fiction_ fairy tale (7/10),"Though in my opinion, Star Wars is hyped & overrated, I still like it. It is entertaining, funny, visually well done, has a great score and simply everything you expect of a entertaining science _fiction_ movie. There are a heap of comments on it and I think most people visiting this site already watched this movie, so I will not write much more about it. On the one hand, I affect to rate Star Wars too low (because it is hyped), on the other hand I tend to rate it too high (because of nostalgic emotions and a certain preference of science fiction movies) - overall, maybe a rating of 7/10 would be appropriate (inside sci-fi genre: 9/10).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The hulls look as if they were made out of brick not metal. Of course there are no explosions in outer space but why let basic facts interfere with a (bad) story. .

Star Wars EpisodeIV-A New Hope Review,"Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker Harrison Ford as Han Solo Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia Organa Alec Guinness as Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi Anthony Daniels as C-3PO Kenny Baker as R2-D2 Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca David Prowse as Darth Vader James Earl Jones as Darth Vader (voice) Phil Brown as Uncle Owen Shelagh Fraser as Aunt PeruThe Star Wars (1977) film by Director George Lucas is a galactic drama which was an orchestrated musical that started with episode IV. The studio insisted that the episode numeral not be added until later after the film's success. The main plot begins with droid robots named R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) that help a young man named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and a cynical space pilot named Hans Solo (Harrison Ford I) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) a hairy bigfoot creature rescue a rebel princess, Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) that has been taken hostage by Darth Lord Vader (Dave Prowse and the voice of James Earl Jones' voice). The evil Emperor is determined to dissolve the Imperial Senate and crush the Republic Alliance. The Empire will then rule with fear of planet destruction by the Death Star Battle Station that will lead to intergalactic domination.The theme is evil (dark side of The Force) versus good (The Force), with which human nature dictates the decision to do good or evil deeds. Luke is a young man that works on a farm and feels obligated to stay on the farm for another season to help his Uncle Owen (Phil Brown) and Aunt Peru (Shelagh Fraser). Luke is torn by this decision and is told by an old Jedi Knight, Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) that his father was betrayed and murdered by a pupil of Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness). The Empire attacks the farm and kills his aunt and uncle, so Luke decides to avenge his family's death and learn The Force and train as a Jedi warrior like his father for the rebellion against the evil Empire. Eventually, Luke becomes familiar with the good side of The Force and saves the princess. He then uses his piloting skills to shoot a virtually impossible vent shaft, destroying the Death Star and becomes the hero for the rebel forces.The thematic ideas and visual designs used were camera techniques and angles, including panning and tilting in a montage that creates hyperspace to get from one place to another at a super speed, similar to Star Trek. The high tech look has camera views that use the idea of World War II bombers to give the viewer a cinematic feel for the atmosphere, which conveys spaceship views unveiling the motion control camera. Stop motion is used along with puppets for the introduction of a creature named Jabba the Hutt.The film's sounds effects are groundbreaking for the time with the environmental tone of each spaceship having its own high or low-pitch tone that creates a specific sound for the dramatic feel of being in the each aircraft cockpit for the scene. The cockpit voices of the pilots are recorded over an actual shortwave radio, which gives the illusion that the transmissions were natural broken radio talk.Costume design was complicated and difficult to pull off due to the budget that was originally assigned. The C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) robot costumes were so loud that they had had to use voice-over to cover up the sound during editing.The thematic ideas were depicted as a futuristic montage of images and sounds for the technological aspects of space battles. Lucas also studied motifs of Greek mythological creatures to design the aliens, sets and robotic character shots of many of the fictional characters. These ideas compare to Raiders of the Lost Ark in theme by saving the girl and saving the day for the natives, which is also a cliffhanger action film that he created.Therefore, these styles of thematic elements were carried into many other space action creations that Lucas has directed in future films, including the Star Wars Trilogy.ReferencesStar Wars, Episode IV, A New Hope., Director and Writer George Lucas, DVD, Twentieth Century Fox and LucasFilm Ltd., 1977 and 1997 versions.IMDb., Trivia – Star Wars (1977) retrieved Dec. 11, 2011 from http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

It might be cliché to say but Star Wars is surely something special.,"You can write off the Star Wars series really easily. It's talked about nonstop through every decade. Your audience who are Star Wars ""fan boys"" are likely the most boisterous fans of any film series. Unlike many others, it's a series to whole variety of people and that's why it's made so much money through the years. It will always be one of the few series known to create trilogies so many years after the last trilogy in the series. Director, George Lucas has remastered the original films so much it has got to the point of being very tiresome. All of these things are a bit much but still I can't deny what great art Star Wars: A New Hope is. Of course, this is the Star Wars movie that started it all.In the simplest way I can describe it, the plot of A New Hope consists of enemy and empire leader Darth Vader taking Princess Lea (Carrie Fisher) hostage. A hotshot named Han Solo (Harrison Ford), two droids named R2-D2 (who has major plans of the empire) and CP-3P0 and basically a young kid named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) are the main keys to saving the galaxy.At the first glance, the plot seems a lot to comprehend even if it is so original. It comes down to good characters that helps the plot work. Han Solo is exactly Harrison Ford's personality; so cocky and such a scrooge so it's hard not to like him. Luke Skywalker is really the ultimate underdog character and it's just make you wish Hamill had a career outside of this series because he brings so much to this character. Princess Lea is what a princess should be; she's sexy and much more likable then the other princess characters around. Darth Vader right from the start gives off of a vibe of an ionic villain and he's the character you want to see more of even if he is the villain. Really, even the droids have some character development where as CP-3P0 is nerdy and a clumsy fellow and R2-D2 is always willing to be in the big moments.This classic gets even better once you realize how well it's made. For a film made in 1977, it seems so new and effects that are acceptable even now. There is action that never lets up and the third act action really is something. From the desert area where Luke grew up to the many spaceship scenes, the settings are really chosen well which is really something for film from the 70's. Even more, it has a 70's-type charm that is not dated still. Basically in a nutshell, I am saying that this first installment of the Star Wars series is timeless.Very few films come close to what this film is. This is the type of cinema that comes around in once a lifetime for a person. Even though I am a bigger fan of the Star Trek series (please don't shoot me fan boys!), I can still can get into Star Wars quite a bit. It might be cliché to say but Star Wars is surely something special.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Groundbreaking doesnt do it justice,"The Film that started it all. Literally. Sequels, trilogies, merchandise, you name it. Star Wars (I refuse to call it A New Hope') has shaped the Hollywood we know today.Star Wars isn't a brilliant film. The plot isn't even particularly original. But what it is (or more specifically was) is a totally groundbreaking exercise in production techniques and values. Nothing like it had ever been seen before and as such, captured the imagination like nothing ever had or ever will again.Even by today's standards, the sets are lavish, the costumes are cool and the characters are just fantastic. You can see why literally everything that appears on screen for even a second has its own action figure. Chewie, the Stormtroopers, Greedo and all the others bristle with imagination and convincingly portray a galaxy far, far away' for the first time ever. Personally speaking, I don't think it has ever been surpassed in science fiction and probably never will. And that is why the franchise has been successful. It created a whole mythos, with the Jedi, successfully blending hi-tech with old style religions and prophecies.I don't think there will ever be a phenomenon like this again. And, although The Empire Strikes Back is technically a superior film, this remains, in my opinion, one of the biggest milestones in cinematic history. I mean, look at it! It was made in 1977! I know its been tinkered with but most films dont even look that good today.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A Retrospect Review,"I originally saw the film at the theater in 1977 when I was 21 years old. I thought it was a great movie, but not the best movie I ever saw. I've seen it two more times since - once on video back in the early 1990s and yesterday on HD TV 43"" screen. I can honestly state that my feeling towards this film hasn't changed over the years.I was never a Princess Leia fan. Her changing accent throughout annoyed the heck out of me the first time and I was surprised it still does today. Carrie Fisher (may she rest in peace) was not all that great of an actress IMHO. She just couldn't pull off the whole sexy-rebel-princess. Come on...she watches her home world blow up and just stands there?The dialogue was sophomoric but maybe that was intentional and based on the demographics group it was targeting, i.e. teenage boys.Fortunately for Harrison Ford, his acting improved greatly after Star Wars: A New Hope. I think his looks carried him through most of the film. Pretty much the same goes for Mark Hamill.All in all, it was a good movie which I enjoyed, but I've never understood the massive hype and fanaticism.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Revised versions were disappointing,I saw this movie in the cinema when it was first released and from the very beginning it was impressive. The opening set the tone - a spaceship is seen running away from a pursuer and then the ship following it appears and just keeps on getting bigger until it fills the whole screen and you finally see the engines at the back. The scale was far beyond anything else I had seen.The cantina scene was also memorable with the alien band not being overdone and the character of Han Solo being established as rather doubtful as one to associate with.The revised versions added filler in various places that did not add to the story at all. In many ways they undermined the sense of bleakness and despair that should have been seen as what you would expect in a remote outpost of a ruthless empire.I wish I could get hold of a copy of the original version to revisit my first experience but that does not seem possible.,5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Camp droids, a walking carpet and Han shot first","Along time and go in a galaxy far away, two droids go on an adventure amidst a rebellion against the evil galactic empire.As an 80s child, my Dad taped Star Wars and I remember it being the first film to hold my attention for the duration of the running time. When you watch it now compared to other films made around about the same time or before, you can see how Lucas created a spectacle like nothing seen since colour and sound were introduced.The story is not original but the way it's told from the perspective of R2D2 and C3PO fills me with wonderment every time. We see them move from one exotic, sci-fi fantasy location to another in an adventure not unlike like the Wizard of Oz, The Searchers or Lawrence of Arabia, but you go on this one like you've been shot out of a cannon on to the fastest rollercoaster.Performances are solid, with Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford being heroic and bantering well with Carrie Fisher. James Earl Jones' voice helped create a cinematic icon in Darth Vader, along with Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker as Peter Mayhew having a similar effect. The best performances for me come from Sir Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing who bring an air of classical British performance to an otherwise distinctly American slice of pop-culture.Special effects may seem standard compared to films made in the 21st century, but this was utterly mind blowing spectacle in its day and for quite some time afterwards. In my onion it easily holds it's own by today's standard and there is nothing in it aside from a few 70s haircuts that feels aged.These days I realise I am looking at this slightly rose-tinted when I hear some of the Lucas dialogue being delivered, but for something as fantastical and unbelievable as it should be, it takes you out of reality for two thrilling hours.As a child I longed to do heroic things and seeing the characters of Luke Skywalker and Han Solo doing them thrilled me. So much so my first childhood crush (like many in generation X) was Princess Leia and I didn't understand at the time why I kept having dreams about swinging from a rope with her holding on to me. I was involved in many a schoolyard fight over which one of us would be Han Solo.

I sense something... a presence I've not felt since....,"""Star Wars"" was the first movie I ever sat down and watched (I believe I was two at the time). Over time, of course, the initial ""Oh wow!"" factor wears off and it becomes just another sci-fi movie. But it really shouldn't-- this is *the* sci-fi movie. That is not to say it is the best of the entire genre-- I really don't think it is, but this was where everything changed for the last time (other major genre changes occurred in 1968's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Planet of the Apes""). The photography and editing combine very well, making it flow better than almost any film the '70s ever produced. Harrison Ford (Han Solo) and Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia) have a great, well-realized, almost love/hate relationship. But the real star of the movie is Darth Vader-- that gigantic black-suited, raspy, evil mastermind who brings new meaning to the word ""power"". This is not only because of James Earl Jones' fantastic voice-over, but also because of David Prowse's physical presence on the celluloid. The movie's vulnerable point comes in the sweeping, epic style, which very nearly overdoes itself on numerous occasions. However, ""Star Wars"" is a classic, even though it cannot really be considered the best of anything. And a word to the wise-- watch the 1977 original. Those special effects shattered doors and set new standards, while the 1997 re-release's cheap digital work only serves to make a good movie look fake and inconsistent.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

This movie showed people a whole new potential that movies could actually have, by leading sci-fi into a direction never before seen. Movies after 1977 have never been the same, the vision of George Lucas was the start of it all This is with the result that pretty much every scene is iconic at this point. Movies are a subjective thing, and if star wars isn't your thing, then fair enough, but give this a watch before saying no to star wars. You can easily watch this without being a hardcore star wars fan, and still enjoy this movie alot! This movie is my favorite of all the sw movies (even though Empire in many ways is objectively better), and it pretty much defines my childhood. This movie is beautifull. If you're a parent, then do your child (not to mention yourself) a favor, and watch this movie with them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This has got to be THE best movie ever made!,"I have seen this movie umpteen times, and everytime I see it is as thrilling as the last! The quest of a meek rebellion against an all powerful empire can be seen as a historic reference to many political occurrences in the world. Most people associate it as the second world war, with the rebellion being the Allies. However, I have always seen it as the Empire being the British Empire and the Rebellion as the American revolution -- for independance. Darth Vader's Mask has been based on the Samurai Warriors helmets, not on the Nazi helmets.Still, I cannot praise the movie enough... It made movie history!The force will be with you... always",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Classical,"In simplest forms, Star Wars, like many other space operas, is basically cowboys in space. With also a touch of medievalist within it and with a simple distinction between good and evil, making it fun for people for all ages.This movie also succeeds in true escapism, with no references to Earth, with a culture unknown to us, truly taking us to a galaxy far, far away. And that concept may also have been played as to the success of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.The comedy duo between C-3P0 and R2-D2 will always be memorable. Though we can't understand what R2-D2 is saying, it's the reactions of C-3P0 that brings it to life.Though still 3 years away from reaching Star Trek's racial and sexual equality, the damsel in distress concept is not as painfully stereotypical as in others with that concept. Even breaking the stereotyping.This movie is inspirational in terms of visual effects and sci-fi art. Bringing forth creativity. And it was great idea to use dog fight footage from the 2 world wars as references for the incredible star fighter scenes.Though many of the plots for Star Wars comes from other stories and movies, they are seamlessly integrated into this movie.And if Star Wars could have maintained this level of quality all throughout the franchise, it would have been in an extremely close second to Star Trek as best sci-fi genre of all time, and ranking the movie 9.5 out of 10.Unfortunately with the disappointing prequels, the not-quite-up-to-snuff ""Return of the Jedi"", and the special editions that in many ways hurts the original trilogy rather than helping it, the Star Wars franchise is now struggling to maintain second place for best sci-fi genre and reduce the original Star Wars to 8.5 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I love Star Wars,Back when i was 8 years old...1993 my mother and father went out for the night and they got me a movie to watch. This was my first experience with Star Wars and i have bee enraptured ever since. Definitly one of the greatest movies of all times SW has redefined a generation and paved the way for new actors film makers and movies. The masterpiece not only has some of the greatest action sequenses ever(Death Star trench run) it has a plot that can be enjoyed and analyzed at any level. From 5 year olds to 40 year olds this movie can hold different meanings. I have to say Lucas is a genius and i cant wait for episode 2 and 3,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Perfect Space Opera Epic,"I'm continuing to watch all six episodes of ""Star Wars"" in preparation for ""The Force Awakens"" (at this point I'm considerably late to the game, but better late than never). Last night I watched ""Episode IV: A New Hope"", which is of course the first of the six films to be made.The last time I watched this movie was about a year and a half ago, when I watched the original trilogy with my brother who had never seen any of them. I had watched the prequels then, too, on my own in preparation for the latter three films, and at the time I remember being ever so slightly disappointed with ""A New Hope"". I didn't get that same slight disappointment this time, perhaps due to watching on a larger screen TV, or perhaps due to not having the anxiety of wondering what my fellow and first time viewer thought about the film, who knows. I do think I now have a good appreciation both for what makes this film great and what makes it distinct from the other movies.""A New Hope"" is, in its own way, the simplest of the Star Wars movies. Sure, the story has a lot going on--but there's less to keep up with than in the more complicated prequels (which I think are great, by the way). It's this relative simplicity that almost takes away from the movie. ""A New Hope"" doesn't set up its characters with a lot of back story--Darth Vader hardly gets one at all, especially if you're watching for the first time and don't know much about the Star Wars mythology. One could argue that a tad bit more background at certain points could have been helpful.And yet, despite its simplicity, it's a perfect movie overall. It tells just enough to be enjoyable on its own merits, and it firmly establishes its characters as archetypes in film history--both its protagonists and main antagonist. Yes, its effects are a bit cheesy at points--it was 1977, so at times things look a bit like an Atari game. Still, it all just comes together into a seamless and enjoyable film, and one that is just all around fun and entertaining.I will note that the movie is best viewed on a larger television--as I noted above, this certainly made a difference for me in my two most recent viewings. HD should be obvious as well, so definitely opt for Blu Ray for this one.All in all, I have to give this movie 10/10 stars. It's the perfect epic space opera. So simple that a kid can easily keep up and love it, but enjoyable for all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Force is strong with this movie.,"Star Wars is a cult classic that spans 25 years (and growing). It has an enormous fanbase (of which I'm part of), and for a reason. Star Wars was years ahead of its time. Not only did it awe us with eye candy, they created an incredible story.Mark Hamill, Carrie Fischer, Harrison Ford, Sir Alec Guinness, and James Earl Jones make up the principal cast of this movie. This movie immortalized these people. They played the parts very well.The music... John Williams is the god of modern composers! This music is so gripping and powerful! Williams rules!The story... words cannot express how incredible it was.If you have not seen this movie, you are possible only one year old, or you've been living under a rock for 30 years.

Time has been kind to it,"Having just seen Episode 1, I watched Star Wars Episode IV again to see if I could get some sort of idea of how the story may join up in two episodes time.  I couldn't really figure this out, as there are thousands of possibilities.  But I must say that Star Wars is still as good today as it was 20 years ago.  The special effects were still good, not as impressive as Episode 1 but for the time, they were excellent.  What is weird is that in basic terms Star Wars is just a good vs evil story, but its the way its done with all the other elements interwoven that make it so good.  The end battle scene is the best, and has been copied many times over in numerous inferior films.  I cant really imagine what life would be like without Star wars, i grew up on it and it holds a special place in my memory.

"Not brilliant, just Good.","I'm a big fan of cinema, and when I was told Star Wars was the best film ever, by one of my friends I jumped on the chance to watch it. Instead I get this - Star Wars is quite possibly the most overrated thing in existence, people will queue for days to watch it. The villain is a guy with what looks to be a pedal bin on his head. The main character - Luke - is a whiny brat. With Harrison Ford boring me out of my mind as Han Solo, maybe I'd have enjoyed it more if Al Pacino had taken this part. My advice to you would be to rent it, but if you're seriously into Science fiction, this should definitely be part of your collection",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Start of a Cult Classic :),"It's the first one and everyone loves it. I have to admit, it is cheesy and has its faults, but that's why it's perfect, and doesn't need improving *cough* George Lucas!The practical effects in this are amazing for its time, the story is literally out of this world and no one had scene anything like it. The characters are brilliant, we get a young boy who wants more in life, an old man who use to be a Knight, a Charming Smuggler, a Princess who can kick ass, two surprisingly comic relief robots and a really tall villain which represents a Dictator and feared by all.You can't get any better than that. The Death Star Assault has to be my favourite scene in the whole film, as the Starfighters look amazing in space and you just want to be in those cockpits. And the fact that George Lucas thought it would never work, and yet it has a cult following and such a huge fan service, they have declared the 4th of May to be Star Wars Day.

What really makes this movie is the hand-crafted models,"Let's all be thankful that today's computer effects did not exist when Lucas made the original Star Wars trilogy, because if they had then the original movies would have looked as bleh as the new ones. With the new trilogy, Lucas proves once and for all that he himself doesn't even understand what was good about the original movies. The original Star Wars movies are cool because they create a convincing, alien culture. Everything looks used, rugged and thousands of years old! It's believable as the surroundings of a five-thousand year-old and truly alien culture. It creates a timeless impression.The new movies, on the other hand, are nothing but run-of-the-mill ""hot right now"" special effects which will look dated in a couple of years. The look they achieve is generic futurism as we always imagine it, all sleek, silvered and aero-dynamic, all devoid of imagination. Fie on it, I say!!The new trilogy does not deseve to exist.

Star Wars is what most people first think of when they think of ""science fiction.""  Why?  It's because this film is wonderful and groundbreaking in that it is really the first modern sci-fi film.  The story is what really makes this movie...it is very well planned out, and grabs the viewer, making them want to keep watching all the episodes. This applies to all the Star Wars movies (Ep.

"""The"" BEST movie ever made...for all ages!!!!","Very seldom does a movie appeal to the tastes of everyone.  This movie is not really science fiction although some say it is the best sci-fi movie to date.  It is more of a fairy tale, which is set in a galaxy far, far away. It has all the ingredients of a fairy tale: good vs. evil, the dashing prince charmings coming to the rescue of a princess, and lots of daring do along the way.  It's almost like the story of King Arthur in outer space. What sells it to the audience?  At that time, its special effects were considered a marvel of cinematic movie making.  Today, the special effects would be considered, well, okay.  The characters have become household names: Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kanobi, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, R2D2, C3PO, and Princess Leia.  People, as a whole, have spent a zillion dollars on Star Wars' toys, video games, etc.  As a result, George Lucas became very rich and famous.  The movie's score is the best masterpiece of cinematic music ever recorded on film.  Lucas does a brilliant job of directing.  The film won 7 Academy Awards.  Harrison Ford became an international super star.  This all says a lot for just one movie!!! (well, not a whole lot...I could have gone on further and wrote a book about the success of this film.)

"""The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded...""- George Lucas","The studio dismissal of his first (and, arguably, best) film, THX-1138, and the phenomenal success of his second feature, AMERICAN GRAFFITI, led George Lucas to undertake an Americanized version of Akira Kurosawa's THE HIDDEN FORTRESS- by way of the old FLASH GORDON and BUCK ROGERS serials. Replacing the two flesh and blood leads from THE HIDDEN FORTRESS with a pair of robots who might well have stepped straight from Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS, Lucas fashioned a kiddie corn classic. Luke Skywalker, one supposes, is the young Lucas himself (whose interest in fast-moving machines nearly cost him the farm in his misspent youth). Forgettable in many ways, but nonetheless entertaining, STAR WARS has become the backbone of big-budget fx filmmaking in this country. One can't begrudge Lucas his phenomenal success, but one tends to find oneself longing for a return to the old, inventive days when he made movies with a tad more substance- movies that didn't follow the selfsame beat, frame after frame...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The ONE that started it all and more.,"Star Wars was unique and still is to this day. I was 9 when I first went to the local theater and watched it with my best friend at the time. When Darth Vader walked into Princess Leia's ship, I was hooked. Who was this guy? I wasn't sure from the first impression, but I was sure that he was someone you did not want to make upset.Heroes who you were clapping for. Bad guys who you loved to hate. Funny droids that could just about steal any scene that they were in. Worlds that you never have even dreamed off.

truly magical,"Twenty one years ago in late August my mom took me to see Star Wars.  It is the first movie that I can remember seeing in a theatre.  Being four years old I didn't know what to expect, but when the lights went out and that fanfare came on, I was mesmerized.  Then the movie started, and when those ships roared across the screen, I just sat there, amazed.  As the film progressed I was introduced to all of the characters that populate this film.  I remember being frightened when I first saw Darth Vader.  I remember the battle over the Death Star, the X-Wings and TIE Fighters blowing up and Luke being chased by Vader.  Then, the Death Star explodes.  Needless to say, I've never forgotten that experience.Twenty years later, I was thrilled to relive the experience.  I went to see Star Wars again in the theatre.  It was truly magical, I felt like I was four again, and going to see my first movie.  This movie will always be my favorite, sure there are other films that are arguably better.

so easy to watch .. but so little to think about,"Might as well get it out there. Sci-fi ""almost"" never age well, and this is no exception. Consider episode 1,2,3 vs 4,5,6.

Now look at Blade Runner - it is superb on blu ray - but maybe not in 2054. The more recent Matrix will probably look like cheese comes 10 yrs time.Well, back to the topic. When this came out and I only watch it once in theatre. Well... errrrh.. hohum, like the title said -> all exterior and not much interior. Just slightly above Michael Bay's best effort and that's The Island.

There are good things - but none too memorable or can be identified with, for me. Roger Ebert said it --> it's a space opera.

A Sense Of Something Epic,"There was science fiction before Star Wars and science fiction afterwards. The amazing thing about this film, though, is that it presents such a simple narrative. It has drama, compelling characters, action, adventure, humor, and fantasy; every ingredient that an epic doth make.The storyline is classic ""good vs. evil"" fare. The Empire forces, commanded by the mechanically- supported Darth Vader (voice of James Earl Jones), wreak havoc over the galaxy, but are opposed by a rebel force led by Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), and Han Solo (Harrison Ford).While recently watching this movie again, I identified three reasons why this simple little film sparked such a phenomenon:1. The storyline is just so compelling and dramatic. A sense of something epic prevails throughout the entire production.2. Whereas it too preceding show Star Trek many episodes to establish a cadre of eclectic characters, Star Wars (with the likes of Chewbacca, C3PO, & R2D2) accomplishes the feat in roughly 30 minutes.3. The overall genre-diversity of the experience. I recently screened the film with my 13-year old sister, and she enjoyed it as much as I did but for completely different (e.g. humorous, primarily) reasons. Much like ""Back To The Future"", for example, Star Wars attracts viewers from all ""walks"" of film genre.Basically, this ""first"" (depending on your point of view...!) installment in the series does a great job of establishing the important characters, laying the basis for the epic plot, and just providing some basic entertainment.

Origins of the story,"I seem to remember that many years ago George Lucas admitted that the basic core idea for the movie was wholly derived from the Seven Samurai. Just as the Magnificent Seven had lifted that plot and re-located it from Japan into Mexico, so Lucas took the very same idea and re-located it into Outer Space. Count the heroes: Obi Wan, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, R2D2 and C3PO. Seven, right? And they have to take on the whole menacing force threatening a nice, peaceful civilisation and restore order and justice. Which of course they do. OK, that basic plot is hugely embellished and adorned with highly impressive special effects (even now they still look great), but at the heart of it the original Star Wars film is essentially a hi-tech sci-fi re-telling of the Seven Samurai. BTW, I still can't bring myself to think of it as anything other than Star Wars, ""in brackets the first one"". How can it be Episode IV when it was the first one to be conceived? Is Lucas ashamed to admit he's just milking his cash cow? Or ashamed to admit he's not really done anything else of note outside of the Star Wars franchise? As for earlier comments about this movie having changed the world - or even just the world of cinema - all I can say is get real, get a life and get out more.

One of my favorites,"Star Wars without question is one of my favorite film series.  This particular episode of the saga is not what I would call the best of the entire series but it is definitley a timeless classic.   I first saw Star Wars when I was 6 years old which was in 1993 and I was blown away by this film and I still am to the day.  I remember my father saying that he had gone to the movies to see Star Wars when it was first released in 1977 and he mentioned that he had fell asleep during the movie, then I thought how could you fall asleep on a movie like this ?  Not many people in my family cared much for Star Wars, but I have to say that it is one of the greatest film series ever made.  A New Hope is probaly my third favorite in the series, in which case The Empire Strikes Back is my favorite and Attack Of The Clones is my second and right after that comes A New Hope.  There isn't much to say about Star Wars except for that is a phenomenon and a timeless classic space opera which will be seen by people of all ages in generations to come.  I think that George Lucas is only making the series better by adding the three prequels to the original trilogy.  A New Hope is a classic movie and is a movie I must have seen about 30 times. Four Stars. I reccomend this movie to anyone of any age.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Now i Understood why so much hype about Star Wars,"I tried to watch star war movies before but somehow, i end up not watching them completely. Lately, i heard that after long time, another star wars movie is going to release and people are so crazy and every advertisement on television is related to star wars. The craze is almost like Macy's thanksgiving parade and Micheal Jackson's live performance. Finally, i decided to star watching all the movies.I kept in mind one thing while watching the movie is that the movie was made in 1977, when there was no technology, no artificial intelligence and automated robots. Movie was brilliantly made and the techniques ( i observed) used to make it visually fascinating are astonishing. Most of the effects are paints and motion blur was used to blend the multiple layers to appear as one.When it comes to the story, i was little bit confused because, the first movie was actually fourth part of the story. Still i do not know why they made in this order.But, story was considered as epic as i thought. Overall, i liked the movie and i could not wait to see the rest of them.Finally, i decided to watch all of them before the new movie is released.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Only once in a great while...,"It's not often that a film is released and it literally changes society. Pop culture, modern film and cinema history took a hit when this film was released... yes even before the 'Episode IV' title was attached.'Star Wars' wasn't just another Sci-Fi film, it was the first time in a long time a filmmaker's vision transferred to celluloid untouched by executive hands and actually worked.Sure, millions will say that it's one of the greatest films ever... perhaps in Sci-Fi circles. It was, easily, one of the most influential. Not because it spawned a billion dollar industry for special FX, toys and marketing or five sequel films... but it led the way for all the films and filmmakers to follow in it's footsteps.Was it greatly acted? It was OK. Was it greatly written? It was an original, paced story.But with it's effects, score and direction, it all came together... and in the end, that is what great epic film is all about.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A decent film,"I know I'm giving a rather underwhelming review to a beloved film that started one of the world's biggest franchises but I still consider it to be more good than great. So without further ado, I'll address the good, bad and ugly about this movieThe Good
1) Darth Vader is an excellent villain (especially given how little screen time he actually has)
2) Han Solo is a great character
3) I like Obi-Wan Kenobi
4) I like R2-D2
5) I like Leia arguing with and eventually falling in love with Han. (Not so much her as a character but that aspect of her.)
6) Even if the effects haven't aged that well, there are pretty neat action scenes
The Bad
1) Hamill's performance is wooden (I know it improved in the sequels)
2) The Death Star is an idiotic plot device
3) Repeatedly (explicitly) describing the Empire as ""evil"" is far too corny for my taste (at least in a movie which plays it straight.)
4) With the obvious exception of Han Solo, most of the characters are generic and forgettableThe UglyThe ending includes forced set-up for a sequel though I can honestly live with that given how rare movie sequels were in 1977, I can let it slide.Conclusion
It has its fair share of flaws but it's a good movie nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The classic sci-fi film that started it all.,"Star Wars, now known as Star Wars Episode IV, is a great classic. It's still amazing how it's held up after all these years. It tells the story of Luke Skywalker, a poor farm boy who, after meeting old Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, begins the greatest journey of his life. He goes up against the evil empire and Darth Vader, who has a past with Obi Wan. Not a whole lot happens in this original Star Wars, but it revolutionized sci-fi films as we know them, with battling space ships, laser guns, and hologram communication. The acting and the writing isn't the greatest there's ever been, but it doesn't stop the movie from being completely enjoyable. Star Wars totally deserves the attention it gets and the money it makes from books, video games, TV shows, toys, and it's following sequels.Star Wars will forever remain a classic, even if critics continue to ignore George Lucas's creativity.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) - May the Force Be with You!,"Director George Lucas brings one of the most fantastic pieces of film in cinematic history with the groundbreaking ""Star Wars"". This movie can prove that I am a complete science fiction freak. Farm boy Luke Skywalker has been asked to protect Princess Leia from the evil clutches of Darth Vader, and the Death Star station. Along the way, he is joined by uncle Obi-Wan Kenobi, the greedy Han Solo and his trusted companion Chewbacca, and two droids named R2-D2 and C3-PO. Throughout the movie, it's a stunning journey that beat the odds of cinema. ""Star Wars"" is one of those epic science-fiction flicks where you already know that you will enjoy it in the end. Let me just say that once those flying credits through the galaxy in the beginning are finished, you are in for a treat. I enjoy everything about this spectacular piece of work. The casting of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Alec Guinness, and Carrie Fisher was quite excellent. Even the characters of Chewbacca, R2-D2, and C3-P0 seem so memorable. George Lucas delivers an incredible directing job, and brought a lot of his unique imagination to the screen. John William's breathtaking score blew me away, the visual effects are astounding and it puts you into the action, the sound is sense-tickling, the editing is pure genius, the costumes are well unique, and the art direction feels so imaginative. This is one of those movies where it can let you escape the real world, and send you into a world like no other. So, if you are a fan of science fiction, and you enjoy watching George Lucas flicks, then ""Star Wars"" is the movie for you!

And now I look back fondly at my first experience with the Hollywood hype machine (and numerous other disappointments to my expectations that would follow).But just to show that I hold no grudges, or force my opinions on my scion, this is my older son's all-time fave.

"No, I am not calling it A New Hope","Now with the kinda enormously anticipated Force Awakens premiering this Friday, I decided to chat about the film that started it all, Star Wars from 1977. And even though I very much enjoy this movie, I will not shy away from the flaws. Anyways lets blastoff!!! (Yes that was corny, but I'm in the mood right now so shut up.)So first thing I want to talk about is the story. The story of a young farm boy being sent on a quest to save the princess and the galaxy from an evil overlord. While the story isn't anything new compared to today's science fiction films, it does have a timeless feel in how its presented. Its also pretty interesting the fact that the story took inspiration from old samurai films.The characters are probably the most iconic thing about this film, besides maybe the story or soundtrack (which is freaking excellent by the way.) We all know them, the whiny Luke Skywalker who learns to mature, the wise old Obi-Wan Kenobi, the awesome Han Solo, the strong and determined Leia, the sinister yet captivating Darth Vader, the.Chewbacca, every character is instantly recognizable and you remember them all. Though one thing I should point out is while the characters are good, the acting at times could be pretty bad. Not all of them, Alec Guinness is great as Obi-Wan, but some of the others aren't all that great.One other thing about this film that is iconic are the effects. When they were making Star Wars they actually had a pretty small budget, which is more amazing when you think about how revolutionary these effects were, they were so revolutionary that this film practically created CGI with the blaster and light saber effects. Even though not all of the effects hold up today, there are still some really good effects considering nowadays. Even the some of the hokey effects I can forgive since the movie's budget was pretty constrained.Even though, like I said before, I do enjoy this movie, I do have some issues. One thing I talked about already was the acting. Another thing is that looking back at it, the first 20 to 30 minutes of the movie are really slow, and this might be just because I am used to movies having a more faster paced story, but I did feel really uninterested at this point. Also, while I said that the story does feel timeless, it does have a lot of ridiculous moments. A famous example being the Death Star having a small hole that if you shot into would cause it to explode. Also when the fight at the Cantina starts, its just because some guy saw Luke and ""didn't like him"". And even though the Death Star battle is iconic and entertaining, it is very overblown and cheesy at times.Even with the flaws I have with it, I do appreciate Star Wars for doing something that hadn't been done before at the time, and in the process created blockbusters and sci-fi films as we know it.Final Score: 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pathetic,"While it did spawn a nifty couple of sequels, the original Star Wars sucked. The rebels, so willing to die for a cause, seemed awful selfish in not wanting to sacrifice themselves to save the others.  How many ships did Vader blow up while in the narrow tunnels?  He'd pick off groups of three at a time, and each one would sit there and say, ""Oh no, he's locking on.  I'm being killed!"" None of them seemed to be willing to slam on the breaks and smash themselves into Darth's ship, killing the villain and saving the day in one move.  Give me a break.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars,"1977 was the year that kicked off an iconic batch of stories set a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away. From the dynamic mind of George Lucas, 'Star Wars' is a monumental piece of sci-fi greatness, in which it is a film that all aspiring sci-fi writers and directors have looked at for inspiration. With a creative plot and characters that only a true imaginative mind could've created, a stage was set for much beloved film trilogy.The casting was great, I don't think anybody could ever imagine the characters introduced in this film being, acting or sounding any different to how they do here. Leading the way is Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, closely followed by the other main protagonists Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) which led to a stellar cast allowing their chemistry to grow as the movie went on. Also present and profound were Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker playing droids C-3PO and R2-D2 respectively, Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca the wookiee, and David Prowse as Darth Vader, voiced by the legendary James Earl Jones.But enough about the actors, what really makes this movie special are the visuals, graphics and special effects that nobody had so immaculately achieved at this point in time; the TIE fighters scenes and the soaring planetary landscapes must've been so breath-taking, in which case they still are today. Along with excellence in special effects, there is also excellence in original score-writing, in which most will agree that John Williams' best work lies within this movie.Dynamic, creative and at times very funny (mostly because of C-3PO), Star Wars lives as a real innovative turning-point in cinema, though the emphasis on the effects and visuals almost overshadows the fact that this is one of the greatest and most lovable films of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Great Movie,"I can still remember sitting in the theatre at 4 years old watching this movie with my Dad. The movie is great overall, but perhaps one of the best scenes in all of cinema is the great Battle at Yavin where the struggling rebellion destroys the evil Death Star. Luke Skywalker came to be a childhood hero for me. The magnificent score by John Williams only hightens it's brilliance.This movie for me is the best of the trilogy and I'm sure will stand the test of time as with all great movies. You might say I'm somewhat partial to this movie being from the bay area near to where George Lucas directed some of the movie so I can appreciate his direction and his style of directing.I give this movie a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Intergalactic Extravaganza,"One of Hollywood's biggest and most influential opuses, STAR WARS is a film unlike any other. This ambitious space opera captivated audiences with its imaginative story, dazzling visuals, groundbreaking effects and exciting pacing, rocketing them to a galaxy far, far away. The pinnacle of the seventies blockbusters, it was an enormous hit, earning critical approval and becoming the highest grossing movie in the world. With all the bleak realism, sleaziness and character studies that populated the contemporary cinema, STAR WARS was quite the contrast - not even JAWS offered escapism like this. Through state-of-the-art technology, writer-director George Lucas affectionately revamped the old Buster Crabbe matinee serials of his childhood without ever diminishing the joy and wonder, creating his own extraordinary universe that launched the modern age of high concept, effects-driven filmmaking.Including the FLASH GORDON and BUCK ROGERS pulp fantasies, the world of STAR WARS was a synthesis of many different inspirations, among them Frank Herbert's novel ""Dune"", the Errol Flynn swashbuckler adventures, samurai cinema, dogfight footage from the Second World War, religious concepts, Westerns, even the Arthurian myth. The plot is a classic example of the hero's journey narrative template: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) the venturesome farm boy begins a new life as he embarks on a quest to stop the tyrannical Empire, who have developed a superweapon called the Death Star that can annihilate planets. Discovering a distress signal from the captive Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), leader of the Rebel Alliance, through her robot companions C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), Luke and the droids team up with the former Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) and the dashing ship captain Han Solo (Harrison Ford) to rescue the princess and bring justice to the galaxy. The character roster is full of endearing and memorable personalities but the standout is Han, the most flamboyant one of the bunch. You can see why Ford became a major movie star after this.The picture is an unforgettable experience - not only is it great fun, it's a visual and technological marvel. Lucas formed his own special effects department, Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), to bring his epic tale to fruition, demonstrating an unparalleled creative wizardry that put 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY to shame. It took home practically every technical award at the Oscars with a special achievement given to sound designer Ben Burtt, undeniably deserving all of them. Boasting fabulous set and costume design, as well as some meticulous matte painting, the sweeping visionary setting is populated with slews of alien creatures and electronic machines, and holds numerous fascinating locations. The interstellar travel and combat segments showcase a remarkable combination of blue screen compositing, built life-size cockpits and intricately detailed miniatures - the spacecraft exterior shots were captured on an innovative device called the Dykstraflex, the first digitally controlled motion camera system. As a preeminent innovator in optical trickery and computer graphics, ILM became the most prized workshop of their kind in Hollywood for at least the remainder of the century.1977 may have seen the deaths of three pivotal entertainment legends in Elvis, Chaplin and Crosby, but a new era was born in the cinema. STAR WARS transformed science fiction into a cash cow of the industry, no longer the niche genre of dorky kids and over-imaginative adults. It also spawned one of the largest media franchises in history, including an immensely popular series of sequels, prequels and spin-offs, and a profitable merchandising business of toys, video games, clothing, posters, books and more. It became a runaway pop culture phenomenon with millions of fans across the world; many characters, quotes, musical pieces and even sounds are widely recognised amongst the general public. STAR WARS may fundamentally be just a comic book about the timeless battle of good against evil brought to celluloid, but it's a spectacularly entertaining take on the cliché done with heart and craft, and there's thankfully nothing pretentious about any of it. With John Williams' acclaimed, evocative score bringing a magnificence to the awesome images, the brisk editing holds your attention and the two hours breeze by. The energy never lets up but it's delightful rather than exhausting, compelling rewatches again and again as the years go by. This is essential viewing for anybody who loves the movies.Initially released as simply ""STAR WARS"", the film was later given the subtitle of ""EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE"" to contextualise it within the story timeline of the franchise. Lucas infamously made a ""special edition"" full of new scenes and modern CGI for its twentieth anniversary in 1997, also doing the same for the two sequels (""the original trilogy""); since then, he has sadly disregarded the first theatrical versions, the films that made the series so successful in the first place, and has never given them a high quality remaster. He ought to be proud of the fans who were devoted enough to accomplish this for him.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Wow....,"This is incredible. With the visuals, it really takes a lot of time to believe that this movie was made in 1977. The story's great and when it ended, I couldn't believe that it ended. It felt...abrupt, but that's maybe because it was so good. Overall, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WATCH IT NOW!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
i never understood...,"Frankly, I really cannot understand why everyone loves this movie so much. The story is corny and really not science fiction at all (it's fantasy--there IS a difference!), the acting is not very good (especially not Mark Hamill, the main character, who is just sort of bland-o), and though the special effects were groundbreaking in 1977, if the movie were released today they would only be so-so. I think the reason for the film's continued popularity is because at the time it was released, the enormous baby boom generation were all teens and twenty-somethings, the right age market for a movie of this type. Now they've all told their kids about how *great* it was, and now *they're* all flocking to see it, just like their parents did, based only on what they've heard. The forty- and fiftysomethings love it because it reminds them of when they were young too. It's nothing more than nostalgia and word of mouth. Why this movie instead of others that were released in the late '70's? Well, perhaps because it *is* the first movie released with the type of overblown special effects we've all gotten used to in ""science fiction"" movies. Hollywood just doesn't know what makes a good movie anymore. I suppose story, script and acting don't matter. Just lots of eye-candy. And this has always appealed to a young market. Like I said, if this same movie were released today for the first time, it would be quickly forgotten. I find it reprehensible that this type of comic-book action flick is now the definition of ""science fiction."" It's nothing more than fantasy; true science fiction makes you think. The best example of a *good* science fiction movie is still ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" A more recent example is  the underrated ""Contact."" No, neither of these movies have laser-gun battles, cutesie-pie aliens, or dark space lords. But those are the creations of Hollywood and really have nothing to do with science. My point is not to ruin anyone's good time--it's a harmless movie and fine for kids to watch and for middle-agers with arrested development still living with their parents, but it should be pointed out that this overrated movie is mediocre Hollywood entertainment, *not* great movie-making. I rest my case.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"6.6/10 - Fun, Great Worldbuilding, But Could've Been Tighter","After two movies that are less mainstream, I'm diving right back into one of the most well-known and enormous movie franchises ever - Star Wars, which is honestly much more than a movie franchise nowadays, but you get what I mean. This will be the first time I'm reviewing a full trilogy here, with the original Star Wars trilogy. I've watched it before but it was years ago, so I didn't really know what to expect now.Feels ridiculous to say it, but the first Star Wars film, the one that came out in 1977, follows Luke Skywalker, a young farmer boy who wants to see the galaxy but never gets to leave his home planet, Tatooine. He ends up getting sucked into a mess that's much bigger than him - the rebellion against the galactic Empire. Will he manage to prove himself, to conquer this task and help the rebels? Will he find his way?Disclaimer: I don't think that this review will end up as one of my best ones. I'm not this passionate about this movie, and so it is that I don't have much to say about it. I'll try, though. Let's go ahead and dive right into it.From the very beginning of this movie, I feel like one of its strongest facets is the world building. It feels full, curious, even when looking at this film as its own thing, without knowing that there are more movies. Like, I want to explore more, to see more, I want more questions answered, but not in a bad way - in a way that just makes you want to see more of this stuff, I guess, more aspects of this world. Making this movie feel like sort of an appetizer, you know?The John Williams soundtrack is, of course, iconic for a reason. I love it, especially the Mos Eisley track. The music can be both epic and a bit tongue in cheek, and it just fits very well to the general vibe of the movie.The cast is very solid, too - Harrison Ford as Han Solo is super fun and charismatic, Mark Hamill catches the naïve vibes of Luke in a way that's both endearing and annoying (spot on), and even C3PO is portrayed in a very fun way. I enjoy the interactions between the character quite often, and they're simple but still fun to watch. The contrast between Solo and Luke, or the bratty cuteness of R2D2 vs the cynicism of C3PO. Fun overall.Some issues I have with the movie: Leia, unfortunately, suffers from the ""badly-written-female-character"" syndrome (not that most characters here are particularly deep, but come on - Leia is like the shallowest representation of what a girlboss is, at least in this movie, and it's not that good). I also feel like something about this movie, mostly after the first act (which is very well-paced) and especially towards the final act, feels a bit off. Maybe because it's part of a bigger story and some details are still missing, some major plot points, but still, I can't help but feel like the pacing is handled weirdly.Star Wars: A New Hope, despite not being as tight or emotionally involving as I'd like it to be, is a pretty fun movie, with amazing production/set design and great worldbuilding. The characters are simple but mostly fun, too. It's not worth the hype, at least for now, but I definitely had a nice time here, especially during the first act. Feeling a 6.6/10 on this one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Unrealistic,"Why do they speak English in a galaxy far away? Why is there gravity on ships in space? How do they travel far above the speed of light? And when the Death Star reaches Yavin why does it wait 20 minutes to destroy the Rebel base, giving the rebels time to attack and destroy the Death Star? Surely the Death Star could've just blown up the rebel base without waiting for it to come in range. Hell they could've blown up the red planet first if it was in the way. Even if they were overconfident and didn't believe the rebels posed a threat to them, the rebels could've all gotten into spaceships and fled the base since the Death Star gave them plenty of time to get away",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Not my cup of tea,"I want to like this movie because it is a big part of movie-history, but, unfortunately I find it extremely boring. I am impressed by it only from a point of view that when it was made, it was revolutionary and fresh. But, as someone born in 99', I am spoiled with movies that have objectively far more interesting plots than this one and also a lot better in many other ways. I can not emphasize enough how much I want to feel the magic that people experienced when this first came out and the nostalgia people keep feeling, but it just doesn't do it for me. It kind of only made me wish it would end, mostly due to the fact that Chewbacca's sounds made me furious. Annoying creature, that one, eh?I will probably watch all the other movies in this franchise, and maybe my opinion will change along the way, but as for now it's solely my mission to watch them all because I made a promise to my mother that we would watch them together to see what the fuss was/is about (she somehow hasn't seen them yet despite being born in 65'.).",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"I mean, it's Star Wars","I haven't actually sat down and watched the original (ish) Star Wars in years, but its probably - let's be honest, along with its sequels - the most culturally ubiquitous American film of all time. You don't need to have WATCHED Star Wars to know basically everything about it; every character, plot beat, costuming or set design choice is so beloved and iconic that it's sometimes hard to actually sit down and watch this as a movie.Take yourself back to 1977, before Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Han Solo or R2D2 were household names. This is a genuinely fantastic action adventure film; the perfect mix of a rousing, exciting time and the promise of A LOT more. Yet, it's also impossible not to be charmed by how quaint this movie is; it was never a high budget film and you can tell. But there's so much creativity and energy on display here.It's a sci fi epic with the energy of an indie movie and that's something honestly very special. I can't imagine a film on this scale coming out today with an equivalent budget and being as universally accepted. I also appreciate that this movie feels like a pastiche of so much of the pop culture that came before. Adventure serials, Westerns, samurai films, fantasy epics...it has elements from all of them and the sum is truly greater than its parts.Luke (Mark Hamill), Leia (Carrie Fisher), and Han Solo (Harrison Ford )are the perfect filmic adventure trio and have undeniable chemistry from the get go. But I also think characters like Chewbacca, R2D2, and C3P0 (the latter two get way more screen time than I remember - essentially they're the focus for the first 10-15 minutes) add not only to the ""spaciness"" of the film, but imbue it with so much heart.Honestly, it's easier to just pick out this movie's flaws than to go down a list of what it does right, because that's basically everything else. George Lucas has sort of robbed us of the ability to watch these movies in their original glory (enabled now by Disney) and I think it's an objective knock on the film. The first bit on Tatooine is rife with ugly and out-of-place CG and it definitely takes you out of the film. Case and point: R2D2 and C3PO are frequently dirty and covered with finger prints throughout this movie. This, ironically, makes them look more real and believable than the undoubtedly spotless version a CG creation would be.Yes, the final fight between Vader and Obi Wan is kind of underwhelming. The choreography is objectively bad and it also doesn't make a ton of sense as to why it ends the way it does...let's chalk this up to George Lucas and co finding their footing.Aside from that, what can I say? It's Star Wars. It's one of the most important films of all time and a genuine masterpiece. If you haven't seen it, we can't be friends.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The beginning of the tidal wave,"My wife and I saw this in the theater on its first release in 1977, not long after we had finished grad school. We took with us a much older friend of ours (more than a generation older in fact) who wanted to see what all the fuss was about but she was a bit too shy to go by herself. It was all great fun but of course no one in the world could have predicted the entertainment phenomenon this franchise would become. In fact, Star Wars was just a one-and-done intention until its massive popularity fueled the making of TESB. (When the opening credits of the sequel rolled starting with ""Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"", it was electrifying: everyone looked at each other saying 'What?? this is episode five? what are 1, 2, and 3?"" and Lucas's grand plan was off and running. I'm not sure it would have happened though if the sequel hadn't been better than the original.)But back in 1977, we just enjoyed the straight-up simplicity and verve of the plot -- good versus evil, admittedly cardboard characters, dazzling space battles that were more fun than they had any right to be.

Before May 1977, sci-fi fans just didn't have that much to pick from. Sure, there were your Forbidden Planets and Logan's Runs, and of course there was Star Trek. Their effects were acceptable (okay, Forbidden Planet was gorgeous for 1954), but quality sci-fi was almost an oxymoron.Star Wars changed all that.For the first time we got an exciting plot, action, and incredible special effects in one package. The aliens looked REAL, not like actors in suits. The spacecraft looked REAL, not like models. The laser beams looked REAL, not like...well...anything before it!For all the books I've read that say 2001: A Space Odyssey was the turning point for sci-fi films, I feel that Star Wars did more to fuel the genre and bring it into the mainstream than any other movie in history. Of course that's just my opinion....",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Evergreen,"If JRR Tolkein was to be suddenly come alive and want to see how his book has been adapted into a movie - I would not ask him to see ""Fellowship of the Ring"" - but rather give him the Star Wars books and show him the movies.Never before has there been such a brilliant adaptation of a book into another book. Lord of Rings deals with a time many years ago - Stars Wars is a long time ago - but in a galaxy far far away.Frodo is Luke Skywalker, Gandalf is OB1 the adaptation is complete and perfect.

First time viewing in 2015,"I can imagine that the first Star Wars was impressive for its time, and how it managed to become instant pop culture icons is understandable. For its time. As someone looking back and watching this in 2015, it's certainly a good movie, but it has its laughable moments. The first scene, all the lasers conveniently miss their targets, there are some comedic death scenes (that were not intended to be so) and the aliens are obviously puppets - no ifs ands or buts about it. But despite these goofs in the film making (which you have to remember, this came out in 1977 - but I'm judging it from a 2015 standpoint), it's genuinely a good movie. The plot sets the precedent for the epic saga that will come afterwards. Original, iconic characters like Chewbaca, Han Solo, Princess Leia, and Jabba the Hutt are unforgettable. The ""childlike"" charm of Luke Skywalker and the interplay between the haughty and arrogant Han Solo, as well as as the bantering between droids C3PO and R2D2 give the film enough comedic relief to make a film about galactic civil war more ""down to earth."" Although I personally enjoyed Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi more, A New Hope is still good and one of the better films in the saga.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The best 3 movies ever.,"Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi are three of the best movies ever made. The appeal these movies have 20 years later is amazing. I can't wait for Episode 1!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Film that hasn't dated in terms of style and more remarkably; modernity. Still compelling when watched now.,"Some frown upon Star Wars, labelling it a fad and being equally unkind to that of its fans. Others praise Star Wars, living by it and its ideas that it garnished to do with 'The Force'. I never had any hostility towards Star Wars but I did toward the genre. Science Fiction has never been my favourite genre of film and likewise, blockbusters usually leave me underwhelmed and confused more often than not. The fact that Star Wars compelled me, kept me interested and above all entertained me then, is a fantastic achievement in itself.I just mentioned the word 'compelling' because that's exactly what the film is. Star Wars may be look upon as a 'fad.' or just one of those things where someone has come up with an idea that no one else has done before and then got rich off it through money and fans (Tarantino's Pulp Fiction may be a good recent example) but Star Wars is something more than that; it's a lesson in good and engaging story telling, interesting characters and fantastic settings. I remember seeing the recent prequels several months ago because they were available to me with the logic that if I watch Star Wars in chronological order, maybe I'll like the more critically bashed recent efforts more. Alas, Episode 1 was pretty good in my opinion but the second and third episodes stunk in terms of story telling, good characters and general interest. Seeing Star Wars now, I have come to really appreciate and acknowledge what this must've been when it first came out, what it must have been like to see something like this and be a part of it.It is clear Lucas had an idea in his head from the beginning which gives you an idea of the scope of his vision. There are numerous references to the previous episodes in the opening half an hour and it must've been both perplexing and fascinating for filmgoers to predict what it all meant at the time  I felt spoilt watching and knowing what it all meant with audiences from 1977 in mind not knowing at all - when was the last time I felt spoilt during a film? This is all part of Star Wars' effectiveness. Whilst I don't think Lucas has achieved auteur status, I feel that his accomplishment as a filmmaker is more that cemented. Lucas has come up with these various types of alien species; he's shown us brief glimpses of them throughout the film, leaving us wanting more; he's given us the special effects that we want to see more and more of and he's taken everything to do with modernity of the time and contaminated it on screen with robots, laserguns and the now famous space Katanas (lightsabres to most people).But the films scope doesn't stop there. It presents us with one of the best character introductions of all time: Han Solo (Ford), a guy sitting in the seediest of bars in the galaxy where shootings and dismemberment is a common thing, talking crime and money with equally seedy people before blowing one of them away when he learns of his death's price. Although remaining professional and giving us an entertaining scene, the film tells us everything we need to know about a character without use of voiceovers or flash-backs or even silly special effects as someone does something truly unbelievable in a dumb attempt to 'woo' an audience. Here, it's just feet up, cool banter, find out about the price on your head and 'Blam!'; job done. The film also achieves its cult status through use of futuristic scope. Man had landed on the moon a mere eight years ago and in the same vein as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars throws everything on screen to do with technology and yet remains undated: space, space crafts, lasers, robots; things that are around now and are at a much more advanced level and yet remain in Star Wars as fresh and entertaining as they ever did, have I mentioned 'compelling' yet? Lucas shows us he can deal with the more serious sides of story telling: a brief flirtation with a love story and the personification of evil through the 'dark side' and its similarities with the Nazis of the second world war. The way the guards dress inside the death star, the way storm troopers guard certain areas on certain planets, the use of an 'empire' in a film and the way the dogfights resemble Spitfire vs. Messerschmitt battles during the Battle of Britain. The film also knows how to keep us in suspense; there are some scenes when Skywalker (Hamill) and Solo are disguised as stormtroopers, where they face being crushed, where Skywalker has to make an important shot aboard his fighter plane, when a door is slowly opening behind them and certain death awaits  the editing and story telling make us involved and if you can zone yourself out enough, make it unpredictable; yes, unpredictable I said it.There is no reason not to identify the mediocre flaws the film has such as the may the dogfight at the end is edited in that dated sort of a way, nor can you ignore the fact any other Allied space ship being destroyed during the final fight is insignificant as we don't know who's in them and we don't care; I also didn't like the way the ships seemed to 'scream' past and the excessive beeping R2D2 kept making. These things aside, the film is still a 'blockbuster' and firmly cemented the legacy that summer films now have  next time you watch a blockbuster that's guaranteed to rake in cash thanks to your favourite stars and characters, spare a thought for little known Lucas and co. whose Star Wars wasn't expected to do well and yet took the time to entertain and remained smart at the same time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not aging well,"The ""silver screen"" edition, which takes the film back to its pre-CG roots (and was indeed the first version I'd seen), is currently available (for the moment anyway) on YouTube. Wanting to see if it was as good as I remembered, I sat down one night and watched it.OK, yes, most successful franchise in movie history. Got it. Great soundtrack. No doubt about it. But strip away the layers upon layers of CG work, and what do you have left? Not a whole lot.The acting is almost as cardboard as the sets. The screenplay is a mash-up of things that even in their day were sci-fi-movie clichés. The models are clearly that: plastic and styro models. The puppetry and stop-action work is almost unbearably bad. The pre-CG post work looks almost laughably lame. Perhaps Lucas is right: this is not the version we want to remember, because it's just a cheezy 1980s movie. STAR WARS' advantage, at the time, was that it was so different from what else was being produced at the time. But now, with the perspective of all these decades? It ain't holding up well.It's still a great series of space operas, no discussion needed on the point. And God knows it's made a kazillion bucks.But is it *good*?

The Force will be with you...always.,"There's hardly anything this reviewer can say that hasn't already been said, and said better, numerous times before, about this milestone in cinema and the popular culture. The story, of a simple farm boy from an isolated desert planet meeting his destiny as one of the brave souls fighting an evil intergalactic organization, is wonderful fantasy in a science-fiction setting.The mythology it creates ensures its staying power, as well as the many endearing and entertaining characters we meet along the way. There's the reckless, macho mercenary Han Solo (Harrison Ford) who learns something about doing things for others rather than just himself, the wizened old warrior Ben / Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) who instructs our young hero Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) on the ways of the ""Force"", the young Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) determined to right the wrongs being perpetrated in this universe, the loyal anthropoid spaceship co-pilot Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), the menacing bad ass that is the black garbed Darth Vader (David Prowse / voice of James Earl Jones), and the odd couple robots R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) who provide us with a healthy amount of comedy relief.The movie is cast to perfection, with old pros like Peter Cushing and Mr. Guinness supporting the talented up and comers Hamill, Ford, and Fisher. A team of technical wizards, who pioneered some ingenious special effects, bring us from one visually astounding environment to another, from the desert wastes of Tatooine to the stark efficiency of the armoured space station The Death Star. John Williams, the man behind some of the most instantly recognizable soundtracks of all time, supplies the iconic score here that lets us know, right from the first moments of the film, that we're in for a good time.Of course, those of us who have become extremely familiar with the film over time would give anything to once again be experiencing it for the first time, which is why it's a joy to see it with younger viewers as they are introduced to its sense of wonder. It's equal parts thrilling, suspenseful, and humorous, and gives us an effective final dogfight in space equivalent to that of an old time war movie.Just speaking personally, this has great resonance for me as it was one of those treasured films of my youth and one had better believe that I was a proud owner of a number of the toys. I always looked forward to a viewing and even as an adult when I know what to expect, the fun factor of the thing still comes through strong.This is definitely one of those films that cinema lovers ought to see at least once in their lifetime.Nine out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars is for dorks,"I have to admit Star Wars : A new hope is a rather good movie. Although it has quite a slow start, towards the end of the movie it gets quite exciting, and you genuinely feel the tension as Luke barrels down the trench at the end. Having said that, it is important to note that although it is a good movie, its isn't THAT good. There are many other films that make far more of an emotional impact.The movie has been immortalized by sad, lonely people who struggle to fit into to regular society. I have a dork friend who is obsessed by Star Wars. He goes to see the new movies at midnight on opening night, hangs out at Star Wars geek meetings to discuss who important topics such as who fired first : Han or Geeko? Him and his hopeless depressed peers ponder upon the logistics of making many millions of clones and how the Emperor is an expert double crosser. I look at him and I pity him, because I do not believe that he will ever understand its a stupid film that made George Lucas a billionaire, and none of the characters are actually real.I have to be honest, out of 5 films only 1 has been any good. Which leaves me the question, why is Star Wars so popular? I have to say also, I thought Lord of the Rings was total cack also. But the intense geek following that is characteristic of Star Wars nerds is almost nauseating. God help sad lonely dorks, and may the force help them find girlfriends.

Even then I felt cheated of my ticket money. It's silly, it's weak. The plot is the sort of thing a group of adolescents would dream up - two teenagers save the universe. Technically the special effects were very good, but used almost completely unimaginately, and with endless incongruities.Loved Harrison Ford, though. And Darth Vader - a great villain, splendidly played.All in all, teenage space cowboys for people who know nothing about either film or science fiction.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Birth of a Cultural Revolution!,"A cultural revolution. That is what perfectly describes Star Wars: A New Hope. Movie historians have longed said that Steven Spielberg and George Lucas gave cinema a rebirth. The early 70's were a period for American and art-house films, but these two men allowed movies to become fun again. According to Lucas, who created THX-1138 and American Graffiti, the purpose for this movie was just for movies to become fun again. What he did for cinema today, well we have this man to thank for it. This small low-budget sci-fi film spawned six more movies with many more to come. Star Wars has now spread across three generations, three generations of love. I love hearing stories from people who saw this when it came out in 1977. They tell me how much this cultural phenomenon impacted their lives. My father is a mega Star Wars fan, and it's safe to say this is one of his favorite movies. How could such a small movie impact the movie business the way it did? Well, it helps that it's a fabulous movie. The movie features an iconic villain named Darth Vader who is known for his deep breathing noises. We have two incredibly memorable heroes in Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia. The two most famous robots in movie history are C-3PO and R2-D2. We have everyone's favorite scoundrel in Han Solo, the pilot of the Millennium Falcon and his favorite sidekick Chewbacca, a bear-like Wookiee. So what I'm trying to stay here, is the film has instantly memorable characters. This film pushed new ground with visual effects. Luca's own company, Industrial Light & Magic worked very hard in creating never-before-seen effects from the humming of the lightsabers to the robotic language of R2-D2. The film looks impressive for a 1977 feature, and that could have attracted scores of people. Most of all, this is a fun movie.Why do I love this film? Firstly, it's a very engaging story. A simple one, but an engaging one. I love science fiction films, so this film would be in my wheelhouse. Maybe it's because of Star Wars that I love sci-fi so much. George Lucas had to go through so much to bring his vision to cinema. He had his ideas early as 1971, but it look many years to get Alan Ladd Jr. of Twentieth Century Fox studios to back his vision. Despite the lack of great direction, the performances were still sharp as I will discuss later. Memorable performances from everyone. I mentioned in earlier reviews on this site that composer John Williams is my favorite composer. Well just listen to this mighty impressive score and you'll see why. The movie was fun to look at and to listen to and it enhances the story in a very positive way. The planets and their landscapes are wonderful to look at. I was impressed with the scale of the desert on the planet of Tatooine. There is a scene located at an intergalactic bar and it's just amazing how good practical effects looked with all of these aliens together. (This bar also happened to be where the controversial scene where you wonder who shot first. Han Solo or the bounty hunter, Greedo?) Believe it or not, I hated Star Wars as little kid. Luckily, that has changed as the years went on.So without further ado, let's go into the story of the film. It's a very simple, but well-defined story. The characters are simple ones, but they are given such deep characterization. This film follows a young man named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) as he sets out with his older, wiser Jedi mentor named Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) and a scoundrel pilot named Han Solo (Harrison Ford) as they set out to rescue the Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) from the evil second-in-command of the Empire, Darth Vader. (David Prowse, but famously voiced by James Earl Jones). They also must destroy the Death Star, a moon turned into a planet-destroying weapon, if they have any chance in stopping the Empire. See how wonderfully simple this story is? It's incredibly easy to follow, but there are layers to everything in the story.Which such a wonderful story, there has to be good performances right? Of course there are amazing performances! Career-defining performances in fact. Harrison Ford later stated it was because of Star Wars that he had such a great career. Shoulda not talked thrash about this movie during filming Harrison, huh? Well, despite Ford talking crap, he delivers the goods as Han Solo. I loved his cocky attitude, but deep down he was a man who is caring (if you count his love towards Leia) and someone who had no love for the Empire. Mark Hamill is great as Luke. His performance is shaky at first, but he grows as the film moves on. Carrie Fisher is great as Leia. A powerful heroine, which is something not seen in many 70's movies. Alec Guinness added a veteran presence as Obi-Wan and he truly embodies his character. Of course then there is Darth Vader. He is played by David Prowse, but is voiced by James Earl Jones (an iconic voice for the villain). Wonderful performances all around.So to sum up my feelings about the movie, I just about loved it. I have this movie to thank for giving me my undying love for the science fiction genre. I appreciate what this film did to change the way movies were made. Starting in 1977, summer blockbusters were going to be very prominent. Star Wars is a series that will live on forever and ever. This is something that everyone loves. But way beneath the implications, the film is a low-budget sci-fi film that only wanted to deliver fun to audiences worldwide. It certainly did that. One of my favorite movies of 1977. Thank you, George Lucas, for creating Star Wars.My Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Honestly, I don't even know where my classmates (I'm born 1999) picked up the first few movies, perhaps on TV when they were children?Anyhow, I never did but recently I decided to fill this hole in my understanding of pop culture. I wanted to understand who Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan and all these names are that appear everywhere because of how Star Wars has penetrated society.And indeed, I was grinning at the mentioning of these familiar names and words.But the story didn't appeal to me. The beginning of the first half was still decently exciting but the latter half was just bland and boring to me. This garbage disposal sequence was extremely unnecessary and just the entire second half bored me to death.The story didn't seem so coherent (there appear to be so many plot holes!) and the animation was of course not what we're used to today.On the other hand, I'm not sure what I should have expected. It is a 1977 movie intended for children.

A Very important film,"It's difficult to look at this film without offering the comparisons of Empire and Jedi. Sure they had much bigger budgets and a more intricate plot in the case of Empire. But Star Wars must be viewed for what it was intended as, the opening of a whole new world. As a cynical 33 year old I watched Star Wars for the first time in years and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's true that some of the dialogue is stupid, the effects a little shaky and even the acting (Hammil's especially) is wooden in places. But film is craft and to imagine one mans vision crafted it is amazing. It could have been terrible, it could have been a stinker but he put a team together that to me, pulled off miracles. The story is not original, it's a composite of every fantasy adventure written but it makes for a dazzling spectacle. John Williams, the man who made Jaws the tension filled thriller it is, scores a dramatic, fan fare opening. It's as if he knows how important this film is. I have to love it. More accessible than Lord Of The Rings and a pure piece of pop history. Star Wars is not the greatest film ever made, but it's certainly an important one",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
'Star Wars' through the eyes of a new generation,"I first saw 'Star Wars' in 2005 when I was around 7 years old and I distinctly remember thinking how fun this movie was, which is really the best word to describe the whole franchise, Star Wars is fun. Even though I grew up watching films filled with new age technology and mind blowing effects 'Star Wars' still made me feel like I was in space, travelling through hyperspace and visiting new exotic planets. For a film released in 1977 its technology and special effect still feel out of this world. Through the years I've realized that not only is it a fun film but it also works perfectly in setting up this trilogy. It's a classic tale of good vs. evil and this simplicity is one of the ways it differs from other Sci-fi were often the plot gets out of hand which is why many films nowadays are over the top.

I'm not one of these people that says that STAR WARS changed or in any way defined my life, but I am a really big fan of the whole star wars universe (the films, the ""fan"" films, the novels, etc.). I myself am an aspiring film maker & I'd have to say my inspiration to produce my own film stars here. If I had to sum up my biggest director/filmmaker influences there would be 2, & George Lucas is one of them (Sergio Leone is the other).As for the film...It's amazing. It's one of the greatest achievements ever made in the history of film making. It's the stuff of legends. I figure everybody's seen it by now so I'm not going to write a lengthy review on what it's about. If you somehow have never seen it, no offense intended, but you can read someone else's review. There's probably at least 10,000 of them out there.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Painfully average,"I never liked Star Wars, period. The fact that this movie got oversaturated and popular instead of Blade Runner or Twilight Zone Bewilders me to no end. The writing is basically above average. I expected more from a overwhelmingly popular series. The special effects are amazing, some of the best I've ever seen honestly. The movie stands the test of time, but so is Blade Runner, Blade Runner has better writing, better philosophy, better sci fi really everything better than Star Wars.

Classic Film,"This movie has defined a generation, and spawned a multimedia empire. With its now classic scrolling text, it created a new genre of film - the space opera. Influenced by Joseph Campbell, Lucas created a space western that hadn't been re-created since in any serious way. Even the much loved Firefly never had the same cult following. Star Wars' timeless feel resides in its classic archetypes the white hats. black hats to boo, and a classic princess to be rescued. It has a John Ford feel, with comedic relief in the twin yin yang feel of the droids R2-D2 and C3P0, the teacher with Obiwan, the lovable rogue Han Solo, the sidekick with a heart of gold Chewie, the student Skywalker and the love interest with a kick Lea.

What is it with the housecoats?,"Why is it that in Star Wars everyone wears a housecoat?   Obi Wan wears one, the Jawas wear them, Vader wears one...WHAT IS  UP WITH THAT?

I first saw it when I was 8 years old...and now, 25 years later, the magic isn't there anymore.  The special effects are so antiquated now that they look FAKE, the dialog is HILARIOUS, the battle sequences are PREDICTABLE, and the acting...well, let's not touch that one.  I do however, still enjoy John Williams' soundtrack, even though it has been rehashed OVER and OVER in the following movies.If it seems that I have a bad attitude about SW, I guess that is due to the 2 ""prequels"" that have been released.  Phantom Menace has basically ruined everything I ever enjoyed about Star Wars, TESB...and I never liked ROTJ in the first place....BUT, I used to regard SW as one of my favorite movies of all time.

Finally watched it.,"Well folks, I finally got around to watching that newfangled Star Wars movie that all the kids are talking about. And let me tell you, it's quite the doozy. I mean, I haven't seen that many special effects since I was in Vietnam and some of the explosions were real.Anyways, the story is about a young man named Luke Skywalker who lives on a desert planet and dreams of adventure. He gets his wish when he discovers that he is a Jedi Knight and sets off to save the galaxy from the evil Empire. Along the way, he teams up with a rogue smuggler named Han Solo, a Princess named Leia, and a walking carpet named Chewbacca.Now I know what you're thinking, ""But Dad, Chewbacca isn't a carpet."" And to that I say, ""Have you seen that fur? It's definitely carpet material.""The acting in this film was top notch, especially from that Harrison Ford fella. He's quite the charmer and that Princess Leia, wowee! I haven't seen a woman that strong-willed since your mother.The only downside to the movie is that it's a bit slow at times, but that's to be expected when you're trying to save the whole dang galaxy.Overall, I give Star Wars: A New Hope four out of five stars. It's a must-see for anyone who's a fan of outer space and blowing things up real good. But if you're looking for a romantic comedy, you might want to stick with The Notebook.May the Force be with you.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

One of the most essential movies ever,"Star Wars. It is undeniably one of the most essential and influential movies ever. Star Wars is an engrossing adventure, and it should be seen in a non-remastered version, but more on that later. Tomorrow is an International Star Wars Day, so to celebrate it, the review follows.The movie is a masterpiece of filmmaking without a doubt. It's use of practical effect overshadows the prequels with it's staying power, along with some gorgeous and visually impressive shots. This is true George Lucas's vision before he was trying to sell merchandise. Star Wars is a lighthearted adventure which has a lot of fun, humor and action in it.The plot is simple, yet it pulls you in. It could be argued that there are three main characters, but for this movie I consider Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill) to be the sole main character.He is a 20-year old who lives with his aunt and uncle on a planet of Tatooine and has dreams of becoming a pilot, little did he know that his dreams will come true in a way he didn't imagine....Galactic Empire rules the galaxy and there are rebels who are aspiring to crush the Empire, who are lead by Princess Leia(Carrie Fisher). Galactic Empire has developed an ultimate weapon a.k.a. the Death Star which has the ability to destroy planets.The main villain in this movie is Grand Moff Tarkin(Peter Cushing) who leads the Empire troops, and he is a great villain and a joy to watch. However, this movie features one of my all time favorite villain in Darth Vader. It could be argued that he didn't do too much in this movie, but he is definitely a show stealer. The man in a costume is David Prowse, but the man doing the Darth Vader's voice is James Earl Jones. Whether it is physical or voice acting, Vader has a menacing presence.There is also a smuggler Han Solo(Harrison Ford) who is born for his role and Ben Kenobi(Sir Alec Guiness) who actually didn't like this movie at all, but nevertheless put in a memorable performance. There are also two awesome droids: R2-D2 and C3PO which have a lot of comic relief and are a joy to watch. The cast is generally very likable and very good in what they are supposed to do.This movie is iconic. There are so much iconic things in it: The Death Star, Darth Vader, the Force(religion which is considered ancient in this movie), space battles and a greatest fictional weapon - the lightsaber. The movie is full of fun situations and every fan of adventure/space/sci-fi movies should watch it. It should be watched in it's unaltered version, because I feel Lucas's remastering only takes apart great elements from the movie, although it is still a great watch.Overall, Star Wars is one awesome movie, which has elements of adventure, sci-fi, epic, space and fantasy in it. It features a likable cast, simple yet interesting plot and a sense of exploring the galaxy,it has a great staying power, even on multiple viewings and it is impressive how it's sequel manages to be even better.May the Force be with you!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Wonderfully entertaining spectacle, an adventure for all ages","The science-fiction film of all time has to be ""Star Wars"". This epic space adventure continues to dazzle audiences even after sixteen years.The cast (including Carrie Fisher, Sir Alec Guiness and Peter Cushing) do a marvellous job amongst all the machinery and technical wizardry of George Lucas. Yet it probably has to be said that they are not only outshone by the technical special effects (still eye-popping even now) but also by the very funny antics of droids C-3PO and R2D2, who really steal the show.Its a movie that has something for everyone, including romance, adventure, action, chivalry and good versus evil. A great spectacle for the kids, and a marvellous adventure for all us adults. Wonderfully entertaining.Thursday, July 22, 1993 - Astor TheatreThe landmark sci-fi movie of all time, ""Star Wars"", remains the most amazing journey into the imagination of writer-director George Lucas.It's visual splendour and special effects genius still has a marked impact almost two decades on, as does the old fashioned story of home grown heroes up against dastardly villains in its dazzling futuristic setting.Sir Alec Guiness and Harrison Ford almost match the show stealing turns from C-3PO and R2D2, but not quite. While finally, John Williams magnificent score is a treat. A real must for the young at heart.Saturday, February 19, 1994 - VideoTwenty years on and the ""Star Wars"" trilogy is back, bigger and, some say, better than ever. For mine I'm not so sure. I have two schools of thought about ""Star Wars"" at the movies.a.) If you've already experienced the big screen adventure of the rebellion as they unite against Lord Vader's evil Galactic Empire and his awesome Death Star, then the new ""Special Edition"" may not have a great deal to offer you. Yes, Lucas and his whiz-bang team at I.L.M. have touched up the whole show, adding some new creatures and effects - most notably Han Solo's scene with Jabba the Hut - as well as digitally re-mastering the soundtrack. But often I got the feeling old George may have just been a little carried away, and sometimes he seems to be trying too hard to impress us. However, I guess if I was given the opportunity to digitally enhance my favourite baby after twenty years, I would be inclined to let things get out of hand too. Perhaps it's just me though, griping about changes to the original, even if very few things have changed. In short, if you've seen ""Star Wars"" at the flicks before, then you'll only be seeing it again. But I reckon that's a good enough reason.b.) If you've never seen ""Star Wars"", or only viewed it on video, then I would definitely recommend you go out right now, find a huge, loud, packed cinema and experience for yourself the groundbreaking science-fiction film which has been infinitely duplicated and whose special effects have only been surpassed in recent years by ""T2"" and ""Jurassic Park"".Sure there are some awful lines - the whole movie is targeted at kids folks (they'll love R2D2 and C3PO and so will you) - but for pure adventure, heroism and good versus evil, you can't go past ""Star Wars"".Saturday, April 5, 1997 - Hoyts Cinema Centre Melbourne",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The most overrated film of all-time (or even longer),"I saw this film around 1979. Once was enough, I couldn't bear to torture myself by seeing it again. Speaking for the silent majority I cannot understand how this mediocre film is rated at number 10 in the top 250. I wouldn't include it in the top 2,500 ! It just goes to show there's no accounting for taste ( or in this case lack of taste ). Was this film meant to be S.F, drama or comedy. The only redeeming feature in it's favour were the special effects. The plot (if there was one) was paper thin and the characters for the most part were totally unbelievable and shallow.

How Do You Review a Film Like Star Wars?,"How do you review George Lucas's ""Star Wars"" (1977)? A movie that has become so cherished by millions of fans that most critics disregard it, a movie that has inspired people to create a religion based on the force and a movie that has become so famous that it is regarded as weird not to have seen at least one out of the six films? How do you review it? One of the few ways to actually read balanced reviews of it is to look at what the critics said when it was originally released, thirty-two years ago. At the time, unlike now, where most ""serious"" movie critics treat it with contempt, they liked it. Roger Ebert called the film ""an out-of-body experience,"" and Vincent Canby called the film ""the movie that's going to entertain a lot of contemporary folk who have a soft spot for the virtually ritualized manners of comic-book adventure."" These reviews show us, that at the time, just about everybody (Pauline Kael, Jonathan Rosenbaum and Stanley Kauffmann excepted) agreed that ""Star Wars"" was a great film. These are the critics (unbiased) opinions before the days of ""Star Wars"" bashing became fashionable among the critical elite. And take it from me. Roger Ebert was right: It's an unbelievable experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The myth has a beginning,"'Star Wars: Episode IV - A new Hope'. The movie scores especially with its charm and atmosphere. You get the feeling that an incredible amount of time went into creating the worlds, the characters, the spaceships and everything around them.The technical realization is really outstandingly good, considering that this movie was made in the late 1970s. The effects are handmade and you can tell. If you look at the movie today, the ravages of time have gnawed at it in some places, but that doesn't bother at all.It's fun to watch the movie and accompany the characters on their adventures. For Luke, many things are new, as well as for the viewer. It's relatively easy to connect with him.Narratively, the wheel is not reinvented, it's a classic good versus evil story. The motive of the antagonists is simply more power. Why this goal is being pursued is not really clear. In addition, all the typical character traits are represented. The suspense arcs are rather short and why the Death Star can be destroyed so easily is also not clear. You have to accept that first.What struck me positively is the way the Force is introduced. The Force is simply thrown into the room as a reason for something in many places in the movie, but Obi-Wan explains relatively at the beginning what it has to do with the Force. This was solved much better than, for example, in Episode I, when Qui-Gon fails to explain the Force.Star Wars Episode IV managed to create a fascinating world despite a simple story and to draw the viewer in, thus forming the basis for the Star Wars myth.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A true masterpiece and far more than just plain nostalgia,"An undefined day in 1977 was to go down in the annals of Hollywood major 20th Century Fox. Director, author and producer George Lucas is about to launch his sci-fi spectacle ""Star Wars"".Once upon a time in a galaxy far, far away, a group of rebels resisted the brutal oppression of the universe's inhabitants by the Empire. The sinister Darth Vader leads the forces and is responsible for implementing General Tarkin's dark plans. The construction of the Death Star is intended to underpin the fighting power of the totalitarian government. Princess Leia, a high-ranking rebel leader, steals the construction plans of the gigantic battle station and stores them shortly before they are captured by imperial storm troops in her robot R2-D2, which can escape together with his partner C-3PO. The valuable data is passed into the hands of the old Jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi, who, with the help of his young student Luke Skywalker, sets off to stop the empire. The two charter the space ship of space pirate Han Solo to make contact with the rebel leaders. The Death Star must be destroyed...The story is simple, yet unique, universal and fascinating. The simple, archaic battle between good and evil takes center stage. The imaginative, action-packed scenery is supported by a vision of the future from the brain of mastermind George Lucas, who also wrote the script, thought through down to the last detail. Grandiose backdrops, breathtaking space battles, groundbreaking special effects and an exciting, straightforward story form the framework for this modern space epic. But all this wouldn't be worth half the price without the fascinating characters and figures that populate the screen. At this point Lucas probably makes the biggest contribution to the cult. The character of Black Lord Darth Vader, played uncompromisingly and ruthlessly by David Prowse, is still one of the greatest villains in film history. Lucas, however, offers positive identification figures in half a dozen. The most radiant is the young Luke Skywalker, who rises from an impetuous, inexperienced greenhorn to the great hope of the rebels. Mark Hamill perfectly embodies the hero's unspent nature and naive energy. The secret star of the movie and darling of many fans is Harrison Ford as the sly space pirate Han Solo. Then there is Carrie Fisher, who not only has to present the most spectacular and controversial hairstyle in the history of moving pictures, is well cast as brittle, but resolute and lovable Princess Leia. She can bring charisma and, in interaction with Harrison Ford, score points in the love story smouldering between the two and contribute a pinch of humour.While the words slowly sweep through the picture and the music of composer John Williams continues to swell, a warm feeling spreads in my chest, because ""Star Wars"" is far more than just nostalgia, or consumer-oriented mass-produced goods. In spite of the naivety and simplicity of the story, the films have nevertheless kidnapped entire generations into a distant galaxy... ""Star Wars"" has long been a myth. The life's work of George Lucas is one of the most popular and successful works in film history and this work influenced me like no other, it formed heroes of my childhood, which I never got tired of. Let's go to a better time together at the speed of light. A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far away...Kolja Finger",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Regardless of how many people love this, here's a few critiques...","Who doesn't know about this movie yet?I bet you could ask a person on the street and he'd know what you're talking about.Dated. The movie is dated! The special effects were superior at the time but now it's no different than your modern Hollywood mass-produced Sci-Fi epic. The dialogue stinks, and the characters are not very memorable (or someone you could relate to). If you grew up in the 70s the fondness of this movie is perfectly understandable. I went to a convention one time and the foot traffic majority consisted of either 30-40 year olds or kids under 10.This film is also uninspired. Many may not know this, but George Lucas originally got the idea from ""The Hidden Fortress,"" a Japanese film written and directed by the famous Akira Kurosawa. If ""Star Wars"" was never made, ""Fortress"" would of been up there in noticeability with Citizen Kane and Casablanca. Essentially, this movie is just an early example of Hollywood's theft of original works of art.I'll take a cue from all the Star Wars fanatics out there and say this movie is a ""fun kitsch,"" maybe something you could see every two or three years, but as a worshipped icon, give me a BREAK!!!!!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not a great film,"Most notable for its influence for the worse on Hollywood film-making ever after its release; the reliance on spectacle, excess action and noise, Star Wars is actually a reasonably good film. Set design, costume design and the like are superb; as of course are the effects, but it all rings a little hollow to me; maybe The Empire Strikes Back will prove a more satisfying film. The actors try their best, but the script isn't really centred around the creation of layered characters, although each of the main characters is defined well two-dimensionally. The only actor of truly great calibre in the film is Alec Guinness, wonderful in so many British films in the 1940s and 1950s, particularly ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" in which he plays 8 parts and ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"". Guinness is good, but simply not given the scope to show his talents to the full. Harrison Ford as Han Solo is reasonable, as is Carrie Fisher in an underwritten role as Princess Leia. Peter Cushing is forgettable, overshadowed by Prowse/Earl Jones as Vader. The music is quite impressive. The film could have done with some better comedic touches; and with Alec Guinness this shouldn't have been difficult; that's a problem: Obi-Wan needed to be a more varied, ambiguous figure, in my view. While it should be mentioned this is a pretty wonderful film for children, it only rates as pretty good escapism otherwise. Rating:- *** 1/2/*****",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Pfff, Star Wars just isn't the picture of my time, but I still praise it.","We all know Star Wars and we all know that it is the worldwide famous sf space film made by the legendary director George Lucas in 1977, which revolutionized the possibilities of filmmaking in cinema forever. However, nearly 40 years have now passed since this movie first made a cinematic revolution around the world, and now, better cinematic elements than Star Wars are coming to the big screen and that's just the reason why I don't like Star Wars. It's not even the film of my time in the first place and I was born just around the time when cinema started making further advancements in filmmaking, so it is obvious and logical why I don't like Star Wars. I found the film completely boring and uninteresting, however I do understand the reason why people loved this film BACK THEN. The only things I liked about this movie is the fact that the movie takes place in a galaxy far, far away, which is obviously an original setting for a sf movie, the technically imaginative Death Star, the well chosen cast, Harrison Ford's intriguing character, the Darth Vader costume and mask, the arrival of the light sabers, the plot and the movie's mythology. My rating for the movie: 6.0/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I've rated this higher having just gone through the prequels,"I can't work out why I originally gave this a 6/10 - may have been in a bad mood or something.Watching this again right after all the prequel movie's actually made me appreciate some of those inputs a great deal more, in light of specific elements of backstory made reference to in this movie. Not a whole lot of retconning going on actually, in the newer movies, in reflection upon re-watching this one.Following a much darker period in the prequels, this does seem a little on the light side, though there are moments of comedy in the prequel elements. It does actually hold up remarkably well, even all the visual effects. I watched the somewhat post-prequel updated or specialized version, rather than the original or de specialized edition, and aside from a couple of slightly shoddy new effects, and old ones, it's remarkably good. I do wish that the prequel's had been a little lighter, especially in the recent Obi Wan series, with Obi Wan's character, given he's not a particularly serious individual in this movie - rather relaxed in my estimation. The only real misgiving I have about this movie comes from a particular light saber battle, which I do wonder if the prequels lent themselves towards undermining, inadvertently, given they're better equipped to pull those related visuals off.Anyway, this is fun, well written, well acted, looks great (despite being quite an old sci-fi movie), and in my estimation would potentially even hold up with consideration to younger audiences that may inevitably drift into this in the wake of the prequels, other series pieces, and more recent franchise sequels.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Everyone had seen it.  when I went, the theater was packed.  what was all the fuss about? the moving was boring, there was nothing that caught my eye, except the picture was really neat.  big rocket ships and lasers.  wow!!!  who cares? the part that most turned me off the movie was the ugly little high tech oompa loompas.  and the scary looking hairy creatures.  even when i was 9 i could recognize a horrible script.  i curled up on the floor outside and took a nap.  my parents were watching ""close encounters,"" and my sisters were watching ""star wars,"" I wish I went with my parents.  star wars sucked, and I have never even bothered with any of the tired sequels.  watch this movie, everyone says it is awesome, but never ask me to go with you, nor tell me about this piece of crap.  the only positive part was seeing carrie fisher.  I had a crush on her.  I am now going back to never thinking about this Lucas crap again.  I sure envy that guy, making a fortune off all you bourgeois, mindless adolescents.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Well Made, Entertaining Adventure,  but not a Classic","I have a confession to make. Although I consider myself a film buff, I had never seen ""Star Wars"" until recently, even though in Britain, it is regularly voted the greatest film of all time. To call it a cult movie would be an understatement; it seems less like a cult than a full-blown mainstream religion. (That is not necessarily a figure of speech. In the 2001 British census nearly 400,000 people, when asked to state their religion, replied ""Jedi"", a greater figure than the totals for several well-known denominations).I have finally overcome this gap in my filmic knowledge and have seen the film which has caused so much excitement. In essence it is a simple science-fiction adventure story, set in a galactic empire ruled by a despotic government which is being challenged by a popular resistance movement. The government forces have captured Princess Leia, a rebel leader, and a motley group are attempting to rescue her. These include a farm boy named Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, a survivor of the Jedi (a once-powerful brotherhood of warriors sworn to uphold good against evil), Han Solo, a cynical and mercenary space pilot, Chewbacca, an abominable snowman-type monster and two robots. One of these talks in an old-fashioned upper-class British accent, the other only in a series of squeaks and whistles. The government are also attempting to destroy the planet that serves as their base using a ""death star"" that can destroy whole planets.The only episode of the ""Star Wars"" franchise I had previously seen was ""The Phantom Menace"" which struck me as a high-tech version of those old space invader games, distinguished mainly by its wooden and lifeless acting. I initially wondered whether the original ""Star Wars"" would be more of the same, with clunking seventies special effects in place of more advanced nineties ones. I thought that seldom can such an influential and well-known film have used so many obscure actors in leading roles. Were it not for this film and its two sequels, neither of the two leads, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, would be household names outside their own households. The main villain Darth Vader was played by an actor best known in his native Britain as the ""Green Cross Man"" in a series of children's road-safety commercials.The film improves with the entry of Alec Guinness, possibly Britain's greatest ever screen actor, and a man who probably could not have given a wooden performance even if he had wanted to. His Kenobi is not only wise, noble and authoritative but also kindly and amiable. He can make us believe not only in the Jedi Knights but also in their belief system, centred upon a mysterious ""Force"" that permeates the universe. In other hands this ""Force"", which the Jedi draw upon for their powers, might have seemed mystical nonsense (as indeed it does in ""The Phantom Menace""); with Guinness as our guide it seems quite plausible. There are also good performances from Peter Cushing as another leader of the villains and from the young Harrison Ford as Solo.One of the reasons for the film's popularity is the way it draws upon other film traditions for its source material. One much quoted is the Japanese samurai film, with the Jedi as the samurai and belief in the Force as the equivalent of Zen Buddhism. I also detected another Oriental influence, the Chinese martial arts movie. Such films often glorify rebellion against a repressive government and frequently also feature religiously-inspired brotherhoods of warriors such as the Shaolin monks. In ""The Phantom Menace"" Obi-Wan's teacher is named Qui-Gon Jinn, a name probably chosen for its vaguely Chinese sound, just as the name Obi-Wan Kenobi was designed to sound Japanese. There are also elements of the Western (particularly the character of Solo and in the scenes set in the spaceport) and of the Robin Hood type of mediaeval adventure. One might have thought in that a society which had developed the means to destroy planets from a distance of thousands of miles hand-to-hand combat would be an irrelevance, but Kenobi and Vader fight a duel with close combat weapons known as ""light sabres"".The most obvious influence on ""Star Wars"" is, as its title might suggest, the war film. The patriotic war film had gone into a decline in the post-Vietnam late seventies, but there was clearly still a demand for films that could stir similar emotions. Much about the villains is reminiscent of the Nazis- not just their ruthlessness, but also their black uniforms and the description of their crack troops as ""storm troopers"". Even Vader's helmet recalls the German ""coal scuttle"". The later part of the film, where brave and idealistic young rebel pilots try to destroy the death star before it can destroy their planet, is strongly reminiscent of British films about the RAF, such as ""The Battle of Britain"", ""633 Squadron"" and ""The Dambusters"", with spacecraft taking the place of aircraft. Another touch of Anglophilia might be seen in the fact that, although the rebels are nominally fighting for ""the Republic"", their leader is a Princess. Over the next few years, the film's vocabulary entered the real-life Cold War, with President Reagan denouncing the Soviet Union as the ""Evil Empire"" and his own Strategic Defence Initiative becoming known as the Star Wars project.I would not claim ""Star Wars"" as my own favourite film, and I cannot see that it could serve as the basis for a new religion. (I doubt if anyone ever intended it to). It is, however, a well-made and entertaining adventure story. Prior to 1977, science fiction films, although there were exceptions, were often embarrassingly bad. We remember tenth-rate examples such as ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"" with a sort of amused contempt, but there were also plenty of eighth and ninth-rate examples, now largely forgotten. If it achieved nothing else, ""Star Wars""; at least rescued the genre from that sort of association. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Not as good as you first thought,"Now I'm not saying I don't like Star Wars. It's a great series of films. But Episode IV: A New Hope falls disappointingly short in retrospect.when in first came out in was the pinnacle of special effects, and everyone was amazed. But as someone who wasn't alive in 77, it is quite easy to see it's shortcomings.The plot is very basic. Seeing this film for the first time in 3 years i was surprised at how short it was. And simplistic too. Not very much depth or character development. With the exception of Alec Guiness and James Earl Jones, the acting is pretty poor two.The special effects were good for their day, but I still find that clash between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader painful. It is a bit ridiculous now with all the lightsaber twirling in the prequels, but they weren't even trying. Just standing rigid and lightly bashing their swords together.That said this is the one that launched so many other great films, and introduced great characters like Darth and Han Solo, and has to receive credit. A phenomenal achievement in cinema, but it's clear Lucas's skill needed a little more polish.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I first saw this film in 2002, when I was 5 years old. I will never forget that day as long as I live. This is my 2nd favorite film of all time.

Legend!,"Star Wars is the stuff of legends, mainly because it finds its inspiration in countless folk legends and archetypes, but also because it became the inspiration of an era. It was probably the first ever cinematic cult phenomenon and one can measure its power by the sway it still holds 27 years after its release.The story couldn't be simpler frankly so do dwell on this detail would be to miss the point entirely. The backdrop is the main character of the film and it is nothing short of miraculous! The alien vistas and locals while otherworldly have a worn look that makes them unbelievably real (unlike the often fake-looking CGI of the prequels). The technology looks real. This authentic look gives the action scenes a power almost transcendental. It surpasses anything we've ever seen because despite it's otherworldlyness it all works. So the world Lucas creates more than makes up for the bland characterizations (these are only archetypes after all so don't expect too much depth, that's a advantage Empire Strikes Back has over the entire saga) and acting, although veterans Alec Guiness, Peter Cushing and James Earl Jones give this more dignity and weight and there's a very welcome cynical ""this can't be real"" look from Ford that means the film doesn't take itself all too seriously (something lacking in the prequels).This vision of fantasy has it's flaws but it still solidly deserves cult status for it's gargantuan strengths: a legendary score by John Williams, era-defining special effects, a mythology and fantasy that rival anything ever imagined by a film-maker, great action and a pure naive heart that makes it impossible to resist and is seriously lacking in today's blockbusters.Star Wars is more than a film: it is in itself a reason to love movies. It is a testimonial to man's imaginative powers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best Film Ever Made.,"Star Wars is absolute genius.The characters, scenery, action, pacing, and rich mythological symbolism combine to create a story so compelling that few are not swept away.  I saw Star Wars when I was seven years old, and have seen it at least once a year since then.  (Some years many, many, more times than that, but lets not get started.)One of the things that is so brilliant about this movie is that it works on every conceivable level.  At seven, I didn't even fully understand the plot, but was still in awe.  At seventeen I began to understand the movie on a deeper level.  At 23 I had read ""The Hero with 1000 faces by Joseph Campbell, and I understood that Star Wars was nothing less than the ""Proto-Cultutral Myth.""  Star wars is the communal dream made glorious reality by the genius of its creator, George Lucas.Today, as a writer, I am constantly awed buy this film.  The way the plot subtly hooks the audience in from the very first instant is undeniable. The way the film makes the audience care about characters within minutes of their introduction should be studied by every future writer.Star Wars is the Prolegomena to any Future Film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"A legend begins. A legend that's not all it cracks up to be. Good, but definitely over rated.","Hmm. This is the sort of movie that often comes in at number one on people's all time favourites list. I pointed this out to some friends and no one I know actually think it's remotely deserving of such an accolade. All I can think is that people place it at number one out of some bizarre automatic response (what was that number 1 movie last time? Yeah, that's my favourite movie), or that it's so famous that it crops up somewhere on a lot of people's lists. It's certainly a well done, enjoyable movie, but it's equally certainly not the greatest movie ever.Plot? Should I even bother? You've all seen it. Teenager boy saves the day (without saying `Whoopee!'). Space ships and gun battles. There's obviously some back history written here, and the story moves briskly along with all the depth of a pulp 20c science fiction novel. Indeed it's science fiction in the lightest of terms, merely using the future elements of ships, and light sabres, as a setting rather than making any conjecture about the future or the applications of science (as more hardcore science fiction tends to do). It's been described as a Western in space, and that's a fair sentiment. What's here is a very good action/adventure story, a family-fun affair. Its pace isn't quite as fast as you might expect, but the story/character building elements in between the fighting are generally okay.The characters here are pretty shallow. There's Spunky Girl. There's Farm Boy. There's Old Wise Man. Mark Hamill can't really act his way out of a soaked paper bag, but the acting isn't all that important here. However many people excuse the weak characters as Lucas' homage to old serials - that does not wash, and is no excuse for some wooden faced performances, and hammed delivery. Fortunately the failings of some are alleviated by the likes of Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan and Harrison Ford's debut as Han Solo.Lucas' directing varies a lot. At times it appears quite pedestrian - plonking the camera down and not doing much with a scene. However when it comes to orchestrating the action sequences, in particular the finale, his handling improves immensely. There's also a definite passion running through this piece, a sense of belief in the project. The actors, for all their skill, put their energy into the performances, giving it a needed sense of `fun'. It's all helped by some great technical elements - a fantastic score by John Williams, some great costumes, and SFX which hold up better than the jarring inserts Lucas' added in 1997. It's a polished product overall.`Star Wars' is a good action/adventure flick. It's generally exciting, andhas a nice sense of scope and large events. It's not exactly cerebral material, and tends to be slightly flimsy while some elements leave a lot to be desired. It's fun though, and entertaining, even if it created a media behemoth. Why it's ranked as #1 by so many people is beyond me as there are better sci-fi movies, better action/adventure movies, and better epic movies. Still, I think it deserves a 8/10, and I'd recommend it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A great movie.,"I wouldn't say it's THE great movie, but it's the best sci-fi out there.When I first saw this on the big screen, it was shocking. Just a jolt offun after a decade of heavy handed social dramas that were good(serpico) but hardly whiz bang!  Star Wars is a swashbuckling sword epicthat had the audience cheering and yelling, like a ride at Disneyland.Say what you will for how it affected the Box Office and how studioheads now look at summer films- it most likely ruined it for all of usfor a long time, as now they all want HUGE OPENING NUMBERS and saddle uswith bloated ""blockbusters"" such as PEARL HARBOR, but Star Wars had/hasa spirit and a life to it that is wonderful to behold.

The film that invented hype as we know it,"This film with its campaign of spin-off toys, T-shirts, mugs etc created hype as we know it and set the pattern for the hype surrounding Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles and He-Man. No wonder Mel Brooks spoofed it in Spaceballs (""Spaceballs, the flame thrower""!) It's one of the most overrated films ever made. It came top in Channel 4's list of the 100 greatest films but frankly Star Wars coming top in that poll and The Godfather coming No2 is a bit like Joe Dolce's Shaddapayourface beating Ultravox's Vienna to No1 in the UK music charts in 1981. It is not that great a film and the people who let it take over their lives and boast about having seen it tens of thousands of times are very sad. As Carrie Fisher says ""It's a great movie, but get a life"". George Lucas said he was wanting to recreate the spirit of the old Flash Gordon serials and he did to a degree succeed. Looking at it now, it looks as dated as Flash Gordon. The art deco spaceships in Flash Gordon exude the air of the 1930s and there are some hairstyles and clothes in this film that are very reminiscent of the awful fashions of the 1970s.The scene where Luke and Han Solo are shooting at the enemy spaceships has the look of a 1970s arcade game. Like Flash Gordon a lot of the dialogue is very corny (in fact it dismayed Harrison Ford when he read the script). The cheesiest line has to be when Luke Skywalker sees the hologram of Princess Leia and says ""Who is she? She's beautiful."".It is so overpoweringly cheesy it is like having your nose shoved in Stilton. OK, there's no denying Carrie Fisher is a very nice looking woman but ""beautiful"" is a bit extreme. Mind you I think if the film was being made nowadays Luke would say ""Who is she? She's hot"". Sir Alec Guinness didn't like this film either despite receiving a sizeable chunk of the profits. He would discard any fan letters he received that made mention of Star Wars. There must have been lorryloads of discarded letters leaving his house every day when the film first came out1",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Legend begins,"I wasn't born when this movie was released for the first time in theaters. I heard many things about it especially how this movie was so badly received by the most acclaimed critics of that time and predicted very wrongly that this movie will be a bust.Well nearly 4 decades later, yes already, force is to admit that it was a true misjudgment from them. It is a classic and it will remain a model for the genre, the movie which revolutionized everything from A to Z. It is one of my favorite movies of all time. I watched it time and time again with the same delight and it never fades away.There are so many to tell about that absolute masterpiece starting with the story. It has anything to please everyone. It's epic, chivalrous, has some dose of humor and first of all a story about friendship and how it pushes to make the most impossible tasks accomplished. There is also that epic aspect of the struggle between good and evil so beautifully depicted.Many of its scenes are also classics like the space battle against the Death Star, the light saber duel between Obi-Wan and Darth Vader or even the final scene of the movie when Luke, Chewbacca and Han are awarded for their heroic moves which saved countless lives.I can talk also about the characters who are as famous as the movie itself. Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia Organa, Darth Vader, CP-3O and R2D2 are part of the legend of the 7th art. It has become part of our culture, anywhere in the world.Then you have the music by John Williams which matches perfectly the mood of the movie. It's epic a lot of time, very sad when Obi Wan dies and the rest of the team is mourning his loss. The music is a big part of the effect the movie procures to us, to keep us engaged until the very end.The cast is also superb and there is such a strong bond between the actors which reflects a lot on the movie. At the time they weren't known but I guess there is a before and after Star Wars for Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher. Now they have become such recognizable figures and I was very pleased to see them back together in the last installment of the saga even if it wasn't as good as I expected. Their performance were still very accurate like they were owned by their respective characters. How I wish it would have been the same for the rest of the cast.So this movie is how the Legend begins. How a movie supposed to crash became the starting point of a love story of almost 4 decades with the public.

"A film easy to understand, flexible, modern and pleasing as transports us to a fantasy world and engaging in the midst of the Civil War","Long ago, in a galaxy far, far away ... This is the first line of one of the most profitable routes and revolutionary in the history of cinema.1977. A year that certainly was marked in the history of world cinema when the young filmmaker George Lucas conceived of intergalactic adventure that won a legion of fans worldwide. Earlier, the director had to his credit a few short films and a documentary series. It was there that appeared good THX 1138 (1971) and the successful comedy American Graffiti (1973) he wrote with Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck, and had in its main cast Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard (future director of blockbusters) and Paul Le Mat Both projects, especially the second, had critical success and audience, drawing the attention of Fox, which has a budget of $ 8 million dollars (much for the time), decided to fund its ambitious project, Star Wars. Mainly because of discrediting a story that talked about space, and because the director did not want to pay, taking only the merchandising rights over their work and complete freedom of creation, the project went ahead. In fact, Lucas knew what he had on hand was special and had a good chance of achieving success. And that was precisely what happened. That earned him enough money to open his own film companies. Among them is the ILM (Industrial Light & Magic), the company that revolutionized the industry with high quality special effects and technology itself.The theme of space had been treated before but with totally different approach. For example, in master Stanley Kubrick's2001: A Space Odyssey addressed other aspects more scientific, realistic and questioning, resulting in an art film, cerebral and striking, that Kubrick could almost anticipate and create your vision of the planet Earth space even before the man reach the moon years later. However, nothing can compare to the universe of action / adventure / drama and above all, fun created by Lucas. There was a movie questing, just a great entertainment with a fantastic ambiance and unlike anything that had been seen before in cinema. This pattern of creation was so innovative and impactful that several filmmakers followed the concept in their future science fiction works such as Ridley Scott, avowed fan of Star Wars, had used in his upcoming films: Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982). With Star Wasappeared a concept hitherto non-existent: the film ""blockbuster"" or ""blockbusters"", made with big budgets and they had the power to generate big box office. The studios come out and profiting course, viewers from around the world getting impressed every revolution effects. The movie changed the rules of Hollywood, bringing special effects to a level never seen before and made the studios would give more importance to young people in the cinema.Lucas conceived the plot into six parts, but saw that in 1977 would not have the technology needed to bring the first parts of the plot to the big screen. So decided to start telling the plot for the last film, with the intention of producing the first chapters of the saga years later, so they knew that the technology would be able to give all the support necessary for the completion of his dream. With the film's success and guarantee the realization of upcoming films, the first ""Star Wars"" won the subtitle ""A New Hope"" in 1981, when it was reissued.Filming took place in the Sahara desert in Tunisia for the scenes on the planet Tattoine. After that the filming went to London, where the scenes of the Death Star and the spacecraft was built. Meanwhile, in the United States, Industrial Light & Magic, a company founded by Luke, began preparing the models, miniatures and equipment to create special effects. After production problems and find the first cut and disastrous effects, Lucas took control of ILM technicians to show what he wanted in terms of action and speed to the space battle scenes. After adjustments, the Fox executives saw the movie could actually revolutionize the cinema.It's a Civil War period. The Imperial Forces -- under orders from cruel Darth Vader (David Prowse) hold Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) hostage, in their efforts to quell the rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford), captain of the Millennium Falcon, work together with the companionable droid duo R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) to rescue the beautiful princess, help the Rebel Alliance, and restore freedom and justice to the Galaxy.What strikes us most is the ambiance of Star Wars, now in cities, now in desert planets, and also the most diverse beings. Some monsters are legitimate, others are humanoids. All live on their planets and often appear in the same place as the bar scene where Luke and Obi-Wan/Ben go after Han Solo and Chewbacca. We also see the common presence of droids. All that is emerging on the screen and think normally. The identification and recognition with that new universe is the main factor that makes the film so be admired today.The script shows the sources of inspiration for George Lucas, with each character from ""Star Wars"" can be easily identified with one or more archetypes several references, as in science fiction and ancient mythology. The characters are also very different and very charismatic, playing key roles in the plot. Mark Hamill, who had interests in the curriculum only series and TV movies, proved very charismatic and able to hold the weight of leading a blockbuster with much skill. With his white robe, is the juxtaposition of the black costume Drath Vader. The hero is shown as innocent at first, but with a spirit always argumentative, impulsive and personality, leaving her very interesting development. Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia, is a heroine who needs to be rescued, but beyond beauty, also shows with great personality and courage, captivating the audience. Harrison Ford as Han Solo, perhaps the most interesting character, because it has an own code of ethics and morals, as well as being selfish and conceited. However, late in the film where Solo leaves aside the design we created him a ""mercenary who only cares about money."" Even the phrase ""do not let you (Luke) get all the glory to himself"") still meets with the previous events shown throughout the film. Alec Guinness will also very much like the hermit sage. Anthony Daniels as C -3PO and Kenny Baker as R2-D2 are also super good and has a fundamental role in the plot, and the great comic relief in the midst of a war scenario. Darth Vader proved a villain really awful and striking, being crucial for feel a real threat. The characterization of Darth Vader is perfect with the costume completely black, combined with a firm and menacing voice of James Earl Jones and ending with his lightsaber red as opposed to blue saber heroes.The art direction and photography are crucial in building the world we see on screen. Photograph of Gilbert Taylor highlights colors lifeless on the planet Tatooine, giving a visual arid, which reflects the characteristic of that planet while hard life of those people constantly threatened by the empire. When the action takes place on the ship of Darth Vader, the grim picture, highlights the dark colors, which represent evil. Allied with the art direction needs to Leslie Dilley and Norman Reynolds, the scenes in space denote advanced technology scenarios in models made precisely, making it easier for the special effects team working. In one scene, when Luke and Kenobi arrive in town to negotiate with Han the use of a ship, the general plan of Luke highlights the fine work of art direction, which creates a different village, full of detail in each of its buildings. If today, some may say that the effects are exceeded, for the time was a real revolution. Fact is that the effects are impressive even today. All this careful visual appearance is impressive, from the many creatures like Jabba dangerous) to the stately ships that cut at high speed chase sequences and fights in space, marking some of the great moments of the film. Be done without major technologies, the talent and creativity of professional values the work. The art direction, the costumes and special effects were deservedly Oscar-winning.Sound also plays a key role in the strength of Star Wars. The sound effects in the fights with the lightsabers, the sound of the ships moving in space, the sounds of the robotic droids, are essential to the progress of the plot, combined with the spectacular soundtrack John Williams. Unforgettable is even a track, especially the part of the signs going up on the screen into space. No wonder that both the sound, the sound effects and soundtrack have won the Oscar for his work.The editors Richard Chew, Paul Hirsch and Marcia Lucas can also print speed all the time and not let the pace drop. The assembly also uses often fade and transition of images that overlap on the screen, giving an air of purposeful episodic narrative. A major problem of A New Hope is its closed end. Lucas Meso having a story to six chapters, it was not certain of the success of this first feature. If no other film was produced later this would have to be closed, with a beginning, middle and end. With a little slip at the end where the events seem a bit quick to quickly finalize the story, the plot is easy to understand, flexible, modern and pleasing as transports us to a fantasy world and engaging in the midst of the Civil War. A film that revolutionized and won millions of fans around the world, leaving us with very high expectations, fully rewarded with the great ""The Empire Strikes Back"" released three years later.""May the Force be with you""",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The day the world changed forever!,"A low budget sci-fi popcorn flick that changed movies and Hollywood forever!I don't know where to start with this film as it changed the world. We had had some SFX in old fantasy films like Sinbad or Jason and the argonauts or space oddessy 2001 but when I sat down I the cinema for the fist time nothing could prepare me for what was about to happen!The opening sequence where the camera pans down to the planet followed by the rebel ship and then the star destroyer flying over your head. No one had seen or imagined anything like this was possible let alone watching it right before their eyes! And it kept on getting better!it was like having a black &a white TV and then suddenly walking into a 3D IMAX! You couldn't comprehend what was actually happening.There is often a debate about the greatest movie of all time. Some say Citizen Kane or Shawshank to name a few but for me it's Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back.The score is ahead of its time. To be honest nothing has ever come close. It makes a massive impact on all 3 original films.Let's review it by breaking it down:Story - classic story which had stood the test of time Special Effect - absolutely amazing Set design - original, faultless and imaginative Musical score - absolute classic Pace of the film - spot onWhen I first saw this film I was blown away! I had never seen anything like it and come to think of it I really have. for me it's an all time classic that changed the movie industry for ever.If you're sitting at home reading this, rake it out and watch it now. It will put a smile on your face and that's what it's all about.For those who haven't given this a 10 I can't understand it.The movie that is the definition of 'a movie'",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I must have missed something,"I was 10 years old when Star Wars was released. I had the merchandise (pen, ruler, lunchbox, frisbee), I was smack in the middle of the target audience, all of my mates loved it. So why does this film leave me cold? I want to like it, honestly. It should be a defining movie moment for someone of my age - the film that held an entire generation in spellbound rapture.I think I can answer my own question by referring to the opening titles of the film. The fact that this took place 'In a galaxy far, far away' made it unreal and something to which I will always fail to relate. That is probably why I consider Close Encounters a better way to spend two-and-a-bit hours of my life.And another thing, why does this feature in the top 5 of so many 'all time' lists? I can name more than five better movies made in the 70's alone.If you've never seen Stars Wars take my advice - if you want sci-fi try Blade Runner; if you want adventure try Raiders of the Lost Ark; if you want humour and a bit of romance try Aladdin.Just say no kids.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A different view on the ""great"" Star Wars","August 22, 2002. That's today. That's the day I first saw Star Wars. I have one reason for seeing it: I am a film major and before I start this semester I figured I had to see a movie with such historical value. Plus, so many people have put it over as being the best movie of all time. I never had interest in the sci-fi genre, but I figured if it was good, I'd like it.Nope. Sorry. Now, I only fell asleep once, and just for a few seconds. I quickly woke up, rewinded, and decided it's best to stay awake. After all, it's the last time I'll watch the movie.I understand completely the historical value this movie has. 25 years ago this film was groundbreaking. The effects were pretty good, even by today's standards. But the movie itself is not very good. It's just average. The plot wasn't very interesting. I was given no reason to care about Luke Skywalker whatsoever. And all I kept thinking throughout the whole thing was ""Wow, I never realized how much Independence Day took from Star Wars... but that movie did it so much better!""I expect a ton of Star Wars nerds to send me hate mail for not totally digging this ""Great"" movie. WAKE UP people. There's so many better movies out there.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A lack lustre action movie that will not stand the test of time....,"In 1977 when audiences flocked to see this film i can only imagine how great they thought it was, a spectacle of visual astonishment, a mythical world full of wondrous creatures, but let me just say this, the story telling was awful, the acting was less than desirable, the screenplay was embarrassing and the plot contained more clichés than troy...but all of these points where overwhelmed at the time from its outstanding visuals. When looking at this film from a non judgemental perspective, at this time, this film holds many faults that make it highly predictable and at times slow paced. Every star wars fan has highlighted all of these points but are unable to expect, the feeling they got in 1977 does not allow them to..The movie going public and critiques alike are all aware that this is most definitely not the best film of all time but undoubtedly the most influential. When it comes to great acting, screenplay, and story telling, revenge of the sith is superior to its predecessors. Lord of the rings for example is a film, like Ben hur, schindlers list, pulp fiction and the godfather that will last the test of time for its outright stunning ability to encapsulate the hearts of its audience and portray a side to life that provokes us to rethink the way we act. Star wars : a new hope is very weak but is not an awful film, disappointing i may say. And in 100 years time lord of the rings, pulp fiction, schindlers list and even titanic will be remembered and re watched, star wars will have died into a non existence...........",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Ok but certainly not a ""classic""","Star Wars is no better than many of the rest of the sci-fi films that appeared late 70's - mid 80's. The one thing it does have above the others is FANTASTIC special effects and production values - in this sense it was kind of ground breaking for a sci-fi film (though nearly 10 years earlier 2001 was doing much the same).What Star Wars DID do was start the story line for some of the best sci-fi films, and certainly the best sci-fi story line EVER. Without doubt its sequel (Empire) IS one of the best sci-fi films ever - multi-layered and dark story line, fantastic characters and a script that is a cut above the ""boys own"" story that star-wars had.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
very well done for its time,"I really enjoyed this movie a lot. I am extremely impressed by special effects especially for its time (1977). I find it way betterthan the new ones(1,2,3).

Is there anything that hasn't been said about this movie?,"Being born 19 years after this movie was released, I never got a chance to see it in theaters. I was even too young to see the re- releases in 1997. My father first exposed me to these movies when I was about 5 years old, when I couldn't quite grasp just how big these movies were and how much of an impact they had on American, and even world culture. Back in 1977, the world was hurting. It couldn't tell the difference between tyrants and leaders in politics, and villains and heroes both on and off the screen. Star Wars changed that. Whether you think it's overrated or the best movie ever, it would be foolish to say that this movie didn't change anything, be it Hollywood, our perception of leaders, or even our perception of ourselves. This movie, and it's subsequent saga, is, likely, the single most talked about movie in history. If you don't like it, you've at least seen it. If you haven't seen it, you've no doubt at least heard about it. That being said, that means that just about everything has been said about Star Wars. It's great, it's bad, it's overrated, the acting isn't exactly on point, the effects are breathtaking, it's corny, it's nerdy, it's geeky, it's a phenomenon, it's just plain good, everything has been mentioned. So why am I writing this review? Because that means I get to contribute to the story. The story of Star Wars goes far beyond its own universe. We are part of it. The fans, the haters, George Lucas, me, you reading this, now, we're all part of the story of Star Wars. This review may get lost among the thousands and thousands of others, but I still get to contribute to the preservation of this story. The more we talk about it, the longer it'll stay in memory, and the longer it'll exist. When the movies are finished, possibly forever, the story will still live on for future generations to enjoy.

A landmark of the cinema-history,"In honor of May,the official Star Wars month, I will review all the Star Wars movies in chronological order. Now lets start with the New Hope: It opened on May 1977 and after that the world as a whole changed big time. This movie is even studied as the archetype of the hero journey and made the words like ,lightsabers, the Force, Jedi and names like Lya ,Luke , Han Solo and of course Darth Vader known world wide.Every science fiction flick or TV series after 1977 is in, one way or an order, a child ,godchild or imitator of Star Wars. From Guardians of the Galaxy to Rick and Morty and almost anything in between. The impact can be seen in movies or series from totally different genres, for instance due to its success studios decided to invest in the superhero stories that inspire George Lucas to create this unforgettable saga and from that it came Richard Donner's Superman ,Tim Burton's Batman and the 1992 X-men series and Batman the animated series ,which are the fathers (spoilers) of the superhero genre ,which now dominates Hollywood. In simple ,no Star Wars, no Superheroes!! If you have not watch it ,I feel sorry for you and go do it now!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Overrated classic,"To fend off any instant murder threats let me begin with the fact that I do acknowledge Star Wars importance in the history of movies, it was a milestone and forever changed our movie experience. It is today a classic connected with fond memories for a lot of people.However I grade movies compared to current movies, that's the way I do it and to be frank, Star Wars (IV, V and VI) does not deliver comparably in this day and age. I am not a Star Wars fan, nor am I a Star Trek fan, but I do love a good science fiction movie or series.That special effects, sound and visual quality are not any longer top notch, despite several brush ups and remixes, well that's just the way it goes with movies that age. It is fully natural, although I must say that for a movie that's soon 30 years old it is not as bad as you would expect. On the other hand that's the remixed and re brushed editions I'm talking about, the ones out on DVD. These drawbacks is however far from my main concern and definitely not why I consider the original Star Wars trilogy to be overrated. No, the main problem as I see it is what they _could_ have done when they actually created these movies. Acting, directing and dialogue.Acting and directing is definitely sub-par, to say the least, and I find myself sighing through most of the scenes. Dialogue is just as bad and definitely does not help the situation, to be blunt it is usually downright idiotic and dumb. And this combined, well they make the characters appear to have an IQ lower than their shoe number, at least with the exception of Chewbacca. I just cannot help myself from getting the feeling that I'm watching a really cheesy budget Hollywood production. The type you realise in less than a year, the type that goes straight to video.That being said, Star Wars is a great adventure, it has a fairly good story overall and some ship designs that I'm really fond of. Something I would love to hear is a remake being in the works, let's hope Lucas is as money hungry some keeps saying.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Galaxy stuck in the 70's,"Clearly there are movies that define their eras.  Star Wars, is a 70's movie, that relates well to other time periods, while at the same time losing meaning as time goes by.  it doesn't help that George Lucas has decided to ruin the meaning of his film, by adding the first three chapters --- which take the mystery away from BOOK 4 and takes away from the joy of the subsequent films.I never understood the great hoopla behind this film.  I first saw it in college, but I felt, that although okay, it was not great science fiction. and although I do appreciate that the film was the ""thing to do"" in 1977, I don't think it held any special meaning to me in 1996.Great Science Fiction fascinates, it asks unanswerable questions. This is not Science Fiction, it is Fantasy, and as a Fantasy piece, it has been replaced by The Lord of the Rings as the best Fantasy movie series out there.  I'm sure The Lord of the Rings will be seen as a turn of the 21st Century film, that clearly only speaks to that era --- but that's the way it is.  Star Wars is a great movie.

It Was Just Called Star Wars...,"...when it came out a long, long time ago in a place far, far away. I stood in line to see it at one of those quaint movie houses that just showed one movie at a time.

But, it was great not for the never before seen special effects, but because we came to know and care about the characters. Two droids with personalities, a thing called a Wookiee, and of course the humans.By the time Return of the Jedi came out, Lucas was already starting to get carried away with the special effects, especially in the climatic battle with the Empire, which seemed to go on and on. That tendency would doom his prequel trilogy, but this film was just perfect.May the force be with us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A War in the Stars,"Star Wars is a wonderful film, I call it the fairy tall that only George Lucas could tell. It has great story and has a great cast.

The beginning of a movie symbol.,"In this film, we see the struggle of the rebels to destroy a secret weapon of the Galactic Empire, whose great general is Darth Vader, a dark, sadistic and mysterious character. Directed and written by George Lucas, this film has the participation of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alec Guinness and David Prowse.This film marks a before and an after in the sci fi. It's essential in this film genre, becoming, thanks to an imperishable popularity, a cinema icon, given the social and cultural importance that it has acquired over the decades. With an audience always faithful and unconditional admirers, the Star Wars saga continues to this day to impress and captivate. The actors were always excellent in their roles, the director/writer is one of the biggest sci-fi genius, the script is very good and the story has no dead moments: it's an intergalactic adventure that only stops at the end. No doubt that this film is excellent, it is a work of art. However, it seems that the latest audiences have more difficulty in enjoy this film, given the lack of the colorful and vividness of the actual computerized effects and cinematography. They have to understand that this film has been done in a given period, with all the available techniques at the time. And if they understand this well, they're more easily able to admire it. In fact, although the picture is quite different from what we are used to actually, it's still very well done. The special, visual and sound effects have always been good, and leave us amazed to think it's a movie with more than thirty years. The soundtrack is something that makes our hearts pounding. John Williams did an extraordinary job and managed to catapult himself to stardom, with great and deserved merit. I only have one bad comment to do: some of the effects and scenes, such as explosions and fire in the middle of outer space, where there is no oxygen, are scientifically impossible, and this should have been predicted by the production team before the film release. But this kind of errors are endemic in sci-fi.This film won the Oscar for Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Sound, Best Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Soundtrack, which shows the quality of the work developed here. Definitely, despite some wrinkles, this film is like a well-dressed and made up lady, looking younger than it really is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Still an Unpretentious Blast!,"Even at the age of 45, I love how this movie makes me feel 11 years old again. The story of a princess trying to blow up a space station's easy to follow and takes a few turns on its way to a climax that features one of the classic races against time. The ending is positively uplifting and made us want to reunite with our heroes for the next 2 films.I don't care if this isn't a thought-provoking real-life drama or a love story. It's Star Wars, not Steel Magnolias. Some people complained just because this movie's ""for kids,"" but some kids' movies rock. It's got humor, cool space battles, eye-filling production design, and another magnificent, rousing John Williams score that even stands on its own as a sometimes underrated musical soundtrack.Spoiled by the pace of today's movies, many people complain today that Star Wars is too slow. Back in the day, it was considered almost a roller-coaster ride. And either way, it's a classic!

The Beginning Of Something Galactic,"The first steps of a juggernaut that holds the greatest significance to the Sci-Fi genre. In terms of legacy, Star Wars (Episode IV - A New Hope) is utterly perfect, important to cinema and the beginning of a franchise still flourishing half a century later.So much content is created in the dialogue, laying a background for a film as standalone, with throwaway lines on characters, planets, events and species, but giving a wealth of plotlines to be exploited decades in the future.The film itself is brilliant due to the imagination of it's creation. Lucas fabricated a galaxy filled with a unique and wonderful history, interweaving and interacting, yet so simple when alone that the plot can be understood instantly. A story of good and evil, led by strong personalities, with a healthy dose of action and excitement to keep the swift plot moving along.Visually so nostalgic, yet seemingly cutting edge at the time, props, costuming, and arguably most importantly, puppetry are all outstanding. Leaning on the Wild West in parts, then jumping to the Space Age, the range applied provides such colour and movement in every new setting. The infamous additions made by Lucas around the turn of the millennium are unwelcome, with poor CGI poorly integrating into the original film, but this goes to show that the physical discipline that went into creating these sets are second-to-none.Casting is perfect - relative unknowns mixed in with theatrically training actors, all flawlessly suited to their characters. They are supplemented with droids with distinct personalities, providing flavour and comic relief at the right moments, giving a full roster of fan favourites.There are imperfections; some later corrected in subsequent iterations, such as the translucency of Vader's eyes in his helmet, showing a lack of sinister-ism in the person beneath, but these are minute in the grand scheme of things. Elements are befitting of the 1970s, but this is both a benefit as much as any slight drawbacks.

A movie that needs no introduction.,"Star Wars; the movie that single-handedly changed cinema, forever, in the 70s; which has become one of the most important and beloved decades in film history. This is one of those cream-of-the-crop films that really deserves its high praise in every category. From George Lucas' solid directing of a story focusing on the Dark Side and the Light, Alec Guinness' classic performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi, John Williams' classic score, and James Earl Jones' voicing of Darth Vader, the best film villain of all time: the list of classic elements goes on from there.Star Wars has been reviewed and referenced so many times now that it's essentially become a staple in modern film mythology and culture, almost a fairy tale and one that's still getting discovered by people today. Film scholars, critics and filmmakers have referred to Star Wars so many times and cited its influences from Akira Kurosawa films so much that it's virtual common knowledge among film buffs. Yet even more important for some, is that Star Wars has always had emotional power for its many viewers.George Lucas' magnum opus has changed the lives of so many viewers it's unbelievable when you think to yourself: 'it's just a movie'; but there's damn good reason why many see it as MORE than just another film. Star Wars is an experience, a story respecting the past while paving the way for newer generations for lovers of story, and the philosophy of spirituality. Star Wars respects the works of Akira Kurosawa, Frank L. Baun, J. R. R. Tolkien and Frank Herbert, and it uses those influences to make a world of its own that is still considered one of the most well-realized ones in film history. Everything here has real emotional impact and presence; from the lightsaber fights to the classic Binary sunset scene.It's films like Star Wars that gave rhyme and reason for so many of us to fall in love with cinema in the first place, and it sent out imaginations into overdrive unlike any other sci-fi/fantasy film before it. It became the proverbial film for blockbuster filmmaking, and a defining example of world-building for other writers out there to build their own worlds. Star Wars has become such a landmark in our lives that for some it's impossible to imagine a world where the film never existed in the first place. Thank goodness it does because we'd be poorer without films films as good as this one.Needless to say, historical impact and references besides, I love this film! It has lovable characters that need no introduction, John Williams' music that sends you to the galaxy far, far away and gets you FULLY invested with what's going on and gives you real feeling for what happens in each and every scene, and the scenery is gorgeous: the shots of space, Tatooine, and the Death Star; this gives the story a real heart and soul of its own from start to finish, making a perfect film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...","""Star Wars"", in case you've been living under a rock for the last thirty years, is a sci-fi action/adventure about a group of rebels trying to save the galaxy from the clutches of the evil Empire. At the time of its release it became the highest grossing film of all time. It then went on to spawn two sequels and three prequels, not to mention numerous spinoffs in various forms of media.The principle characters in the story are Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), an idealistic farmboy, Han Solo (Harrison Ford), a cocky starship pilot & Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), a feisty rebel and 'damsel in distress'. All have been assimilated into popular culture, as have numerous supporting characters like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader & Chewbacca. The cast is indeed a good one but objectivity is difficult at this point since the cast and characters are so inextricably linked.George Lucas's script does a fine job of creating an energetic story and populating it with memorable characters. His direction is well handled but the best aspects of the film's visuals come from the ground-breaking special effects. Sure, they may not be outstanding by today's standards but they were breath-taking at the time and for many years afterwards.In addition to the stellar visuals, the film also excelled on the aural front. The sound design by Ben Burtt masterfully brought the world and its creatures to life and resulted in a special achievement award from the Academy. And who can forget John Williams's legendary score, which, in 2005, was chosen as the greatest American film score of all time by the AFI.Simply put, this was a film that not only connected with millions of people but changed movie-making itself. As a result, it is a must for any film fan. That being said, I've only rated the film an 8 for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I feel that the trilogy is best appreciated as a whole and, secondly, the follow-up refined the characters and storytelling to such a degree that the original suffers slightly by comparison.By the way, if you've only seen the prequels (Episodes I thru III), don't let them dissuade you from seeing the original trilogy. The original trilogy is much, much better.Also, I recommend watching the original versions of the films, not the 'Special Editions' that Lucas messed around with for the 20th anniversary.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Watch this one first!,"If you choose to watch Episodes One-Three first, you may be disappointed in these older films which, quite understandably, lack in the special effects compared to the other ones. It should be noted however, that these films were at the height of technology at their time, and remain a credit to their creators. As far as story line goes, I was unimpressed with the action. The movie does contain a few fast paced scenes, but they lack the feeling of suspense and excitement which make the newer movies so fun to watch, and which had come to be associated with Star Wars.Luke Skywalker, played by Mark Hammel, is about as interesting as watching paint dry. Carrie Fischer does a scantly better job. Most kudos should likely go to Harrison Ford, as Hans Solo, who makes a few foolish attempts at being funny, but whose acting is at least up to par. Or maybe the Star Wars Oscar should go to whoever played Chewbacca, for being inside that big costume all day. All in all, a bit of a disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Talking about Star Wars is a lot more fun than watching the movies,"So my main problem is simply that I don't like Star Wars, I know that it's a super iconic film series that has triggered a lot and a milestone in cinema history that has made Didi film world and films itself a quantum leap forward but I have to at the end of the day still give a review and unfortunately I have to say that I just don't like Star Wars even though I was allowed to watch the films as a child, it never appealed to me and I couldn't quite understand why it was such a huge hype. I even go so far and say that if I hadn't been encouraged by over 1000 people that I would probably have only seen one star wars film voluntarily to date.
Of course, the weapon technology, the character design, and the costume design are so multifaceted and gigantic that it was not without reason that whole lexicons were filled with them, but I have to say that as a film it just doesn't really tell me it was not boring, but it's nothing what I would ever watch again voluntarily.

"For my generation, impossible to overrate","I was born in 1979, into a world already saturated with pop culture.  A post-Star Wars world.  What World War II did to define the world that the Baby Boomers were born into, oddly enough, Star Wars did for mine.  This generation has been entirely molded by popular culture, and as such, Star Wars is of a significance that cannot be overrated.  Because it changed everything in pop, and it created so many icons....Darth Vader...Han Solo...the Jedi Knights...Obi-Wan Kenobi...the Evil, Galactic Empire...Princess Leia...the Death Star...""I'm Luke Skywalker, I'm here to rescue you!""

Absolutely nothing, perhaps that this blockbuster from 1977 was the start of it all.

A movie to be see over and over and an epic that will arise above all, people still will watch 1000 years later, if only we live...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Half way the  story: pros & cons.,"What a difficult task, reviewing an isolated chapter of a much larger franchise such as the Star Wars saga! One might draw parallels with other epic undertakes as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, for example. Is it fair to review a single movie as an independent story, when actually much of what transpires from it (or to it) is directly linked to crucial motifs in a story that spans for six movies? Not only that but in the particular case of this movie (episode), we have reached half way in the story, with the first act of the saga completed in the earlier episode (Revenge of the Sith), giving this movie the job of linking the two trilogies together. So as one might expect we get back in first gear again, with the story unfolding very slowly again.Some twenty (more or less) years later after the events that toke place in ""Revenge of the Sith"", the empire is already established, the senate hanging on a thread, and with the Jedi almost extinct nothing is between the emperor and his grip on the universe, except for a few rebels. The movie opens with a ship carrying princess Leya, a rebel ambassador, fleeing from an imperial cruiser.Lucas has told many times that he chose to tell this movie and its story from the point of view of the two bickering droids, R2D2 and C-3PO. For as amusing as it is (they really stand out as a kind of odd couple), this really makes the first half of the movie very slow. Inspired from Kurosawa's ""Hidden Fortress"", these slow beginnings where seldom in the Japanese director's movies, but then again you got rewarded in the end, as Kurosawa made self contained movies and no sequels, hence the drawback in Lucas choice. Before George Lucas directed the later trilogy it was understandable, as there was the need for introducing characters. Not anymore! For some interesting exceptions (the delightfully Han Solo) we already know from the prequels who the droids are, who Obi-Wan is, who Darth Vader is, etcetera, etcetera. Perhaps one of the few unexpected consequences of the recently produced trilogy and prequels.However, once we get to the second half of this episode things start to get moving! The escape from the Death Star helps you to sink in with the real nature of Episode IV, an adventure movie more than anything else, not really worried with developing the true motif and backbone of this saga which revolves around the Skywalker family. From there on, including that final assault on the Death star (very nicely done by the way!!), going through it all with the land mark score by John Williams (which is indefinitely part of the story's identity), we are definitely in gear: accepting the new characters and their roles in the saga, as well as going back to our empathy for the old ones (Obi Wan and such). And of course, by this time the prequels have helped to emphasize our wish to see the Skywalker novella unfold. So when the credits come on the screen you are already reaching for the ""Empire strikes back"" DVD.To conclude my review, if you want to see a self contained movie, you are in for a fair adventure movie, but the real prize will get past you if you haven't seen the prequels or don't intent to see the sequels. So don't waste time. By the whole lot and see the full six episodes! It's a unique cinematic experience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A total dilemma,"Now, after 33 years of having heard about this movie i finally decided to buy its DVD taking into account its rating on IMDb and its historical success over most of the people. i guess that i am maybe not compatible with this saga, though i new i was going to dislike it even since i was a child. But now, when i finally decided to take the risk to watch this movie what i found out confirmed all what i had thought before. I Found a silly and very overrated film, i couldn't have seen it all if i didn't keep reminding myself that this was an old movie.Star Wars is basically the movie that began a series of clichés on movie history; the movie itself contains parts of movies you have seen on TV before, so it is impossible for you to accept that such a great movie turned into a series of low rated movies and series afterwards. its like saying that it is okay for SW because it is old but not for the rest because now new things need to be invented.I can understand how Star Wars could have been the best for people who lived their youth on their 70's (and maybe the majority of IMDb's users are probably from this time), but i cannot understand why it is still now the big deal; enough to be on the 14th place on a tops list.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Ultimate Common Joe Schmoe movie...,"This movie had it all for Common Joe Schmoe.  It had explosions, high tech special effects, plot twist, and even a comic book style story line.

But it seems this film has become more than a entertaining movie with groundbreaking special effects.  To some this was an epiphany.  An enlightening experience.

"Star Wars, a new era...","""Star Wars"" was the start of something new, something different, something extraordinary for those times. Until today ""Star Wars"" considered the best Star Wars movie of all times. Personally I liked it very much and I can compare it with the other two movies of the classic trilogy: ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi"".George Lucas makes a great direction (nominated for the Oscar of Best Director in 1978) such the writing and screenplay (nominated for both for the the Oscar of Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen) and that great job seemed during the whole movie. Gary Kurtz also did an extremely good job for the Picture of the movie who is also nominated for the Oscar of Best Picture.The theme of this movie is that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) are going to save Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) from the evil Darth Vader (David Prowse) and they are also want to save the universe from the Empire's world-destroying battle-station.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

An Intergalactic Masterpiece,"It was just over 50 years ago now that George Lucas captured magic in ""Star Wars"", retroactively titled ""Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope"" after it became clear his vision garnered the demand for many more films. There are few occasions when a film is able to transport you to a different time and place (in this case a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away), but ""Star Wars"" makes you completely forget you're watching a movie.Part of that is because Lucas was able to masterfully blend inspirations from J. R. R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"", Akira Kurosawa's samurai classic ""The Hidden Fortress"", Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and even ""Wizard of Oz"" into his lore and mythology. This movie is also a true genre-bender. When we follow Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) it's a coming-of-age story; a roughneck space pirate Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his furry companion Chewbacca provide buddy comedy elements, and at the heart of the movie there's a rescue plot for the ""damsel-in distress"" Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), who turns that trope on it's head. All of this is wrapped up in a fantasy space opera, and it somehow works. George Lucas managed to blend all of these elements to perfection and captivate and transport audiences to a different time and place with iconic characters that have stood the test of time.I won't harp on the plot points too much but the journey that this movie takes us on through the eyes of Luke, a naive moisture farmer who's never left his home planet of Tattooine, is one of the film's strong points. Luke is instantly relatable to us as we explore the galaxy for the first time with him. Of course the special effects were so incredibly ahead of its time, it's mind-boggling this movie came out in 1977. Less than a decade prior, Stanley Kubrick directed ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", a film known for its it's amazing special effects depicting space. What it isn't known for however is aliens, something Kubrick said was impossible to visualize on the big screen. ""Star Wars"" populates it's planets with fascinating alien species and living creatures that allow us to get lost in this vast world Lucas is building. These excellent special effects culminate in an exciting final battle on the Death Star between Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness) and Darth Vader, but like I said the journey and the characters are what make this film. The intrigue and interest George Lucas was able to create with the Force, lightsabers, Jedis, and the overarching galactic conflict had viewers of ""Star Wars"" instantly hooked, and this film went on to spawn one of the greatest film and media franchises of all time. That's a testament to it's greatness. 9.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Response to critics,"Ok! We've all seen it (if not here's a hammer to hit yourself with) and loved it. Now I've read the anti-Star Wars comments here and feel as though I should respond with a fair point of view rather than gush about the movie itself (been done already).First off,this movie is not a western. Yes it's got a western type story to it,but it obviously is not one. I would aim more toward it being a cross between sci-fi with western underpinnings which is why it wasn't so hokey like most previous sci-fi (hence,a big reason why this movie made such a splash). Calling it uninteresting is just plain bluster considering what was valued as 'good' sci-fi at the time. As for the Storm Trooper's not being able to shoot....what else is new? Every action movie I've ever seen with firefight scene in it has the bad guys blind as bats. Remember;it's fantasy!The decline of Hollywood certainly didn't start with Star Wars. I'm sure we could all discuss this one for a very long time,but I assure you,Lucas isn't to blame for Hollywood's recent poor flicks. Paranoia at it's best! Praising Jaws above Star Wars? Well,everyone's got a right to an opinion however Jaws is nothing more than a simple monster movie such as Godzilla. :)Boring? I guess you 'could' say that,but I'd have to say you didn't really pay attention to the story and are the type who must have a fight scene every 3 minutes to keep you entertained. Sort of like the kid who rushes past the intro to a video game so you can hit buttons as fast as possible.The below posting,'Episode IV: Leia Rules, Star Wars sucks' is so ridiculous it doesn't deserve response. I'll hazard a guess and say that anyone with this much hate in their words is the type of person who simply hates a movie (or song) simply because so many others like it.I quote:'The films shortcomings in terms of the technology, detail and positioning, whilst revolutionary for its time, must be examined compared to today's standards for the movie to be considered great.' Answer: No,it doesn't. I have a friend who thinks because a movie has some years on it,that it somehow makes the film no longer good. This is ridiculous. Film is art,just like music and paint. When they're good,you judge them on their own merit and not contrasted against other works. If it's good,it's good. The film's effects were certainly not poorly done and you've got to remember when the film was created. I was four years old when I saw this and was certainly not confused about the plot. The movie is a visual adventure in the sense that although the dialogue and plot was great,even if you missed something,you'd be able to pick it up with the visuals that give you the story anyway. Anyone who gets lost in the story should stick to pro wrestling. As for the 'laws of physics sound travelling through space' argument:I've heard this one several times taken up against ALL sci-fi films. What exactly would these viewers have us listen to? NOTHING? I'm certain that we can all suspend belief as we sit through a FANTASY movie during these times. If certain viewers can't swallow that,they should quit watching movies altogether (as there are always things happening in film that NEVER happens in real life) and stick to 'more realistic' documentaries.In short,through all of the anti-Star Wars folks that I've talked with, they've never had any real objection to the movie that rendered the film a poor movie but more of a 'teen-angst' ridden review that showed they only wanted to 'stick it to the man' and wearing their hate of the movie like a medal for not 'being fooled' like the rest of us. Thanks but I've enjoyed the movie with most everyone else and plan to do so for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's Star Wars. Need I say more?,"Watched as part of a Star Wars Marathon, hence the shorter review.Star Wars. What is there to say about this film that hasn't already been said? The characters are well written caricatures; the doe-eyed hero, the princess who doesn't need saving, the sleazy hotshot, and the wise mentor. The story is simple, but it serves its purpose. The creativity poured into the background characters and the sets is clear, and every idea is realised to its full potential. The music is sweeping, capturing the feel of every scene perfectly. Sadly, the fight choreography was laughably bad, and not a lot occurred in the two hour duration, most likely as this film acted as setup for the next two. Despite this, it's arguably the single most innovative, iconic movie of all time. It's influenced countless other films since its release, and spawned an 11-movie franchise, alongside 7 TV shows. The genius camerawork, the stark set design, the use of new techniques like miniatures or bluescreens, everything about this film was decades ahead of its time. Everyone should watch this film for the insane technical feat it was, regardless of if they care for the story.78/100--Admin--

Where it all began,I remember when I was 9 years old when this movie was repeated on channel 10 and I found it really enjoyable to watch. The story is very strong for a SCIF movie. The costumes are very good for the aliens and the robots too. The most likable characters are Luke sykerwalker Han Solo and C3po and R2D2 But I think its the droids are the ones who steal the comedy in this movie As always the story always go for a part 2 so their is always a little more more to the story and secrets being revealed latter on in the series.

George Lucas Fails Physics Forever,"This movie's okay, but you have to have the education of a ten year-old child to not laugh your butt off all the way through. The movie starts off with two spaceships chasing each other and firing laser blasts at each other -- didn't the producers know that sound does not travel in space? Next we get a scene inside one of the spaceships -- and all the people are standing on the deck, as if there was actually Earth-normal gravity in space! They should be floating in free-fall, idiots! A bit later the Millennium Falcon blasts off from a planet and goes to ""lightspeed"" with no relativistic effects whatsoever. I thought everyone knew that the speed of light was not a limit that could be arbitrarily broken like that. Furthermore, even traveling at ""lightspeed"" the ship would still take several years to get where it's going -- that's why the unit of distance is called a ""light-year"".The movie goes on to treat us with several more very loud space battles, some of them fought by spacecraft that look like they were based on modern jet fighters, and the tactics inspired by Red Baron dogfights. To be fair, the special effects of the original 1977 version are very good. The movie loses a few points in the politics department, by taking fairy tale monarchies and transplanting them wholesale to space -- after all, the story is about a quest to save a princess from an evil empire, and involves a duel between a white knight and a black knight. There's also Han Solo, a space cowboy with a talking dog called Chewbacca as his sidekick, and a pair of robots for comic relief. (BTW, the robots are not gay. Robots are machines and therefore asexual).It's easy to see why this movie is so frequently ridiculed. No one who saw it in 1977 took it seriously, and it's lived on for the past thirty years as a total joke. Science fiction fans consider this at about the same level of quality as ""Barbarella"". Which is too bad, because it's really quite a fun little romp, kind of like the old Saturday matinée serials of the 1930s and '40s.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The One that Started Them All!,"Star Wars was the film that started the Saga!! It's also the film that revolutionized the sci-fi category, making all sci-fi films that came after it more realistic and better because of the technology that is used in the films because of Star Wars. Industrial Light and Magic was created that headed the department of technology advancements. Skywalker Sound headed the way in the advancements of film sounds, and George Lucas became a titan in the film industry!! Now on to the movie!! Star Wars simply came out at time in America when we needed it the most. The Vietnam War was wrapping up & Americans needed distraction and something positive to believe in again. Enter Star Wars, a story about a farm boy who it turns out is actually a Prince that joins a ragtag bunch of Rebels that destroys an Evil Empire with the help of a scoundrel-like friend & his good natured dog-like buddy and his Princess sister. A bit far fetched - yes, filled with a bunch of morals that the youth of this nation and other nations around the world needed at the time. As George Lucas has been quoted, it's been very important to him that his movies give youngsters hope, and while we no longer have the tail end of the Vietnam War waging on today Star Wars still brings me and others hope today!! Now to the nitty gritty. The acting. It's good, remember for the most part these are first couple performances minus Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford). The action is s very good, the special effects - for the time - were outstanding. The sound editing is very good, the soundtrack is great done by genius and legend John Williams, the writing and direction is out of this world by George Lucas.

Employees at our lone theatre were dressed as the movie characters, and even R2D2 and C3P0 made an appearance - I have no idea how such a tiny town managed that.Like everyone else, I was enthralled. But as the years have passed, I've found myself less and less impressed by this ""masterpiece."" It's still fun...but in the end it seems elitist and hollow. I find it difficult to empathize with any of the characters but Artoo and Wedge Antilles - perhaps because these are the ""everyman"" characters, the workhorses who do their jobs with little glory. Luke was too whiny, Han too smarmy, and Leia too insubstantial.That being said, I thought Christopher Lee was great as Grand Moff Tarkin. Too bad his character was killed off in this film.All in all, Star Wars is a decent time-waster, but undeserving of the attention lavished upon it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of the best films ever made IMO,"When I first saw this film, I initially thought it was made in the mid-80's or something. I never knew it was from SEVENTY-SEVEN! It very much REDEFINES what it means to be ground-breaking, and that's the reason it took the movie industry BY STORM as it did. The original trilogy of Star Wars films are classics that nobody in the right mind would hate and you'll never get tired of them. Think of the Lord of the Rings and Back to the Future trilogies.George Lucas is a saint in my eyes and has blessed us with a bona fide masterpiece of the film industry.And remember: The Force will be with you.

Star Wars (1977) The beginning of a great franchise,"Nowadays one of the best-known franchises in the history of cinema is Star Wars. However, was the first film really that good or has it aged poorly? Of course, analyzing special effects today it is possible to notice many things that have not aged so well. However, the film has a very interesting story with very fun characters and a beautiful look, although there are some moments where not all the costumes are perfect. George Lucas' direction is very basic, but this is not something that is a problem throughout the film. There is a big pacing problem at certain times, however, when it manages to maintain an interesting rhythm it becomes incredible. This film isn't perfect, but it's great and deserves great recognition for starting one of the biggest franchises in history.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Review of Star Wars,"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope follows a young man named Luke Skywalker in his quest against the Galactic Empire and the Sith Lord, Darth Vader. In A New Hope, Princess Leia has requested Ben Kenobi to deliver a message to her father. Luke has a very complicated past and Ben Kenobi, knowing about this past, seeks out the help him. This plays a key role in the quest of the movie. Kenobi behaves as a mentor towards Luke by taking him under his wing. Luke and Ben must free the galaxy of the tyranny of the Empire. Although, they cannot do this alone. With the help of: Princess Leia Organa, Captain Han Solo, Chewbacca, and the rest of Rebel Alliance, they may just end up victorious. Or will they?Star Wars IV A New Hope is worth watching because it gives us a story that is reminiscent of the old tales, but gives us an element of future. It is a story that we have not seen much of. Another reason is that this movie contains all of the areas of action, adventure, tragedy, and romance.First let's give some background profiles on these characters. First, Luke Skywalker is the main protagonist in the story and , according to a prophecy, he must restore balance to the universe. Ben Kenobi is an old hermit man who has been in hiding for a long time. When help calls for him, he does not hesitate. He represents the mentor of the story. Han Solo is a rogue pirate who is self-centered egocentric. He is an expert at flying the Millenium Falcon (his iconic spacecraft). His copilot, Chewbacca, is the species of Wookie. He is Han's best friend and right hand. Leia Organa is the princess of the planet of Alderaan, and is on a mission to defeat the Empire. Finally, there is Darth Vader who is the big villain of the story. He is the leader of the Galactic Empire.This movie gives us a story that is reminiscent of the old tales and gives a take on medieval samurai-type behaviors. One scene in particular that shows this, is when Luke is meeting Ben Kenobi. Ben is portrayed as the mentor of the story. When Ben is speaking to Luke, he says, ""This was your father's lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or random as a blaster. An elegant weapon, for a more civilized age. For over a thousand generations, the Jedi Knights were guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times. Before the Empire."" This scene shows that in this time of future, there are warriors who seek an elegance in fighting. When watching through the movie, you see sword fights that resemble to those from Robin Hood. Another scene that shows this is the fight scene from Ben Kenobi and Darth Vader (the villain). During this scene, it is two older people who have decades of experience wielding the weapon of such power. They are striking each other with grace and elegance. This is a reminder of the Medieval times with samurais fighting to protect the honor. This movie gives lots of details on the idea of honor and defending one's honor and one's legacy.Another reason that this movie is worth watching is, that it contains multiple genres including: action, adventure, tragedy, and romance. The movie contains action scenes such as the lightsaber fight between Vader and Kenobi. It has the classic rogue member, Han Solo. The characters say a lot of the movie as well. It has a Princess that they need to rescue, showing chivalry, connecting to the idea of the Damsel in Distress. One scene in particular portrays the classic futuristic space battles. When imperial ships are chasing the Millenium Falcon, Solo and Skywalker must step up and defend the ship before it is too late. This has lots of adventure and action elements, leaving viewers on the edge of their seat. When the group goes to rescue the princess Luke and Han argue about it: """"I'm not going anywhere"", Han says.""They're going to execute her! Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay?"", Exclaims Luke.""Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind."" Han says, condescending.""But they're going to kill her!"", Yells Luke.""Better her than me!""""She's rich."", Luke says after a brief moment of silence.""Rich?""""Rich. Powerful. Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be...""""What?""""Well, more wealth than you can imagine!""""I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!""""You'll get it""""I better.""""You will.""""All right, kid. But you'd better be right about this.""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope is a fantastic movie that captures the essence of what it is like to be the brave and what it is like to fight for what you believe in, and what you can get out of that. It ultimately shows the idea that even people from an ordinary and colorless lives, can still defend peace and justice. According to Ben Kenobi: ""...the Jedi Knights were guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic"". I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in a futuristic Space Opera with ideas of chivalry and courage. Anyone that enjoyed Star Trek, The Avatar, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, or the Hunger Games will definitely enjoy this. All of these titles have either a common director, themes, or content that is similar to one another. Star Wars IV A New Hope is worth watching because it gives us a story that is reminiscent of the old tales, but gives us an element of future. It is a story that we have not seen much of. Another reason is that this movie contains all of the areas of action, adventure, tragedy, and romance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars essay - a child's best friend,"I wasn't a popular kid, mostly spending time in my own imagination. I was 7 when I first saw Star Wars, and I was immediately captivated by its charm and fantasy.Firstly, it made me feel I had friends! The characters are some of the most well-rounded and iconic of all time. As a kid I resonated with Luke, stuck on a desolate planet with no one around, but with dreams and aspirations that always seemed too far out of reach. He and I could only dream of venturing into the stars and rescuing a damsel in distress.Speaking of whom, Leia is no mere damsal when we meet her, and she grows into an even stronger female role model over the trilogy. She's fiercely intelligent, no-nonsense, and fiesty enough to keep Vader, Tarkin, and two horny spacemen at bay! Even humiliated in a gold bikini, she has the strength of character to be unfazed and hold her own (much to the admiration of every teenage boy in the '80s and '90s).Han, to me, was like those kids a few years older at school who you'd never hang around with, but as I grew, so did my appreciation of him. His wit, his charm, his confidence. Played with an earthy realism, Ford was always going to be the true hero in keeping a film so aloft grounded amongst the nuts and bolts. His relationship with Chewie is just perfect too, especially seeing as we can only ever understand one side of the conversation.But! As strong as the key three are, they are no match for the immeasurable presence of Darth Vader, probably the greatest movie character ever. From the first second we see him, he's immediately terrifying, daunting and intimidating. The voice, the mask, the height, the quotes (""The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force."") Plus his arc over the trilogy is probably the best of all the characters.The story is legendary. Farmboy discovers heroic plot and joins his wise mentor to learn new skills, save the princess and destroy the enemy's ultimate weapon. It's so good they completely replicated it for Episode VII! At time of writing, there have been eleven proper Star Wars movies (plus Clone Wars, Ewoks, etc), but none of them, even Empire, surpasses the gallant charm of the original. Even 40 years later the effects are still solid (and only slightly dated) because of the use of miniatures, costumes, robust sets and locations which keep the movie grounded, physical and tangible in a way which its prequels and sequels could only dream about. Also John Williams's sensational score is one of the most recognisable soundtracks in Hollywood history.So many years later, but no film can make such a romping space fantasy so believable, immersing and iconic. Long live Star Wars!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Humble Origins For A Cinematic Legend,"Few movies capture the imagination as the original ""Star Wars"" does, and because of its vast legacy, it is rather challenging to review in isolation. Part of the wonder of watching George Lucas' initial space opera today is knowing what it leads to and appreciating how this low-budget sci-fi movie from the late seventies changed the face of cinema forever.Inspired in-part by the work of Joseph Campbell, ""Star Wars"" follows a conventional hero's journey. Farm boy Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) leaves his deadbeat desert planet to explore the universe and play his part in defeating the Galactic Empire. Along the way, he also learns about the Force and the mythical group of warriors known as the Jedi. Today, these terms are well-known aspects of the zeitgeist, but in '77, they must have seemed both fantastically strange and brilliantly original.In truth, the story is a little predictable - dancing in the footsteps of mid-century B-Movies. However, when it first hit screens, ""Star Wars'"" return to happy endings and epic protagonists was actually a bit of a breakthrough. At the time, American film was entrenched in violent neo-noir New Hollywood artistry. Lucas thus recreated the blockbuster with ""Star Wars,"" a cheerful, big-scale movie that the whole family could enjoy.""Star Wars'"" success, however, is thanks to much more than just its myth-affirming story centered around Luke Skywalker. The hero would likely be forgotten without the support of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Princess Leia, and Han Solo, perfectly portrayed by Alec Guinness, Carrie Fischer, and Harrison Ford, respectively. Meanwhile, the non-human characters (C-3PO, R2-D2, and Chewbacca) carry just as much weight.In fact, it is the aliens and droids that give ""Star Wars'"" its magical flare. The make-up and art departments created completely original beings that truly convince the audience that they are witnessing something that happened a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away. Even by today's standards, these creatures look believable. Also, although I am not anti-CGI, there is immense charm in the fact that all these other-worldy characters were built practically. The puppetry, masks, and physical designs (particularly in the Cantina scene) both please the eye and warm the heart.Nevertheless, ""Star Wars"" also gave the movie business groundbreaking special effects. The very first shot of an Imperial Star Destroyer chasing a small rebel ship through space looks like something created by a modern Hollywood VFX team. I can only imagine how grippingly spectacular it must have appeared when first projected in theaters. Meanwhile, the entire film is filled with space battles and images that still hold-up to this day. No wonder this is the magnum opus for the man who went on to create Industrial Light and Magic.Finally, no ""Star Wars"" review would be complete without praise for its sound. Spaceship engines, blasters, alien languages, and unmistakable clash of lightsabers show that ""Star Wars"" is as much of an auditory feast as it is a visual one. Then, there is the wonderful score from John Williams. Based on classical styles rather than anything tropishly futuristic sounding, Williams' music elevates every scene to a new, dignified height. To this day, it remains one of the best movie soundtracks.One could fill a book (and many film scholars have) with everything there is to say about ""Star Wars,"" from where it came from to what it inspired. Without it, we'd obviously have no other movies set in that galaxy far far away, but we'd also probably not have Indiana Jones, Superman, Marvel, Lord of the Rings, or many other epic franchises that owe their studio green lights to ""Star Wars'"" initial success.Of course, the movie has its critics. Many tarnish ""Star Wars"" for its one-dimensionality or how it turned mainstream cinema into studio-driven marketing campaigns for ancillary products. However, when we consider ""Star Wars"" as a film and a film alone - as ""Star Wars"" rather than ""Episode IV: A New Hope"" - we can't help but ogle at how perfectly everything falls into place on screen. All aspects of cinema - script, sound, editing, etc - come together in this film for the delight of filmmakers, fans, scholars, critics, adults, and children alike.Before its release, nobody would have bet on ""Star Wars."" Like Luke Skywalker himself, it was an underdog, but forty-plus years later, it is nothing short of cinematic legend.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Is this SW thing some kind of contagious delusion, mass-hysteria or pseudo-religious fervour? Why do I feel as if I'm some kind of heretic?

I even preferred The Empire Strikes Back (though Jedi is at best a rehash of the first two movies for the under-fives.) I think I've gone a little way towards qualifying my stance. I like the movies, really, I do! But can someone explain this madness to me? I'm so far past this obsession it brings me down to see the stuff everywhere, always, without respite, EVER. The toys, the gadgets, the books, the re-released soundtrack sets, the re-released video sets, the bed linen, the computer games.... On top of this, people around me greeting these things with enthusiasm, even excitement. PLEASE, SOMEBODY HELP ME! For me, the films have always lacked a certain something; passion perhaps, a deep emotional involvement. Star Wars never hit me in that place that makes a movie something personal and enduring. The Dykstra / ILM special effects leave no space for imagination. It's all about technology, never beauty. That opening shot of the Imperial Star Destroyer going overhead has always left me unmoved, (this blasphemy alone would be enough for certain buddies to kick that chair out from under me!) even at the age of 10 when I saw it the first time round. These days I've moved onto movies with a bit more of an emotional kick. I'm still a dreamer, but I prefer characters to be defined a bit more clearly and the technology to be a bit more blurred.

All of these characters have been around for so long that, even though I haven't seen the films before, I still recognise them and know who they are.

I am also an electromechanical engineer with a master's degree in computer science. I am still surprised to think that maybe Star Wars had a lot to do with it. All I know is that this is the only movie I remember watching when I was a young child (3 years old, to be precise), and that the excitement I felt hasn't worn off. Oh no, not the least.This movie has to be my favourite one of all time. The premise is so simple, the acting is straightforward and the plot is coherent. But most important of it, you actually care about everyone in the film. Maybe because character development is so strong throughout the film, or because it is a very well told story. A simple tale of good versus evil, told in the best of ways.And so I am sitting here in front of my computer, wondering if how is it possible that a 2 hour story helped me find out what I wanted to be.

This film's force will be with us for a long time,"In early summer 1977 I found myself taking in the sights on Times Square one Saturday afternoon, and I came across a long line of people waiting to get into Loews Theater (which turned out to have a screen, oh, about a half mile wide) to see ""Star Wars."" For several months I'd been intrigued by a silver-gray movie poster at the Memphian Theater back home that said simply, ""Coming to Your Galaxy This Summer: Star Wars."" My feet were tired from walking all over New York, so I decided, ""What the heck,"" and got in line. When I bought my ticket I was given a pin-on button, about three inches in diameter, upon which was printed against a blue field of stars, ""May the Force Be With You."" ""Wonder what that means?"" I thought, and I pinned it on my shirt. I found a seat and for the next two hours, as I sat suspended in space from the front row of the balcony, ""Star Wars"" transported me, as no movie had before, to adventures in a time and place I could never have imagined. ""Star Wars"" took my breath away. Almost literally. When the Millennium Falcon kicked into overdrive and the stars stretched, I nearly fell out of the balcony. The next day I traveled home and told all my friends that they would soon see a new science fiction movie that was about to sweep the country and they would all love it. They thought I was nuts, but I was mostly right of course. (Can you believe some people don't love ""Star Wars?"")

"Perhaps a tad too talkative, but the force is still strong in this one","When Princess Leia is held hostage by the evil Darth Vader she implants a message into the programme of droid R2-D2. The message is intended for Jedi knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and contains plans on how to destroy the empire. With the help of a couple of pilots, a wookiee and 2 droids Obi-Wan Kenobi sets out on a mission to rescue Princess Leia and overthrow Darth Vader's empire...It's been quite some time since I last watched A New Hope and my memories of it are mostly the same; it's an enjoyable film with a decent story some humour and some reasonable shoot em up style action. However...A lot of this does come in the second half of the picture and the first hour is mostly concerned with setting up the story. The first half of the film is still OK as it gradually builds the narrative up and introduces all of the characters, but the slow manner in which this is all achieved may be off-putting to some people. Still for those with a little patience in their bodies it is definitely worth the effort as this film is enjoyable and the strong camaraderie between the cast definitely helps its cause.The film benefits from a solid cast who all bring different qualities to the film; Darth Vader with a combination of David Prowse's physical size and James Earl Jones commanding voice manages to be quite an intimidating presence (despite basically just being a costume). Harrison Ford brings charisma and charm to the role whilst also having fun as well (something he also exploited to good effect in the Indiana Jones films). Anthony Daniels as C3PO is mostly there for comedic relief but it works because he is amusing.There are certain aspects of the film that look dated but I was surprised watching this film in 2020 that a lot of the SFX don't look too bad. The cinematography isn't too bad either...From memory, I remember enjoying The Empire Strikes Back a touch more, but again it was a while ago since I watched it so I'll confirm that when I revisit it soon.

The force is strong in this one,"It seemed only fitting to watch Star Wars to transition from the terrible year that was 2016 to the new year. With it's title, A New Hope, it it was just something that I needed to watch to start the year. Not only did George Lucas' phenomenal and monumental film define a generation, but it shaped the way for science fiction films for many years to come and bring joy to everyone.I think the greatest triumph of the original film lies in it's simplicity, so simple and yet so perfect. It's *the* classic good vs. evil plot, intertwined with a space opera feel that combines and works so well together. This is not the ""greatest"" film ever made, there are some problems with it, but when I watch it I just have so much fun. That's the best part though, it wasn't meant to be the greatest film ever, it was meant to invoke joy and make you feel good every time you watch it and it does this effortlessly. It's crafted to perfection; with Lucas bringing in beautiful landscapes and great set pieces, a haunting and also uplifting score, and lovable characters that get better with each viewing.Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker is *the* prime example of releasable protagonist. Sure he's a little whiny, but aren't we all. Harrison Ford though, is where it's really at. His charm and charismatic vibe just works so well with the film and it's characters, you can't really say why it works so well, it just does. He's everything I wish I was if I lived in space. Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia is perfect. She's no damsel in distress, she's a warrior and a fighter and I love that about her. Alec Guinness is perfect as well, he plays the ""master"" role so well, and his lines with Luke are great.Darth Vader is the single greatest villain ever put to the screen. His simple and effective way of putting terror in people and he's just so menacing. His fight with Obi-Wan may have be lackluster in a year with giant space battles, but that's why it is perfect, it's simple way of storytelling. Combining with John Williams greatest achievement yet and using practical effects to his advantage, George Lucas makes the film a technical marvel to watch.The film doesn't over complicate anything, it's a simple story of adventure, hope, and love, all told in a wonderful space opera way. There hasn't been many films like this in many years; taking us on a fun journey to new places we could never imagine. Star Wars is not a perfect film, there's some flaws here and there, but remembering the first time I saw this and it bringing me so much joy and happiness, I can't help but keep going back to this saga and find new ways to love it each and every time.RIP Carrie Fisher",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Luke sets out to find Obi-Wan, and together they must save Princess Leia and her people.In need of transport to her planet, they team up with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his copilot Chewbacca, a humanoid alien covered in hair. What follows, is plenty of action and adventure and many interesting characters along the way. The antagonist is Darth Vader, a masked villain wearing a black cloak, and since we never see his face we don't know whether he is human or alien.There are many iconic moments in the film. The costumes and production design are fantastic, and the outstanding visual effects were groundbreaking for its time. The visuals actually still hold so well by today's standard. It's no surprise the film won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects. The film also boasts an incredible amount of stunning practical effects. It's hard to believe this film was made almost five decades ago! This amazing production has CLASSIC written all over it. Back in 1977, 'Star Wars' was way ahead of its time! This is undoubtedly one of the greatest films of all time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Put SciFi back on the movie map!,"Star Wars came around at the right time. People were feeling down and needing something fun to take their minds off the late 70's which were a crummy time. Star Wars blasts across the screen from the opening shot (still amazing today) to the final. And if there had never been another movie, that would have been ok simply because this is so great.

"Star Wars, It's Star Wars","If you haven't seen Star Wars yet, then you won't have seen Star Wars at all. Excellent for fans. Effects are good even for today. Characters are well thought out and detailed. Every scene is a work of art. It has become the most quotable film of all time. Must watch more than 15 times. It's Star Wars. Better left alone. Watch the original, not the remastered rubbish.The most iconic Science Fiction film of all time ever. The cast of characters includes some of the coolest and funniest in film, and the actors who play them fit seamlessly into this new universe. Mark Hamill, THE Joker, is full of passion and strength while Alec Guiness is flawless as Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Jedi on the run from the evil Empire. Harrison Ford is awesome as Han Solo, a smuggler and thief who helps the gang rescue the princess. But the coolest looking character of all time is Darth Vader. Not only is he the coolest bad guy, but we learn in later films why he is evil and start to feel sympathetic for him. Not to mention that booming voice.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

That's One For The Good Guys,"Good clean fun. This movie didn't ask you to think about any deep and weighty subject matter. It was good vs. evil almost literally in black and white. And when you left the theater, you didn't have to digest what you had just seen. To top it off, it reached out and grabbed you in the opening scenes with a fantastic shot of two ships in space doing battle. Even the bar scene was believably because the weird characters were not computer generated. They were played by real people in costume, and the viewer knew it and could live with that.It was clear at the end that Darth Vader had escaped the destruction of the Death Star, but it was unclear how the small, one-man fighter he was in could have traveled far enough on its own to be rescued.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The beginning of an brilliant trilogy which still holds strong today,"On this day,Wednesday,May,25 of 1977 would be a day to remember in the history of motion pictures and science fiction itself. On this day,the eagerly awaited premiere of one of Hollywood's biggest secrets opened that day in theatres across the country and it would do so throughout the remainder of that year and well into the end of the decade.For one,this film would go on to become the biggest boxoffice champ of its day and would hold that status for the next couple of years. The film tooked four years in the making with a aresnal of top notch special effects never before heard of was history in the making with all of the elements combined with Greek mythological mixed in with all the elements of a American western,and with it the references of movies ranging from Akika Kurosawa to John Sturges not to mention thrown it with the surprise element of the grand Saturday Matinee serials of the 1930's and 1940's. In other words,it redefined with science fiction was meant to be and that made it very impressive with the critics and from there audiences couldn't wait to see since the day it opened long lines from blocks away were waiting to see it and would eventually see it again,and again.The Film? ""STAR WARS"" released in the summer of 1977 by Lucasfilm,Ltd. and by Twentieth Century-Fox. Fox pulled some great odds for this film since the studio itself was fighting to stay alive and it needed a blockbuster to bring it back to prominence,and it did just that. This was a visionary blockbuster that was eyepopping from the get-go which was a ""quantum leap"" that ""redefined the entertainment industry"" and established a ""dynasty"" by locating the ""universal"" in a ""galaxy far,far away"" where ""original"" critters,""futuristic samurais"",side with a put-upon princess against the ruthless evil empire controlled by the most diabolical villain in the history of cimema,the merciless evil tyrant,LORD DARTH VADER for the control of the galactic empire and the universe itself,only to be stopped in his tracks by a unknown lad named Luke Skywalker,his companion Obi-Wai Knonbi,and renegade ex-soldier named Han Solo and a furry sidekick Chewbecca,a wookie. Together they must rescue the princess,and above all get-by the guards and save the universe from a certain fate. This builds up to a showdown against the forces of evil that is vastly entertaining with a mix of some modern myth,and it is a ""thrill-and-a half"" FX spectacular galore that is in a class by itself. In other words,""STAR WARS"",not only saved 20th Century-Fox from a complete disaster and a near bankruptcy of the studio, but also it was ""the movie that saved Hollywood"",thanks to George Lucas. The movie made international stars of its cast which consisted of a unknown actors at the time who were hitting their stride,Mark Hamill,Carrie Fisher,Harrison Ford,with a stellar cast of British actors:Sir Alec Guinness,Peter Cushing,and the voice of Darth Vader,James Earl Jones.The first ""STAR WARS"" film won six Oscars including several for best musical score from the legendary Hollywood composer John Williams,and for it impressive special effects. The film of 1977.However,""STAR WARS:EPISODE IV:A NEW HOPE"",didn't stop there since Lucas insisted there was more to come,and it came too. The next one was even bigger and would be heralded as one of the best in the original trilogy and still holds up very well.""THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK"",also released by Lucasfilm,Ltd. and 20th Century-Fox roared into theatres in the summer of 1980,and it would become one of ""the darkest of Star Wars series"". This worthy first sequel features more depth in its characterizations and ""the best storyline so far"" which included revealing many important secrets about the origins of Luke Skywalker and man he rarely knew whom would become his father before turning into the evil Darth Vader. However,a new character was introduced as well,a renegade named Lando Calrissian played by Billy Dee-Williams(whom most remember from ""Lady Sings The Blues"" and ""Mahogany"" with actress/songstress Diana Ross back in the early 1970's). However,the sequel has no wooden dialogue from the first film,but here it is more ""adult-oriented"" of the original trilogy while that open-ended cliffhanger of a finale makes for a suitably spectacular windup since of this one George Lucas serves as executive producer and writer here and leaving the directorial duties to Irvin Kershner. Also Oscar nominated as well for John Williams' musical score. One of the top ten highest grossing films of 1980.The final episode of the Star Wars trilogy ended with Richard Marquand taking over the directorial duties with George Lucas serving as executive producer for ""THE RETURN OF THE JEDI"",released by Lucasfilm,Ltd.,and Twentieth Century-Fox on Memorial Day weekend in May of 1983. This was indeed a ""worthy sequel"" or ""leftovers"" from the last installment,but in all fairless it was a bitter disappointment. The storyline was very good in every detail,especially with the ""good-versus-evil"" conflict between Luke Skywalker and the evil Darth Vader in a climatic showdown and some of the coolest special effects ever devised especially in the amazing ""final battle"" in the destruction of the Death Star is amazing beyond belief. What didn't make it stand out in some of the segments is the weakest entry in the series which is overrun by Jabba The Hutt,cute-furry Ewoks,and the realization between Luke and his long lost sister he never knew. But in all fairless,this was the end of a trilogy that was really completely destroyed 16 years later in 1999,by THE PHANTOM MENACE,which was the weakest link in the history of the Star Wars series.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Irritating, self-important, dated, with some bright moments","Listening to the sound of fingernails screeching on a chalkboard is soothing compared to watching this movie. From James Earl Jones' surprisingly flat and uninteresting Darth Vader to Carrie Fisher's sticky bun haired Princess Leia, the main actors in this movie deliver strictly second rate performances, except for Alec Guinness, who does his best with a script that seems to have been written by a 14 year old fantasy gamer.The special effects started a trend which has never been broken, of ignoring physics and engineering in favor of cheap thrills and easy effects so scriptwriters don't have to think about reality and can simply transfer scenes from westerns and other shoot-em ups into ""space"".The non-earthlings were the best part of this movie, creatively done, with the deservedly famous bar scene being the film's shining moment.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The beginning of a great and epic space opera.,Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope. The beginning of a great and epic space opera. A truly cool movie for its time. George Lucas has created a masterpiece that has been a resounding event for over 40 years.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An Epic Start to the biggest franchise ever,"With The Mandalorian set to hit the UK next week and with myself being one of the people in isolation at the moment I have decided to rewatch the Star Wars films and possibly the shows in order to catch up and I have now rewatched the first Star Wars Film A New Hope and this is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees a farmer join forces with a Jedi Knight, a cocky pilot, a wookie and a pair of droids in order to attempt to save a princess from the evil Empire.Main Character
Mark Hamill became an actor that was type cast in the role of Luke Skywalker and this was the start of his journey as the character. Luke is a character it is quite easy to root for as he is like us, learning about these big galactic events like us the audience, he doesn't start as a big confident character but he wants to do the right thing and we can relate to that as if given the opportunity we want to be the hero of the story.Supporting Characters
This is a part of the film where it really succeeds, Harrison Ford plays Han Solo in this film and he is easily the best character in this film. He is cocky and arrogant but he is so entertaining to watch in the film that you care about his character, his character also has the best arc in the film and he really develops as the film progresses. Carrie Fisher plays Princess Leia and judging by the premise of the film you would believe she is just the damsel in distress but she really isn't, she gives the other characters attitude and doesn't take nonsense from the other characters and shows her character has plenty of strength to her as a leader of The Rebellion. Alec Guiness plays Ben Kenobi and his role is crucial in the film, he really plays a mentor to Luke in the film and sets him on his way as a character on the journey that he goes for in this film. Darth Vader is possibly the most important villain in film history and this is the first time we see the character and he is possibly the most terrifying looking character on film. You don't get all the details about his character but it really gives you enough to get invested in the background of his character and the powers that he possesses.Story
Again when you read the premsie of the plot of the film you probably think it is really basic and I guess it kind of is but it is executed so fantastically that it rises above the basic idea of the and makes it extremely interesting. Learning about the things such as the Jedi, The Empire & The Rebellion that keeps you intrigued and just sucks you into want to learn more about this situation and the characters. If any film can get away with being a bit predictable it is Star Wars as it feels perfect for the film you are watching and sets up all these characters for great arcs in the future.Script
The script for this film is great, it has some truly memorable lines that are remembered by fans and casuals alike. There are some funny lines that make the characters seem more interesting and likeable, plus the drama builds to some real emotional moments thatrises this film above other films in the same genre.Style
This film came out in the late 1970's and it looks incredible, the action scenes are some of the most exciting and entertaining of all time and they keep you on the edge of your seat whether it is a blaster battle, lightsaber battle or space battle it is great. I also have to mention how important John Williams score is to this film as it makes every scene feel so much bigger then it is and it makes this such a better experience. The one thing I must mention is that I watched the current edition of this film that has some added scenes with new CGI but in this film I just find these really jarring and don't think they add to the film at all and even look uncomplete. However, I felt that these scenes are few and far apart and don't take much away from the overall quality of the film.Overall
Overall this is one of the most revolutionary films of all time, it is a pretty perfect start to a franchise and sets up all the characters superbly for future films while providing a great film in it's own right. If you are one of the few people that haven't seen this film then watch it as soon as possible.Rating - 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Perfect story and movie..,"This movie has always held a special place in my heart, even if my enthusiasm isn't always shared by everyone. It's one of those films that brings together the wonder of a classic fairytale and the thrilling elements of sci-fi, blending them so perfectly that it reshaped the entire genre. It wasn't just a movie; it felt like a new cinematic rulebook was being written. The atmosphere, the groundbreaking visuals, and the compelling storytelling have made it a timeless classic. While the sequels did a great job continuing the story and delivering on the original's promise, the prequels remain a topic of debate. Revisiting them two decades later raises an interesting question: do they still hold the same magic? Can they capture the imagination of both nostalgic fans and new audiences today? There's an undeniable charm in the characters and plot that, for some, still feels fresh and relevant, yet for others, might seem dated. It's a film series that has evolved with time, yet its core message remains iconic and unforgettable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"One of the Most Iconic, and Best, Films Ever Made","Star Wars is directed by George Lucas and is the story of a young man named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) that lives on the desert planet of Tatooine with his Uncle and Aunt. As he reaches his late teenage years, he begins wanting to leave the planet and live his own life, away from the desolate wasteland of a planet. However, as soon as he begins to become passionate about leaving, he meets an old hermit named Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness), that tells Luke that he knew his father, who was a Jedi Knight, before the Empire had taken over. This information leads Luke on an adventure, pitting himself against the Empire and the dark side of a mysterious energy called The Force.Near everyone knows the impact that Star Wars had on the film industry. After the massive hit that Star Wars was, filmmaking had changed forever, and for the good. George Lucas had simply revolutionized a new era of film, bringing to life many sequels, and prequels, and an entire new generation of filmmakers and fans. Not only is Star Wars legendary, it's amazing as well. A film can be remembered, and not that great, but Star Wars is, simply put, fantastic.The best thing about Star Wars, if there is one, is the groundbreaking special effects. Even now, almost 40 years later, the special effects don't look fake. All of them look completely believable and great at the same time. This is mostly due to George Lucas' use of models. Rather than making everything out of CGI (cough, prequels), Lucas used small models of the Death Star, the Tie Fighters, The Millennium Falcon, etc. He filmed these models shot for shot, and it payed off, due to just how great the effects look all this time later.Not a single soul can talk about Star Wars without mentioning its score. As most know, John Williams composed the music for Star Wars, and did a fantastic job with it. The iconic opening theme is one of the most memorable songs ever composed, both for a film, and of all time. Near everyone can remember the tune of the song, and it's heard everywhere. In fact, I heard the opening theme being whistled by a worker in my local grocery store a couple days ago. The memorableness of this score is incredible, and deserves all of the praise that it gets.The acting is also great. Mark Hamill does a great job as Luke, and plays the character like nobody else could. Harrison Ford is literally perfect at playing Han Solo, and brought to life one of the coolest movie characters of all time. Princess Leia, played by Carrie Fisher, is a great character, and is portrayed very well by Fisher. Alec Guinness is absolutely amazing as Ben Kenobi, and so is the actors that portrayed C-3PO and R2D2, Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker. All of the actors in Star Wars are very talented, and did great in their roles.Also, the script, written by George Lucas, is astounding. Before this movie was made, none of the cast or crew expected it to do well, especially with the outlandish script. However, nobody could even imagine the vastness that is the Star Wars universe today. The script propelled this film in every way possible, and is the biggest reason, aside from the special effects, that Star Wars was such a success.The last thing about Star Wars that I'll mention is the villain, Darth Vader. Not only is Darth Vader the most iconic movie villain of all time, he's the best as well. Without knowing anything about his past yet, Darth Vader is still a very compelling and fantastic villain. He's menacing, intimidating, and likable all at the same time. Darth Vader is perfectly acted, both physically and in voice (credit: Peter Cushing and James Earl Jones). He's the perfect villain, and did so much for the Star Wars franchise.Overall, Star Wars is easily one of the most iconic films ever made, and, in my opinion, one of the best. Anyone and everyone should watch Star Wars; it's highly likely that you'll enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Wonderful is the word,"Star Wars without Han Solo is like Indiana Jones without his whip. The new star wars trilogy may have better CGI but they are no match to the old trilogy when it comes to memorable characters, dialogue and the thrill.Star Wars a new hope is enlightening, fun and draws you in to want to see what happens when the Empire Strikes Back. This episode IV is well designed there is not too much dragging in talk and theories just a brief introduction to all the characters involved and then straight to the main event. The CGI and screenplay is one that takes you by storm, as you watch this movie and compare it with the recent trilogy you start to wonder what the difference was, as the difference in the CGI is very minute.George Lucas is a visionary and what he started with star wars is what many have been dreaming of doing for time past, a franchise that can go on for a long time. This 1977 space movie is written and directed by George Lucas himself and this movie influenced many others that came after it. The movie was originally just named Star Wars; it was after its success and corresponding sequels and then Lucas idea to make a prequel to the sequel, which the movie now became Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope as the movie tend to follow the events that happened after Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.The Galactic Empire is led by the Sith Lord Palpatine and his apprentice Darth Vader, both have been in charge of the Galactic Empire for years, and they are facing an opposition by a group of freedom fighters known as the Rebel Alliance. The Galactic Empire has become more driven by technological advancement as the way of the force seems to be known by only few, the Galactic Empire have a new weapon named Death Star, a space station that can take out a whole planet in seconds.Detail plans of the Death Star were intercepted by the alliance and Princess Leia was taken it to the rebel base when she and her starship occupants were captured by Darth Vader. Before her apprehension she stored the data in her droid and sent it off to go find Obi-Wan Kenobi, the droid on its way got acquired by farm boy Luke Skywalker, and due to some circumstances beyond his control Skywalker decides to accompany Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi on a daring mission to rescue the rebel leader Princess Leia.The level of design in the movie is so well done that when an upgrade of the same set design is introduced in the new trilogy, you would feel the movies were made in the same time. Lucas upon production of the movie created his own special effect company Industrial Light & Magic to handle the effects in the movie, which was a huge leap ahead of others for the company.Here is a movie from the way back in the days that you just have to watch and admire the work that went into making it.www.lagsreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not bad, but Lord, it wasn't *that* good!","The inspiration was the space opera serials of the '30s to the '50s and numerous other sources, with the result that this movie is almost startlingly unoriginal. The script was not great. The acting was achingly uneven, from the brilliance of Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing to the awkward mouthings of Mark Hamill. The special effects were amazing only in their ubiquitousness; the techniques used were venerable -- and have been considerably ""spiced up"" in the currently available video editions. Yeah, it was lots of fun, but beyond that it had no meaning or enduring value. So what inspired the fanatic following enjoyed by the Star Wars franchise?According to George Lucas, he was guided by the work of mythologist Joseph Campbell, who was able to distill from the world's folklore the foundational elements of myth. These are principles and images that resonate; our response is almost biologically hardwired. Using Campbell for a blueprint, Lucas constructed a modern retelling of the hero's journey. In this he didn't do a bad job, because the resonances are certainly there. This I think is key. It fools into thinking we are seeing a great story, because its structure causes us to react to it as we would to any number of other great stories. But the story cannot fill this structure. The mythological resonances blind us to the gaping plotholes, the shallow characterizations, the poor acting, and that godawful dialogue.A really harsh critique of this film is required not because it deserves it by any absolute measure -- indeed, under other circumstances it would really be too lightweight to merit the attention -- because against all reason it has become a standard by which all other movies of its genre are judged. There are far better candidates for that role than this.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

And I got amazed. Primarly because it was 1977. There were no After Effects or stuff like that to edit a movie. It was magical to see such great job without today's technology.

7.7/10 Great start to the science-fiction genre with brilliant technical wonder and a great and timeless story,"Star Wars is kind of overrated, but that doesn't mean it's not a good movie. This film changed cinema as we know it today. It changed many things: Visual Effects, Film and Sound Editing, Action and just Fiction. What it didn't revolutionise was acting or directing. Aside from Alec Guinness' great performance and good ones from Peter Cushing and James Earl Jones, the acting in this picture is a touch stilted. Mark Hamill is winy as Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford is always complaining and Carrie Fisher seems to go in and out of a bad British accent. They're not bad by any means, they're just not good either. Now that we got the bad stuff out of the way, I can praise the rest.The action is more revolutionary than it is good, there's nothing exceptional here, it's just OK. I think I was too busy thinking ""How the hell did they do that in 1977?!"" to actually care about what was going on. Actually, I take that back, I did care about what was going on, it just wasn't the action that made me root for the Rebellion, or the special effects. It was the characters. They aren't brilliantly written or anything, they're just really likable and engaging, aside from the flaws that I pointed out.The story is great. It's original, it's inspiring and thought-provoking. The Force is a brilliant idea. It could be interpreted as anything. Maybe religion or belief. The story may have its flaws, like some small plot holes here and there, but I don't really care. It's a fantasy. And as I said, I was rooting for these characters. When a movie does that, I cannot say it's bad writing.Easily the best aspect of this film is the creativity it brings to the film industry. All the aliens, the robots and cyborgs and androids that they come across are all visually compelling and incredibly designed. It's so... cool, there's no other way to describe this movie than cool. Darth Vader, the film's villain is a prime example of that. He looks cool and he sounds cool. We don't know that much about him yet at this point, but at least I wanted to. I love Darth Vader.Overall, I'd say Star Wars is a pretty good film, truly revolutionising film in general with breathtaking special effects for its time compelling characters, an interesting story and brilliant costume design and makeup. I would say the special editions are pretty lame, but I guess they're not as bad as everyone else says they are.Star Wars: 7.7/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The droids crash on a desert and are saved by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), and when he listens to Leia's message he becomes involved in the mission. Luke meets the man who Leia wanted the message to go, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Sir Alec Guinness), an elderly former Jedi Knight. The two team up and go to one of the roughest towns on the planet. They hire the serves of Hans Solo (Harrison Ford), and his hairy companion Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) to help them. This crew end having to go into the Death Star, and forced to save the Princess and battle the power of Darth Vader.The production history behind Star Wars actually pretty interest, and had all the makings of being a flop. It was cast with unknown actors, the budget ballooned, many of the actors did not get along, particularly Anthony Daniels and Kenny Barker, and Fox got cold feet with the film. But this was not the case, and of course Star Wars was a massive success. The first saw the film when I was 11 and it still hold power over me. The actors in the film are decent throughout, this was the role that truly brought Harrison Ford to prominent, and he is easily the best actor in the film. His character is cool and has chemistry with everyone as the smuggler who seems not to give a damn. Both David Prowser and James Earl Jones ooze power and domination as Darth Vader, Prowser as the physical performer and James Earl Jones offering a menacing voice. Of course Sir Alec Guinness was good as his role as Luke's mentor and surrogate father. Carrie Fisher had excellent chemistry with Harrison Ford having a love hate relationship in the movie. And of course Mark Hamill was good in the leading role.But despite the actors efforts, this was George Lucas achievement, having written, directed and produced the film. As the sole writer/director this is the best Lucas has ever did. Lucas throws many sci-fi fantasies into this film, space travel, giant and laser weapons, psychic powers, multiple alien creatures, and basically fun adventure and action. The action scenes are excellent thought and the special were fantastic, particularly for the time. Even now they are still amazing. This also the best script Lucas has written, whilst the adventure was grand, the focus was on interesting characters you could care about. Lucas made sure the character were well developed and the world was grand, it was obviously based on the Roman Empire.Lucas shows when Special Effect are done well with a good story it can enhance the film experience. Lucas also hired John Williams to make the score for the film, which was a wise move. Williams make one of his best scores and it his music added to film, particularly the Death March.An all important classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Wall Street might have had more to do with the making of this film than we know!,"I would never have seen this movie in a theater if a reporter for The Wall Street Journal hadn't personally approached me and insisted that I must see it because the wise men on Wall Street were convinced that it was the wave of the future. The advertising hadn't appealed to me nor did the ordinary word of mouth, which said that it was lightweight intellectually compared for instance to ""Star Trek"" (the television series) or ""2001."" I wasn't pleasantly surprised when I saw the film because I didn't think the kinetic gimmickry or elaborate production design were a reasonable substitute for the strong characters and emotional themes that I had come to expect from the great action and adventure TV serials. Also, I felt the acting and dialogue were both substandard, except in the case of the robot characters. Some have said that the approach George Lucas used was intentionally ""camp,"" but these are the same people who think that ""The Lone Ranger"" is dated and only for kids. There's an art to making the audience sympathize with the characters in adventure tales, which seems to be way beyond the film maker's capabilities.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
attention grabbing,"This is one of the best received films of all time that spawned two sequels and three prequels. I first saw this when I was four years old and from the first flashy credits it left an impression of what was capable in the film industry. However it has not fared well with time. The effects are dated the look is dated and Lucas' screenplay lacks a psychology that could only be mastered in episode V The empire strikes back by Lawrence Kasdan. George has set the stage though and what a set up it is with so many possibilities to be explored in the Star Wars universe. It has a Hero, a mentor, a cowboy, a princess, A dark overlord a pair of bumbling droids and an ancient art rekindled by Jedi master Obi Wan Kenobi. People who grew up with Star Wars find the series to be a sentimental favorite. It launched the career of Harrison Ford who's Han Solo by the end of the series enjoyed more popularity than that of the hero Luke Skywalker.

An old discovery that lives on,"Some may not know that the galaxy containing the solar system that houses our beautiful little planet Earth is but one of so many it can, so to say, blow one's mind. Nobody knows if there are highly developed life forms out there in the Universe, let alone other civilizations. Outer space deals with distances that are hard to imagine, let alone conquer. ""Star Wars"" is set in outer space, but our Earth is nowhere to be seen. That's because this movie takes place in a whole different galaxy, a fictional one, of course. Despite dealing with technology beyond imagination, though, the story is not from a future yet to come. It is from the past. ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away"" is how the movie itself describes it. The technological wonders seen in the film might seem to contradict the ""a long time ago"" idea, of course. But they don't, because, for example, and let this be an easy example, our Sun used to be brighter and hotter, and our planet was uninhabitable back then. But Mars could have been in a whole different situation because it is further from our Sun. That means the red planet was once in a better set of circumstances, a milder one. Now think of those countless other galaxies, their own solar systems and, in turn, sets of planets. Nobody knows what is out there, or was out there.The movie opens with an action scene in space which looks amazing decades and decades after the movie was created. And the story starts, of course. We get to know what's happening here in general. Then the material gets quite a big break to breathe and let the audience explore this unknown environment with surprises on their way. The movie takes it's time to focus on things and make sure we care about what's going on. Soon enough, of course, the action involving spaceships and explosions will resume. The costumes, the sets, the special effects and all the physical material in general is impressive. The alien creatures, except for the big bipedal monkey named Chewie, are basically there to give you an idea how much this world is filled with all sorts of different forms of life. But the puppets are primitive and ridiculous, of course. It is good they do not occupy much screen time. The plot is rich and nicely contrasts The Evil Galactic Empire with the rest of the world. The Empire represents technology and total control. It is mechanical and hostile. An interesting detail that should be mentioned is the fact that we don't even know if they inhabit planets or just use their colossal starships and battle stations at this point. They are the artificial. The rest of the characters are the natural living world even though they resort to technology.Obviously, more ""Star Wars"" material has been released since 1977. Some of it was a continuation of the story. Some of it was a precursor to the story. This one movie, however, is the source of it all. Not all of the visuals may have aged well, not to mention some of the ""special edition"" material, and the plot can also be rightfully criticized here and there. It is naive and could probably have been paced in a better way. Again, the beginning of the movie is great, then a smooth sailing for quite some time. But the action can get a little boring just past the equator. Not that it does any real damage with a finale as spectacular as it gets here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Landmark film,"How do you even review such a film? Hey, news flash, this was a great film, let me tell you all about it. One thing I'll say, it holds up over the years, and over repeat viewings. I loved how Lucas unfolded the story on the remote and arid planet of Tatooine, and the first half of the film is especially good, with all sorts of little things that add interest upon a re-watch.Some highlights overall:The scene with Luke Skywalker looking out at the double sunset, contemplating his destiny, as we hear a soaring part of John Williams' soundtrack.The band and all those aliens in the Mos Eisley space port.The menace of Darth Vader, one of cinema's all-time great villains. One of the imperial guys is skeptical of the Force and says to him ""Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort..."" Vader responds ""I find your lack of faith disturbing,"" and begins choking him from a distance. And how about James Earl Jones for the voice? Perfect.That epic moment between Darth and Obi-Wan, with this line: ""You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down I will become more powerful than you could possibly imagine."" How all of this would tie into the sequels and prequels was also just brilliant.Favorite bit of humor: C-3PO misinterpreting the cries of joy from the garbage compactor and saying ""Listen to them! They're dying, R2! Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough!""The second half of the film, starting with the bickering between Princess Leia and Han Solo during the rescue and from then on, gets to be a little cartoony and glossy for my taste, and to be honest I didn't think much of Hamill or Fisher's acting throughout the film ... but I feel as though I'm nitpicking, when I could have listed a lot more highlights that I almost take for granted now (the sand people, the whole concept of the Force, the character of Chewbacca, the amazing effects, Obi-Wan bamboozling the guards, the gravitas Alec Guiness and Peter Cushing bring to their parts, Luke swinging with Leia across that bridge ala true swashbuckling legends from Hollywood past, etc etc). Definitely a landmark film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A must see it again movie,"Star Wars episode lV is a subgenre to the genre of action films, other action films in this subgenre are star trek and space odyssey. George Lucas took space adventures and space travel to the next level of film fantasy, and was such an inspiring pioneer. Star Wars episode IV is a typical genre film that is shot digitally with incredible special effects. Star wars episode IV is based on the rival between the good and evil of the force, and how mankind once again must rely on the good of the force to protect the galaxies from Lord Vader and the dark side.George Lucas is a master of film editing and uses so many techniques in this film from fade in fade out, dissolve, establishing shot, shot/ reverse shot, eye line match, and fast cutting. Every scene seemed to flow smoothly from each sequence, and I felt so drawn into each scene that I was on the edge of my seat waiting for the next scene.Sound effects used in this film were incredible and extremely effective from the sounds of Lord Vader breathing you could just feel the power in his voice, and the sounds of the light sabers when battling. The sounds of the battleships and voices of Chewbacca, RC3PO, R2D2 and other characters were so real meaningful to their parts in the film. The music in the film had such a dramatic impact and theme in the film such as scenes with Lord Vader and the dark side. I felt that the music had such a mysterious tone that it gave me a sense of fear when shots and scenes of the dark side shown. The way Gorge Lucas used sound to each shot and scene was remarkable, because every sound had some meaning and made the scene come to life and so realistic. The sound effects I felt were synchronous sound and diegtic sound, and what drew me deeper into each sequence.When it comes to cinematography George Lucas was the pioneer of digital photography. I have the same feeling that George felt for digital photography it brings more clarity and realism to each shot. George was able to create films sets in digital photography that he couldn't have done using film. The film used many techniques from tight framing, loose framing, and symmetrical composition. Camera perspectives such as deep focus and zoom shot helped make the digital shots more to the mind of the viewers. Camera positions such as bird's eye view, eye level shot, and low angle shots made scenes more powerful and dramatic. I feel camera distance was a major focus on each shot because George wanted to give viewers the sense that they were right there in the scene. Viewers could see the details in every costume, set design, and how life like each subject looked. George used close up shots and medium shots on subjects when battling or in conversations. Extreme to long shots used when showing the Death Star battle cruisers passing by and the conflicts with the Galactic fighters. Camera movement such as panning, crane shots, and hand-held shots were incredible smooth between each shot and scene. I believe that the cinematography and sound brought the other aspects of the film together.I feel George Lucas wanted to create a film that reached out to all individuals by giving the power of imagination in space travel. Star Wars episode IV gives you hope that good will conquer evil, and if you believe in your inner self that anything can happen. All mise-en-scene of this film was done with high detail and a deep imagination. It is this detail and imagination that sticks in the minds of children and adults for generations to come. I have never enjoyed a film so much or was drawn into the film as much as Star Wars episode IV film. This film is a must see for the whole family and gets a two thumbs up.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Overrated,"In my opinion, Star Wars (1977) -- believed by many to be the film that started it all -- is in fact, a weak microcosm of what 70s Hollywood tried to accomplish, which was producing films such as the mentioned, with blockbuster budgets in light of attracting youngsters to the theater.Hollywood was quite successful in doing so, however, what has aroused my curiosity is the fact that despite the agreement of most people in the extremely poor quality of the audio/visual effects, the bad acting save the performance by great Alec Guinness, audiences have allowed the mere interesting story that's been as unique as Terminator and Matrix at their corresponding times; in addition the publicity given to Star Wars, aside from what we here from parents --teenagers/early teens of 70s-- effect their judgment.I saw this film for the 2nd time in my life in the class, and now as a film student, and never in my life have I seen such annoyance caused by ridiculous techniques used to assemble special effects, the horrible noises of the trashcan look alike R2d2, to which so much screen time is given.In my opinion as a movie fan and student the movie is quite terribly done, and by God don't start with ""Well, it's been done 30 years ago!""

The second best Star Wars.,"Let me just start off by saying that I will always love the first Star Wars film. However, to watch it as an adult is a much different experience than watching it when I was 10. It's still a very entertaining film, however there are a few reasons why this first installment of the trilogy doesn't hold up for me. First, Lucas's direction bothers me just as it has in the new films. Some of the scene transitions are just sloppy. If this had been a first film, all would be forgiven, but he had already done THX1138 and American Graffiti, the latter being one of my favorites of the 70s. Second is something I never noticed until the last couple of viewings. The actors in the film seem either bored or are just not sure about the lines they were speaking. With the exception of the voices (James Earl Jones and Anthony Daniels) all of the acting is very flat. I know this is nitpicking because the special effects are incredible, it's just that I can't, out of all 5 films so far, think of one truly exceptional performance besides Harrison Ford in Empire. This review is not meant to pan this film which I view as a classic. I just wanted to share some criticisms.I rate Star Wars Episode IV an 8 with points added for historical and sentimental value.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
What more can be said that hasn't been said already?,"Star Wars is possibly one of the biggest franchises of all time. Consisting of theatrical films and sequels, TV Shows and spinoffs, toys, and video games and much more I would imagine. It all started with the release of the first Star Wars film just simply titled Star Wars when released in 1977. Obviously, I was born in 2002 and know this film by it's retroactive title, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. But, like many people who have already reviewed this film, this film has had a huge impact on me in many ways. To be honest, as of the time that I wrote this review, the viewing was the first time in a couple of years. Star Wars was released in 1977 and was a surprise hit as nobody had much faith in the project to begin with. The film was such a success that, for a short time, it was the highest grossing film of all time. Critics loved the film upon release and even went on to win some Oscars. The film stars Mark Hamill, the late Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and much more. The film was popular enough that a sequel and an eventual series was made.The Empire has control over the galaxy. The Empire captures Princess Leia who is apart of the Rebel Alliance, a force that is fighting against the Empire. The Empire is looking for the stolen plans for their new superweapon, the Death Star. The plans manage to fall into the hands of a simple farmboy named Luke Skywalker who, along with a Jedi, a Wookie, a smuggler, and two droids go and try to rescue the princess and possibly help destroy the Empire.Star Wars has a massive legacy and a very good legacy as well. But let's just stick to this film specifically (and it will be hard to do so). Star Wars in 1977 was a unique film. Nobody seen anything like it before. The story by itself is rather simple and in later years has been copied but not quite ever been replicated. George Lucas (the director) took inspiration from the sci fi of his childhood like Flash Gordon and what not. It is funny seeing how after this film's release that many other sci fi media took inspiration from this film. The story sees a great character arc for Luke Skywalker from a simple farm boy to someone more mature and that is very apparent in the whole acting. Luke Skywalker in the beginning sounds whiney and annoying but as the film progresses, the whiney and annoyingness goes away. This was something I at first critiqued but someone brought up this point and had a compelling argument. Speaking of characters, the characters just in this film alone are very likeable and they only get more and more likeable in later films. Not only that, but character development is further improved in the later films. It is all rather simple. Very memorable and very likeable. They all make for an enjoyable viewing experience. The villain, Darth Vader proves to be a prominent villain though, again, it is further improved on in the next film. What Star Wars does best is in the world building department. In the first few minutes, a new viewer can easily get an idea of the world of Star Wars. It is a vast galaxy with many, many planets and creatures and the Empire has a big grasp over it all. The Mos Eisley scene is another example of world building with it's showcase of all of the different and unique creatures. The Force is yet another example of world building done right. Easily explained and one gets a good sense about the whole universe of Star Wars in only a few lines. Simple, yet also complex, but ever so effective. The action scenes are loads of fun to watch. I highly enjoy the blaster shoot outs. The space ship battles are fun too. Which leads me to the special effects and this one is going to be complicated. Why? Because I watched this film on the 2004 DVD release which is the Special Edition. Many people know the Special Edition and for newbies it is basically the original Star Wars film with newly added CGI effects and what not. Sure, those scenes that are heavily effected are not really of much significance and I can easily look past it. But holy crap are they bad. Not really bad but, let's just say not aged well. With that being said, the original effects are fantastic and truly hold up 40 plus years after being released and I believe this is one thing that made Star Wars very popular. The various miniatures and what not are all used effectively. Sure, there is an occasional green screen explosion that I can look past because think about the budget that this film was on. $11 million. Which is even more impressive if one thinks about it. It is somewhat hard to wrap this part of the review up because, again, what more can be said about this film that has not been said already?Star Wars was not supposed to be a masterpiece but yet it ends up being one. It is the hit nobody expected and watching it again reminds me how great the original trilogy of films are.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Two droids escape an Imperial attack and land on the desert planet Tatooine. Eventually falling into the hands of Luke Skywaker (Mark Hamill) the droids inadvertently bring together a disparate group who will battle against the mighty Empire.As the Emperor's lieutenant, Darth Vader (David Prowse/James Earl Jones) interrogates a rebel leader Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) a rescue mission is mounted by Luke, an old Jedi named Obi Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) with the mercenary help of smugglers Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew).Starting a franchise in the middle shows confidence in the product but it was the only choice for the young George Lucas as no one knew if the film would be successful. This episode is complete in and of itself so an obvious starting point.The effects are high quality, as are the sets and on a mind boggling scale too. All the actors put in now famous performances but the stand outs in this movie are definitely the surer hands of Peter Cushing and Alec Guinness who swallow the screen. Good job they are never on screen at the same time!Harrison Ford's breakout performance as Han Solo has become a template for the chaotic good buccaneer, leaning heavily on the shoulders of those 1930's/1940's movie swashbucklers. Nice to watch.I always thought it a shame Carrie Fisher decided not to act more. There's a fair portion of her mother's acting talent there.The droids are of course the central, pivotal characters of the Star Wars cycle. C-3PO and R2-D2 are lovingly brought to life by Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker.Anyone who's seen the charred remains on Tattooine must wonder how this is a U certificate.Even now many children of the '70s and '80s are split down Star Wars versus Star Trek lines. One thing you can be sure of is that A New Hope will never be refilmed.All of this and that magnificent orchestral soundtrack from John Williams!Things to look out for: lots of catchphrases and many many quotable lines, Denis Lawson as Wedge (?), the two elder statesmen of film, binary sunset, final battle with the Death Star, charred remains of Luke's aunt and uncle, those wonderful droids.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Good Wars,"Just an opinion. Star Wars. The name clearly shows what is seen in the movie, but it's amazing how the saga, or rather the ""universe"" Star Wars, does not pass the feeling that something is bad, something evil people, the image of Darth Vader with the music who makes perfect sync with him, is not enough to scare anyone. The death of Darth Maul may have been the scene of more thriller saga, and even had blood. I say this tongue in cheek, but of course shocking scenes of thriller genre are not part of Star War, and should not do. The complexity of the lifestyle of a Jedi is a portrait of a disciplined good nature. The Star Wars universe has no doubt, makes sure the existence of force and it is proved in all the skills displayed by the knights, it has the Force not as a god, but as something that connects everyone and made them everything. The trips are simple in hyperspace! I think George Lucas portrayed much our world in Star Wars, however left the dark side of the force less obscure than ours.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars - Movie Review,"Star Wars is directed by George Lucas and stars Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford as Han Solo and Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia. The film tells the story about Princess Leia who is captured and held hostage by the evil Imperial forces in their effort to take over the galactic Empire. Venturesome Luke Skywalker and dashing captain Han Solo team together with the loveable robot duo R2-D2 and C-3PO to rescue the beautiful princess and restore peace and justice in the Empire.This movie is absolutely amazing! The acting is fantastic, the music, the storyline. I love the characters in the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Lucas's masterful direction make this a great watch.,"Film history aside A new hope is just very good filmmaking. Much has been said about A new hope and I do not need to add to it except for the fact that this film is fantastic- well paced and featuring the appearance of so many memorable characters and scenes. Lucas as a young man sure had an eye for details and it's a pity how he lost this ability by the time he started filming the prequels. The locations, atmosphere and camerawork is so different than the later films it is hard to imagine they were both directed by the same man. Anyway if you haven't already then please watch A new hope and then slowly make your way through the entire saga.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The film that changed Hollywood (for better or worse); still amazing,"Yes, the original can still stand head and shoulders above the competition. One of the all-time biggest box office titans, the first film in the original STAR WARS trilogy is a 24-karat film classic in the same vein of such cinematic masterpieces as The WIZARD OF OZ (1939) and CASABLANCE (1942). Even the decades of sequels, lame knock-offs, and crass commercial tie-ins cannot dim the sheer brilliance of the ultimate space opera. When re-watching the film all these years later, it remains impossible not to get caught up once again in the film's irresistible sense of adventure and excitement.Much of what makes the film special (and what director/writer seems to have forgotten when creating his uneven prequel trilogy in the late-nineties/early-2000's) is the relative simplicity of the entire project. This is not to deny the various technical merits of the film, as Lucas is a true pioneer in large-scale effects-heavy film-making. The still-impressive special effects designed by Jonh Dysktra and John Stears set a new standard for film visual effects, and the production design and Rick Baker's make-up effects are top-notch without being overdone. Impressive as the film's technical merits remain, however, the film's true heart lies in good old fashioned story-telling.In the end, STAR WARS excels as entertainment simply because it is a great story told in an fresh and inventive manner. The characters have all justifiably become pop culture icons, especially Mark Hamill's quintessential put-on hero Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford's quick-witted pilot Han Solo, and everyone's favorite bickering robots, C-P3O and R2-D2. The perfect amount of sophistication is brought to the proceedings by screen legend Alec Guinness, who delivers a performance of great nuance and indisputable class. Best of all is the infamous Darth Vader (sinisterly voiced by James Earl Jones), who remains one of the silver screen's greatest villains.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars Review,"I loved Star Wars and so will you, unless you're . . . oh well, I hope you're not...Star Wars is a hell of a lot of fun and Lucas makes fun a sparkling pop metaphor for the sheer joy of goodness that could even make friends out of men, mutations and machines.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A cinematic achievement,"There is not much to say about the original Star Wars movie which haven't already been said a million times. These movies have been analyzed in multiple levels, but the best way to describe the original one, in my humble opinion, is: this movie is a celebration. A celebration of movie-making as a visual media, with an endurable and magic story, full of adventure and excitement: that's the lasting appeal of Star Wars. Aside of all the hype or pseudo-intellectualism surrounding the criticisms of the movie, the simple fact is that it's just a familiar story (""The peasant rescues the princess and becomes a knight""), told in such a visually creative way and funny mood, that it becomes something entirely fresh and new.Leaving aside the criticism George Lucas deserves for some other movies he made before and after ""Star Wars"", it's undeniable that this was his finest hour, and one of the finest moments in cinematic history.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
What sort of bad thing can you say about a movie like this?,"The first time I ever heard anything about Star Wars was in the fifth grade. My uncle is definitely a crazed fan, so he bought it for me immediately when he heard I never saw it.  I can easily say one of the best movies of all time.  The story was incredibly good and the acting was terrific.  Very believable (unlike a certain episode 1 that we all know about).  This was a great start for the trilogy and shouldn't have been messed with in 1999. Oh, and I was equally impressed when I got the last ones too.  A must see above all others.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Star Wars,"On the one hand, there is boundless longing for science and technology, and on the one hand, the return to the narrative tradition of myths and stories. The sloppy death, the scene of 3P0 and R2 in the desert is the most classic, the soft curve and texture of 3PO are derived from the robot Maria in ""Metropolis"", and later the nature of robots like Wali,Even though the special effects of ""Star Wars"" seem so simple today, it does not prevent this sci-fi pioneer from being a timeless classic. It has an epoch-making significance in the technological revolution of film production. The tension of the plot, the exciting soundtrack, the wonders about the universe are so amazing, creating this fascinating dream of light and shadow.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
