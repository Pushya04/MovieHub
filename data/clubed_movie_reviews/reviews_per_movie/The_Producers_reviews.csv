The Producers: 9/10,"When you see a movie once and think it's hilarious, that's a good sign. When you see a movie about a half-dozen times and think it's still hilarious, that's more than a good sign. That means that not only can you put up with seeing it multiple times, but you also find new things that you didn't see before. Plus, there are some scenes that are too hilarious not to laugh at! The chemistry between stars doesn't hurt, either. What movie am I talking about? Mel Brooks' The Producers, his most sustained and inspired piece of lunacy!Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel have amazing chemistry as meek accountant Leo Bloom and scheming Broadway producer Max Bialystock. Max seduces little old ladies for checks, and when Leo comes into his office one day, he finds that a producer can make more money with a flop instead of a hit. They decide to do his ploy, and create the world's worst play, Springtime for Hitler (a gay romp with Adolf and Eva), and meet interesting characters, including author Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars), director Roger DeBris (Christopher Hewett), and their Hitler, Lorenzo St.DuBois, aka L.S.D. (Dick Shawn).What makes this comedy such a gem is its mixture of types of comedy. There is slapstick, there's satire, there's bad taste, and everything but the kitchen sink! The scenes I have seen so many times, but what makes me love them is how they, mainly Wilder, play their roles. Wilder is somewhat crazy, and relies on his blanket to calm himself down. Not only does he have comic perfection, he's a darned good actor to boot! Mostel is great as the would-be sleazy loser-producer, with eye movements that put Silent Bob to shame and a great voice.The songs in it are great, also. Two of them were written by Brooks himself, `Springtime for Hitler' (with which I have auditioned for a role in a musical with) and `Prisoners of Love'. They're both very funny (real Brooks-ian) (note to Merriam-Webster: include that word right next to `bling-bling'). It's not exactly a musical, but The Producers is in a class of its own. Long live The Producers!My rating: 9/10Rated PG for bad taste and homosexual themes.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Zany Mel Brooks comedy is over-the-top laugh riot...,"There are so many laughs in THE PRODUCERS (long before Mel Brooks lost his magic touch), that you'll be in tears by the time Brooks gets to his ""Springtime for Hitler"" routine. ZERO MOSTEL's early scenes with ESTELLE WINWOOD are hilarious enough, but he and GENE WILDER top themselves by the time you get to the frantic ending.LEE MEREDITH is the curvy Ulla who can shake a mean hip and DICK SHAWN is the hilariously daffy Lorenzo St. DuBois (LSD for short), and everyone in the cast has a fine time delivering over-the-top performances in the spirit in which this sort of satire requires.The story is simply that of a producer running short on cash who devises a scheme whereby if he produces the worst musical in the world, he can actually get his investment back and then some. He convinces his mild-mannered bookkeeper GENE WILDER to join him in the scheme and then the fun gets off to a great start.The climactic ""Springtime for Hitler"" is just one of the delirious highlights (if politically incorrect by today's standards), and is probably the reason so many of the comments here resent the film and everything it stands for. But there's no getting away from it--the script is downright brilliant and original--winning an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and numerous other writing awards including an award from The Writer's Guild of America.Summing up: Mel Brooks at his wittiest.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
What a film.,"Why this movie is brilliant and funny:
1-A hilarious Gene Wilder with his amazing freak-out moments. I think many actors copied his scenes from this film.2-Excellent satire about hitler and nazis. Many lines from this film are recognizable and became a comedy standard.3-Amazing performance by Dick Shaw as L. S. D and as the theatrical hitler. He is funny and subversive at the same time.4-Great 1on1 scenes with the main actors, especially the ones which involve heavy physical acting.5- It is intelligent filmmaking which shows how progressive and funny Mel Brooks was; and that was his first film...Just watch it, it's 1,5h and it's beautifully funny! 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Mel Brooks' Masterpiece,"THE PRODUCERS might just be the funniest film ever made. It stars Zero Mostel, as a bankrupt Broadway producer, and Gene Wilder, as his emotionally-retarded accountant. Together, they figure that they could actually make more money producing a flop than a hit, so they become producers and put on ""Springtime for Hitler,"" a sure-fire flop. However, things go horribly ""right,"" and soon the producers find themselves in a tight spot trying to repay their investors. It is not the flop they hoped for, and they wind up in jail, with a hilarious finale.This is Mel Brooks' masterpiece. Brooks' won an Oscar for Best Screenplay-1968-no surprise,as this is as funny a film ever to be made! The song should've won an Oscar, as it is one of the most hilarious tunes to come out of any movie.",,Anonymous,Music
A little bit disappointed,"From what I have heard about it I was a little disappointed with this Mel Brooks creation. The movie has aged poorley, with many jokes that aren't funny. It's often slow and draged out, but the jokes that do work almost makes up for it. The best thing about it is the general plot idea and the climax. Overall, the movie was okay and interesting to watch but it's lacking something.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Before Broadway, There Was The Movie","A down-on-his-luck Broadway producer, Max Biolystock (Zero Mostel), is reduced to funding his shows by romancing old ladies for cash. Enter neurotic accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), arriving at Biolystock's apartment to do his books. Upon discovering that Biolystock had extorted $2000.00 from his last Broadway flop, Bloom, simply on a whim, mentions to Biolystock that he could've made a fortune on the flop if he'd only gotten more money from the old ladies. Needless to say, this revelation gets Max's mind working---get the old ladies to invest $1,000,000 on what Biolystock knows will be a surefire flop, then run off with the excess cash! Max convinces the gullible Leo to join him on the scheme, and off the two men go, on a crusade to produce the biggest disaster Broadway has ever seen. They come across a god-awful work written by a former Nazi (Kenneth Mars) called ""Springtime For Hitler,"" and decide to produce it. If it's a flop, Max & Leo will become rich. But if it's a hit, they'll go to jail....If you're one of the infinite many who've been unable to secure any of those scorching-hot tickets to Mel Brooks' current Broadway phenomenon, ""The Producers,"" there's always this, the original 1968 movie version to watch & enjoy. This Oscar-winner for Best Screenplay is a comedy classic, and easily Mel Brooks' masterpiece, a brilliantly funny film that hasn't aged a bit. Zero Mostel & Gene Wilder are hilarious & perfectly cast as the con-artist producers, with terrific chemistry between them (just their opening scene together, including the great bits about Leo's blue blanket, and Leo terrified of being jumped on by Max, is already one of the great filmed moments of comic acting). Kudos all around to the rest of the cast, too: Kenneth Mars as the deranged Nazi playwright of ""Springtime For Hitler,"" Christopher Hewett as the no-talent gay director who only makes ""Springtime"" even more misguided than it already is, Dick Shawn in an outrageous performance as L.S.D., the hippie ham who lands the coveted role of Hitler (his audition song, ""Love Power,"" is a major highlight), and the gorgeous Lee Meredith as Ulla, Max & Leo's dimwitted secretary. And then there's the ""Springtime For Hitler"" production number itself---yes, it's everything you've ever heard about it, a wonderfully hysterical ""you gotta see it to believe it"" moment in film comedy.Mel Brooks' direction is spot on, and his hysterical screen writing here has never been better (though his co-writing with Gene Wilder on ""Young Frankenstein"" comes close). His Oscar win for the screenplay was very well deserved, indeed. ""The Producers"" is a timeless comedy classic, and the defining moment of Mel Brooks' long illustrious film career.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
How to succeed in show business without really trying,"Leave it to Leo Bloom to figure out the possibilities in having the worst show on Broadway, and yet, make a bundle by collecting a small fortune from innocent old ladies investing their savings in it. It's no wonder Max Bialystock jumps for joy upon hearing about how to really succeed in show business without really trying!This 1968 version of Mel Brooks' ""The Producers"" is a much better film than the recent one unveiled at the end of 2005. We had watched the original movie some time ago and we thought it was quite funny. On second viewing though, some of the fun one had that first time, seems to have disappeared somehow. It seems inconceivable, but this time we found little to laugh about, although this version should have been the definite one because of the presence of Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder is far superior than the stars seen on the latest version.Zero Mostel was a colossus in the New York stage. He was a man who could do anything at all and still give an honest performance to everything he did. It was Mr. Mostel's misfortune to have been blacklisted at a time where his career was at an all time high. When film work stopped, Mr. Mostel had the theater to go back. Who knows how far this actor would have gone if he hadn't been a victim of the McCarthym that ruined many lives.Zero Mostel made a creation out of Max Bialystock. This was a man who had seen better days in his producing career days and now finds himself dodging his creditors because he doesn't have the money to pay his debts and has to rely in his stable of old ladies for living. Zero Mostel was the perfect man to play this larger than life character.Gene Wilder, whose second film this is, showed from the beginning to be a genius in the movies. His Leo Bloom was an excellent creation and his chemistry with Zero Mostel seems to be real. The film owes a great deal of its success to Gene Wilder who acts as the straight man.In supporting roles we see Kenneth Mars as the lunatic author of the musical. Christopher Hewett is the gay director who turns the material into a great musical. Lee Meredith makes Ulla fun to watch. Dick Shawn who plays Hitler, makes a good impression. Also some other faces in the cast, Estelle Winwood, Renee Taylor, William Hickey, Frank Campanella, Madelyn Cates, all New York based actors with long experience in the stage and screen.Mel Brooks was going for laughs, and at times, he succeeds brilliantly.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A Milestone in Film-making,"The DVD release of ""The Producers"" sends me every viewing back to 1968 when I first saw this brilliant, barrier-smashing comedy. Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder were the perfect pair to bring to life the adventures of a Broadway faded impresario, now a con man, and his neurotic, hyper, accountant accomplice.Together they fleece old ladies, something Mostel's Max Bialystock was doing before the auditor, Max Bloom, came by to check the books. Mostel's seduction of the old, the awful and the ugly has no equal in movie physical comedy.The scheme: put on the worst flop imaginable and when it closes virtually after opening night the two scammers snare riches: the investments they don't have to return. But if the show is a hit...The producers' vehicle, ""Springtime for Hitler,"" both brought audiences to a new level of appreciation for the malleable, creative power of film and...it made some viewers genuinely nervous, even upset.Following Steve Allen's observation that a formula for comedy based on history is Tragedy+Time, director Mel Brooks brought to the screen, less than a quarter century after World War II ended, Dick Shawn as a campy fuehrer surrounded by the Nazi counterpart of the Rockettes. And Max and Leo are clearly Jewish in character if not so openly identified.Kenneth Mars grabs laughs as the author of ""Springtime for Hitler,"" an unreconstructed, Hitler-adoring flake who raises pigeons on the roof of a Manhattan tenement while accoutered in the odd leftovers of Wehrmacht uniforms.When I fitted in seeing ""The Producers"" in its opening week I sat in the middle of an audience that was, to a certain extent, as befuddled as the film's playgoers watching the first part of the intended-to-outrage musical comedy about the Third Reich. Not only were SS uniforms, swastikas and photos of Hitler on the ""stage"" but the movie theater audience also digested, perhaps for the first time, a send-up of an uproarious gay couple, two real queens. One is effeminate to the core, the other is a cross-dresser (and a faultlessly garish one at that). This kind of stuff hadn't been done before in a Hollywood flick.1968's audience had many who well-remembered World War II and some had fought in the conflict. I knew people who admitted feeling that the horrific global battle against Hitler had been trivialized by Brooks and his extroverted cast - until they could no longer hold back guffaws that segued rapidly into uncontrolled laughter.That ""The Producers"" is also now a runaway Broadway hit is no surprise and I'd love to see a DVD release with Lane and Broderick. However fine they would be, it's the original that broke barriers.The DVD has a number of worthwhile features including a fascinating ""Making of..."" segment. Peter Seller's short, famous encomium is read and there are the usual other additions. An outtake presenting an alternative blow-up of the ""Springtime for Hitler"" theater is interesting, largely because it shows how perceptive Brooks was in scrapping it for the shorter scene actually used.""The Producers"" is, in some ways, a subversive movie. Without stridently proclaiming a new aesthetic, it is exactly that and so it's a timeless classic. This is not satire about Nazism, Hitler and the Third Reich. It's treating as suitable material for slapstick and quick gags the detritus of an evil time.But it's also a bit dated, no subject is taboo today for comedic treatment, and many who see it for the first time (as my teenage son did tonight) will enjoy the movie without getting the full impact of its assault on conventionality.Is there any historical topic that will not, in the passage of time, be employed for pure comedy? Is it possible that the next generation will laugh at a comedy parodying Auschwitz? I hope not but I also can't be sure.Many years ago I refused to watch ""Hogan's Heroes"" on TV because I personally knew former U.S. POWs. But that show, with Werner Klemperer as Colonel Klink, was very popular. ""Hogan's Heroes"" was to TV what ""The Producers"" was, and is, to film. And both made a mark that will be emulated as future generations go beyond satire to humorous treatment of matters most today consider beyond the pale of acceptability as a vehicle for laughs.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Music
You fish-faced enemy of the people,"This was Mel Brook's first big success which he wrote, directed but did not act in. Over three decades later he turned it into a successful Broadway play and there was a remake with Nathan Lane in 2005. The legendary black-listed comedian Zero Mostel (one of the original Hollywood Undesirable 12) plays a failed Broadway producer Max Bialystok who has taken to scamming old ladies. A young Gene Wilder (the fish-faced enemy of the people) is an accountant who has the disastrous idea that an unsuccessful play can earn more money than a successful one.He and Max sell shares for their sure-fire flop Springtime for Hitler - written by a Nazi psycho. They sell shares for slightly more than 100% - more in the vicinity of 25,000%, but thats OK because a play portraying Hitler as the hero is bound to fail right? Wrong! We have the lead actor playing Hitler - called LSD (another in-joke I think!)to thank for that.While some of the dialogue is certainly funny, personally I think the film didn't age too well. I saw it for the famed Zero who originated the Tevye role in Fiddler on the Roof on Broadway, because I'd never seen him before in any movie. But, I understand the Nathan Lane remake is better.I don't know if I'll see that soon, but anyone wanting to see The Producers may want to watch the newer version instead which is supposed to be better than the original.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
This Quotable Classic is Still One of Mel Brooks' Very Best,"I know more people who quote lines from THE PRODUCERS than from Shakespeare; make of that what you will! :-) That said, people seem to either love it or hate it, but most folks I know agree this nutzoid farce has, to quote groovy LSD (delightful Dick Shawn), ""Love Power!"" Writer/director Mel Brooks' insanely zany yet strangely sweet tale of down-on-his-luck Broadway producer Max Bialystock (the great Zero Mostel, who should have been nominated for an Oscar himself) who uses his powers of persuasion (and wheedling, and bellowing, and conning :-) to convince meek accountant Leo Bloom (justifiably Oscar-nominated Gene Wilder) to help him make a surefire Broadway flop that, if their nutty book-cooking scheme works, will land them in Rio -- or, if it doesn't work, Sing Sing. This screamingly funny, no-holds-barred comedy won Mel Brooks an Oscar for Best Screenplay and put the former YOUR SHOW OF SHOWS writer on the map as a filmmaker. Anyone trying to make a comedy depending on controversy and questionable taste for its laughs should watch THE PRODUCERS first and see how a master does it! For that matter, Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder ought to watch it again themselves; after the duds they were churning out for a while there, maybe they need a refresher course in how to be funny. (Hell, it might be as simple as them teaming up again; Wilder seemed able to temper Brooks's mania for poo-poo humor and Brooks seemed able to help Wilder to better balance out his trademark blend of shrill hysteria and sweetness.) Much as my family and I also loved the Broadway and film editions of the musical version co-written by Brooks and Thomas Meehan and starring the incomparable Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick (even though I felt that Broderick wasn't quite as good as Leo Bloom as Lane was as Max Bialystock. That said, together they have great buddy chemistry), the original is still the champ.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Springtime For Mel Brooks,"For Mel Brooks, The Producers is the gift that keeps on giving. The film, the Broadway musical based on the film, the second film based on the Broadway musical...maybe you can make more money with a flop than with a hit but I'm sure Brooks has done just fine for himself with The Producers. And this is certainly no flop.A plot summary seems rather unnecessary as most everyone should be familiar with the story. And the story is really secondary anyway, there really only to set up a succession of jokes, sight gags and one outrageously funny, utterly brilliant musical number. The film is not always uproariously funny. For much of its running time it inspires mild chuckles rather than gut-busting laughs. It's a movie that certainly has its moments but it is not consistently hilarious. But just when you think this might be just another reasonably amusing comedy it happens. ""Springtime for Hitler."" The musical number so perfect, so outrageous, so impossibly funny that it elevates the movie as a whole. In this moment everything comes together and the comic payoff is priceless.Some of the jokes and gags do fall a little flat but overall the film always manages to be entertaining. The cast is terrific. If it is true that opposites attract Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder could not be any more perfect in their roles as Max and Leo, the producers themselves. The bombastic Mostel and jittery Wilder play off one another brilliantly. They are the two central characters but they are surrounded by a terrific ensemble which really brings the lunacy of Mel Brooks to life. Kenneth Mars as a deranged Nazi playwright, Christopher Hewett as a ludicrously flamboyant Broadway director and Dick Shawn as a hippie Hitler are among the standouts. And while her screen time is minimal Lee Meredith is an absolute treat in the role of Ulla, Max's Swedish receptionist. Ulla may not be much of a receptionist but she sure is fun to watch. In the end The Producers is a real treat. Other movies may be more consistently funny but this one is certainly funny enough. And it has that one transcendent moment which is simply as good as film comedy gets. Well done Mel Brooks. Turns out you can make plenty of money with a hit.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Terribly overrated!,"The opening title scene is a little funny, but not the rest of the movie. The performances are, especially Zero Mostel's, extremely overacted which belong to the night club, not on the screen. Mel Brooks never learns that ""less is more"" in terms of film acting.

A Classic!,"This is a classic film with wonderful performances all around (although I didn't take to Dick Shawn's as much as the others). Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder were perfect casting as was Christopher Hewitt (later to be known as TV's ""Mr. Belvedere""). What's even more impressive are the various elements of truth that are beneath the histerical if not obsurbed storyline. The current Broadway hit doesn't compete with this film. The performances are good on stage but not as wonderful as here. Due to long term business problems this film wasn't released for home video and cable until much later then it should have been.

"""Hitler was a great painter!  He could paint an entire apartment in one day, . . Two Coats! ""","Mel brooks' first attempt at directing is this film "" The Producers, "" originally entitled ""Spring Time For Hitler.""

Great film through and through,"One of my favorite lines from ""The Producers,"" was the one where Max Bialystock read the play about the man who turned into a giant cockaroack, and said ""It's too good."" How can you go wrong there? As for Roger DeBris's secretary/lover, I'd like to know if Mel Brooks named him after the Volkswagen Karman Ghia, and just changed the spelling, because until I saw this movie, whenever I heard the words ""Karman Ghia,"" I thought of the car. Furthermore, Lorenzo St. DuBois's song ""Love Power,"" was butchered on the soundtrack. I know it was played for laughs, but it's still a halfway decent song. I'm surprised that some band never did a remake of it.  This movie IS one of the funniest of all time, and had an incredible impact on me as well. On occasions where I've visited Lincoln Center in NYC, I've had to fight the temptation to prance around the water fountain  and shout ""I'LL DO IT!!,"" at the top of my lungs. I wouldn't be surprised if other people have done things like that over there.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
An amusing gem that works despite not being hilarious,"I'm not a fan of Mel Brooks. At all. For a comedy director, I find him painfully unfunny and therefore very difficult to like. The Producers is often cited to be Brooks' best film, and for good reason; as it is. Although it never reaches the realms of hilarity, and quite a few of the gags aren't funny in the slightest, it's a breezy little comedy that's based around an amusing idea and is hard to dislike on the whole. The idea is that a Broadway producer can, in theory, make more money from a flop than he could from a hit. When accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) suggests that this could be the case, a plan forms in the mind of once great producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel), and we're on course for an amusing ride as the two set out to find the worst play ever written (a drama called ""Springtime for Hitler"" eventually wins out), and pull out all the stops to ensure it's a sure-fire Broadway flop!Through a stark colour scheme and overacting from all concerned, Mel Brooks succeeds in creating a distinct comic-book style that lends the film a very comedic, and fun, edge that few films have succeeded in capturing adequately since. The cast helps this film enormously, with everyone giving hammy performances that help in creating the film's sense of fun. Brooks regular Gene Wilder is, of course, the star of the show despite not being the absolute central character. His performance is more subdued than Mostel's, but still very over the top. The play itself features a very tasteless, yet very amusing and catchy opening song that will no doubt be swirling around your head for days afterwards. The play itself is actually the funniest thing about the film, with most of the hilarity coming from the monumental miscasting of an Elvis impersonator-esquire character calling himself 'L.S.D.' (Dick Shawn) in the role of the fuhrer himself.Overall, this is a very fun film. The sense of fun is carried throughout, even if the jokes don't always work. I can almost guarantee a good time from watching this movie and it's one that fans of this sort of film shouldn't go without seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Amusing and fun,"Some of the scenes in this movie are outrageous. Zero Mostel is so hilarious, I'm surprised he wasn't a bigger star in his days.

Just possibly the most over-rated comedy of all time,"The Producers has very much made its mark on popular culture... the successful Broadway show, West End show and recent remake would all go to suggest that this is some kind of comedy masterpiece. I'm afraid to say it is not.The plot contains some good ideas and a couple of brilliant ones. But the script is juvenile, crude and generally silly without being funny.

A gay romp through a great film,"This is a marvellous piece - a combination of utter farce, black humour, Jewish schtick and high camp, ""The Producers"" remains a truly wonderful film.From the opening sequences, where Theatre agent Max is a despairing old fool trying to avoid tax, through the ""little old lady seduction"" scenes, to the gorgeous rooftop scene where a mad German pigeon fancier tries to remain within the bounds of sanity and fails, via the meeting with ""top"" Hollywood director Roger"" we're not alone"" de Bris, the film traces the hapless and eponymous producers who devise a foolproof scheme to make money out of a flop.  They employ a Nazi writer to script the musical ""Springtime for Hitler"", which is guaranteed to be a flopperoony. Of course, they manage to totally miss the mood of the day and the projected flop is a huge hit - whereupon they have to pay back the 16,000 percent of the cost that they acquired....Wild, manic, joyous and deeply perceptive, this is Mel Brooks at his finest - Jewish gags abound, but never alienate, accountants get the mickey taken (cheers all round!) and the final production - well, if you haven't seen this film, where have you been living?

"""Bad taste is simply saying the truth before it should be said."" -Mel Brooks","In 21st Century America, the one feature of The Producers that astounds even today is the boisterous, exaggerated, confrontational impulsiveness of its two lead performances. But in 1968, the film's content was like a suicide bombing of the audience's idea of good manners. There's such greed in its heroes, such merry deceit, such eagerness to concede every ethic, that the 1968 audience just had to surrender, stick with it. How did Brooks get away with that? By proving the dishonorable struggle of both lead characters at the start, by casting them with actors you couldn't help liking. Mostel's Max Bialystock is a man whose yearnings are so measureless they exonerate his voracity. There's a scene where he rubs his grubby office window with coffee, peeps through the dirt, sees a white Rolls-Royce and shouts, ""That's it, baby! When you've got it, flaunt it!"" You can drink a tall glass of his gluttonous self-indulgence. ""Look at me now! I'm wearing a cardboard belt!"" It's characteristic of this movie that after he says the line, he rips off the belt, tears it to smithereens.Mostel, a distinguished thespian, blacklist foil, and academic, here gives a tour de force of low comedy. Regardless of a comb-over that starts just above his clavicle, he propels buoyant egotism, spitting on his hand to slick back his hair before an elderly female investor enters for her weekly frolic. What Mostel propels in particular is unreserved self-assurance. He never has doubts. Maybe he never thinks at all, just simply carries on out of evolutionary necessity.Wilder was a fresh mug in 1968, familiarized to audiences with a significant supporting role in Bonnie and Clyde a year before, also as a rather hysterical character. His performance in The Producers is a tinge short of cardiac arrest. On the floor with Mostel over him, he shrieks, ""Don't jump! Don't jump!"" Mostel begins to leap in a flurry. ""I'm hysterical! I'm hysterical!"" Mostel pours a glass of water and chucks it in his face. Wilder serves a perfect line: ""I'm wet! I'm hysterical, and I'm wet! I'm in pain, and I'm wet, and I'm still hysterical!"" Gene and Zero reel on the floor so violently we expect them to chew on one another. Mostel's so overexcited and feral, Wilder so flustered and frantic, you marvel that slobber didn't get on the camera lens. The entire movie's toned on that plane of turbulent anxiety. One of the delights of watching it is to see how the actors are able to manage timing and distinctions even while shrieking. Timing is in the hands of actors, but without scripts, there would be loads of tedious improvisation. Good timing in the written words is the gateway to good timing on screen. I'm sure we'd be surprised at how snappish the dialogue seems on the page. But Brooks, a veteran nightclub act himself, leaves space for delivery while simultaneously working economically with form. Characters repeat the last thing another character said to extend the laugh. Characteristic of Brooks, that's often what causes the laugh. Language is ecstasy to him.Kenneth Mars is a militant live-action cartoon, up on the roof with his pigeons, singing Nazi songs, later commanding an audience member to stop laughing because ""I am the author! I outrank you!"" Brooks includes gay jokes, with the ostentatious couple of Broadway director Roger De Bris and his right-hand Carmen Giya. At one point Max, Leo and Carmen crowd into a teeny elevator, and are ejected breathless and ill-at-ease. Heterosexuality's epitomized by the nubile Lee Meredith, as Ulla, the voluptuous secretary, who types one letter at a time then stops for a pat-on-the-back smile. The other terrific performance is by Dick Shawn as the actor who plays Hitler. In a movie made at the pinnacle of the hipster era, he's a hippie comprised out of archetypal junk scraps, with his finger cymbals, soup can necklace and knee-high shag boots.To produce a musical named Springtime for Hitler is naturally in the worst achievable taste, as an exiting audience member remarks in the movie, to the glee of Bialystock and Bloom, who're depending upon precisely that response. To make a movie about such a musical was also in bad taste, apparently. It's clear that Bialystock and Bloom are Jewish, but they never touch on that. As Franz Liebkind rages, they nod, because the more repugnant he is, the more liable his play will fail. Brooks throws in merely one brief flash to indicate their personal feelings. As the two men walk away from the playwright's apartment, Bloom covers the red-and-black Nazi armband Franz has given him. ""All right, take off the armband,"" says Bialystock, taking off his own. They throw both armbands into a garbage can and spit in it.Whilst jabbing at the troubles of Broadway, Brooks' directorial debut's concerned with two overtly Jewish characters who are, in the best tradition of Jewish comedy, doomed to failure, in a film steaming with conflict on every level. Whilst there may be a prominently Jewish-American sensibility about Brooks' work, it's a feature that he's chosen to leave out after this film, apart from the Yiddish Native American chief in Blazing Saddles, the metal detector scene in High Anxiety, occasional comments in To Be or Not To Be and the fictitious trailer for Jews in Space in History of the World Part I. But what he's maintained, and what I feel---having grown up in a family of Brooks fanatics---is what makes a particular generation enjoy him so insatiably, is a pure audacity, mischievous delight, eagerness to leap any bound for a laugh. They'll say, ""Ah, comedy today's all eff this, eff that, fart on this, have sex with that. It's all bad taste."" And I say, look at your boy Mel. He knows better than any of them: Bad taste can taste the best.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Laugh-Out-Loud Funny Stuff,"How can a Broadway producer who has seen his day really make a lot of money? Leave it to writer/director Mel Brooks to answer that, and answer it he does in the uproarious comedy `The Producers.'  Zero Mostel stars as the producer in question, one Max Bialystock, with Gene Wilder co-starring as Leo Bloom, the meek accountant who steers Max onto the path to instant riches with a scheme that (in Max's hands) simply can't fail.  With Leo on board as his new partner, Max embarks upon a search for the perfect script, the first step of the plan that will lead them to the pot of gold at the end of the Great White Way.  And with Brooks at the helm, it's the beginning of a laugh-filled movie that gets funnier every time you see it. 	Mostel is perfect as the unflappable Max, the charlatan who woos a string of old ladies into becoming investors in his show; his personality and countenance match the broad approach Brooks takes with his comedy, and it's a fit made in comedic heaven.  Wilder, however, nearly steals the show with his terrific, definitive `long' takes and sideward glances that have served him so well during his career.  Here, in one of his first screen appearances, he works it perfectly, creating just the right counter-balance to Mostel's boldness, and it makes Leo a truly memorable character. Visually, there is enough in this film to generate plenty of laughs, but that it's delivered with wonderfully witty and clever dialogue as well (the screenplay earned Brooks an Oscar), makes it a true classic in anybody's book. 	Also unforgettable here are Kenneth Mars, as Franz Liebkind, author of the play that Max and Leo undertake to produce; Christopher Hewett, as Roger De Bris; and especially Dick Shawn, as Lorenzo Saint DuBois (`L.S.D.' to his friends), who becomes the star of Max and Leo's production.  Rounding out the great supporting cast are Estelle Winwood (`Hold me, touch me' old lady), Lee Meredith (Ulla), Renee Taylor (Eva Braun), Andreas Voutsinas (Carmen Giya), and William Hickey (Good Natured Inebriate). 	`The Producers' is every bit as funny now as when it debuted in 1968, maybe even funnier; it proves that good comedy is timeless, and this is comedy at it's best.  This is a must-see, not only for Mel Brooks' fans, but for anyone who just likes lots of good laughs.  Believe me, this is one funny movie you're going to want to see again and again.  I rate this one 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Funny enough,"This movie IS funny, all right, but not as funny as everyone claims it is. Ok, there are two or three hilarious moments, but what is there beyond that? I kept smiling throughout the movie but I hardly laughed. It is definitely cleverly written though. I wouldn't argue about that. Actually , I think that The Producers' best feature is the underlying comment it makes on the unreasonable acclaim that cheap products (plays, movies, songs etc.) get from the masses sometimes. It is a very good satire, I just wish there had been a different ending, perhaps a less ""easy"" and obvious one. It is worth watching, though. I haven't regretted watching it by any means.almost 7",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A fantastic jab at all that is good and holy... ;),"I love this movie.  It is not the greatest comedy in the world, but it IS something that must be seen to be beleived.  Overall, the first 3/4 of the movie is absolutely fantastic, and the final 1/4 approaches the sublime. However, the movie does miss a few spots here and there and there are quite a few jokes that were probably a lot funnier in '68 than they are now (this film does not translate as well as Blazing Saddles, but is still a damn funny movie).Ultimately, none of that stuff really matters, as the only truly important part could justify the rest of the film being a blank screen... the performance of Springtime for Hitler is, quite simply, one of the most beautifully absurd things that the world has ever been witness to.  This one single scene was so vulgar and hilarious and offensive that many were paralyzed over how to react to it when it was released (much like the audience in the film itself).  You may find yourself having to rewind it several times in order to catch all of the wonderfully obscene lyrics (not South Park obscene, just obscene), but you will find it worth your while.Unfortunately, Brooks seems to back down from his initial premise and softens the blow of the play a bit with some cheap shots at the 60s counter-culture (not that there is really anything but cheap shots to take at hippies, but he does it anyway).  The film achieves truly sublime humor for a few minutes and then falls back into a pretty standard (if inspired and somewhat brilliant) comedy.This film is definitely worth seeing, perhaps several times.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Dare I say it, comedy classic?","Admittedly The Producers is very tasteless but in a triumphant way. In short, The Producers is a comedy classic to me and one of my personal favourite Mel Brooks comedies. The story is a great one about two men who team up to fleece theatrical investors with the worst play of all time- a musical biopic of Adolf Hitler, while the script is constantly hilarious. The gags flow with ease, with the numbers from Springtime for Hitler faring best of all, they are just jaw-dropping. The two leads are wonderful, Zero Mostel as the down-on-his-luck impresario and Gene Wilder as the shy accountant, as is Dick Shawn as the hippy star who takes the lead in the production. Overall, brilliant, tasteless but very funny. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Winter for Poland and France!,"A lot of the humour in Mel Brooks famous film 'The Producers' is pretty broad brush, and some of it is dated. What's more surprising, perhaps, is just how dated its portrait of Manhattan is, a place without any of its current glamour, instead populated by Jewish hustlers, Nazi veterans, proto-hippies, and people of what is clearly presented as deviant sexuality. And yet there are some very funny moments (especially the titular song), even if Brooks's approach seems to be to throw everything at the wall to see what sticks. That this story of a musicial has itself been turned into an actual musical is rather less surprising, given its essentially theatrical structure. If (like me until very recently) you somehow haven't seen it, it's certainly worth watching once.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The Producers: a masterpiece,"Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) and Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) are trying to find a sure flop play to get a lot of cash.Then they run into a play called Springtime for Hitler.That's a sure failure.A play written by a Nazi fanatic, no one wants to see that, right? The Producers is a Mel Brooks masterpiece from 1968.It has got the best actors.Zero is far from zero in the lead.Gene Wilder also guarantees you laughs.Kenneth Mars makes Nazis look ridiculous, which they were. Christopher Hewett is hilarious playing the actor, who plays Hitler on stage.That wouldn't have made Adolf proud, but I really don't care. This is some brilliantly written stuff, which isn't a surprise since it was written by Mel Brooks.People still seem to love The Producers.I mean, a lot of people went to see it on stage with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick.This year there is an other movie version coming, with also Nat and Matt.Why wouldn't they love it?

One of the Funniest Films of the Last 35 Years,"The Producers(1968) has three things that make it a pleasurably funny film. One, the humorous interreactions between Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel.  Two, the film's memorable and unforgettable ""Springtime for Hitler"" musical number.  Three, the energetic and fresh style of the filmmaker, Mel Brooks.Mel Brooks does a fantastic job in his masterful film debut as film director.  Blends the crude humor of Blazing Saddles(1974) with the subtleness of Young Frankenstein(1974).  Brooks's direction is daring and isn't afraid to use material that might be a little risque.  I believe Mel Brooks direction in The Producers(1968) is excellent and surpassed only by his more mature direction for Young Frankenstein(1974).The screenplay is terrificly good for a comedy of this kind.  Perhaps the best written film by Mel Brooks in his directorial career.  Boasts some original lines of dialogue and strange situations.  The film's screenplay received an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay(too bad The Producers[1968] wasn't considered for Best Picture or Best Director).Gene Wilder was the best alter ego as actor to Mel Brooks as director.  He was in the director's three top films and that is no accident because Gene Wilder always added more laughs to the films of Mel Brooks in which he was in.  The Mel Brooks pictures where Gene Wilder wasn't in lose a lot with the lack of his presence.  In my opinion Gene Wilder worked with Mel Brooks in a way the director has not worked with anyone before or since.The characters of Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder are opposites in personalities yet they make a perfect duo.  The two leads give brilliant performances in their roles of Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom.  Two is a number that plays an important role in many of the Mel Brooks films.  In his films there is a leader and an assistent whose plans never work as originally envisioned.A satire on planned failure and unintentional success that was daring for its time.  Deals with how a bad or below average product can be popular due to good fortune.  In the film, Max and Leo attempt to produce a failure on Boardway to collect the insurance.  To their chargin the play becomes a big time success.The main idea of the story was eeriely prophetic because today there are many lousy films that are big box office successes.  The Producers(1968) message was that people will go to see anything even if the product isn't very good or excellent.  Its funny to see how truthful The Producers(1968) was in portraying a certain element of human nature.  To see films like Blair Witch Project(1999) or other lousy big hit films become successes shows that The Producers(1968) in one way was ahead of its time.I have no intention of watching the Boardway play based on the film for several reasons.  One, the actors in the play do not bring the same type of humor or style of Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder.  Two, the story worked much better when written during the late 1960s.  Three, anything that has been inspired from film into Boardway usually turns out to be not very good at all.Kenneth Mars rounds out the main cast in a hilarious turn as Franz Liebkind. One of the best sequences is when Max flirts with old women to get their money.  The final scene is another brilliant moment in The Producers(1968). The set designs are beautifully constructed and visually depicted.William Hickly makes an obscure appearence in a film before his breakthrough role in Prizzi's Honor(1985).  The Producers(1968) is Mel Brooks at his best and most enthusiastic.  I can tell the film was made in the late 1960s because of the manners and style of the characters.  A classic comedy made at a time when the cinema took chances and weren't afraid to use its artistic freedom to the fullest extent.",,Anonymous,Music

The Producers,"Mel Brooks only ever made one film that I felt worthy of note - and boy is it! This is a super musical comedy centring around the cunning plan of ""Max"" (Zero Mostel) and ""Bloom"" (Gene Wider) to make money by losing it! The former is a down-at-heel producer who lurches from one wealthy widow to another trying to keep his head - and his failing shows - above water. His hits are now more rare than hen's teeth and when his accountant ""Bloom"" indicates that financial disaster is looming they concoct a plan. Raise as much cash as they can for a show that will be certain to crash and burn. But how to create such a sure fire disaster? The topic? Well, after wracking their brains they, not unreasonably, conclude that a family-friendly tale of Adolf Hitler might just do the trick. Odds-on, surely? It cannot possibly succeed - can it? I mean, they hire the worst talent, the worst director, tone deaf musicians... It is genuinely hilarious in patches, and the efforts of both Mostel and Wilder gel perfectly together with the former having a magical megalomanic glint in his eye that makes the ordinarily zany Wilder look positively restrained. Add to their chemistry some fun contributions from lead actor ""LSD"" (Dick Shawn); deranged director ""Franz"" (Kenneth Mars) and, of course, the inimitable ditty ""Springtime for Hitler"" and we have a whole thing that is so surreal yet surprisingly plausible! It's a richly and tightly paced ninety minutes that rarely draws breath and over fifty years after it was made, is still a truly classic piece of entertaining cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

heres to failure..,"I havent seen every single movie that mel brooks has made and i doubt if i ever will. The ones i have seen i must have laughed a few times. They arent bad and while the producers 1967 is his earliest work in some ways it is still his most fresh. Its really sth to see a very young gene wilder in the role of leo bloom a stereotype lonely jewish accountant with a knack for chiseling who gets swept up by a fellow chisler into a scheme to go bankrupt in order to collect. I couldnt help seeing a reverse willy wonka as zero takes gene around the big apple tempting his moral turpitude. Or perhaps like the devil did to jesus in the last temptation. Which leo bloom gives into temptation and joins with evil. People and critics of the time criticized the controversial nature particularly of the portrayal of the jews in the storyline as neurotic shady double dealing types. I think in this time period comedians like richard pryor were self exploiting using stereotypes as cannon fodder. Perhaps the audience hadnt quite gotten in on the joke. Its apparent this movie took broad ethnic humor and a ton of industry in jokes social commentary and schtick out in the open for all to see. Its strange it took me so long to watch this one. Probably because its been under critical reappraisal after a broadway revival of the 1967 original became a hit. I saw young frankenstein as a 6 year old kid accidentally trying to rent the original frankenstein. Why i was drawn to that or the furst king kong movie back then still pyzzles me. I simply was given the choice to rent any vhs i wanted and that was what i wznted to see. The world looked so big to me at a very young age. Watching the producers in 2023 at 44 years old i could see the dna of what would become blazing saddles and young frankenstein. Still i cant help feel sth was very different about this movie. The second movie i remember of mel brooks was on tv when i was about 6 i saw a scene i vividly remember in which he is running through a park being bombed with bird feces. I think it was called high anxiety and its one of his i never finished. Lots of it went over my head and especially at that age. Back then i kind of accepted that but I guess by now i might not ""get"" but i certainly recognize more of the ""in jokes"". But ive never been an ""in person"" so those fall flat on me. I think the producers 1967 is as point blank as brooks ever delivered to the screen. The characters and performances are often very funny. I kept having this feeling this movie likes putting you on the spot and enjoys making you feel uneasy or unsure. It fifures those people who got up and left ee dont need but the ones who stayed around we can count on. Brooks has claimed to have written ""springtime for hitler"" originally in book form but converted it to a play because publishets felt it was ""talky"" which eventually ended up a film script he would perform live himself. He touted it was a revenge for being called jew boy in the service and a protest of 20th century antisemitism particularly the holocaust. He claimed his method was to ridicule from the sides instead of stand against head on making speeches from a soap box. Makes sense to me because there are some statements that simply cannot be dignified with a response. A picture paints a thousand words and actions speak louder the pen is mightier.. all that stuff. In his way i suppose he wrote sth that was to him very personal and while not everyone will directly relate they can at least relate just to that conviction. All that other aside Is the movie funny? At times itvwas to me and while not everyones gonna get it i dont yhink watching it will scar anyone fir life.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A dry movie that requires effort to laugh,"I saw this movie in anticipation of the new one and the Broadway play. It was disappointing after hearing about how great the play was. because Mel Brooks didn't use as many jokes as he normally does, and the two stars of the movie, Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel, were not as good as they could be. Neither of them had very many quirks, except for Mostel's sexual quirk, which is almost completely ignored in the whole movie except the beginning. A couple of rare moments in the movie shined, however, with Mel Brooks-type quirks. One example is the audition for the part of Adolf Hitler with many hysterical freaks trying to do what they think is excellent but truly pathetic. It ends with LSD's audition, which is funny as $#**! The other part is the Busby Berkely opening of the musical, making fun of Nazis, etc. However, towards the end the movie starts to seem more like a semi-adventure movie, which doesn't fit any of the movie's makers at all.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
* Great Comedy Indeed!,"* In his very 1st movie Mel Brooks indeed showed his brilliance with The Producers. His Lorenzo Saint DuBois (LSD) character was a goofy caricature of hippy-types of that era. The various auditioning singing Hitlers were hilarious. Director Roger Debris and his assistant Carmen Ghia were indeed bizarre humorous gay characters. Even minor supporting characters such as the inebriated fellow in the bar added to the humor of this great comedy. My favorite Franz Liebkind line was ""You are just the audience. I am the author. I out-rank you!"" But of course der Fuhrer never said ""baby!"" Yet for me the greatest unsolved mystery is who was the applauding guy at the end of the Springtime For Hitler production number? He looks like Don Adams but the character was unbilled.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Combine the two and you get a mediocre comedy. What a shame. What a shame. There are a few hilarious parts but I sat through much of the film just wondering. Many of the other actors were just over the top. Perhaps I will watch it again after a few months to see if anything changes.,6.0,Anonymous,Music
This is where comedic subjectivity is affirmed.,"There comes a time in every critic's life, be it newspaper critic or online critic, syndicated or local, hobbyist or elitist, when he watches a highly-regarded classic for the first time and feels underwhelmed by it. He proceeds to write a not-so positive review of the film and what follows is a long-run of neverending hate-mail about the comment for the rest of his career.If that's what my review of Mel Brooks' The Producers brings so be it. This isn't my first rodeo with not liking a relatively high- regarded classic. I proved not to be such a big fan of Easy Rider, the classic road movie that portrayed sixties culture in a way many found profound and accurate. My main reason for not loving that particular picture is because I found it ""spoke to a generation that no longer had ears to hear it,"" and unless you're from the generation when big political and social changes began to take effect, chance are, it was an alienating and sometimes tedious film to indulge in.That's a whole different complaint than the one about to make for Brooks' The Producers. Given Brooks limitless track record for uproariously funny and subversive comedies of yesteryear, I felt popping in almost any one of his films would be an immediate winner. The bottom line with The Producers is it's simply not that funny and never that interesting. Concerning a hack producer named Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) and his neurotic accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), the film follows the two halfwits as they attempt to conjure up a travesty of a play when they run the math and realize that a bomb could work better for a producer than a hit in terms of shares and rights solicitation.In efforts to produce a play that is destined to play for one night only, Max and Leo right and produce ""Springtime for Hitler: A Gay Romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden,"" a work that is labeled ""a love letter to Hitler"" written by an ex-Nazi Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars), which is German for ""Frank Lovechild."" The play turns out to be a musical, and to assure nothing but total and unprecedented chaos, the two producers decide to follow every step in the ""what not to do"" section in the unwritten book of performance art. They hire the wrong director, the wrong actors, pick the worst and potentially most offensive story, and find a writer who is four tires short of a car.Mel Brooks does just about everything he can against the wall with The Producers and it's surprising and a shame to admit so very little of the humor actually sticks. To begin with, it's no denying Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder are extremely talented performers, but somehow, Brooks found the way to make both extremely tired, irritating, and tedious. This especially goes for Wilder, whose over-the- top neurosis exhausts itself well past the perimeters of being funny. Mostel, on the other hand, occasionally hits admirable strides, but his character is so blatantly selfish that it's difficult to watch him for very long let alone to side with him.Furthermore, the ideas of satire are barely noticeable here - something the film should've set its sights on heavily. Instead, we get frequent vignettes of situations that aren't very funny simply because they're burdened by overacting and boring physical comedy. I never knew the latter words went together. Mostel and Wilder both have unbearable characters and, in return, give us somewhat unbearable performances.Brooks has made a name for himself as one of comedy's great voice and, through some mystery far beyond anything I'm willing to conjure up at the moment, The Producers has become a staple in the comedy genre. It has earned its place on the American Film Institute's one- hundred best comedy films among many film critics' favorites as well. I conclude by saying that I don't expect my opinions to be agreed with or shared but at the very least respected. Sometimes I feel comedy is the most subjective of all genres because one thing that makes somebody laugh can make someone else uncomfortable or annoyed. The funny thing is I've seen films very similar to The Producers hit considerable highs. I suppose I'm just trying to figure out where it all went wrong here.Starring: Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder, and Kenneth Mars. Directed by: Mel Brooks.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
The Producers - Highly Recommended by Mark Tafero,"This is my brother Mark's favorite comedy of all time. We agree on the director be the greatest director of comedy of all time (Mel Brooks), but differ on the film. My favorite Brooks film is Young Frankenstein, also in my top 100 films of all time. The performances in this film are nothing short of zany. Zero Mostel is perfectly cast as an unscrupulous Broadway director, and Gene Wilder is wonderful as the bumbling, but brilliant accountant. Even Burt Lancaster's neck hairs would have been raised as JJ Hunsecker, the scheming national writer and subject of Sweet Smell of Success. That film was deadly serious; this one is deadly hilarious. There are several episodes in the film that are memorable, but the song that stands out for me was ""Springtime for Hitler in Germany"". I mean, really, can you get more perverse than that? But, as we all know, perverse sells. And when the play is successful, the duo has to pay off the 500% of the ownership of the play. That's right, the boys sell the play FIVE times more than it could legally be sold. We can all figure out that this will not end well. You have got to see this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Zero Mostel & Gene Wilder's sure-fire flop show made for a sure-fire evergreen comedy! Mel Brooks' memorable debut.,"The Producers (1968) :
Brief Review -Zero Mostel & Gene Wilder's sure-fire flop show made for a sure-fire evergreen comedy! Mel Brooks' memorable debut. I happened to see the Bollywood film ""Dhoondhtey Reh Jaoge"" in the theatre during my college days (of course, with a bad taste for cinema then), and I somewhat enjoyed it then. I kept thinking about the idea and read somewhere that it was inspired by some Hollywood film. I never found out about that film until today, when I saw Mel Brooks' ""The Producers."" Mel Brooks chose a hell of a comedy to debut with. An amazingly unique idea that can be related in realistic terms with a twist at the end-and not a regular twist, but a funny one that completely changes cards for the players. The film is about a theatre producer and his accountant, who, as part of a scam, decide to stage the worst stage musical they can create. They find a script centred on Adolf Hitler and the Nazis and bring it to the stage as ""Springtime for Hitler."" You need intelligent writing to generate thoughts like that. You know that having a story written as a love letter to Hitler is supposed to get you smacked, but a contradictory approach to the same will create hysteria. Mel Brooks does that thing here. Two relatable characters and then there are a bunch of idiots and silly-looking humans who add up to a wholesome package of comedy. Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder's bromance is lovable (that has nothing to do with the speech in court). The supporting cast is hilarious, as everyone has different peculiar features and is funny in different ways. Mel Brooks's direction has to be noted since it was his debut film and arguably his best film ever. He compiles the humour with modern-day characters and serves a sure-fire hit show out of a flop show's idea. The film stands the test of time and breaks age-group barriers as well.RATING - 7.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Somewhat dated but still hilarious,"Winner of the Academy Award for the best original screenplay, this comedy has become somewhat dated from the time of its release. However, the originality of the idea is hilarious and startling. An accountant and a producer decide to play the ultimate con on the Internal Revenue Service by taking huge amounts of money from their financiers and investing it into a certified flop. They go to great lengths finding the perfect script which will translate into a play which will last for only one show. The script, a musical about Nazi Germany and Hitler, written by a mentally unbalanced writer is found. The director who has the distinction of being the worst director in the world is selected. An actor who has come for the wrong audition is selected as Adolf Hitler and the play is shown on Broadway. Written and directed by the comic genius Mel Brooks, the movie starts a bit slowly and then picks up pace after Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder join hands. The movie belongs to Mostel who is excellent as the producer who frauds old women for love and takes money for them. Gene Wilder, in one of his early roles, is a bit over the top. Dick Shawn as LSD, the actor who plays Hitler, is amazingly funny. The songs are good. However, i found the humor to be a bit forced at some moments. The movie is still pretty decent fun. But it was definitely not the laugh riot i thought it would be.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Mel Brooks' directorial debut!,"The Producers (1968) was the first film that Mel Brooks directed. It was a critical smash as well. Gene Wilder stars as a accountant to a Broadway producer (Zero Mostel). Whilst going over his books, he noticed that his productions that bombed actually made money instead of the successful ones. Mostel has an idea, what if he makes a Broadway play that is such a disaster that it only receives one run. He needs two things in order for this plan to go into effect. One, he has to sway Wilder to his side and two, he needs to have a huge amount of investors.Whilst Wilder fixes the numbers, Mostel goes out to all of his elderly female clients whom he swoons with his charm as they write out checks for him to invest in his play. He over sells shares into the play, so when it bombs he doesn't have to pay them back and pockets the money. Now only one question remains, what kind of production will they do that'll be so awful that it'll play once and never again? How will these ""Producers"" be able to pull off this ingenious scheme? To find out you'll just have to watch THE PRODUCERS!!! Co-stars Kenneth Mars and Dick Shawn as Lionel Saint Du Bois (L.S.D.).Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Funny,"Good comedy from Mel Brooks. In this one, two producers are putting together a show that they wish will flop: Springtime for Hitler. Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder both gave good performances.Out of 100, I gave it 79.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
More than capable of producing laughter,"I initially had low expectations for this movie, having not been wowed by the other Mel Brooks films that I'd seen up to that time. This one, however, did live up to Brooks's reputation as a comedy legend.The cast of characters and the actors portraying them are quite distinctive and memorable. Zero is pitch-perfect as the mildly devious Max Bialystock and Gene Wilder is ideal as his straight man sidekick, Leo Bloom. The supporting cast is exceptional as well, with memorable performances from Kenneth Mars, Dick Shawn & Christopher Hewett.The script isn't filled with meaningless gags but rather with comedy that's built upon characterization and plot. Sure, some of the comedy may be dated (particularly LSD's mannerisms) but it's all entertaining nonetheless. I really enjoyed the plot, particularly the ending.If I had one complaint it would be that the comparatively small amount of music left me wishing for more. The production's main theme alone is worth the price of admission.I haven't seen the recent remake but it would have to be awfully good to be an improvement on this. Stick to the original and you won't be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Another classic to remember,"The Producers has to be one of the funniest plots I had ever heard of. Basically Max Bialystock is a former play director who used to be on top of his game, but lost it. Now he is supported by his lover's, who happen to be elderly old ladies. But when Leo Bloom enters his life as his accountant, he brings up how flops can bring in bigger bucks than a hit, together they produce the play ""Springtime for Hitler"". A sure flop, right? Who in the world would see a play about Hitler? The world's most hated man! But when it turns out to be a popular comedy, the guys are in big trouble because those elderly old ladies who gave money to Max to produce it now want the profits.This is a very funny and original piece of work that any Mel Brooks fan or comedy fan in general would enjoy. Also bringing in some memorable songs, I think you'll get your kicks out of the Producers. After all ""I am the author. You are the audience. I outrank you!"" LOL! Enjoy!7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Awful and overrated.  Mel Brooks's worst!,"Why was this voted as one of the funniest comedies of all time in AFI's Hall of Fame?  Who cares?  I sure as heck didn't think it was that funny.  There was an occasional giggle here and there, but I found it frequently annoying and stupid.  The comic timing is perfect, Zero and Gene have a great chemistry.  Too bad there's no good material to work with.  What we're basically watching is the two of them fumbling around like a bunch of idiots for a mindless hour and thirty minutes.  Now, Mel had some good ideas. ""Springtime for Hitler"" could've been hilarious, but even that fell flat. Come on, a drug-induced sixties, flower-power stoner playing Hitler is supposed to be funny?  Maybe I missed something.  Maybe I should give another look.  On second thought...no.  There's a whole bunch of weird bits of comedy that are definitely original--but that's all they are.  That originality has no zest or appeal.  Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder stumble through each scene like Abbott and Costello with crappy material.  Did I have to be born in the late sixties to get the humor?  Is this a dated comedy?  There has to be some reason why one of the ""supposedly"" funniest comedies of all time only sparked a few giggles and a bunch of groans and snores out of me.  And I'm a fan of Mel.  He's definitely a comic genius like no other.  But I'm sure even the greatest of writers--if you look back in time--wrote a really bad essay in sophomore year of high school.  This is like that essay.  Loved all his other movies.  This one should be thrown in the trash.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

"Well, Mel Brooks did it: he made people laugh at Hitler.","Before Mel Brooks made outlandishly silly movies, he debuted with ""The Producers"", about Broadway promoter Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) and accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) trying to produce a flop.

Comic Farce Offset By Insensitivity  **1/2,"The premise for ""The Producers"" is marvelous. Two guys get a bunch of elderly women to invest in a play and look for subject matter that will be a certain flop. As the investments have gone well over 100%, there will be plenty of money for Max Bialystock (a memorable Zero Mostel) and his sidekick bookkeeper (Leo Blum), played by Gene Wilder, to keep.Max hires a transvestite director known for his failures to direct this bomb-to-be. Can anyone imagine a musical ""Springtime for Hitler,"" including an opening number where June Taylor-like dancers make a swastika while singing and dancing Springtime for Hitler and Germany? This is outrageous but it works as the play turns out to be an enormous success. What's there left to do? Blow-up the theater and then face the music in court.What hurts this farce is the subject matter regarding Hitler which is definitely offensive. While I realize that the purpose was to create a sure flop, writer Mel Brooks has gone way over the top. Why not a musical on Julius Caesar? How many people would have been offended by that? I have faith in Brooks as he could have made the latter a riot as well.Kenneth Mars unfortunately is funny as ""the kraut,"" the guy who authored the Hitler musical.Have Max and Leo learned anything from their experience? Not really. As jail-birds they get the inmates to invest in ""Prisoners of Love."" Aren't we really imprisoned by this utter nonsense?",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Brooks' Finest...,"Mel Brooks' finest screen achievement stars the legendary Mostel and Wilder as two men on a mission to make money off (what they hope to be) the biggest flop in the history of theater. Dick Shawn is priceless as their odd choice for Hitler in the musical ""Springtime for Hitler."" Kenneth Mars is also wonderful as the author of this wretched musical. Estelle Winwood, Christopher Hewitt are also fine in support. Wilder received an Oscar nomination and the film won a prize for its sharp screenplay.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Underproduced Producers,"All of Brooks' movies are basically one joke. The joke in this first film was arguably his best one to date: no wonder it got adapted and then remade. Unfortunately the execution here is often subpar. It isn't like an early Woody Allen, where the bad jokes just fly by with the good. It's slow-moving schtick, and it's often overplayed as if the actors weren't even sure what kind of shot they were supposed to be in. There are some flat spots and an a-w-f-u-l lot of setup before the heart of the joke, the play itself. After staging this hilarious topper (and it's even cleverer than you expect) there's not much for Brooks to do except try to find an even funnier way to get out of the movie, which he doesn't quite do. A few scenes, like the one with the secretary, also run on and on long after you've got the joke. Was this because the newcomer deferred too much to his actors, especially Mostel? Brooks' later films are cut faster and are often funnier. But overall this was still a pretty impressive debut and worth seeing once. Hewitt and Voutsinas were funny, I didn't care as much for Mars though I don't see how else the part could have been played. Mostel is all over the place. Wilder's underplaying saves the day.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Bialystock&Bloom,"After seeing the musical remake of The Producers it made me appreciate the original all the more. Not even the creator himself Mel Brooks who did the remake as well should have touched the original. You just can't improve on perfection.Poor Zero Mostel as Max Bialystock once noted Broadway producer, but now the genius behind several flop shows. When things can't get any worse he's about to be audited when drone little accountant Leo Bloom shows up in his office and starts going over the books.If this had been a Looney Toons cartoon the light bulb would have been over Mostel's head and flashing as Gene Wilder as Bloom explains how with a little creative accounting one can make lots of money off a flop show. Then it's off to go out and try to create the biggest flop in the history of Broadway. Something no one has ever actually tried for in the history of the theater itself.Certain films are seminal moments in the history of the genre. In comedy two previous ones in my opinion could be It Happened One Night and Some Like It Hot. Both by creative geniuses Frank Capra and Billy Wilder and both radically different films. Mel Brooks put himself in that category with The Producers. And like another genius David O. Selznick spent the rest of his career producing good film, even great ones but never topped his first and best.All I can say is that when the film opens with that Springtime For Hitler number done in Busby Berkeley style you'll react like Brooks's theater audience did and say he succeeded. But if The Producers teaches us anything it is that flops are born, not made.Brooks put together a perfect cast in support of Mostel and Wilder. Standing out are Dick Shawn as the method acting Hitler, Kenneth Mars as the crazy Naxi author, and Christopher Hewett as the worst director on Broadway who takes a real liking to Wilder.The Producers got an Oscar nomination for Gene Wilder as Best Supporting Actor. It won an Oscar for Mel Brooks for Best Original Screenplay.All I can say is that if ever an award was deserved it was the Oscar Mel Brooks got. It was certainly original.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"I laughed a lot, which is success for a comedy","As I make my way through Mel Brooks' filmography, I am constantly reminded of how funny he is. I mean, who else would think of making a movie about two Broadway producers who make a musical about Hitler? I laughed so much it hurt. Of course, my head often hurt for other reasons too. Gene Wilder, while quite hilarious himself, frequently got on my nerves with his manic episodes. It was funny the first couple of times, but it annoyed me afterwards. The true star of the film was Dick Shawn, who played the lead actor in the musical 'Springtime for Hitler.' He was such a pleasure to watch. Overall, I would say this is one of the more straightforwardly comedic Mel Brooks films. I certainly laughed more consistently than with his other ones. However, I don't see myself rewatching this a lot. It was good for a ""one and done."" I'm glad I saw it, and now I'll move onto his other work.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The Start of the Modern Age of Film,"The Producers (1967), is Mel Brooks first directorial job. It is a clear indication of where his career would go from here, because this film is just as enjoyably, as his later hit films. Zero Mostel is a slicked-up, shady, theater producer, named Max Bialystock, who in-between his seduction of rich, elderly women for production money, realizes he can make more money, by collecting the taxes from a theater production, if it tanks in ticket sales. He can make money, by declaring it a loss. Along, with help from his cautiously naive accountant, Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), Max sets out to produce the worst play ever made. He stumbles across a script, written by a wacked-out, ex-Nazi soldier, turned writer, Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars). It is a script entitled, ""Springtime For Hitler"". The play stars Lorenzo St. DuBois, aka: L. S. D. (Dick Shawn). LSD unwittingly, conveys to the audience, an awful performance, utilizing his beatnik, stumbling, improvised delivery, that they accept the play as satire. The theater play becomes a hit, thus creating a nightmare for Max, who now has to figure out how to pay the old women, who he conned, into investing into this venture.This is a funny film, that captures the best of 1960s, satirized comedy. Being as it was 1967, the maturity of Hollywood cinema, was heading into the modern age of film, with more mature content, becoming common practice. The Producers (1967), has the feeling of a British comedy, that flirts with the desires of wanting to be rated R. The MPAA rating system, was still, about two years away, so the Producers (1967), is a pre-MPAA, mature, comedy film. It's cool knowing this fact, because it is always interesting, watching films from this time-period (knowing very soon, the censorship lines are going to be redrawn in 1969), so many productions tried to push past the maturity line in their films. Those late-1960s films were telling the film industry, that artistic creation, needed the freedom, to push the maturity line further. There is a very sexy side to the Producers (1967), plus other mature elements, that make this a great film to watch. A movie, that hails from the very beginnings of the modern-age of film.7.8 (B-) = 8 IMDB.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"""'Gregor Samsa awoke one morning to discover that he had been transformed into a giant cockroach.' Nah, it's too good. ""","""The Producers"" is an exceptional first film for Mel Brooks. His direction is spot-on to what we've come to expect Brooks to do in later films, Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder are likable and developed, and Brooks even manages to pull off a few shots I had never seen before in his movies, such as the extreme long shot used when the fountain shoots up. It's a scene that looks so great, that Brooks placed it as the final scene of the end credits. It's really hard to hate a Mel Brooks film, and this is no exception.

I personally think this is Mel Brooks best film and he made some real good 'uns. This is much better than the remake, which is also a very good film. Often the original can't be bettered and this is the classic example. This film is now over 50 years old and never has the cliché 'they don't make 'em like that anymore' been true.

Fantastic,"""Tragedy plus time equals comedy"" - Steve AllenThis is a film that had me from its opening scene over the credits, with Zero Mostel (a fading Broadway producer) flirting with a rich old lady, one of many for him, who wants to role play with him in naughty ways as part of an agreement where in return she'll fund his plays. His accountant (Gene Wilder) shows up, an anxious man attached to the blue blanket he had as a baby, and notices a problem with the books. Mostel brushes off his warnings of fraud and after convincing him to fix things through awkward personal gestures and screaming two inches from his ear, says, ""Thank you, I knew I could con you."" Wilder's character then observes that a producer could earn more money with a flop than with a hit, and soon the two are in business, looking for the ""worst play ever written."" They find one, Springtime for Hitler: A Gay Romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden, written by a deranged ex-Nazi.The concept of spoofing the Third Reich is undoubtedly less dangerous today than it was in 1967, when it seemed in questionable taste by many who had endured the war (and/or the Holocaust). Over five decades later it's lost its power to shock, and it's also lost some of its comedic freshness, but it still makes me smile. The two producers take out an ad in the paper to cast the role of Adolf Hitler, with the note hilariously ending with ""No previous experience required."" A hippie whose initials are L. S. D. (Dick Shawn) is cast as Hitler and we see him go from auditioning with a song called ""Love Power"" to playing a whiny Fuhrer. The dance troupe performs the title song in a classic bit of choreography, complete with a Busby Berkeley-like overhead shot of a rotating swastika.The film obviously satirizes the Nazis first and foremost, but it also has fun with theater producers, flower power hippies, and a couple of gay men, a director and his assistant. Lee Meredith is a sexy secretary who dances and shakes in the office at the drop of a hat, hired by Mostel's character just so they can ogle her. You get the idea, very little is off-limits here, and some of the humor is very old school. The way Mel Brooks captures Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder, and Dick Shawn is memorable though, and between the dialogue, snappy pace, and wide variety of comedy, I found the film held up quite well.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"The Producers: Tap dancing storm troopers, oh my!","Mel Brooks is a curious person in the film industry, he started out big with such films like Blazing Saddles (1974) and The Producers (1967) then tumbled down until Dracula: Dead and loving it (1995) where he stopped making films all together. On one hand most people remember him to be a comedic marvel with razor sharp satire while on the other hand people remember his work to have some.....outdated comedy that hurts otherwise great movies. Let's find out!Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) is a washed up playwright who is struggling to make ends meet, he has not had a profitable play for a long time and fears he might not last long. When a mousy accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) inadvertently mentions a way to scam people, Max enlists Leo to create an intentional flop to scam the investors. Thus Springtime for Hitler: A Gay romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden by mad ex Nazi Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars ) is made.Hilarity ensues.To not mention the famous Springtime for Hitler number would be wrong, it is amazing, and such a delightful middle finger to Hitler and Nazis in general, the music is catchy as well. I was humming it for a good few days with a big silly grin on my face. I love how that number takes Nazi propaganda and mocks the hell out of it and shows just how stupid it all is when you boil propaganda down to its most basic and honest level, I love it.The comedy is great all round for the most part and the performances for the most part are really good, the timing is on point and, again for the most part are characters and not one note clowns that exist only to make us laugh.There is a reoccurring problem with the Mel Brooks movies, at least with this and Blazing Saddles is that there is a period of time where all the comedy just dies. In this case it is with the gay characters, they are the only characters that not three dimensional people but just the camp gay stereotypes that are relying on being gay camp stereotypes. It is not funny. In any way whatever, I have seen more offensive variations on this stereotypes, it is just boring and annoying. It brings the entire movie down for a time.However the movie does recover from this and the stereotypes never come up again in any major way. The film benefits from this as that period has aged so badly and does the movie a massive disservice. The movie's real straight lies in the satire and the two main leads which Mel Brooks does well.The trouble with reviewing any good comedy is there is very little margin for spoilers, so much of what is good about it is can be considered a spoiler so I will end this review now.This is a very good comedy, not for everyone and some of it has not aged well at all but there is a wit and intelligence to this that makes it very watchable.I would recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Funny funny movie,"In this one movie, Mel Brooks simultaneously satirizes Nazis, Hippies, and Broadway, with a funny plot involving a would-be con artist (Zero Mostel) and his unwitting dupe (Gene Wilder).The songs, written by Mel, are unbelievably funny; from the Broadway show tunes to the psychedelic rock send-ups, his renditions are dead-on.It's only 88 minutes long, and in a way that is good, as it keeps the jokes coming non-stop.

The First Mel Brooks Film Is Comedy Fun,"Mel Brooks' ""The Producers"" is a comedy that revolves one central idea: that it might be more profitable to produce a flop than to produce a successful play.Zero Mostel plays Max Bialystock, an over the hill producer who lives on a shoestring. When he meets Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), a neurotic but straight-arrow accountant, the two form an unlikely partnership. Object: failure.The film has a manic beginning with plenty of hyperventilating, but soon settles into what filmgoers would later come to recognize as a trademark Brooks' wackiness. This is Mel Brooks' first film as a director and one can hear his (writing) voice in many of the lines.The plot is somewhat irreverent, but it hits its comic targets reliably, in a way reminiscent of Chaplin's parody of Hitler, perhaps.Brooks' style of humor may not be for everyone, but this first attempt at direction is an enjoyable film. Look for Dick Shawn as a kooky, beat Hitler in the play within the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
how really funny it still is,"It was a rather some time since I saw this and was pleased to find how really funny it still is. Gene Wilder is very good, although he had a small part in Bonnie and Clyde (1967) and really it begins here. Zero Mostel is stunning with his old aunts in the first part of the film and later he makes the film his own with his bravura performance. I have to say that I had never really noted how good Dick Shawn was the first time. I had never heard of him as a comedian and here is the hammy portrayal as a singing Adolf Hitler, in the show within the show and almost steals the film. Mel Brooks' is brilliant and such well chosen stars, written such script, and with the singing too with also makes the film perfect without letting it overrun.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Sometimes very annoying,"The film could be much better. Maybe it aged too much, but today watching it is a bit of a tough challange. First is directing. It isn't that bad but not very decent either. But the most annoying aspects are the script (I don't know how it won the Oscar) and the main characters (others are absurd too, but not that much). I don't know why director thought that this constant screaming and yelling would be funny or at least reasonable, but it is not. Most of the dialoges are absurd as well. Of course it's not actors' fault, but due to the plot and screenplay they annoy most of the time and make laugh rarely. Stereotypical German guy is another irritating thing.The good sides of the film are a few good jokes, more or less good directing, interesting idea and a few nice songs.

I don't know why the script won awards as it was not impressive and not good enough for a man usually very funny, Zero Mostel, a comedy actor is only as good as his lines and he was let down this time. Blazing Saddles can be enjoyed many times but this will be watched by most just once.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

There's something here to offend almost everyone,"""The Producers"" has something to offend almost everybody: Jews, Germans, Swedes, blondes, old women, young women, gays, hippies past and present, directors, accountants, Italians, tenors, the list goes on. The plot is by now well known: Broadway producer Max Bialystock (which is the name of a town in Poland with a Jewish community as venerable as any in Europe) has been cursed with a string of flops and is an impoverished has-been, reduced to romancing little old ladies who think the checks they write are going to finance plays when in fact they are going to pay his rent. He is visited one day by Leo Bloom, the quintessence of the stereotypical repressed, anal-retentive accountant. After an initial acquaintance that is---to say the least---difficult, Leo sits down to do Bialystock's books. He makes an innocent, casual remark about ""creative accounting"" (""under the correct circumstances, a person could make more money from a flop than from a hit""). Producing flops, of course, is what Max Bialystock has become best at, and he eventually talks Bloom into conspiring with him to find and produce the worst play ever written and to abscond with the vast amount of excess funds they have swindled out of hundreds of little old ladies. It goes without saying that despite their efforts to produce the worst script (""Springtime for Hitler: A Gay Romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgarten"") with the worst director and the worst actors, the show is a huge success. Now they have to pay off all the backers, something that will be a bit difficult as they have committed fraud and raised 250 times the money they really needed, and there wouldn't be enough profits in a million years to pay off the backers. ""WHERE DID I GO RIGHT?!?"" laments Bialystock. The script goes downhill from there, and the climax of the story is not really very satisfying; in fact, the anticlimax that ends the film is better than the climax. I guess you'd call it a happy ending.By the mid-1960s, Mel Brooks had a reputation as a gifted comedy writer for television, and as a performer as well, mostly from the ""2000-Year-Old-Man"" recordings with Carl Reiner. But with ""The Producers,"" he was taking a big chance. World War II and the Holocaust had been over for only about 20 years, and were still extremely painful memories. For someone to write a play in which Hitler becomes a comedic figure, even indirectly, was awfully presumptuous, especially for a Jew, but if you think about it, ONLY a Jew would have the chutzpah to do it. You can try to rationalize or justify the use of Hitler because, of course, Bialystock and Bloom explicitly label the play ""Springtime for Hitler"" as the worst play ever written, and Brooks makes its author, Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars), the broadest of caricatures. It just doesn't work: Hitler's crimes were so transcendentally monstrous that not even ""The Producers"" can distract from the horror of it all. Despite this, Act I, Scenes 1 and 2, in which Bialystock and Bloom meet, are 18 of the funniest minutes ever put on film. Although the rest of the movie never quite lives up to the beginning, much of it is intermittently hilarious, especially the scenes with Roger De Bris and the opening production number of ""Springtime for Hitler"". Any viewer of Mel Brooks's movies knows that realistic characterization is not his forte, and ""The Producers"" is no exception: Even inspired clowns Zero Mostel (Bialystock) and Gene Wilder (Bloom), despite their best efforts, barely manage to elevate their characters above caricature. (I wonder if Brooks was inspired by the comedy of Laurel and Hardy when he chose two actors who resemble them physically.) The rest of the characters are completely so. Probably the most irritating piece of casting was Dick Shawn as the hippie ""L.S.D."": He is WAY too old to be a hippie (he was 44 when the film was shot) and he was the un-hippiest hippie in history. He looked like Liberace and played his character as a combination of Elvis Presley and a Borscht-belt comedian. Despite the fact that they DID play caricatures, Kenneth Mars as Liebkind and Christopher Hewitt (pre-Mr. Belvedere) as Roger De Bris, the worst (and swishiest) director in history, have left us with some unforgettable moments. There are also some nice, gentler touches when Brooks quietly acknowledges his cultural roots: Among the photographs that fill Bialystock's office can just barely be seen a famous portrait of Sholom Aleichem, who is considered by many the greatest author in the Yiddish language.Mel Brooks the performer is one of the funniest men alive; Mel Brooks the filmmaker has made more bad films than good. ""The Producers"" was his first, and it hinted at Brooks's future as a maker of mostly unsuccessful movies with leaden humor, toilet jokes, and caricatures rather than characters. 'The Producers' will never quite be an unqualified success; still, the first 18 minutes reduces me to helpless laughter every time I see it.",,Anonymous,Music
Nice Movie,"This was a pretty funny movie but it's NOT better then Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein!!!! Nevertheless this is a nice movie with outstanding performances, great characters, and wonderful direction.3(***)out of 4(****)stars",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A great film and always entertaining.,"The Producers is, in my view at least, the best Mel Brooks film behind Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein. I think the fact that this is only his third best film just shows good of a comedy filmmaker he is.Some elements of humour in this film wouldn't fly today, but this was made over 55 years ago and it is unfair to judge it with today's standards. It's also important to remember that this is a satire.That said, it's hilarious. The chemistry between Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder is fantastic, such a great pairing. They reminded me of Laurel and Hardy. The first 20 minutes are a little tedious for me with but after that the film completely opens up into a comedy masterpiece with many side-splitting moments.Great story and it's very unique. I wish the ending was more interesting.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
a film of bests,"I consider this film to be several bests; Mel Brooks' best film, the best comedy of the 1960s, and possibly, the best comedy film of all time. Unlike most of Brooks' other films, this one has a truly original and intriguing plot. However, what makes this film truly great are its stars, Mostel and Wilder. Without these two, this film would have been nothing. This duo is an unparallelled comedic duo.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Clever, bald, crazy, fast, funny and funny!","The Producers (1968)I had forgotten how really funny parts of this movie are. It sometimes is too shouty for me, or a little just obvious in its step by stepping through disaster, but Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel are truly amazing, both outrageous and subtle, a stunning combination.It might be hard to view the movie in the light of 1968. It has some of the 1960s mad-cap element, mixed with Jewish Broadway humor, with a dash of New Hollywood liberalism thrown in. Influences of late Billy Wilder and early Woody Allen can't be dismissed, but in a way this is Mel Brooks himself coming to his own. His background in Catskills resort stand-up is clear, but he interweaves a cogent plot in a way that we'll see many times later, almost with a Marx Brothers logic (or illogic?). No, call it logic. This movie depends on actually making absurd sense in the end.Mostel of course had a whole incredible career of his own, including in Woody Allen's ""The Front"" in 1976. And Wilder has a kind of legendary fame for his leading role in ""Willy Wonka"" in 1971 (though his career had a small kick from the seminal ""Bonnie and Clyde"" in 1967).In some ways the over the top (of course) idiosyncrasies of two side kicks help make the film the farce it is. Dick Shawn as a kind of drugged out Elvis imitator named L.S.D. (playing Hitler of course) is perfect, and so is Kenneth Mars as the German/Nazi/writer who had the whole idea of ""Springtime for Hitler"" in the first place. If you aren't laughing through some of these scenes you have a gene missing for this kind of New York hilarity.The movie has taken on a different meaning now that the actually Broadway version (not a flop) was a fixture there for six (six!) years. The irony is plain, but the talent even more so. The movie is a funny take on the times (unlike the play, which is set in the 1950s) and so has a weird kind of authenticity to it. Not that you care one bit. It's just belly laughs all the way.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The Original Nazi Humor Movie,While I find this movie a bit uneven (it picks up a good deal in the second half) it is an amazing satire of Nazism and is probably the first mainstream piece of pop culture that joked about something as serious as the Nazis and the Holocaust.

The Film that Kickstarted Mel Brooks's Directorial Career,"Although Mel Brooks is often regarded for his well crafted parody movies, his first foray in feature film direction was the 1967 satirical comedy The Producers, a farcical commentary on the seediness of show business rather than a farcical spoof. Although the film didn't attract much buzz back in its original release, it did win Brooks an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and went on to achieve greater cult admiration in the years onward, down to getting a successful stage musical adaptation. So looking back on the film that launched Brooks' cinematic career, what makes it one of his most iconic today?The film follows a con artist theater producer named Max Bialystock and his accountant Leo Bloom who devise a get rich quick scheme by fraudulently overselling interests in a deliberately disastrous stage musical. When they both find a script celebrating Adolf Hitler, they set out to bring it on stage. With this premise in mind, Brooks does not hold back in getting laughs out of the most repulsively wicked type of people, all the while allowing his two lead actors to carry the otherwise eccentric characters on their shoulders. While Bialystock and Bloom make a decently funny duo on paper, Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder perform together so seamlessly that their contrasting personalities elevate the humor in fluctuating flying colors. It's almost a riot witnessing Mostel overreact accordingly while Wilder brings such wacky hysterics to Leo's persona, and without them steering the ship by Brooks' side, the two giddily unorthodox crooks would not be as sympathetic as they appear to be on screen. I'm sure at least one viewer has actually wanted them to pull off their scheme.Since Brooks was intent on attacking Hitler and the Nazis through the power of comedy, he manages to make them look incredibly foolish with Springtime for Hitler's players. In particular, Kenneth Mars is just delightful as playwright Franz Liebkind, whose pathetic devotion to the fuhrer makes him both a laughing stock and a reminder of how far gone some ""true"" followers are. In addition, Dick Shawn is a lot of fun playing the unearthly hippie actor L. S. D. Alongside Christopher Hewitt's flamboyantly theatrical performance as director Roger De Bris. Along with a decent cast of passionate performers, the men performing before your eyes manage to mock yet pay tribute to the campiness often associated with theatre production. Also, the old ladies that Bialystock seduces offer some fun variety to his cunning schemes in financing the play, all the while adding into the themes of just how sleazy these kinds of businessmen are. That said, perhaps the weakest link in the cast is Lee Meredith as Ulla, since she doesn't do much beyond the sultry toy her character was written as.If there's one thing Brooks truly managed to pull off well in spite of their low budget, it's the actual musical performance of ""Springtime for Hitler"" within the movie itself. While the cast did a great job in making Nazis look silly, the actual production shown is marvelous from an artistic point of view, complete with strong dedication to the razzle dazzle seen on Broadway shows and Busby Berkeley numbers. Not only is Brooks' song named after the same play humorous in its slanderous lyrics, but the choreography and editing make it a delightful romp that makes one laugh at the entertainment while wondering how the filmmakers actually got away in executing such a daring number. In addition, John Morris's accompanying score adds into the fun with booming orchestrations that emphasize just how successful Max and Leo nearly get in their passionate scam. By putting on a deliberately bad show that manages to induce laughter more than it leaves people in bad taste, Brooks rightfully managed to mock his targets with the pure ridiculous meant for the material.By mocking the sleaziness of devious producers and the lunacy in admirers of the powerfully wicked, The Producers may be one of Mel Brooks's funniest and most scathing movies of his entire career, partially thanks to its incredible leading cast and dedicated production design. Knowing how cathartic it must have been for Brooks to slander Hitler and his stooges with his artistic talent, anyone who adores this movie can see the magic on screen in flying camp and humorous vulgarity. Rarely has an offensive comedy aged so well, let alone one made by a Jewish comedian who found his calling in the media.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
way better than the 2005 remake,"this Mel Brooks directorial debut is actually much better than the 2005 remake.this one actually has some amusing moments.it wasn't what i would call hysterically funny or anything.but it was entertaining.Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel work well together,and have great chemistry,whereas in the remake,Nathan Lane and Mathew Broderick merely grated on me.my only real complaint with this version was that it gets a bit too loud at times,as in too much shouting and screaming,which never really does anything for me.otherwise,i actually didn't mind it.definitely way better than the insipid remake.for me,The Producers (1968) is a 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A complete dud,"I saw the 2005 remake of this last year and thoroughly enjoyed it; but so many reviewers said it was not a patch on the original I have been trying to see that as well to compare the two. At last I have managed it and have to say that I sat leaden-faced through the entire movie. I could not believe that any so-called comedy could be that unfunny. Zero Mostel shouted hysterically with frenetic gestures, obviously thinking that he was being extremely funny when he was nothing of the sort. As for the famed Gene Wilder all I can say is that he had nothing of the subtlety that Matthew Broderick brought to the role, though at least he was not as appallingly irritating as Mostel. Scenes referred to by previous reviewers as classics of comedy were to me just noisy and childish. It was interesting that the original was much shorter than the remake, but it seemed about twice as long. I only just managed to sit through it all. A complete dud.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"Don't you see, it's so simple....","""The Producers"" is Mel Brooks' first film - it is also his most original, the only one to win him and Oscar (for Best Screenplay), and to many (myself included), his best. There are certain filmmakers who seem to create their own sort of film with a different style than anyone else (people like Woody Allen or Wes Anderson, for instance), and Brooks is one of these. There isn't anything else that has the ribald, comedic, sarcastic, and overly theatrical tone of a good Mel Brooks film.This is, in such a sense, Brooks' master work - the film is imbued with a natural theatricality in the way each character is seemingly caricaturized, and the presence of Broadway favorite Zero Mostel in the leading role just adds to the effect.The movie is of course, about a play - a work entitled ""Springtime for Hitler"" (a spring with Hitler and his lover Eva, showing the Fuhrer's lighter side), which ought to tell you everything you need to know about the sense of humor necessary to enjoy such a movie. The movie is full of blatantly (and purposely) tasteless humor - Bialystock (Mostel), a down-on-his-luck Broadway producer, raises funds by wooing little old ladies whom he refers to with such names as ""Hold Me, Touch Me"". His partner, Bloom (Gene Wilder), is pretty much a full-blown wimp who still carries around a ""blue blankie"", and together they make quite a pair.The rest of the cast fills out nicely - Kenneth Mars as the yammering German Franz Liebchen, full of love for ""you-know-who"" and no grip whatsoever on reality, Christopher Hewitt as the flambloyant director Roger DeBris, Lee Meredith as Ulla, the secretary who speaks no English, Dick Shawn as Lorenzo Saint-DuBois (or, as his friends call him, L.S.D.), an hippie actor who ends up playing Hitler, and excellent cameos from the likes of Estelle Winwood and Burgess Meredith.It would be amiss to talk about this film now and not mention the current hit show actually on Broadway. The play is, to be honest, probably a bit better. The majority of the best one-liners and scenes remain, but the play fits even better into Brooks' theatrical, over-the-top stylings (indeed, at times the play goes so far over the top as to not be in the same atmosphere as normal entertainment, such as the character of Carmen Ghia in the play). The Broadway adaptation features a slightly different storyline and drops the character of L.S.D. altogether, but it comes out as a more entertaining production than the film. That said, and with apologies to Matthew Broderick and (especially the excellent) Nathan Lane, Mostel and Wilder play these characters better than their newer counterparts, so there is a bit of a balance.The film itself stand alone, and is definitely worth seeing, not only for the greatest musical number ever to grace film stock (also named ""Springtime for Hitler), but for the entertaining feel and pace of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Springtime for Comedic Brilliance!,"Rarely does a movie have such an deliberately and savagely provocative intention with such incredible creative sense of comedy like Mel Brooks infamous ""The Producers"".I mean, who thinks about making a movie about a musical play about Hitler? Especially Mel Brooks did. Using the potent tool that is laughter.The excessively ridiculous performances by Mostel, Wilder and Shawn are literally perfect for the movie, as they naturally and charismatically display humour. Kenneth Mars performance is underrated, I think. It caused a laughter of shock at numerous times.Moreover, inherent joviality of the swinging sixties manifest itself best with the theme. The iconic ""Springtime for Hitler"" is surprisingly memorable, despite the rather tasteless nature of the content.Finally, also from a modern standpoint, its just a great relief to watch a movie that doesn't care to offend.

Great fun with a criminal mastermind,"The opening scene of ""The Producers"" has to be one of the most brilliantly constructed comic scenes ever. The scene develops with the meeting of Biallystock and Bloom where at first they despise each other but soon on the discovery that they could become partners in crime they show trust in one another. It is the overbearing impresario, Biallystock, who controls the scene as he manipulates the accountant, Bloom, into at first feeling sorry for him and later into believing that he (Biallystock) could be a criminal mastermind cunning enough to pull off the fraud. In his scene which is only about 10 minutes long it is fantastic to watch the trust develop between the naive, emotionally withdrawn Bloom and the flawed but charismatic Biallystock. The shambolic apartment is a great setting with the grime on the windows shielding the two misfits from reality. They are both dreamers who want to escape this dilapidated existence and we too go along for the ride trusting in Biallystock's scheme.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Good But Rather Flawed And Dated Also,"Some people rate THE PRODUCERS as the greatest comedy film ever made .

I guess many people watching this in the 1960s and 70s would have first hand experience of Nazi cruelty ( Their reactions of a musical featuring Hitler probably reflect that of the audience watching Springtime For Hitler ) but after spending much of my childhood watching American B movies where the Nazis were bumbeling buffoons who couldn't shoot straight I could easily accept the concept of Hitler and his henchman being a hippy branch3 ) Be honest , there's not enough time dedicated to LSD's Hitler , instead we're treated to Leo having yet another panic attackTasteless and very funny in its day THE PRODUCERS seems rather dated .

Played to perfection by its cast.,"Mel Brooks's irresistible zany style was already in full bloom for this theatrical directing debut, a gleeful concoction about a hard luck Broadway producer, Max Bialystock (multiple Tony award winner Zero Mostel) who cons old ladies out of their money by agreeing to play games with them. Into his life comes a meek accountant, Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) who's supposed to go over the producers' books. Leo casually ventures the idea that one could make a lot of money selling well over 100% of a play which would be sure to flop. So the two of them think that they've found their surefire flop in ""Springtime for Hitler"", an invention by disgruntled ex-Nazi Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars). Of course, their plan goes seriously awry when the play is tweaked by its no-talent director, Roger De Bris (Christopher Hewett) and then performed for laughs by hammy star ""L.S.D."" (Dick Shawn), and the audience ends up loving it!This viewer personally didn't find the movie to always be terribly funny but there are most certainly very good moments throughout. The cast is so utterly enthusiastic that they do win you over. Mostel and Wilder are a great comedy team, especially in their introductory scenes; Leo is afraid of having Max jump on him and, much like Linus from the Peanuts comic strip, is attached to a blue blanket that he carries around with him! Mostel is a true force of nature as the slimy Max, while Wilder, who of course would go on to do other great things for Brooks, showed here his unmatched ability to completely flip out in a comic way. The other actors are fun, too; Mars is a riot as the unhinged Franz, especially towards the end when he, Leo, and Max make their last ditch effort to salvage their scheme. Lee Meredith is smoking hot as Ulla, the Swedish bombshell hired as a secretary who thinks that ""going to work"" means go go dancing. Viewers will also delight in the appearances by Renee Taylor (as Eva Braun), William Hickey as the drunk, and Barney Martin as Goring.The songs, not surprisingly, are catchy, with L.S.D.'s audition performance a standout. Brooks fans will know that his voice can be heard dubbed into the ""Springtime for Hitler"" number.This movie didn't do so well at first but amazingly found a supporter in comedy star Peter Sellers, and his endorsement would motivate people to revisit it and give it a fresh evaluation. 46 years later, it's now also extremely well known for inspiring a very successful Broadway musical, itself filmed in 2005.It's must viewing for all those eager to see the beginnings of Brooks's film career, a couple of years before he hit his biggest peak with his spoofs ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Young Frankenstein"".Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"""The Fuhrer is causing a furor!""","Broadway theatre producer, down-on-his-luck with a string of losers behind him, takes the joshing advice from his accountant to stage a sure-fire musical flop and sell off the interest in it, thereby leaving him a millionaire when the show closes after one night. Low-voltage hysteria from Oscar-winning screenwriter Mel Brooks, who also makes his debut as director. The timing is off, the scenes ramble without punch, the sets and art direction are appalling, and the opening scenes with Zero Mostel wooing different elderly women for show-money are disastrous. Oscar-nominated Gene Wilder has a very funny early scene freaking out in Mostel's office, and the auditions for their lopsided extravaganza are amusing. However, aside from the musical number ""Springtime For Hitler"", Brooks never quite gets the lead out. His pacing drags, and he's surely not helped by the flagging editing and overacting from just about everyone (Dick Shawn and Kenneth Mars are the worst culprits). Even though this is early-era Brooks, one is automatically inclined to cut him a wide berth for both his customary belly laughs and groaners--unfortunately, much of ""The Producers"" is lined with groaners, particularly in the third act after the show has opened.

Springtime,"Using his connections he had made while working on the Sid Caesar led Your Show of Shows, Mel Brooks found a way to take his perennial joke of a project titled ""Springtime for Hitler"" and turn it into a movie when he convinced producer Sidney Glazier to raise the $600,000 necessary for production. Hiring noted Broadway actor Zero Mostel and the up and coming comedic actor friend of Bancroft's Gene Wilder, Brooks wrote and directed a comedy classic. A hilarious and surprisingly tender look at a pair of nobodies who try to shortcut their way to financial wealth using offense as their tool, The Producers keeps a silly grin on my face from beginning to end.Max Bialystock (Mostel) is a has been Broadway producer, producing flop after flop with the money he gets by romancing little old ladies, organized with framed pictures he keeps in an armoire with code names like ""Hold Me Touch Me"". Into one of these little trysts in his office walks Leo Bloom (Wilder), a neurotic accountant sent to look over his books. One of the fun parts of this opening is how the credits work. Part of the frame gets frozen, framed in white with red lettering. This is often accomplished while focusing on Zero Mostel's face, and the comic timing of the moments is rather impeccable, getting us extended views at some of Mostel's most amusing grimaces and sighs of exasperation.When the two men are alone, Bloom starts looking through Bialystock's books and discovers that $2,000 from his previous play, a flop, was missing. Bialystock convinces Bloom to make it disappear since no one else cares and all he got out of it was a Turkish bath, and Bloom starts off on an accounting theoretical exercise where Bialystock raises a million dollars for a one-night flop. Using the appeal of New York City and the promise of life at the top, Bialystock convinces Bloom to give up his little gray life in the little gray box at the accounting firm to help him execute this plan. What's most interesting to me about this section is that it really creates a relationship between Bialystock and Bloom that's almost fraternal while also twisted and corrupt. The two men really do grow to appreciate each other over the film, and it starts here. Bialystock may be appealing for dishonesty, but the appeal is also something Bloom needs.Their search comes to an end when they discover the unproduced play titled Springtime for Hitler: A Gay Romp with Adolph and Eva at Berchtesgaden written by the barely closeted former Nazi Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars). Mars as Liebkind is one of the constant joys of this film. There's a small detail in his perpetually worn German infantry helmet, a bullet hole, that could explain his degree of insanity, but whatever the reason, his insanity is almost intoxicating in its amusement. He's terrified of being found out as a Nazi, despite the helmet, goes on long winded diatribes about how Churchill was not as good a dancer as Hitler, and how the world did not know the true gentleness of his Fuhrer. With the exact wrong play signed, the pair go to find the exact wrong director and exact wrong cast. For the director, they hire the Ed Wood inspired Roger de Bris (Christopher Hewitt) who is amazed by the historical tidbits in the play like that the Third Reich meant Germany. For the cast, they lead with Lorenzo St. DuBois (Dick Shawn), or LSD as he's called, a crazed hippy who is exactly the wrong type for someone to play Hitler. Well, someone to play Hitler seriously.And then the play opens, and the opening number, titled ""Springtime for Hitler"", of course, is one of the most deliriously hilarious things I've ever seen. I actually was the one who found out about The Producers in my family first, finding a copy of a Mel Brooks film I'd never heard of at the library when I was about 10 and taking it to my dad, and even now, more than twenty years later, I'm still in stitches as this thing plays out. It's such an outrageous display of bad taste that I find hilarious, and watching it each time is like watching it anew.Of course, the plan goes wrong when the wrong play, the wrong director, and the wrong cast combined to create the right end product of a comedy rather than a drama. Liebkind is, understandably, upset at the end result of his love letter to his Fuhrer, and Bialystock and Bloom work with him to try and blow up the theater to end the tyranny that is plaguing them for different reasons. It, of course, does not go as planned.And then the movie gets sweet again, and it remarkably works. Bloom really grew to appreciate the corrupt and dishonest Bialystock, and his appeal to the court that Bialystock never did him any harm is surprisingly touching in a twisted little way. There's a moment where, after having fought in the detritus of their plans, the two reconcile, and it's handled almost wordlessly and sweetly. Brooks really did seem to love these two characters in all their faults, and it comes through in the film.The movie was suppressed by its producer, Glazier, upon completion because he had no idea how to sell something so obviously offensive, but the key to Brooks' success here is that the offense can seem like its directed at the audience but is actually directed elsewhere. We watch two men do something outrageous and criminal without ever hating them and also enjoying their destruction at the same time because the offensive material doing it is so funny. I should also point out at how well directed the film is. Brooks was a first-time director who came out of television, and his framing is economical and clear but also, at times, surprisingly sophisticated. More than once, characters will be in the bottom corner of the screen and into the top corner, towering over them, will be another character who instantly dominates not just the frame but the whole scene on purpose. There's an understanding of spatial relationships and what they imply that you don't often get from first time directors.This is one of the jewels of first films from a director. Confidently directed, wonderfully performed, and uproariously funny, The Producers is a comedy that has stood well the test of time.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Castigat ridengo mores,"Mel Brooks is one of the great thinkers and explorers of comedy in the 20th century, and it is incredible to think that this was one of the first films where he worked and the first he directed. It is practically perfect and has material to make laugh the most diverse audiences. Of course, it's an old film, and its fame has diminished in recent years, but it's worth revisiting and recalling a film with so many merits. Nominated for two Oscars at the 1969 ceremony, it managed to bring home the award for Best Original Screenplay.And in fact, it's a script worthy of being awarded: the story is simple and works deliciously, in a very light way. It begins with the arrival of an accountant assigned by the bank to review the books of a Broadway producer who has seen better days: despite his past successes, he limits himself to seducing wealthy elderly women in an effort to separate them from their money with the vague promise of future profits from his next play. With this resource, he has ensured that this play will not earn him a penny and, even if it is a success, will surely put him in prison for fraud. So, in collusion with the accountant, he devises a plan: stage a play so astonishingly ignoble that it is a 100% failure on its first night! Then, they can pocket the remaining money and declare bankruptcy, avoiding prison. And what theme would be better to guarantee a box office flop than an ode to Nazism?The film is unsuitable for people without a sense of humor or incapable of appreciate sarcasm or satire: there are still many people who take things literally. However, if it were necessary to prove that this is a deeply anti-Nazi film, it would be enough to remember Gene Wilder's Polish Jewish origin and the Jewish heritage of director Brooks, who has dedicated himself to a personal revenge in which he ridicules the Nazis in every way he can. I think it's fair and appropriate, after all ""Castigat ridengo mores"".On a technical level, the film is superb: production values are excellent, and the film looks more costly and elaborate than it probably was (I don't know the budget or the box office numbers). Cinematography is a little dated in its treatment of light and color, but the filming and editing work is very good. The scenes on stage are the best, as the way the people reacts to what they are watching.The cast is led by two noteworthy names and their presence cannot be underestimated. Zero Mostel is an actor that youngsters ignore, but he was a very good comedian and a safe bet. Charismatic, he ensures an efficient protagonism and makes us like a character who, basically, is a despicable scammer. Gene Wilder, who was at the height of his career at the time, fit perfectly here, giving us a deeply nice character, naive to the point of childishness, which perfectly counterbalance the viciousness and slyness of Mostel's character.

The worst play in the world.,"'The Producers (1967)', Mel Brooks' first feature, is a high-concept comedy in which a pair of bumbling business men team up to produce the bomb of a lifetime, 'Springtime for Hitler', in order to keep all the excess budget for themselves. I don't think it's a spoiler to say that things don't exactly go to plan, which is where most of the comedy lies. This payoff takes a long while to come, though, and most of the movie is about the focal duo setting up their intentional flop. Its humour mostly comes from absurdity, whether it comes from the overall concept or from the broad characters, and it's all rather 'loud'. It has several chuckle-worthy moments but I wouldn't say it's hilarious. It's mostly enjoyable, though, which is the most important thing. Of course, some of it is a little problematic in retrospect. Surprisingly, however, its initially controversial Nazi lampooning has, relatively speaking, aged rather well. Using humour to take shots at Hitler and his stormtroopers has become somewhat common practice nowadays, to varying degrees of success, so Brooks' initial attempt isn't as shocking as it apparently was at the time. Whether or not it does what he hoped it would is another matter. For me, the flick never feels distasteful because, while it fails to mention the very serious atrocities committed by the Nazis, it paints its targets with an incredibly broad brush and doesn't feel like it wants its audience to sympathise with them in any way, shape or form. It doesn't trivialise their crimes, even if it doesn't mention them. Perhaps those unfamiliar with Hitler will see him as a comedic figure after watching this, with no understanding of the gravity of his crimes. However, it's common knowledge that the guy was despicable and that his party did some of the worst things imaginable, so this isn't necessarily a wide-spread issue. Basically, if you're coming to this film to get your history, you're coming to the wrong place (and are incredibly misguided). Besides all that, the flick doesn't focus all its attention on Nazis nor, indeed, the play involving them. Instead, these elements are used as a catalyst for the two protagonists' greedy shenanigans. These characters are the focus of the piece and they're what keep it from falling apart at the seams. Ultimately, it's a decent experience that's sometimes funny and typically rather entertaining. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A brilliant classic film,"Great film, incredibly funny comedic timing and, I think, a really invigorating performance from Gene Wilder. Overall a well-paced cinematic experience with a lot of solid bits and heart. Zero Mostel provided for a charismatic lead performance and the dynamic between the two was one of the highlights of the film.Mel Brooks' directorial vision in this film made it one of those films that I'm sure will continue to be relevant in the years to come.For a film with a runtime of only 1.5 hours, they were able to pack in a lot of jokes and gags. I would highly recommend it as a film to watch with friends and just enjoy the experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The medium is the message,"Impossible to judge the movie's efficacy after watching the vastly improved musical (which I'd give a 9). Brooks cleaned up the story arcs, added more hilarious numbers and, most importantly, got Ula on stage longer. It will be interesting to see how the new movie-based- on-a-musical-that-was-based-on-a-movie will fare. This is a brilliant premise that, since it is about a stage production, probably translates better to the stage. But funny is funny, and this is funny, although it could do with less yelling and mugging. Especially underwhelming is Gene Wilder's performance, which is just schtick. Wilder is usually golden, but the material here is so good, it doesn't need all the bells and whistles he provides.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Overrated and overacted.,"Theatrical producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel), assisted by timid accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), deliberately oversell shares for Springtime for Hitler, a show that they have no intention of making a success. Unfortunately for Bialystock and Bloom, the musical is a massive hit, meaning that they now owe the financiers 25,000% of the profits.A lot of people seem to revere director Mel Brooks as some kind of comedy genius, but on the basis of what I have seen (Young Frankenstein, The History of the World: Pt I, and now this) I have to disagree. Yes, he has his moments, but the films as a whole are more miss than hit. The plot for The Producers is ingenious enough, but the whole affair has a theatricality that makes it seem more suited to the stage than screen, while the gags are extremely laboured, the performers overcompensating for the lack of genuine laughs by wildly overacting.I admit to giggling at Dick Shawn singing his hippy rock song Love Power, the extravagant Springtime for Hitler musical number is fun, and Lee Meredith is a delight as sexy Swedish secretary Ulla, but once again, I find Brooks' work to be highly overrated.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Mel Brooks Goes Straight for the Jugular in His Cinematic Debut,"Mel Brooks bursts through the gates of Hollywood, writing and directing a lasting favorite for his first feature film, but he had some trouble finding a willing dance partner. Major studios were reluctant to back this bawdy comedy, which sets a pair of unscrupulous theatrical types on the road to the biggest flop in Broadway history. The stiff, neurotic accountant has found a legal loophole that would make an unsuccessful production far more profitable than a long-running one, and the scummy, low-rent producer knows all the right connections to make exactly that sort of disastrous musical. Although Brooks was clearly taking the piss, exorcising old ghosts with his signature brand of irreverent humor, the big dogs in tinsel town weren't anxious to greenlight a comedy with Adolf Hitler in a major role, no matter how absurd and disparaging his portrayal might have been.The big showtuney play these cockeyed crooks have contrived is dubbed ""Springtime for Hitler,"" an adoring ode to all things Axis, and it's spectacular. A perfect catalog of bad taste and glitzy over-indulgence, it's the kind of terrible that wraps all the way around to become its own brand of perverse, delightful entertainment. Which, to the chagrin of our over-leveraged executives, is exactly how their captive audience sees things. The audience members' shocked initial reactions are responsible for some of the film's biggest laughs, a sea of dropped jaws and palms-upon-foreheads, while their eventual, impossible acceptance powers the story's penultimate curves. It's a smartly flawed scheme, and a great showcase for Brooks's deliciously twisted sense of humor. I just wish we could've spent more time in the glow of that riotous premiere performance. A lot more time.The road to those onstage spoils is awfully long, and the imbalance between long setup and brisk payoff/outcome probably belies Brooks's inexperience as a filmmaker. That opening act, which runs for about 2/3 of the film, is loaded with wacky eccentrics; hilarious characters that suffer for their proximity to so many others of the same type. We spend so long dwelling on Zero Mostel's shameless machinations, Gene Wilder's manic outbursts, Kenneth Mars's dim-witted goose steps, Christopher Hewett's flamboyant cross-dressings and the inane passions of about a dozen more over-colored supporting players, there just doesn't seem to be enough leftover time to deliver the goods and wrap it all up. Most of these roles, if not all, are well-cast and undeniably funny, but they complicate the plot and hamper our progress to the bigger payoffs. Oversights that were corrected and improved, decades later, by the stage adaptation and succeeding cinematic remake.The Producers '67 has all the right components, and a wickedly avant-garde sense of humor, but it also has big problems. It's akin to reading the rough draft of an all-time favorite.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

"Outdated, loud, silly, putting off lousy acting with an occasionally funny script","Too loud and silly for my liking compounded with grown men touching and groping at each other every other scene has put me off which otherwise had quite a funny premise and a very potential slapstick plot. I have always enjoyed Mel Brooks movies, but this made my cringe mostly. The Swedish secretary and the actual show were an oasis in the middle of this huge man-made desert.Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) is a yesteryear successful producer now running on fumes entertaining old ladies for scrapes. When an IRS man Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) while going through his accounts makes a remark on how a producer can make money out of a sure flop, Bialystock gets interested and talks Leo into executing it. In the process they pick up the worst show ever written 'Springtime for Hitler' showing Hitler, his intentions and accomplishments in a bad taste. After they select equally superlative bad choices for director, actors etc.. they were just waiting for the show to get burned the first day and spend the money made out of it. Does their plan work towards their intentions forms the rest of the story.Though intentional this is by far the worst acting job by the entire unit and the most putting off presentation I have ever come across. The actors were too loud, too silly and their hugging and kissing and groping made me proud about my patience to finish the movie. Considering it is a successful movie does not lack in its merits with a well written script for a slapstick and occasional moments of humor and a breezy screenplay.

"Mel Brooks, at his absolute finest","Mel Brook's The Producers is his best film to date and is personally my favorite Brooks-film.  Everything in this film gets together greatly to make one big insane batch of comedy that may be repeated, but not matched.The acting is a big element here (so is Brooks' Oscar winning script).  It includes the great Zero Mostel as a low-life broadway producer, who with a nervy accountant (Gene Wilder in his best performance to date), concoct a plan to make more money from a plot, than from a hit.  To do this, they get a crazy Krout (Kenneth Mars) and a hippie actor (Dick Shawn) tocreate the worst musical ever- Springtime for Hitler (a gay romp with Eva in Berlich's garden).Wow.

Zero Mostel gives one of the greatest comedic performances of all time as a desperate Max Bialystock. He is a walking example of at least five of the deadly sins, yet he manages to be endearing, even lovable. Gene Wilder is his perfect foil; nebbishy, smart, impressionable, and longing for the life that Max promises.

Spriiiiingtime for Hitler,"The plot to this movie is really quite interesting, and gives Mel Brooks a podium to go completely over the top with one politically incorrect (whatever that phrase means) joke after the other. The ""Springtime For Hitler""-sequences are pretty hilarious, just so in your face, even by today's standards. Nazis who are singing and dancing are just really really wrong. Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder work well as a duo, but it's really Kenneth Mars who steals the show as the insane German guy stereotype. The whole comedy acting is pretty old-fashioned, by the book even, but this is just the type of screenplay that needs to be done that way. Exaggerated characters and grotesque situations, the system works. I wouldn't go as far as calling it the funniest movie ever made though. Don't get me wrong, it has plenty of good bits(the auditions, for instance), but not all of the material is that great and it does tend to drag at some points, I didn't really care for that.

Hitler as Comedy,"First, Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder played their characters with genius. ""Over the top"", for sure, but in an exceedingly entertaining way. I'm surprised when folks criticize their portrayals and go on to praise Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles. ""Over the top"" is Mel Brooks' endearing style. So, if you laughed at Frau Blucher, Igor, Mongo, Hedley LaMarr and Lili Von Shtupp, you'll be right at home with Bialystock and Bloom.Second, its easy to understand that some folks have a difficult time with Hitler/Nazis as comedy. For the rest of us, comedy is born from adversity. Mel Brooks understands that laughter and ridicule are the best ways to disarm your enemy's ability to continue to terrorize you. Even in WWII, it was deemed wise to trivialize Hitler in political cartoons. The Producers gives us a more frivolous version of Chaplin's Great Dictator. ""Survivor humor"" is, and always has been, everywhere. Hitler has no special reprieve from ridicule. On the contrary, as Franz Liebkind points out, laughing at Hitler is a disgrace to his memory. And that should be good enough for all of us.For those of you that enjoy a funny movie with wonderful acting, I highly recommend this flick. I just watched it again and it has weathered the years, like it's brothers Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, without becoming ""dated"".As an aside to the commentators that were personally offended by this movie because of their direct connection to the horrors of WWII, I was at the World Trade Center on 9/11 and I can't imagine anything funny about that day and the events surrounding it.

What could possibly go right?,"Max Bialystok (Zero Mostel), a producer of musicals who has lost his knack and is living on his illusions, gets some odd tax advice from his accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder): that although the IRS audits successful plays with a fine tooth comb, it ignores flops. Bialystok, who can no longer succeed in producing successful musical comedies, gets the inspiration to produce the worst musical ever, oversell the production to little old ladies willing to make investments in his plays after he seduces them, keep the investment, and have the money that he still needs for his self esteem. Bloom, until then a thoroughly-repressed and neurotic accountant, agrees and becomes a partner.Of course everything must fail. The music must be awful, the plot must stink, the set design must be dreadful, and the story must be offensive. So he finds the worst director, the worst choreographer to create incompetent dance scenes, the worst set designer to create a tasteless set, the worst performers possible, and above all the worst stage play available. And the worst stage play ever written is the incredibly tasteless ""Springtime for Hitler"", penned by an unrepentant nazi (Kenneth Mars) as a romp in the Third Reich for the 'lovable' clique of Hitler, Goering, Goebbels, and all the other sordid characters that ""Franz Liebkind"", the nutty Nazi, loves to the time.But Bialystok and Bloom, both obviously Jewish, have to 'seduce' the crazy nazi into believing that they have empathy with Liebkind's desire to express his love for the Fuehrer and his cause, even to the point of wearing swastika armbands that they despise in his presence.The casting for a ""Hitler"" finds a hippie-like actor who can't hold a tune or even make sense. The play, above all, is to have its premiere in New York City, a place where one would expect an audience only slightly less sympathetic to Nazis than Tel Aviv.Bialystok tries to offend the critics by offering a small bribe small enough to insult the critic. The play opens with anticlimax with stale music, bad lyrics, and an incompetent dance scene. Some dancers have tasteless headdresses (including a beer stein and a pretzel). The introductory dance scene incorporates the goose step and in the end a salute with artillery.Nothing could be a more certain failure -- but it SUCCEEDS!

A public accountant named Leo Bloom arrives to do Max's books one day, and he discovers that a producer can make more money with a flop then he can with a hit. Upon hearing this, Bialystock teams up with Bloom to find the worst play ever written, the worst director in town, and the worst cast around. When their surefire flop becomes a huge success, they suddenly find themselves in more trouble than they can handle. The Producers is Mel Brooks' first film, and it shot him straight to stardom due to its laugh out loud humour.Mel Brooks hasn't done a whole ton of movies in his time, but the ones he has done have all been hysterically funny. Mel Brooks has a great brain in his head. He knows how to write a good parody, but he also can write great original material. This is an example of his originality. Brooks' satire on the show business profession can bring tears to your eyes in some scenes. The entire plot and the tongue in cheek style of the film makes the movie all around hilarious. The funniest scenes are the ones involving Leo Bloom, played perfectly by Gene Wilder, who is so cowardly and nervous that he's thrown into hysterics when someone even looks angry.The acting is really good. Gene Wilder does an amazingly good job in one of his first film roles. He's so funny in this movie that it makes you want to go out and see his other films, just because you know it will be funny. Zero Mostel is funny as Max Bialystock, even though he falls second to Gene Wilder. The other acting job I really enjoyed was Dick Shawn as Lorenzo St. Dubois, or LSD.

Great 1968 Classic Comedy,"Mel Brooks produced a great comedy with plenty of laughs about two guys named Max Bialystock, (Zero Mostel) and Leo Bloom, (Gene Wilder) who both decided to produce a Broadway Play and try to turn it into an instant flop in order to make themselves rich.

So ... can we laugh about everything?,"On that question, one of the most notorious politically incorrect French comedians, Pierre Desproges provided the most overused answer: ""Yes, but not with everybody."" In other words, the most racist joke has to make a non-racist person laugh without creating a bond with a racist one. See? The distance between the content of his joke and its author must be evident. A bit oppressive isn't it? Or maybe we can all agree that humor essentially depends on the intelligence of the listener.With all its racism, sexism and inner vulgarity, the intelligence of ""The Producers"" is that it works on a self-reflexive way as each joke might get the two sorts of reaction that the infamous ""Springtime for Hitler"" inspired on the stage audience: a slack-jawed shock or cheerful applauds. But that's what the ""not with anyone"" means in my opinion, you trust the intelligence of the viewer enough to believe he can see behind the laughs where your opinions lies, and that making fun of something is also part of a subtle exercise of self-derision.Was it really necessary to show Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) and Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) removing the Nazi armband, putting it in the trashcan and spitting on it. Maybe as a reminder of the Nazi's barbarity but I thought that bit sinned by underestimating our capability to read between the lines. Anyway, apart from that moment, ""The Producers"" remains one of the funniest films ever made carried by the incredible Mostel and Wilder duo, ""The Producers"" outshines whatever defined humor in the sappy 60's : it's outrageous, irreverent, naughty and so blatantly amoral that calling it 'politically incorrect' is the understatement of the century.""The Producers"" pulverizes all the barriers of good taste with a daringness that flirts with genius in its incredible mix between a chaotic hysteria and a perfect comical timing. The scene where Leo Bloom frenetically screams ""I'm hysterical"" before Max throws water on him and then shouts ""I'm hysterical and I'm wet!"", the whole scene punctuated with so many unintelligible noises is some of the funniest pieces of comical acting ever made and maybe a landmark in comedy. When the water comes out of the fountain after Leo Bloom decides to have ""everything that's in the movies"" feels like exultation, an orgasmic liberation from every principle ruled by the movies through a hilarious hymn for selfishness and greed.The selfish and greedy one is Max, influenced by his new accountant and future accomplice, he decides to raise money to produce a flop in order to make the greatest benefit. The most likely play to flop, is a musical comedy about Hitler, a ""love-letter to Hitler"" written by a manic Nazi nostalgic wonderfully played by Kenneth Mars. And to be sure the play will fail; they take the worst director of all the showbiz, Roger De Bris, played by Christopher Hewett. It's a real delight to see Otto from ""Malcolm in the Middle"" and ""Mr. Belvedere"" in such hilarious performances, ""The Producers"" is served by a wonderful gallery of supporting performances where everyone has a moment to shine, even Ulla, the sexy Swedish receptionist whose name rhymed with Oh-lalaaaaa.Asking how they got away with calling a woman a 'toy' is pointless because the real question is how they got away with the infamous ""Springtime for Hitler"" and this swastika choreography that concludes it with Hitler's picture? Well, I feel that there are two reasons: right and wrong.Right first: by ridiculing even the most atrocious aspect of human history, you stop turning it into a sort of sanctified taboo. Humor becomes the true barometer of freedom of speech and if we can make fun of God, politics and sex, why should there be barriers even in the 'dark side'. As Mel Brooks said, the 'movie rose below vulgarity' it's so deliberately crude and vulgar that it never cease to mix the amazement with the enjoyment. The spirit of Mel Brooks is what differentiates mean-spirited propaganda and true slapstick, to the Donald Duck fans, between ""Commando Duck"" a bad cartoon with no other purpose than mocking the Japanese culture and the masterpiece ""Der Fuerher's Face"".Now, what was the bad reason that spared an accusation of bad taste : because only Jewish people could have made fun of Nazis and even of Jewish people with such audacity, without being accused of anti-Semitism. After all, the portrayal of Max's greed exploits some stereotypes that even the Nazis used in their propaganda, if you don't take them into perspective. Many would discuss this argument but didn't Sacha Boren Cohen invoke his own ethnic background to justify the Anti-Semitism displayed in ""Borat"" as a running joke.While I understand that never a gentle director would have dared to make such a movie, I totally disapprove the setting of racial barriers in humor, with its tacit rule to make fun only of our own ethnic background. It politicizes comedy and set rules when the very purpose of humor is to be deprived from anything except the capability to make people laugh. There's no way to avoid critics because the line between being offensive and funny will always be uncertain, but that's the subversion of humor. Many comedians were labeled as racist when they mocked some communities, as if the translation of ""yes, but not with anyone"" became ""not by anyone"" which distorts the very principles of humor.""Can we laugh about everything?"" I guess the answer is in the question, if we laugh, then it's funny. If we're intelligent enough to get it, then we can make a difference between insults and jokes, between mockery and mean-spiritedness, and to those who can't, I recommend ""The Producers"" as the greatest fertilizer to grow a sense of humor in the field of their constipated minds.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
pothead cult choice with one gag,"I remember the ""old days"" when the pothead cult determined this to be classic; like Jimmi Hendrix and SNL, you weren't cool if you didn't adore these things, which of course made you all the more dorky when you succumbed to the pressure. The movie was a one gag stunt then, just as it is now. The premise is two guys try to make money by producing a bomb stage play, selling investments at about 1000%, intending on a bomb with no revenue to pay off, pocketing the money. This is one of those ideas that don't even sound good on paper. One of those ideas that a couple of kids with IQs of 25 combined come up with. That is the joke. A mild ha ha at best. Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder, and Dick Shawn, as well as the subordinate players, make the most of it. Its the sort of stage play that relies 100% on the actors, because the script is void. And the cast is one of the better ones brought together. And Mel Brooks does what he can, but if you want a movie to make you laugh, you really have to strain to smile through this.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
A Classic Farce,"This is definitely one of the greatest farces in the history of film. Of course, this could only come from the mind of one of the greatest masters of farce, Mel Brooks. The whole idea of purposely putting on a flop to make money could only come from Brooks' mind and not only that, to have the plot revolve around Adolph Hitler is still very shocking to this day. However, Brooks pulled it off and created a classic. Also, the casting of this film was sheer genius. Zero Mostel is perfect as Max and Gene Wilder as Leo was genius as well. In fact, his characterization of Leo would pretty much be his trademark for years to come. Also, Dick Shawn puts in what is perhaps his best performance since his appearance in It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. He really shines as the overage hippie L.S.D.. This film is truly a classic.",,Anonymous,Music
what an excellent movie,I saw this movie on TCM and I like this movie. Gene Wilder did a perfect Leo Bloom. Zero Mostel did a great job with Max Bialystock. Christopher Hewett did excellent at Roger De Bris. Estelle Winwood was beautiful as the old lady. Lee Meredith as Ulla was wonderful. Mel Brooks did a great Voice singing for Springtime For Hitler. Andréas Voutsinas as Carmen Ghia was just right. This a story when Max Bialystock makes money. There are no music except for Springtime for Hitler.

"A sure-fire flop becomes a Broadway hit, much to the chagrin of its producers.","Mel Brooks won an Academy Award for his screenplay of ""The Producers"" and deservedly so.  This is just about the funniest movie ever made.  Zero Mostel is brilliant as the failed producer, Max Bialystock, who is reduced to seducing little old ladies into investing in his productions.  A very young Gene Wilder gives a great performance as the repressed accountant Leo Bloom who literally ""blooms"" under the tutelage of the exuberant Max.  Leo is going over Max's books when he discovers that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than with a hit. The search is on for a sure-fire flop, and a script written by former Nazi soldier Franz Leibman (played to the hilt by Kenneth Mars)called ""Springtime for Hitler"" is chosen.  The producers then hire the worst director, costumers, and actors.  The auditions for Hitler are unbelievably funny, and Dick Shawn plays Hitler as a tripped-out leader without a clue.  The opening musical number must be seen to be believed...tacky, overblown, satirical, hilarious.  This movie is so right-on; the supporting cast, bit players, stars, all are in top form.  I highly recommend this film!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Mel Brooks' best film.,"While I prefer Blazing Saddles over The Producers, I will concede that the latter is a better film. I just prefer Westerns over Broadway.What makes this film brilliant are the characters. Zero Mostel's Max Bialystock is a slovenly man with a comb-over who seduces randy octogenarians to finance his failures on Broadway. Gene Wilder's Leo Bloom plays a hyper-sensitive, anxiety-ridden, security blanket holding accountant who puts ideas in his head for the ultimate scam. Kenneth Mars' Franz Liebkind is a crazy Nazi who probably fears the atrocities in Germany just as much as he praises Adolf. Dick Shawn's L.S.D. is a goofy flower child who vainly tries to sound and act hip. Lee Meredith's Ulla is sexy eye candy; like Leo Bloom, you can't keep your eyes off of her.Scenes like Bialystock seducing octogenarian women, the hundred or so men doing ""Heil Hitler"" at the audition or L.S.D.'s terrible singing are classic comedy. As for the play itself, the opening is very entertaining; especially the Swastika dance. The scenes with L.S.D. seem to come off as Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In to me, though that's not a bad thing.All in all, a very entertaining film and deserving of its Oscars. Great acting, superb writing and joyous fun. I can see how it was impossible for Mel to top The Producers; it's near perfect.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"The Fuhrer has never said ""baby"".",Mel Brooks is an absolute comedic genius and I dare someone to tell me different. I'm writing this review in 2021 and The Producers is just as funny now as it was in 1967 as is with all Mel's movies. Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder are amazing as Max & Leo but for me Dick Shawn is the real star of the movie. The remake with Lane & Broderick is good but it's nothing compared to the original.,10.0,Anonymous,Music
Flat Story + Good Acting = Poor Film,"Mel Brooks is a hit or miss director. This is a miss.This is not as horrifically bad as ""Robinhood: Men in Tights,"" but it's flat, like a slice of white bread.I gave this film more than my 20 minute sniff test (32 to be exact), but it still just sat there. It tried to be funny, but wasn't.Perhaps, Brooks shouldn't simply rely on buoyant actors like Gene Wilder and pepper a film with slap-stick. Doesn't work.STORY: Two (2) guys want to produce a ""guaranteed to flop"" film hoping to get rich in the process. Here's why:
1) This story may have meaning to Mel Brooks given it's his livelihood, but it just doesn't resonate.2) The ""story"" itself is empty, so it appears that Brooks expects Mostel and Wilder to overcome the inert plot with opulent personas. Doesn't work.3) There's practically zero character or context development, so how do we get invested? (Brooks tends to do this.)ACTING: The ONLY good part of this film is the genuinely talented cast, but they can't breathe life into a dead story.(Yeah, kinda like the film itself.)TEMPO: Slow, choppy, a bit scattered.CINEMATOGRAPHY: OK scenery with it taking place in NYC, but nothing special at all. Actually, quite bland.DIRECTING: As mentioned at the outset, Mel Brooks is a hit or miss director. This is a miss.Overall, I wanted (hoped) to enjoy this. It's a dud.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
"Funny yesterday, funny today, will still be funny 20 years from today.","In all the times I've seen The Producers, I never tire of it. And I'm continually haunted by one question: who is funnier? Dick Shawn? Or Kenneth Mars?Shawn, as LSD, the star in the Bialystock/Bloom production of `Springtime for Hitler' is outrageous,  broader even than his wonderful turn in It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World'. Mars, who many will remember as W.D. Bud' Prize on `Fernwood Tonight', is spectacular as Nazi pigeon ranger cum playwright, Franz Liebkind.The Producers never misses an opportunity to stack gag upon gag--physical, musical, intellectual-no holds barred. At 88 minutes the film falls flat at about 65, but at that point you're so full of good humor it really doesn't matter anyway.Kudos to Andreas Voutsinas, and Christopher Hewett, both hilarious in smaller roles.If you haven't seen this film, see it today.

Springtime for Hitler,"Once the King of Broadway, Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) is now a greedy, lustful, and corruptible producer that sexually manipulates old women to get some money. Upon meeting Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), the hysterical and insecure accountant, the two come up with the perfect scheme to gain a fortune. This time they have to fail (something they are both good at) by producing a flop rather than a hit.The producer (1967) was the first film to be directed by Mel Brooks. His debut film is an amusing satire with a mood that makes the viewer lightheartedly go along the wickedness and fraud shown by the main characters. The jokes are rather genuine and the performances help a lot. Many say that the characters scream a lot (especially Wilder), but I only found that to be part of what made his hysterical personality so funny. The gay characters of Roger De Bris (Hewett) and Carmen Ghia (Voutsinas) and the Nazi Franz Liebkind (Mars) added a lot to the hilarious plot. Also, I should say that some of the names and jokes used reflect a witty and culturally knowledgeable Brooks.. (Using the name Prince Myshkin from Dostoyevsky's novel ""The Idiot"", or Carmen Ghia = Karmann Ghia.. etc.)The film was criticized also for depicting the two main characters Bialystock and Bloom as two Jews that are trying to cheat theatrical investors; an aspect that many found unoffensive and remarkably clever especially when added to the ""Nazi play scheme"" planned for by the protagonists.Although the film was more shocking back then in the 60s (it is claimed that Peter Sellers had to intervene with the executive producer Joseph E. Levine to convince the studio to release it! And it was released on one condition that is changing the title from Springtime for Hitler to The Producers), it is in fact gaining more and more respect throughout the days. Many critics such as Roger Ebert, consider it one of the funniest movies ever. Whatever the taste of the viewer is, I recommend this movie for it is really a brilliant classic film.. the type missed nowadays.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Still a Classic with Brooks, Wilder and Zero in Peak Form","I have seen the smash hit Broadway musical version with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick. While I love the update and added music and schtick, I have to say that I still prefer the original 1968 film upon which the show is based, the first movie Mel Brooks ever directed. By now, the story of two producers seeking to profit from a Broadway flop is familiar, but the concept is still priceless. The comedy scenes are original and nonstop, and unlike Brooks' later films, they actually seem to feed a solid, original storyline that does not take its inspiration from other films.Zero Mostel, with his greasy comb-over and heavy-lidded, bugged-out eyes, is the ideal choice to play has-been theatrical producer Max Bialystock. Though larger than life as always, he seems downright subdued at times compared to the sideshow of characters surrounding him. Somehow the thought of Mostel as a paid lothario for wealthy old ladies stretches beyond the bounds of credibility and taste, all the more reason to guffaw at his antics in securing investment money for his big production. With his saucer-eyed innocence and apologetic demeanor, Gene Wilder is equally hilarious as nebbish accountant Leo Bloom. All the familiar mannerisms are there, but in his first major film appearance, he seems just right in expressing first his disdain for Max's unsavory business practices and then his excitement in breaking out of his shell when he realizes he's about to become a big Broadway producer.My favorite scenes are among Brooks' most creative concoctions - the Hitler auditions; the too-close-for-comfort elevator ride with mincing assistant Carmen Giya; the euphoria Leo feels when he becomes corrupted as he skips around the Lincoln Center fountain; and of course, the elaborate opening number of the musical that Max and Leo hope will flop, ""Springtime for Hitler"". I still think the audience response immediately after the number is priceless, among Brooks' best shots, especially when the one guy who applauds is attacked. The entire supporting cast is great - the underrated Kenneth Mars as devoted Führer-loving Franz Liebkind, a pre-""Mr. Belvedere"" Christopher Hewitt as the over-dramatic transvestite director Roger DeBris, Lee Meredith as sexy Swedish secretary Ulla (given several unrelated opportunities to go-go dance in a bikini - predating Goldie Hawn on TV's ""Laugh-In"") and even Dick Shawn in full hippie-dippy mode as the star of the show, L.S.D. Although there are certain touches that date the film including Shawn's character, there is a sense of quaintness and even sweetness about it that does make you sad it has such a brief running time (90 minutes). There is a film version of the Broadway musical in the works, but I still think this movie stands on its own and continues to get better over the years. A deserved comedy classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

A Sign of What Was to Come,"The Producers (1967)*** (out of 4)A Broadway producer (Zero Mostel) and an accountant (Gene Wilder) realize that you could make a great amount of money if you found countless investors to give money for your play and it close after one night. The two of them set out to commit a fraud by putting on the play Springtime for Hitler.Mel Brooks' THE PRODUCERS is considered by many to be one of the greatest comedies ever made. I personally wouldn't go that far as I think Brooks was still learning his craft, which would soon take off but at the same time there's no question that this is a rather unique and interesting comedy that has enough laughs to make it worth watching.I think the greatest thing this film has going for it are the performances by Mostel and Wilder. There's no doubt in my mind that no other actors could have made these roles work as well as Mostel and Wilder did and especially when you consider the chemistry that they have together. The two of them really do seem like a life-long comic team because they just work so well off one another as if they have been making pictures for decades! The two of them really deliver some great laughs throughout the picture. You've also got Lee Meredith who is a lot of fun as the sexy secretary.Brooks certainly handles the material quite well and the film for the most part is rather laid back. It's more of an ""intelligent"" comedy that some of the more visual comedies that the director would do in the following decade. The film moves well enough and as I said there are enough laughs to make it worth watching.

A funny film from the mind of Mel Brooks,"I didn't see this in a theater when it first came out. This is Mel Brooks first film and although he had won an Academy award for a cartoon and had been a big name in television as a writer and director I don't think he had enough film clout to sustain this in the theaters very long and it probably had a short run on the big screen and disappeared to turn up on late nigh TV movies. It did go on to win Brooks an Oscar for Best Screenplay and a nomination for Gene Wilder as Best Supporting Actor for 1968 but the film was released on March 19, 1968 and it didn't win it's Oscar until April 14, 1969 so it was long gone from the theaters by then. I first saw it a couple years after its release on a late night movie on TV. I immediately loved it in a cult-like way you catch onto some movies. I'd then always look for it to be on TV and catch it every time I could. Brooks of course would go on to direct such classic comedies as Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie and High Anxiety in a film career as an actor/writer/lyricist/producer/director. It's the story of a Broadway producer and his accountant who come up with a plan to get enough people to over invest in a play that will close after a single performance that they can walk away with a profit. They have to find a sure-fire bomb in something that would be so offensive it will assure an opening and closing night one time run. They find it in a script by a Nazi sympathizer that glorifies the Third Reich, Cast an eccentric hippy in the lead role and hire a transvestite with a record of ineptness in directing plays to direct and they create the musical Springtime for Hitler in Germany. zero Mostel and Gene wilder lead the cast which includes Dick Shawn, Kenneth Mars, Christopher Hewett and Estelle Winwood.

Has some very funny and tasteless moments but is mostly just an amusing piece of ham,"With his business basically in the toilet after yet another flop, producer Max Bialystock has taken to extorting old women for small cheques. A visit by accountant Leo Bloom and an off hand remark about insurance puts a plan in Max's mind. With Leo he plans to gather a large amount of investment to produce a play that will be a sure fire flop and claim the insurance money when it closes on the first night; the only risk being that, if it makes money, then they will be in debt to all their investors and be charged with fraud. To make totally sure of a flop they decide on the most tasteless film they can possibly find, the worst director and the most unsuitable cast and, thou, the curtain is soon raising on ""Springtime for Hitler"", a musical about the rise of Hitler and Nazi Germany.With the play making headlines recently for big name starts dropping out of the London production (despite a great reception) I decided to rewatch the film again. As with my other viewings, I found the film to be consistently amusing with a handful of great moments but generally unworthy of the high regard that many seem to hold it in. The plot is a great concept and it produces the high point of the film with the wonderfully tasteless title song of the show, but too much of the humour is rather broad  and not in the way of Brooks' better spoofs but rather broad as in being generally amusing. The script lacks a real sharp edge to it and I didn't find myself laughing that many times even if I did find it to be consistently pretty enjoyable stuff.The cast are a big reason that it keeps this tone going, in particular the lead two, who ham it up for all they are worth in performances that suit the material even if it isn't their best work. Mostel plays it up well and a good chemistry with Wilder who overdoes it in a quieter way. Support is good from Mars, Shawn, Hewett and Hickey. As with the material, they are all very broad and enjoyable without ever really being great.Overall this is a funny film but not to the degree that some viewers may expect as a result of the high regard it is held in. All those involved have made better films and I found it to be rather broad as both comedy and satire and didn't excel as either. Despite this, the highs compensate for the odd moment where it falls flat and generally the film is a fun and enjoyable 90 minutes.",,Anonymous,Music

"Don't Be Stupid, Be a Smarty, Come and Join the Nazi Party","Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder aim Mel Brooks' bawdy jokes at the third balcony, and the result is one of the funniest movies ever made. As anyone who doesn't live under a rock by now knows, Mostel and Wilder play Max Bialystock, failing Broadway producer, and his hysterical accountant, Leo Bloom, respectively. When the two realize that they can make more money off a Broadway flop than they can with a hit, they set out to make the worst show ever made, and ""Springtime for Hitler"" is born.The fun in ""The Producers"" is watching Max and Leo assemble their team of show-biz disasters. Not since Dorothy skipped down the yellow brick road on the way to Oz has a more colorful assortment of characters been added one by one to a film's cast. There's the play's author Franz Liebkind, who spontaneously bursts into the Nazi anthem and whose plans include world domination; Ulla, the Swedish tease, whose hips move independently from her torso and who Max meets in the public library; Roger DeBris, who thinks the third act of the play ""has got to go"" because the Nazis are losing the war; his ""assistant"" Carmen Ghia, who slinks around wearing a pointy beard and a monocle and who enjoys (maybe too much) his ride in the elevator with Max and Leo; and last but not least, Lorenzo St. DuBois, also known as LSD, who sings perhaps the film's funniest song, ""Love Power,"" while wearing furry thigh boots and finger cymbals and which ends with him breaking a banana in half and sticking his thumb in his mouth.The high point of the movie, of course, is the ""Springtime for Hitler"" production number, that includes dancing girls dressed as pretzels and beer tankards and includes lines like ""We're marching to a faster pace/Look out, here comes the master race."" Just the shot of the audience watching the show, their mouths hanging open in dumbstruck shock at its awfulness, is alone worth sitting through the movie for.My only complaint with ""The Producers"" is really a compliment, and it's that there's not enough of it. The whole movie has a sketch-comedy feel, and each supporting character gets really no more than a big scene or two. I really wanted more of Roger and Carmen, and more of LSD. And of course it would have been great if Brooks had filled out ""Springtime for Hitler"" even more. Indeed, that number is such a show stopper that the movie deflates a bit after it's over and never quite recovers.This is easily Brooks' best film, and it's wonderful to see such an unapologetically in-your-face comedy work so well. It's crass and crude and silly, yet remarkably intelligent all at the same time.

One Of Mel Brooks' Best,"This movie has the best elements of Mel Brooks'.  It involves great emotion and friendship, slapstick comedy, and this movie is a satire ahead of it's time like ""To Be or Not to Be"" Starring Jack Benny.  Unlike other Brooks films this one was not a spoof, and although Brooks made great films out of Blazzing Saddles, Young Frankenstien, Dracula Dead and Loving it, Space Balls etc etc. This movie is original with it's own jokes and it's own soul.

"""Don't be stupid, be a smarty. Come and join the Nazi party.""","THE PRODUCERS is a music comedy film that mocks at a satiric, but a vulgar way, a very tricky theme.Theatrical producer Max Bialystock was once the toast of Broadway. Now he lives in his seedy office, cadging cash contributions from wealthy old ladies in exchange for sexual favors. His new accountant, Leo Bloom, the soul of honesty, suggests that Max produce a hit to try to recoup his losses, but Max knows that it's too late for that. Leo discovers a $2,000 discrepancy in the accounts of Max's last play. Max persuades Leo to hide the relatively minor fraud, and while shuffling numbers, however Leo has a revelation...The story is very fun, though the plot is a little confusing. The theme is a matter of taste, but I think that Mr. Brooks did not taken into account the sensitivity of a certain part of the audience. The conclusion is nonconforming with the rest of the story, although a certain amount of sentimentality rescues the situation. However, the relationship between the two major protagonists is remarkable. Their conversations are hilariously fun, but their product has made the greatest damage to this movie.""The Hitler you loved, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler with a song in his heart."" It is so grotesque and vulgar, yet it has caused a positive response with a fictional audience.Zero Mostel as Max Bialystock is a cunning fox, who catches the last straw of salvation in his life. His performance is very funny, however, his brutal fraud reminds us of a some daily routine. Gene Wilder as Leopold ""Leo"" Bloom is a nervous, hysterical and shy accountant. He is Mostel's support, but his character changes, so that he becomes aware of the consequences of their scams, but still he is more satisfied with himself than he was before. Kenneth Mars as Franz Liebkind has offered a good performance as a Nazi fanatic.This is very funny, but it could be packed much better.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
It's ok.,"I saw the 2005 version of this first, many years ago and thought that it was awful. The humour was so twee and farcical, but somehow this 1967 original does it well. Something about the film making processes and the actors of the time works. The jokes don't seem as ridiculous because you can take in to account the period that it was made in or something like that. I can't quite think of how to phrase it.It's still not a story that I enjoyed that much and it was a bit slow to start. I would have liked to have seen more of the rehearsals and the musical that they were making to fully show what was so wrong about it.I thought Dick Shawn was very good, an early Steve Martin, but much easier to watch.I can only imagine how controversial this would have still been in 1967 and perhaps if I had lived through the war I may have found it more offensive, but I would hope not.Having watched this one, I would be more inclined to see a theatrical performance of it, as I have previously refused point blank, but I wouldn't want to pay too much for the ticket.317.57/1000.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

"The funniest movie I seen next to IT's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World.",the Producers is the funniest movies I seen in a Long Time. Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder are the perfect comedy team. They play off each other in perfect timing. The other actors are added to the laughs. Kenneth Mars as the author of the Play makes the audience believable. Dick Shawn makes a Hilter character we can laugh at. There was laughter from the start to the end. The sense where the opening of the play with the dancing SS Troop with the look of the audience is the greatest. Laughter just abounds with the whole movie. Mel Brooks music is the funniest. Just a great movie. I would watch it every time I see it on TV. Thank you AMC.,10.0,Anonymous,Music
A fun movie with some visible holes in the plot,"I understand that this movie was a hit, and I did enjoy it very much. Mostel and Wilder are truly great, and the idea behind the plot is superb.There are, however, a few weak points. The biggest one is the mystery how Bialystock first have to court old ladies to barely earn a living, and then suddenly can swindle them of a fortune. There is no obvious reason. Why would he need to produce anything if the old ladies are naive enough to invest in a play that they haven't even seen the script for? If, on the other hand, they had started with a first-rate script, sold too many shares on THAT, and then do all they can to make a flop out of it, that would have been much more logical. Without the bad script, we would not have the mad writer (Kenneth Mars), but the plot would have been convincing. I have read at least one story based on The Producers that avoids those logical problems.The other total lunatics, like deBris (Christopher Hewett) all make sense (and over-act as they should), and how deBris and the actors can fit together to make the result a hit is quite sensible.A second weak point is Ulla (Lee Meredith) the blond bimbo. She is a cliché that adds nothing to the movie, she is not fun but only makes me sad. Of course her presence is a result of Bialystock's strange ideas of luxury, but just finding a complete idiot like her is too unlikely. She could possibly have been part of the play (as Eva Braun?), but as a pet secretary she is only offending.There is one more weak point. The turning from flop to success, by actors performing a high school student level farce is not convincing. Rather, the grandiose opening was more likely to work as something so superbly overdone that it becomes a good satire. So when the play goes from grandiosely overdone musical to cheaply improvised amateur play, that is not the point where I expect the audience to start loving it. They could possibly start smiling at a bit of simplistic farce, and THEN get enthusiastic at how it fits with the music numbers, but not the other way around. Or is the audience that easy to please? But I take this problem as a problem with time; it would take too much time to show high-class humor with tension and perfect timing.All in all, I think the actors (and most likely first-class direction of them) carry this movie. Mostel, Wilder, Hewett and most others (even most smaller roles) do terrific acts that add up to a very enjoyable movie and I can choose to ignore the logical errors.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Let's hear it for the Jews!,"By far the best Mel Brooks' film I've ever seen.  I laughed start to finish finding the recurring old lady bit hilarious... it makes me crack a smile every time I think about it.

The way he does it is masterful... and I'm not exactly sure how he pulled it off.  ""Springtime for Hilter"" or ""Winter for Poland and France"" was undoubtedly one of the most brilliant comedic sequences I've ever seen.  Dick Shawn was hysterical as LSD/Hitler, and I also thought he was the best part of Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.

Refreshing and Funny,"I originally watched the new musical version of the producers, because I loved the music. Now don't get me wrong, I love the story, and the music, but I found it over acted. The only reason I picked up the older version of the Producers was because it had Gene Wilder in it, and I love Gene Wilder. I plugged it into my DVD player, turned it on, and boy was I in for a surprise. It is nothing like the new version. OK, they are the same story, but the original is so much better than the old one. The characters seem more real, and there is no over acting. There are some things I didn't like, i.e. I liked the new Franz better than the old one, but only because you could actually understand Will. Other than that I really preferred Zero and Gene's Max and Leo to Nathan and Matthew's. I strongly recommend this version over the new one any day.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Mel Brooks first movie is certainly a good one.,As I said on the summary this movie is a good one it has loads of laughs in it has class and the right actors to play the people. The movie is about 2 men one a washed up movie directer(Zero Mostel) and an insane but clever accountant(Gene Wilder) discover that they can get more money from a flop then with a hit. The storyline works really well and Gene Wilder steals the show really but Zero Mostel holds it up really well. This show has got a lot of good things in it 1. Mel Brooks famous humour is very clear while it being probably his smartest movie.2. The storyline is the best out of a lot of movies and 3. It is very very original. Overall I think this show while not being Mel Brooks funniest definitely deserves a lot of praise so I rate it 91%.,,Anonymous,Music
The funniest movie of all time,"I fell in love with this movie thirty years ago.  I am not yet tired of its jokes.  Its dialogue remains the lyrical comic poetry that plays forever in my heart.  I am not alone in this opinion.  To the best of my knowledge, all knowledgeable and right thinking people consider this to be the funniest movie of all time.The Producers is filled with great actors giving great performances as great comic characters in the middle of inspired wall-to-wall silliness.  I know of no script (and here I include Shakespeare) so completely filled with memorable lines.  I would like to share a few of my favorite lines with the reader, but I am going to resist the temptation.  They are only funny -- screamingly funny -- once you have heard them in context.This is Mel Brooks, at his best, directing the best cast he ever assembled in the funniest material he ever wrote.  If you liked Blazing Saddles or Young Frankenstein, or anything else he did (even if you only liked it a little bit), it is absolutely necessary to see the Producers.Of course, if you have a low tolerance for silliness, or if you are very easily offended, or if you suffer from a heart condition, you should skip this movie.

"Funny Premise, Slow and Dated Execution","Amitidly it is difficult to review a comedy. Humor, after all, is a very subjective thing. Also giving respect to the time period in which the comedy was created. But I am reviewing this film in how it stands up by today's standards. If I could rip out someone else's eyes and see this movie from their point of view I would, but to me, this is pretty slow and clunky.From the first joke, you can probably tell if this is the film for you. Max Bialystock is seducing old ladies to get money for his next production. After one leaves, he then switches the photo on the table to another old lady, who comes in as the previous exits. At that point, about the 30 second mark, you get the joke. But this scene goes on for over 9 minutes of screen time. That's 10% of the runtime of the film spent on this same joke. And the joke was more awkward than it was funny.There are undoubtedly funny jokes in the movie. And the premise of producers trying to deliberately bomb a production is a hilarious idea.

misunderstood,"So far, 5 people have written a bad comment about ""The Producers"" (one person said it was mediocre). The major complaint of these 5 people is that they don't find it funny.

Funniness is very subjective, so even if these 5 people didn't find ""The Producers"" funny, YOU still might.But at least one of these comments included that the two stars were overacting. That's why I think that this film is misunderstood. I mean, come on, people. What kind of films did Mel Brooks do later in his life? Zany, hilariously bizarre spoofs like ""Blazing Saddles"", ""Young Frankenstein"", ""Spaceballs"", ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights"", etc. And I think that this film is also one of those zany, hilariously bizarre spoofs. All the overacting, the shouting, the kooky actions, the hilarious one-liners - all this is Mel Brooks experimenting with this particular genre of comedy.This film is not to be taken seriously.

Mel does us all a great service as well by holding the Nazi's up for ridicule in this movie as he did in his remake of the 1942 original To Be or Not To Be with Jack Benny. The casting of Dick Shawn to play the actor performing as Hitler on stage was perfect.

There are suggestions that the acting was good: perhaps that ages poorly too - I found this also flat and uninteresting. The tedious opening 'gag' of the failed producer collecting checks from ""rich old women"" went on intermixed with the opening credits for almost 7 minutes: at least when Monty Python messed with the credits they made them funny... this started the entire film out as slow and it never recovered (apart from the light relief of the musical itself).

"Producers, The (1968) [Directed by Mel Brooks]","I've glanced at a few reviews posted by others on IMDB, and it appears to be general opinion that the comedy in this film is dated and the movie itself is over-rated (`forgive the pun,' as stated by Andreas Voutsinas). But whoever thinks this film isn't funny must be joking, because in my opinion The Producers is Mel Brook's second finest film (next only to Young Frankenstein). Comic legend Peter Sellers himself once stated that this is `the ultimate film,' and he is most definitely correct. I mean, what else could you expect out of Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel, an Academy Award-winning script, and a play entitled `Springtime for Hitler?' Simply put, this movie is comic genius. Built solidly upon the concept of pounding irony into the ground until it is no longer ironical, Mel Brooks' story is about two producers (one of which is inspired by a real person he knew at 16) who concoct a scheme to raise more money than needed to make a Broadway flop and -- after the play closes on opening night -- keeping the rest of the dough and cooking the account books. The irony aspect REALLY becomes evident when the play -- Springtime for Hitler -- becomes a runaway hit, and they must blow up the theater in order to keep it from being a success. I found it a sheer delight to watch Zero and Gene fumble about attempting to do exactly the opposite of ordinary (casually throwing about lines like, `I picked the wrong play, the wrong director, the wrong cast; where did I go right?'). This entire movie could have very easily been a total disaster, but with such fantastic casting and brilliant dialogue, it truly deserves to be called one of the funniest films ever made. It also must be noted that the newly released Special Edition DVD -- with remastered picture and 5.1 Surround Sound -- has a must-see documentary with stories that are almost as funny as the movie itself (`She refused to wear swastikas on her t**s, so we replaced 'em with black eagles').Grade: A",10.0,Anonymous,Music

A Possible Moral to the Madcap,"After 200+ reviews, what's left to say. Nothing much, except such an outrageous comedy could only have emerged from the free-wheeling 60's. Actually, what surprises me is the relative absence of sex, unless romance with giggly 80-year olds qualifies. But then neither Mostel nor Wilder is exactly an answer to a maiden's dream.What a marvelous premise the writers came up with. Producing a guaranteed flop just about makes all the subsequent insanity believable. And getting drug-addled 'LSD' (Shawn) to play Hitler makes for perfect nonsense. No doubt about it, the movie's a one-of-a-kind, outrageously funny from beginning to end and arguably Brook's best.

Nor will I analyze it in the minute detail that other reviewers have done so well.But, people always seem amazed when I point out the fact that Bialystock & Bloom are characters straight out of a Nazi propaganda movie. One is a sniveling, somewhat effeminate nerd and the other a loudmouthed pushy sleazebag who would cause anyone who shook hands with him to count their fingers. All ethnic groups have their charlatans,swindlers, and even rich old lady seducers. But an anti-semite would tell you that only Jews would be so cravenly amoral as to profit from their own people's misery. And Bialystock gives the impression that he would pull the old lady routine on his own mother. They don Nazi armbands, and sing old beer hall songs with their arms around the author of ""Springtime for Hitler"", all the while assuring him that they only want to show the world what a kind and gentle man Hitler was!?!This is exactly what a Nazi would tell you is wrong with Jews. Some of the more academically inclined anti-semites of the past even expressed a degree of sympathy for this behavior. You see, not having a nation state, the poor Jews couldn't help being liars and cheats oblivious to everything but survival and making a buck. Nothing, not even their own people's suffering; much less abstract notions of honor and human decency; could be allowed to get in the way. Mel Brooks (himself a Jew) seems to understand this and makes it an important component of this riotously funny, yet extremely dark comedy.Please understand that this writer is NOT anti-semitic. In fact, I'm a member of the ""Tribe"". The wry, cynical, iconoclastic sense of humor that has become a part of Jewish culture is also one of the causes of the disproportionately high involvement of Jews in progressive and humanistic endeavors. It has allowed them to see beyond the blind loyalties and literalism that often retard social progress. Not to mention getting them through more than three thousand years of conquest and persecution.I guess I'm just surprised at how few have this perspective.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Prisoner of Love for The Producers,"This is the film I would take to a desert island. It was a love affair from the first time I saw ""The Producers"" in the theater. I bought it on VHS when it came out, and now have it on CD. My kids grew up on it and can quote entire scenes. Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel were inspired, brilliant. No others are Leo Bloom and Max Bialystock. Off the top of my head, some of the irresistible lines, and as quotable as Shakespeare:""Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!"" ""Yes, Prince Mishkin. They all come here. How do they find me?"" ""My blanket, my little blue blanket!"" ""I'm in pain. I'm wet. ""I'm hysterical."" ""You used to be able to sit on the stoop like a person."" ""White, white, white, the color of our carpeting."" ""Max, he's wearing a dress."" ""Get car! Get car! Go to motel?"" ""Actors are not people. Did you ever eat with one?"" ""Congrat-u-lations! Hitler will run for years.""Mel crammed everything into this film--the creative accounting of show business, Hitler, the counterculture of the 60s, the fun and sadness of old age, success and failure, con men and innocents, and even references to great works of literature. Call it Yiddishkeit because that's what it is. He won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

The Original.,"Many know the musical, but not this. It's Mel Brooks's directorial debut. Clearly, he left one hell of an impact in his first outing. Even in its time, The Producers was a shocking movie, let alone how self aware it is about being shocking. Hitler wasn't someone that anyone dared making satire out of. Nazism isn't funny. It never will be. But God bless Mel Brooks for making a comedy at the expense of Nazis. Satire wouldn't be the same without The Producers, but that almost goes without saying. Through the lens of history, The Producers is a film for the ages. From the prospective of today, it's amazing to see how far Brooks has come from here. Above all else, this early incarnation of The Producers is an independent film. Low budget warts and all. No studio or big money was behind Brooks here. Given the sensitivity of the material, you could understand why. The other thing that you will notice is how steeped into the 1960s this is. Unlike the musical version which pays tribute to the great stage and screen musical masterpieces of the 50's, the film's backdrop grapples with the cultural revolution that was unleashed in 1967. Notably, the actor who plays Hitler is a flower-child junkie named Lorenzo St. DuBois (LSD). He's played by Dick Shawn and he sounds uncannily like Robin Williams in his comedic heyday. So yeah, it's tremendously different than the musical we all know, but it's just one of those movies you need to watch if you love comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The Biggest Scam on Broadway,"Zany Broadway farce about two Jews who plan to make a show so bad they won't have to pay their investors anything. Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel) the washed-up stage producer spends his days exciting wealthy old ladies for money until young, highly strung accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) comes in and innocently suggests that a flop could earn more than a hit, which fills Max with gleeful greed. Together they discover a play which they think is a sure-fire disaster, ""Springtime for Hitler"", selling 25,000% with the intention of embezzling the profits.The premise is funny and original but the execution is amateurish and crude. Writer-director Mel Brooks, in his moviemaking debut, doesn't show good comic timing; he lets clever gags fizz out and the silly ones thud consistently. It has a cheap look and the hammy acting often gets excessive - Kenneth Mars as the former Nazi playwright in particular is a hysterical embarrassment - yet Mostel and Wilder carry the picture with their talent. Dustin Hoffman was offered Mars' part but instead joined THE GRADUATE alongside Brooks' wife Anne Bancroft.Initially a failure, many didn't take kindly to the film's vulgarity; while poking fun at hippies, gays and transvestites, it mockingly portrayed Hitler to little appreciation. Nevertheless, it picked up an Oscar for best screenplay and has since been considered a masterpiece of low-brow comedy and one of the funniest films ever made. Brooks remade it into a smash musical many years later, which won a record twelve Tony Awards and was itself turned into a movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

"Don't listen to him, he's crazy","In order to take advantage of a tax loophole, theater producer Max Bialystock(Mostel, flamboyant) and accountant Leo Bloom(Wilder, a nervous wreck) put on a play together that's sure to fail: Springtime For Hitler.This is the only version I've watched. I've loved every Brooks-directed film that didn't have Dracula in it, meaning, Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie, History of the World: Part 1, Spaceballs, Robin Hood: Men in Tights. And, yes, this. You can tell it's his debut. Quality, and thus, laughs, range greatly over the course of it. It's really broad. And vulgar from frame 1. For the first several minutes, it feels as though it's (possibly unintentionally) meta. Like the movie itself wants to offend the audience, not entertain. Then it starts to come together. The material that's strong in the good way piles on. And honestly, even when I wasn't laughing, the effort is still there.This has tons of great personalities. Everyone is on the verge of a complete breakdown, many for different reasons and in other directions than the others. Adolf himself is portrayed by a flower-child whose mind is just barely still there from all the acid. He remembers his name only because the initials are LSD. Do note that the first performance of the piece itself, which is almost the only place that has musical numbers, is two thirds through the running time. This mocks all aspects of show business, and of Nazism. The aesthetics, the idea to wage war, and, yes, the devoted supporters that it still had when this came out. And sadly, to this day. Nothing disarms like comedy. Any moment that imagery from The Third Reich(which, as you might not know, meant Germany) is shown, it is ridiculed. The person, the clothes, the sound accompanying, the reaction, *something*, about it is risible.The DVD has trailers for this, and movies like it. OSS 117: Cairo: Nest of Spies, OSS 117: Lost in Rio, The Last Remake of Beau Geste, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990), Silent Movie, High Anxiety, To Be Or Not To Be and The Cannonball Run. And since it's from Scandinavia, the ones with Brooks involved is listed under an alternate title involving the words ""Springtime For"". It also has posters for this, and pictures from it. I recommend this to any fan of those involved in making it. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"The review of ""The producers"" (1967) by Mel Brooks","The perfect script, which was recognized by Academy Award, looks modern nowadays. This story about unsuccessful producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel), who was ""The king of the Broadway"" in past. The idea to stage the worst play of the world, which came to him thanks to appearance of an accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), sounds like a madness. And because of this crazy idea producers' life became very funny and surprising!
The script is well built and the characters are skillfully designed. The author of the play named ""The springtime for Hitler"" justifies his nature. He is fond of Hitler and he admires the greatest tyrant. This madman speaks with birds and shoots a gun and whole his feelings and motivations are accurately played by Kenneth Mars. 
It is a slapstick comedy which mixed different types of humor, jokes, tricks and gags. Needless to say, absurd dialogues make the narration more interesting and intriguing. There are also details of screwball comedy, especially scenes where Max encompasses for elderly ladies to get some money, and the funniest depiction of casting for Hitler's part in performance, where the comic sing a song about ""love power"". 
The plot is untypical because of the results of the opening night. The ""genial plan"" was destroyed and the ""sure-fire flop"" was failed. The play was a success with viewers. The producers were very upset and the author was very angry. The main value of the script is unpredictable climax and astonishing resolution. The producers never give up, they have got a new ""genial idea"". Their project is called ""The prisoner of love""!",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"Comedy Gold from the Great Mel Brooks,","The Producers is a brilliant movie with a very well developed plot and a fantastic comedic cast. It is a comedy classic that brings me joy and laughter on every viewing, I love the whole concept of the Producers and have enjoyed any version of it I have seen (remakes, theatre plays, etc.), but this version still stands out on its own.The only thing that ever really bothered me about this movie is the lack of development for both Max Bialystock and Leo Bloom, the characters are still effective to watch as a result of great writing and performances. However, we learn very little about the two as people prior to them beginning their journey, nothing really in terms of their lives outside of show business.The chemistry between Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel is outstanding and without any doubt the thing that holds this whole movie together. They are both well capable of handling the comedic moments, as well as the more dramatic ones. Gene Wilder even got an Academy Award nomination, and rightfully so, as every line he delivers is sincere. I never viewed him as a comedian, merely as an actor who did comedies, that is very evident here.A combination of charming performances, bizarre plot twists and a catchy musical number make this a memorable, unique experience on every viewing. A classic that still holds up pretty well today, as does everything else Mel Brooks wrote, I would recommend the Producers to anyone looking for a good comedy.When two producers discover that it is possible to make more money with a flop than you could with a hit, they set out to make the biggest disaster on Broadway.Best Performance: Gene Wilder",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Hilarious- If You Know Your History.,"Mel Brooks wrote and directed this uproarious farce as failed Broadway producer Max Bialystock(Zero Mostel) enlists meek accountant Leo Bloom(Gene Wilder) in his scheme to produce a surefire flop, that way, he can collect his investors' money and not have to pay it back. The play they find is a jaw-dropping, tasteless musical called ""Springtime For Hitler"" written by a fugitive Nazi soldier(played by Kenneth Mars). They even enlist the aid of a bizarre director, and cast a most unlikely lead as Hitler(Dick Shawn as LSD, a nutty hippie!) Trouble is, the team made this play a little TOO awful, and much to their amazement and horror, it's now funny! Though has some dated elements, and silly final sequence, this comedy is among the funniest ever made. Not only is the play unintentionally funny, it's the reaction of the audience that sells it, with their shocked faces.

The cast is amazingly brilliant, the story diminishes that of ANY other comedy, the script is a work of pure comedic genius and as for the movie on a whole: charming, hilarious, touching and ever so watch-able. It is not so much that every time I watch this film I discover something new-it's just that the many elements of its brilliance becomes so much more apparent. I have compared it to the classics; from Kindhearts and Coronets and Some Like It Hot through to The Blues Brothers and Dumb and Dumb-but it remains in a league of its own. Personal opinion maybe, but given a watch I'm sure that you too will discover its charms are quite simply irresistible. The Producers is an unequalled masterpiece.",,Anonymous,Music

A clever idea carried to hilarious heights,"In 1968, the world had seen the second world war end, and managed to push out of it's mind the horrors committed by the Nazis in it's duration.  How to deal with such horrors in a way that would commit entertainment ? Mel Brooks attacks the problem with the weapons the Jews have always armed themselves with in order to survive: humor, or in this case, heavy-handed yet clever satire.  During the tale of an over-extended ""producer"" of plays (Zero Mostel) and his adoption of his accountant and the accountant's innocently declared scheme to oversubscribe investors in a play to be found---and   guaranteed to fail---thereby with no questions to be asked by the investers, with Mostel and his accountant(Gene Wilder) escaping with the $$$$$ vast oversubscription.  They locate a Nazi loyalist living in Manhattan who has written a play honoring Hitler.  It seems a cinch...until the unexpected happens, all after Mostel has sold thousands of percentages of the play all to ""little old ladies"" who are enticed by Mostel's charm and promise.  The movie uses the play's author, Naziism, and Hitler himself(with great help from comedian Dick Shawn)as the butt of jokes/ridicule throughout the unfolding of the scheme. Even after these 32 years intervening since 1968, a multitude of the joke lines remain alive and well ...and in frequent use.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
I wanna be a Producer,"One of the most clever films ever made.  No need for political correctness, the film that is now the King of Broadway relies on solid linear storytelling, ingenious characters and fun dialogue.  Brooks' work here is not that of the broad satire found in ""Blazing Saddles"", ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""Spaceballs"" but rather inahbits an environment that is just realistic enough that one starts to wonder if Biyalstock and Bloom's scheme could indeed work, that their reality is that of our own.  Indeed, Brooks has admitted that Max Biyalstock was based on a real producer he knew at a young age.  And what a character to know.  Zero Mostel gives one of his most charming and yet at the same time sleazy performances.  You love this character, his manic obsessiveness coupled with Gene Wilder's Bloom's anatagonizing over everything makes for an incredibly enjoyable on-screen duo.  But it's not just the dialogue and great songs (if you want more go, if you can, to the outstandingly, mind-numbingly great musical), or wild characters but it's the little things that set this film high above shlock like the ""Brady Bunch"" movie.  For me this means the genuinely charming moments where Bloom decides he'll ""do it"" and water shoots from the fountain behind him as he will now be free of his accounting job.  When he realizes he's having fun in the park with Max also always brings a smile to my face. Lastly my big laugh out loud momet is right at the start of the film, as Max lunges for Lick Me, Bite Me only to make a grand fallthrough a table. Standard for a comedy I know, but Mostel's reaction is just so perfect that one can't help but laugh.  If you thought fallling through tables was the domain of Chris Farley your wrong.

It's too good,"Accountant Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder) sees a fraudulent way to make a lot of money while he's doing the books for theatrical producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel), and Max leaps at the idea: invite too many investors to finance a Broadway play (they sell 25,000%), then produce a total flop so nobody has to be paid back.Written and directed by Mel Brooks, the movie is original and brilliant, satirizing a lot of New York stereotypes, none more than Broadway producers and nebbishy accountants. The writing is echt Brooks. Consider: Mostel is lying on his sofa, buried in manuscripts, trying to find the worst possible play to produce, and he begins to read one aloud, ""Gregor Samsa awoke one morning to discover that he had been transformed into a giant cockroach,"" then pauses to think and says, ""It's too good."" From that moment on, I knew I was in the presence of comic genius. Two comic geniuses, in fact. Zero Mostel is completely captivating, voice and body, especially his face-- his expressions change like whole weather systems.Brooks' original screenplay won the Oscar that year, beating another worthy, much more civilized comedy about fraud, ""Hot Millions"" starring and co-written by Peter Ustinov. And Brooks deserved to win, even if he threw in a lot of shamelessly cheap, heedlessly offensive comedy-- the sexy Scandinavian secretary, Ulla (Lee Meredith); the flamboyantly gay director, Roger De Bris (Christopher Hewitt) and his friend Carmen Ghia (Andréas Voutsinas), the flower-child Lorenzo St DuBois, aka LSD (Dick Shawn) cast as Hitler.

"Brooks directorial debut sloppy, crass, hilarious.","Mel Brooks first time out of the box as a film director pays little attention to form and lays it all on the strident mugging of his leads Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder to belt out ( and sometimes swing and miss ) broad slices of Yiddish ham that result in an uneven but very funny comedy. Brooks more or less steps back and allows Mostel free reign and it works most of the time as the blustery iconic comedian by the mere force of personality holds court over an array of supporting characters taking their lead from Zero and making the most of small heavy handed bits that produce more belly laughs than groans.Down on his luck Broadway producer Max Bialystock seduces wealthy old ladies to get capital for his productions. When an insecure accountant (Wilder) comes to look at the books he gives max an idea on how to make a fortune; produce a failure. Max then sets out to get the worst possible play, directors and performers while stepping up his seductions.The Producers gives you the feeling Brooks is making things up along the way. Its oddly episodic with an array of patchwork meetings and rendezvous with one kooky character after another that either hits or misses and most of it hits before teetering on too much absurdity. Brooks frantic style goes well with Max's desperate plan but he does lay it on a little too long and too thick at times.Mostel is a life force unto himself and more for better than worse allowed to do as he pleases. Wilder's malleable lack of fortitude partners well with Zero and a handful of precious bits by Kenneth Mars, Dick Shawn, Christopher Hewett and 84 year old Estelle Winwood insure a steady steam of hilarious moments in keeping with a film that deals with putting on a musical called Springtime for Hitler.Brooks as a director would go on to get a better handle on film grammar in future films. Much of the Producers is shot in close-up though a Busby Berkeley moment and a casting call for Hitler types show him to be just as effective in his intent when he pulls his camera back. But the bottom line would always be about producing laughs and The Producers delivers droves of them.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Painfully, jaw-dropping-ly hysterical","Mel Brooks' genius has rarely shown as brightly as it did in this 1968 film that was roasted by the critics, and later won two Oscars and would be lauded for the masterpiece it is.Zero Mostel (in one of his finest comic performances ever) plays a crooked Broadway producer, and Gene Wilder his mousey, high-strung accountant. After going over the books of several plays, they realize the best way to make money is to oversell investment of a play that is destined to flop.The play chosen is a musical comedy entitled ""Springtime For Hitler"", written by a wanted Nazi on the run (played over the hilt by Kenneth Mars). The play is cast with the worst possable actors (Dick Shawn, playing a very bad Jim Morrison wanna-be, is cast as Hitler), the worst costumers are hired, and the rest of the play is staffed by the worst talent money can buy.On opening night, the play is so bad (the Busby Berkley-style musical number that opens the play, complete with dancers goose-stepping to form a swastika, is so kitchy as to boggle the mind...and the expressions on the faces of the audience are priceless) that everyone thinks it's a farce...and, horror of horrors, becomes a monumental hit!Now, how do you repay the investors after you've sold 25,000% of the play?There are lines in this film that are priceless, and the film never lowers to the level of slapstick or profanity.

One of the best.,"Mel Brooks first film, maybe his best. With incredible hysterical performances from Wilder, Mostel and Shawn, this movie is not only one of the funniest movies of all time, it's a comedy classic.The paths they choose to make this movie were very smart, it, although has a incredibly entertaining plot, concentrates in its jokes all the time, it may have as many jokes as satire movies ,like ""Scary Movie"", but unlike satire movies where they throw hundreds of jokes at us, and eventually some of them work, in ""The Producers"" almost every joke work, and leave you breathless.Jokes told by a person that's not funny (Like Rob Schneider), even when the jokes are good, don't work, but the acting of this movie is where it really shines, Wilder, as usual, is extraordinary, charismatic and hysterical, makes me wonder if he is the best comedy actor that ever lived. Mostel's performance is also great, but it's unfair to compare him to Wilder.The choice of making it only 84 minutes long, was very smart, it's flows naturally and at no time I thought it was boring, every time there was something important happening, making it intense and just fun to watch.Verdict: One of the funniest movie of all time. Intense, short and with and incredible performance by Gene Wilder.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Bold, bad taste","A masterpiece of bad taste and boldness considering the war only ended 23 years previously.

Brooks at his best,"A Mel Brooks film. That identification alone makes a film worth checking out.He made his biggest reputation as a parodist: ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""Blazing Saddles"" are classics that the current crop of pretenders should study.In one, he deftly parodied the scenes and situations of a specific series: the Universal Frankenstein movies. And in the other, he takes on the cliches of a particular genre.It occurs to me that ""The Producers"" comes to us as a parody of a form as well: all those backstage story movies. Richard O'brien said that this would be the setting of the third of his ""Rocky Horror"" movies.Mel Brooks got there first, Richard.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Classic Mel Brooks,","Truly brilliant comedy, probably one of the 10 funniest movies of all time.

A Joyful Riot,"A truly riotous comedy.  Zero is magnificent as the ultimate loser (""Where did I go right?"") and all the extravagant, even hysterical performances, whilst not to all tastes I'm sure, are perfectly balanced by Gene Wilder's caged bird persona.  The premise of two producers seeking the worst play in the world is brilliant, but even so does not prepare you for the farce of ""Springtime For Hitler"".  The song and dance routines are unforgettable, as are the flower-power actor called L.S.D., the director who likes wearing ballgowns, and the furious author in a German helmet.The ridicule and fun are relentless, but  Mel Brooks' greatest comedy is a triumph of human spirit too.

HITLER MEETS HIS MATCH,"Mel Brooks wanted to make a movie about how two producers schemed to make a killing on a sure-flop musical entitled, Springtime for Hitler. The problem was that no one wanted to finance a movie titled, Springtime for Hitler.After several years of begging, Sidney Glazier agreed to produce it and the money was put up by Joseph Levine, a producer with an international reputation. Like many movies that end up being classics, The Producers was made by people who ended up hating each other (well, except for Gene Wilder, of course). It was a very unhappy eight week shoot in NYC. Then came months of editing. Finally, it was released, sort of. It opened in a small theatre in suburban Philadelphia (Glazier's hometown) where I saw it. There were not a lot of people in the theatre and no one was laughing except for me and a friend who had seen it the night before and dragged me to it the next night.Then, it was released in New York. Most of the critics didn't get it - they criticized the movie for being about a musical based on the life of Hitler. One critic wondered if they were going to do a musical about cancer next. In spite of the mixed reviews, the movie made money in NYC but was, generally, a flop. The fact that the producers in the movie wanted to produce a sure fire disaster musical as part of their scheme to steal millions and that is why they produced a musical about Hitler was overlooked. A musical about Hitler? This was blasphemy!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"""I want everything I've ever seen in the movies""","It is incredible to think that The Producers was Mel Brooks' directorial debut. An incredible feat not just because the film remains a classic 50 years after its 1967 debut, but also because of its subject matter. Making a comedy about making a play about Adolf Hitler, one of the worst world leaders in world history seems like an odd vehicle to launch a career with. Nonetheless, Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel join together in a brilliant display of chemistry to tell the story of two producers who hatch a plan for mischief and riches, in a way only Mel Brooks can tell.Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel), an aging Broadway producer is now relegated to attaining money for his productions by seducing wealthy seasoned women. One day, when Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), an accountant with White Hall and Marks meets Max to go over his books, the discovery of a fund-raising error gives Max an idea. If he were to raise a great deal amount more money than a play will cost, then selects a play that is sure to be a flop, the two will be infinitely wealthy since they will have no profits to pay the backers of the play. Leo, a perpetually nervous individual, is skeptical to go along with Max's plan. After Max takes Leo under his wing, shows him a good time, and treats him like a person, Leo agrees to help with the plan because for the first time in his life, he has found happiness. Springing into action to execute their plot; Max and Leo must find the worst play possible, a play that is so awful it is sure to only run one performance. Springtime for Hitler; a musical preaching the overlooked good qualities of Adolf Hitler looks like the perfect play for their plan. After meeting with the playwright, Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars) a German-born American with pictures of Hitler littering his walls, the three agree to bring the play to audiences. After the effeminate well-known terrible musical director Roger De Bris (Christopher Hewett) is hired, the play is sure to be a disaster; the only way their plan could fail is if the play is a hit.Mel Brooks proves he was put on this earth to be a director with his debut film, The Producers. Arguably his best picture, his first film was an instant classic and clearly illustrated the type of parodies we could expect, and come to love from genius comedy director, Mell Brooks. Thankfully, years before The Producers came to be, Mel Brooks found Gene Wilder acting in a play with Mel's then girlfriend (and later wife) Anne Bancroft. Although it would be years before the pairing would come to fruition, Mel asked Gene if he would be interested in playing the part of Leo Bloom, and never forgot about him. Only his second film, The Producers was the first lead film role for Gene Wilder. From the bit part, he had in Bonnie and Clyde the same year, to sharing the lead in a film with Zero Mostel, Gene Wilder certainly proved to be quite the actor, and would go on to collaborate with Mel Brooks 2 more times, each classic in their own right.Wilder played the role of the neurotic nervous Bloom with great tenacity. It's hard not to sympathize with his character who just wants a friend and a purpose for his life. Always being a rule breaker had gained Leo nothing in his life except a mundane existence. Although the relationship with Max didn't come to the best of outcomes, it begs the question, does it matter what results in a friendship as long as it is real and fun?",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Ridiculous enough to be great,"I truly wish Mel brooks would throw together another movie that is as crazy and outlandish as the Producers. I love how goofy and absolutely indevidual each charactor is. It has a vintage feel from it's age, and I don't think that it could be as hillarious if filmed today. A lot of writers and directors are afraid to go over the edge, which stunts a films ability to be outrageous and just plain fun to watch.  Be a GOOF!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Mel Brooks' Oscar-winning masterpiece,"Some say the first 15 minutes of THE PRODUCERS is the best comedic scene ever captured on film.Film, stage and television legend Zero Mostel is teamed with a very young Gene Wilder (in only his second film role) in this story of a Broadway show that can't possibly fail. Zero plays Max Bialystock, a once great Broadway producer who now prostitutes himself to ""little old ladies"" to earn money for shows that he will never really produce. When an accountant named Leo Bloom shows up to do Max's books, the nervous Leo (Wilder) realizes that a Broadway producer could make more money with a flop than with a hit show. Max's ears perks up, and he soon cons Leo into co-producing the worst show ever to hit the Great White Way. The play, a musical, written by an German ex-patriot named Franz Liebkind (Kenneth Mars, the wooden-handed policeman in Brooks' ""Young Frankenstein"") is called ""Springtime For Hitler"". To make sure the show is a ""sure-fire flop"", they hire Broadway's worst director (actor Christopher Hewett as the flambouyant ""Roger DeBris"") and worst leading man (actor Dick Shawn as ""Lorenzo Saint DuBois).What could go right?If you are a fan of Brooks' ""History of the World Part One"", you will recognize director DeBris' personal secretary ""Carmen Giya"" played by Andréas Voutsinas. Look for actor Barney Martin (he played Jerry Seinfeld's dad ""Morty"" on the hit tv show ""Seinfeld"") as one of the stage Hitler's generals, and listen for Mel Brooks' voice dubbed into the show's big opening number. Believe it or not, but THE PRODUCERS has more quotable lines of dialogue than the rest of Brooks' films combined! (a slight exaggeration...perhaps)Check this film out alongside 4 other wonderful ""thespianic comedies"": The Tall Guy, My Favorite Year, The Impostors, and Waiting For Guffman.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Not Funny At All - Terrible!,"Please, don't bother seeing this. This was a total waste of time. During the first hour and 15 minutes I smiled once (and I laugh easily). This movie was not funny - it was stupid. If I tried to make a movie like this they'd hang me (because I'm not a famous person). Funny is like: Getting Even With Dad, Home Alone, City Slickers, Naked Gun, and (recently) Just Visiting. These movies, and others like them, will make you laugh. The Producers will make you wish you never wasted the time (watching it) or money (renting it). And for God's sake, DON'T BUY IT! The concept IS funny (potentially). But the way it was implemented, was not. There is no chemistry here - not between the actors, not with the audience - nothing; it's just stupid. The timing is off, and the actors are just running through the script (to get it over with it seems). The only way I can think of this movie getting a positive rating is by paying the reviewer - and paying them big bucks. That might even motivate me to see something good in this film - but I doubt it!",,Anonymous,Music
You Must Watch This Movie,"The characters in ""The Producers"" are all over-acted, taking to the extreme what you see on a wacky afternoon soap opera or sit com. Take this (if you can) and add a plot that is preposterous (but convincing), offered to you on a silver platter by some of the best comedic personalities on the planet and what do you get? You get a classic comedy that invokes laughter from even the most stoic and sardonic. Not all the jokes work, but there is humor for everyone, humor that sometimes makes you question your sanity for laughing at it.(e.g. No words can describe the reaction of the audience and the expression on their faces after having been subjected to the first act of ""Springtime for Hitler"")There is no subject, not even evil, that can escape satire....and Mel Brooks does a great job at attacking our sensibilities.This movie has its minor flaws, but it is near the top of the best ten comedies ever produced.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Best Comedy Ever!!!,"Although this film predates me my 3 years, I just can't get enough of 'The Producers' by Mel Brooks.  Zero Mostel (Max Bialystock) and Gene Wilder (Leo Bloom) are delightful in their roles as a washed-up theatrical producer and a mousy accountant, and the chemistry between Mostel and Wilder is just incredible.  Dick Shawn is hilarious as the Jim-Morrison-wannabe Lorenzo Saint Dubois (or as his friends call him, L.S.D.).  Several smaller roles provide an assortment of oddballs that makes the movie enjoyable -- the good-natured inebriate, the concierge, the assortment of Hitlers, Ulla, Carmen Giya, Roger DeBris, and the ""Hold Me Touch Me"" lady.However, the movie's big scene-stealer is Kenneth Mars as Franz Liebkind, the author of Bialystock and Bloom's planned theatrical flop, ""Springtime for Hitler.""  His performance is Oscar-quality, and he delivers some of the funniest lines of the film: ""Hitler -- there was a painter. He could paint an apartment in one afternoon, two coats!"" and ""You are the audience.  I am the author.  I outrank you.""I first saw this movie on VHS, and I can easily say that this movie contains some of the funniest scenes ever on film.  I had to buy my own copy, and I can watch it over and over again without getting tired of it. The plot is well-developed and funny, and ends on a hilarious note.I'm giving it 10 out of 10.

One of the best comedies of all time,"""The Producers"" is definitely one of the best comedy movies of all time. This was Brooks' first major comedy, and it is his best achievement. Although his other movies are all parodies (Robin Hood, Westerns, Frankenstein), this one is completely original - everything from the storyline to the great songs in it: ""Love Power"", ""We're Prisoners of Love"", and of course, the zany production number ""Springtime for Hitler"" which manages to offend practically everyone in the audience and yet becomes the biggest hit on Broadway.If you haven't seen this masterpiece, go rent it from the video store and watch it a couple of times.  Then go buy yourself a copy.  You're bound to love it!Just don't go around on the street singing ""Springtime for Hitler"" - you'll get very odd looks.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
This is Funny? Not hardly.,"I BOUGHT this thing on tape because the Broadway revival has obviously gotten it reissued.  I looked up and was astonished to see nearly fifty minutes of it had passed.  This thing is dull. I'm thinking this is an hour and a half long movie and it has been this boring?  I heard the song ""Springtime for HItler"" on Dr. Demento years ago and thought the rest of the movie would live up to the hilarious parodied song, but no, this is empty. It is watching like 'Laugh-In' and seems to want to satire that period in history, but isn't doing it well.  Wilder worked better as the enigmatic Willie Wonka and Mostel worked better with the Muppets.  Dick Shawn was funnier in 'Mad World'. But now the most peculiar moment has been in Kenneth Mars as the Nazi author.  He was the only one enjoying the play when 'Springtime' was on, but when Shawn starts with the tired hippie Hitler act and the audience laughs, Mars is offended.  It would have been funnier if he had enjoyed it as well, or better yet, misunderstood why everyone was enjoying it.Was there supposed to be humour in the audience laughing at Shawn's Hitler? Or was the humour in Shawn's performance?  It was in neither.I reset the counter when 'Springtime' began because I will never watch that first hour again.  And it doesn't seem likely that I will venture beyond the song much either.",,Anonymous,Music
Timeless Comedy,"In a day when Adam Sandler is called a genius, it makes you feel like a member of a special club to know about the classic comedians of the 60s. The Producers recalls a different time in hollywood comedy, when broad humor didn't mean that the audiences intelligence was insulted.  When comedies weren't required to follow a formula (idiotic man-child meets girl, gets fooled by snobs/crooks, loses girl, beats snobs, gets girl).  It recalls a time when comedy was the refuge of genuinely anarchic personalities.Only Mel Brooks could think of the story, two crooks devise a plot to steal a million dollars by producing a flop play.  The one that they come up with, Springtime For Hitler, shows up on the screen as a hilarious parody of the overproduced musicals of the 60s.  The wildly unpredictable screenplay is, at times, almost unbearably witty.  Some of the jokes are a bit dated; the hippy actor has intials that spell out LSD, the director's homosexuality is played for laughs (although the jokes are never as cruel as the gay jokes in, say, Revenge of the Nerds); but overall, the jokes still hit.  Most comedy screenplays from 10 or 20 years ago have aged much more poorly.But the films still wouldn't work nearly so well without its top notch cast. Gene Wilder proves himself to be among the finest comic actors of his generation as the manic depressive accountant.  Zero Mostel, on the other hand, is hilarious as the unscrupulous producer, at times seeming like he is about to explode from greed, lust, and excitement.  The supporting cast is also great, particularly Dick Shawn as LSD.  You might balk at first, seeing the definitely middle aged Shawn playing a jive talking hippy, but both his flower power debut and his hipster portrayal of Hitler are riotous and dead on.I'm sure that a lot of people, programmed to search for our standard movie formulas and stock jokes, are not going to get it.  I will say you should give it a chance, no matter your age (I'm only 25, so I'm not the target audience here), and maybe you'll find something great.",,Anonymous,Music
A GROOVY HITLER!,"This miraculously riotous farce is replete with comedic inspiration and EVERY character is mercilessly preposterous. Dick Shawn's hippy Hitler tickling the ivories and wailing the blues away is the very personification of the god of mirth, a howling absurdity that deserves a monument! And you should see Roger De Bris's wide eyes and gaping mouth at the audition! Shawn's tastelessness stuns even the greatest master of it. A sudden stage full of Hitlers maniacally saluting each other! If there's a message here, it's that Fuehrers are a dime a dozen. A politically incorrect author wearing a politically incorrect helmet, even when bandaged from head to toe! No one is spared. The two gay characters are as good as anything in the movie, with the obese one explicitly inviting cruel mockery on grounds that it will come his way anyway! There is even a backhanded compliment to the zaniness of producing anything. If you enjoy this one you may also enjoy ""The Gay Deceivers"" and ""La Cage Aux Folles II"".",,Anonymous,Music

Funniest Mel Brooks flick around!,"First a comment on the ""Producers"" DVD, which has the worst subtitling I have come across - and I am not talking about bad translations, so that the translator can't spell Führer is OK with me, but why can't he/she/it spell ordinary English? We'll never know, but this is the first time I have come across abysmal spelling!Now for the film, which was Mel Brooks first, and best, even if it at times shows that the budget was small. The acting is brilliant by everyone; from minor roles like the character Goebbles, played by David Patch, the character Hitler, played by Dick Shawn, to major; as those of Zero Mostel (THE producer), Gene Wilder (the accountant) and Kenneth Mars (Nazi immigrant who has written a play about Hitler, called Springtime for Hitler), which the director de Bris (played by Christoffer Hewitt) turns into a musical!!!But we have a smattering of minor roles, such as the dumb Swedish blonde Ulla, excellently played by Lee Meredith (if not Swedish one bit!), to old dear ladies wanting a bit of sexual excitement with Zero, et cetera, et cetera.Zero Mostel has the most expressive face I ever seen - a true gem! Gene Wilder never gets better, but that is very good indeed, while Kenneth Mars' acting is second to none, in this one of the funniest film ever!Notwithstanding some goofs (like before Mostel and Wilder are allowed to visit de Bris' flat they are forced to take off their shoes, and yet when they sit in his den they have their shoes on!), horrible subtitling and one or two other things that could have been better the Producers is worth nine out of ten!",,Anonymous,Music
"Great Movie, Except for Dick Shawn","This is a very funny movie, with several classic moments, and is definitely worth watching.  However, the casting of Dick Shawn was a tragic error.

Funny at times but seemingly dated here and there (but the greedy, no qualms business sense still prevails today in show biz retains!)  `Springtime For Hitler' may have been genius ahead of its time but would be the 12:50am skit on `Saturday Night Live'. Wilder's apoplectic tizzy over his blankie is a comic gem.  Look sharp for William Hickey as a drunk (who would go on 20 yrs later to his famous role as the grizzled, octogenarian mobster in `Prizzi's Honor').",,Anonymous,Music
Slight disappointment.,"I heard about how great this Broadway musical was, so I asked a friend to burn the sound track for me. I loved it! Besides a few tracks, every song on it is worth listening to again and again. Seeing the original movie quickly rose to the top of my To Do List, but after watching it I can't help but be disappointed. You know why? Because the movie is not a musical! How crazy is that? The only songs are Springtime For Hitler and Prisoners of Love, so apparently Mel Brooks wrote all of the other songs solely for the stage production. How dumb am I? Anyway, with that crushing blow administered, I realized how average the movie was. Sure, the lead actors are likeable, and making fun of Hitler is always a good time, but I never laughed. I wanted to laugh. I would have loved to fall off my bed in a fit of laughter. But did that happen? No! Nothing here made that key noise of amusement come out of my mouth, and that just destroyed the movie's chances with me. Now I just want to see the stage version even more. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll give this 2 out of 4 stars and pop the CD back in my stereo.",,Anonymous,Music
"The movie's good, the Broadway show is even better!","I saw the movie for the first time last spring(time) and found it to be ""cute"" but not quite as brilliant as I was expecting. Then I was lucky enough to see the Broadway show with Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick last month. What a masterpiece!The new show scales back on some of the characters (no LSD, for example) and expands others (Ulla is a much more central character), but for the most part it is pretty faithful to the movie, even down to a lot of the dialogue. So why did I like the movie and LOVE the show? I think the difference is, the story lends itself so perfectly to being a brassy, broad, over-the-top musical, that the film seemed somehow too ""little."" It should be larger than life, just like Max Bialystock. The show's score (all written by Mel Brooks) is lush and melodic, but just listen to the bawdy, hilarious lyrics! I'd highly recommend to all fans of the movie to get new cast recording of The Producers on CD.Mr. Brooks, if you're listening, please, PLEASE consider shooting a musical remake with Nathan and Matthew, especially for all the fans who won't get a chance to see it on Broadway. Who knows, maybe it would spark a new generation of movie musicals, something Hollywood is sorely lacking right now. In the show, Roger DeBris is seduced into directing ""Springtime for Hilter"" by the lure of a Tony (""Tony-Tony-Tony""). Maybe Mr. Brooks will answer to the call of Oscar-Oscar-Oscar...",,Anonymous,Music
Strangely entertaining,I started off not caring much for this one but it grew on me. Not so much that I consider it a masterpiece however I got enough laughs to say it is a decent comedy. The helmet wearing kraut and his insane facial expressions stole the show and reminded me a lot of the goofy soldier on Laugh-in.,,Anonymous,Music
Hilarious,"This contains undoubtably one of the funniest sequences ever captured on film. I laughed so hard during the ""Springtime for Hitler"" musical, I thought I was going to hurt myself.Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel are both excellent, with Wilder in particular throwing himself into the role of paranoid accountant Leo.Hitler is hardly an ideal subject matter for a comedy film, but Mel Brooks manages to make him one.The overhead shot during the song and dance routine secures this film it's place amongst the classics.",,Anonymous,Music
"So-so prelude to ""The Producers"" musical","I'm not a huge fan of Mel Brooks movies, I admit. They have good lines, but as coherent movies, they usually come up short. Such is the case of ""The Producers"". Although it may be a ""cult"" classic, it never became a REAL classic because it just doesn't work in this format.BUT as a Broadway musical (THE PRODUCERS, that is, not SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER) it is a real gem. Brooks' talent comes through full force, but he gave enough authority to other people involved to cut out his often silly, un-funny sophomoric humor, probably since this was his first play. Watching the movie now simply reminds one of all the great musical numbers in the broadway show. In the genre of great old musical comedies, it is set in the 1950s and works much better that way.The movie however, taking place in the ""present"", i.e. 1968, the classic musical was already going out of fashion, and it is no surprise that Max was no longer successful. The contemporary sixties clothing, sets, and ""L.S.D."" are out of place as they do not conjure up images of classic broadway musicals and the atmosphere that went along with them.If you like the movie, you'll love the musical. This movie was BEGGING to be made into one, and I'm glad it finally happened. I just hope Mel is able to bring it to the big screen one day, although it probably won't be until the touring company finishes, and that may not be for years and years. In the meantime, get your tickets (a year in advance) and make your plans to go to NYC or London, or wherever it's playing when you read this (even your community theatre someday?).Don't miss the late great Chris ""Mr. Belvedere"" Hewitt as Roger DeBris.",,Anonymous,Music
"Laughed my self silly, 35 years ago.","As a movie projectionist in 1968 I watched this movie a hundred times. It got funnier every time I saw it. Gene Wilder losing it over his blue blanket was killer. This was Zero Mostel's best work. With all the recent hoopla over the Broadway play, I am not surprised. Why did it take so long to discover this gem.  Enjoy!",,Anonymous,Music
