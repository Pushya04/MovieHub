acidic dark comedy/costume drama,"In the court of British Queen Anne (Olivia Colman), Lady Churchill (Rachel Weisz) and her lowly cousin Abigail (Emma Stone) conduct a battle of wits to become the ailing Queen's favorite, ensuring wealth, prestige and power.I enjoyed the other movies directed by Lanthimos that I've seen (Dogtooth, The Lobster, The Killing of a Sacred Deer), but he strikes new ground here, turning in his most accessible movie to date and perhaps his most polished. There are shades of Kubrick in the editing and cinematography, both of which are excellent. The use of natural light and distorted lenses is visually interesting. The costumes are also top notch, as one would expect from a period piece.The performances are the main event, with all three women turning in at or near career bests. Colman won the Best Actress Oscar, but her's is the most in line with a supporting turn, as the film is told from the points-of-view of Weisz and Stone. Their increasingly nasty one upmanship is hilarious. Lanthimos throws in some anachronistic touches (the dance scene is very amusing), the dialogue is sharp as a dagger, and the film isn't afraid to go grotesque. Recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
delicioius,"English Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is fighting a war in France. Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) is her favorite courtesan and is the power behind the throne. Her cousin Abigail (Emma Stone) arrives looking for a job after her family had fallen in status. Sarah looks down upon her and sends her to be a maid. She is being whipped when Sarah suddenly needs her to alleviates the Queen's gout pains. Leader of the opposition, Mr. Harley (Nicholas Hoult), is pushing for an immediate peace treaty while Sarah uses her power over the Queen to raise taxes to continue the war led by her husband at the front.This is a wonderful competition of female relationships. It is deliciously passive-aggressive. All three performances are amazing. The visual style is impeccable. It is a movie of singular vision and great actors.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wow!!,"In early 18th century, the friendship between Anne, first Queen of Great Britain and Lady Sarah Churchill, the wife of the Duke of Marlborough, was very close and then deteriorated because of their differing political views and the growing influence of another favorite, Abigail Masham. The film focuses on the rivalry between these 2 women, Abigail and Sarah: lousy tricks, alliances, treacheries, ground shiftings, sex, ... Everything is allowed to obtain the favors of the queen!The actors, the photography, the costumes, the 18th century atmosphere despite voluntary anachronisms, the rhythm, the dialogues, the soundtrack, ... This is an excellent achievement. Smart, dark, irreverent, cruel and immoral.",,Anonymous,Biography
Fans of Yorgos Lanthimos will love it. I'm not sure about everyone else,"The Favourite, the seventh feature from Greek auteurYorgos Lanthimos, is a film that eschews both convention and expectation. On the other hand, it's also Lanthimos's most accessible by a country mile. A savage morality play, a camp comedy of manners, a Baroque tragedy, an allegorical study of the corruptive nature of power - it's all of these and yet none of them. A film I liked but didn't love, on the one hand, it's too long, the plot too threadbare, and the metaphors and allegories too ill defined. On the other, the acting is flawless, it looks amazing, the first half is very, very funny, and the end is very, very dark, with the last shot one of the most haunting/disturbing images I've seen in a long time.Set in England in 1708, the film tells the story of Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough (an icyRachel Weisz) and one-time scullery maid Abigail Hill (Emma Stone, charting a course from doe-eyed ingénue to vicious Machiavellian intrigant) and their increasingly bitter rivalry for the affections of Queen Anne (an absolutely mesmerisingOlivia Colman), and is the first film Lanthimos has directed which neither he norEfthimis Filippouwrote (the script was originally written byDeborah Davisin 1998 and later refined byTony McNamara). Although it deals with real historical personages and events, historians probably won't be too thrilled to learn that Lanthimos is relatively uninterested in either historical actuality or socio-political contextualisation (to say nothing of the slam dancing). This is a story about a love triangle, with everything else just the background noise against which that triangle plays out.And it is most definitely a Yorgos Lanthimos film, with his peculiar Weltanschauung omnipresent. The emotionless and monotone delivery of dialogue has been scaled back considerably fromThe Lobster (2015)andThe Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017), but everything else you'd expect is here - the pseudo-omniscient judgemental glare; the dark absurdist humour; the formal rigidity; the emotional isolation of the characters; the surrealism; the games of psychological one-upmanship; the alienation of the audience; the thematic centrality of shifting power relations; the lack of distinction between poignancy and joviality; the use of self-contained and closed off pocket universes where characters must play by rules differing from those of the outside world; intimate familial conflict (except in bigger rooms than in his previous films); and a disorienting score. Similarly, whilst The Lobster was a savage dystopian-set allegory for discipline and conformity, The Favourite is a merciless satire of decadence and pettiness, taking in such additional themes as class, gender, love, lust, duty, loyalty, partisan politics, patriarchal hegemony, and women behaving just as appallingly as men.As one would expect from Lanthimos, the film is aesthetically flawless, with many of the compositions having the appearance of a fête galante painting, so meticulously integrated areSandy Powell's costume design,Fiona Crombie's production design, andRobbie Ryan's cinematography. Powell's costumes are historically inaccurate, but thematically revealing, with the situation of the characters at any given moment directly influencing the design, especially in relation to Abigail as she climbs the social ladder. In a more general sense, the black-and-white colour scheme of much of the wardrobe contrasts magnificently with Crombie's predominantly brown production design, with the actors effortlessly standing out from the backgrounds.Of Ryan's photography, perhaps the most impressive feat is that, despite the many scenes tracking characters through rooms, up stairs, and out doorways, there's not a single Steadicam shot anywhere in the film. He also makes copious use of 6mm fish-eye lenses, which distort the spaces the characters occupy whilst also showing much more of the environment than a normal lens, creating the sense of characters lost within an overload of background visual detail. Combined with the whip pans seen throughout the film, the cumulative effect is a world rendered strange, a place of distortion and unnatural compositions. As with most of Lanthimos' work, the film also uses natural light, which makes for some stunning candle-lit night-time compositions, partially recalling the paintings of someone like Jean-Antoine Watteau or, even moreso, Georges de La Tour.In terms of acting, there really are no words to describe just how good Colman is. Utterly inhabiting the character, she is able to elicit empathy mere moments after behaving thoroughly shamefully, communicating a sense of both tragic inevitability and a childlike refusal to accept reality. The character could easily have been a grotesque villain or a pitiful broken shell, but Colman finds a nobler middle ground, straddling both interpretations without fully committing to either, moving from one to the other seamlessly throughout the film. Yes, she can be a horrible person with appalling manners and questionable hygiene, but she is also deeply lonely, a survivor who has lost 17 children in childbirth, a woman whose health has made her old before her time, a tragic figure too naïve to see how badly she is being manipulated by Sarah and Abigail. Rather than trying to downplay the contradictory facets of the character, Colman leans into them, illuminating Anne's humanity amongst her least appealing characteristics, and finding both wit and pathos in a character whose mercurial nature and excessive neediness could easily have rendered her the film's antagonist. It truly is one of the finest on-screen performances in a long time.The film's most salient theme, one could argue its very raison d'être, is the dynamic of gender politics. For starters, it's headlined by three actresses (something which is still rare enough as to be notable), whilst the men are portrayed as petty, vainglorious idiots. Men, in general, are background players, existing only to be mocked, exploited, and duped - with their ridiculous wigs and heavy makeup, they exist only to support the women. However, what's especially interesting about the film's depiction of gender is that the world of women is anything but a utopia. Yes, it's relatively free of toxic masculinity and the male gaze, but in most other aspects, there's no real difference between the matriarchy and the patriarchy. Sure, the women are much smarter than the men who surround them, but they are no less greedy or cruel. At the film's post-première press conference at the Venice Film Festival, Lanthimos explained, ""what we tried to do is portray women as human beings. Because of the prevalent male gaze in cinema, women are portrayed as housewives, girlfriends...Our small contribution is we're just trying to show them as complex and wonderful and horrific as they are, like other human beings."" Similarly, when asked by the Hollywood Reporter if a film about females treating each other badly might be considered a setback in a post #MeToo era, Colman explained, ""How can it set women back to prove that women fart and vomit and hate and love and do all the things men do? All human beings are the same. We're all multifaceted, many-layered, disgusting and gorgeous and powerful and weak and filthy and brilliant. That's what's nice. It doesn't make women an old-fashioned thing of delicacy.""As regards criticisms, although I personally wouldn't class them as flaws, some people will probably dislike the same things that many have disliked in Lanthimos's previous work - cold formal rigidity, perverse sense of humour, and irredeemable characters being irredeemably horrible to one another. There will be those who find the obviously intentional anachronisms too much, whilst others will take umbrage with the disregard for historical authenticity. For me, whilst I admire Lanthimos for trying to bring something new to his oeuvre, especially when compared to Sacred Deer (which just repeated the beats of The Lobster), I felt the film was oftentimes trying to work its way through an identity crisis, unsure of exactly what kind of tone to settle on. I had similar feelings about the allegories that run throughout, and are never what you would call fully fleshed out. Obviously, it's a treatise on power and the ridiculous opulence of royalty, but that's not exactly an untapped issue in cinema. Additionally, one of my biggest problems with Sacred Deer was how utterly pointless it felt, and although I got a lot more out of The Favourite, I had something of the same reaction to it. It could also be argued that the characters are a little two dimensional, and filmgoers who need a protagonist to latch onto, someone to root for, will be left rudderless.Superior toAlps (2011)and Sacred Deer, but not a patch onDogtooth (2009)or The Lobster, The Favourite will probably attract a sizable unprepared audience because of awards buzz, positive reviews, and excellent trailer. Undoubtedly, for a lot of people, this will be their first exposure to Lanthimos, and I can only imagine what people expecting a Merchant Ivory costume drama will make of it all. Neither morally enlightening nor historically respectful, The Favourite offers a bleak assessment of humanity's core drives; not Lanthimos's bleakest, but a hell of a lot more nihilistic than an average multiplex goer will be used to. The characters within the film live in a milieu of egotism, narcissism, sexual cruelty, psychological bullying, greed, and hunger for power. There's barely a hint of sentimentality, and very little that could be called morally righteous. I would have liked it to have more meat on its bones, but at the same time, one cannot deny that it presents something of a faithful looking-glass, as Lanthimos continues to corner the market in pointing out not just humanity's worst foibles, but its most egregious eccentricities and lamentable character defects.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unsettling favouritism,"'The Favourite' from the day it came out quickly became one of my most anticipated films. Mainly for the critical acclaim, the vast awards attention and the talented cast (namely Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz). Anybody who has seen and liked Yorgos Lanthimos' previous films, including 'The Lobster', would also find another reason to be psyched about seeing it. Interesting furthermore for seeing a monarch and reign/era not explored an awful lot on film and actually even in general.Seeing it finally last weekend with my sister, 'The Favourite' didn't disappoint me at all. Completely agree with the acclaim (and just to say there have been times where that has not always been the case) and the award nominations, with it receiving the most nominations of the year along with 'Roma' (another favourite of the year), and hopefully wins for at least a few of the categories are richly deserved. Just to say that my sister also loved it and she knew very little about its critical reception and accolades until when we were talking about the film afterwards, so this is not a case of being ""followers"" and this is a genuine review from somebody who actually did love it and has been known quite a number of times before for going against the grain when it comes to critical consensus. With that being said, can understand why 'The Favourite' won't click, and hasn't clicked, for some. But what some have deemed bizarre, cruel and pointless for me was one of the most entertaining, most visually striking, best acted and surprising films of the year.Won't say that 'The Favourite' is exempt from criticism. Do have to agree with everybody who found the ending disappointing. Far too abrupt and it didn't make sense, leaving a very odd feeling and aftertaste.However, the production values are exemplary. It is a beautifully shot and cleverly edited film, with a few effectively nightmarish moments that didn't distract at all (this is including at the end). All of this complements the evocative attention to period detail and the sumptuous locations interiors and exteriors. Especially good in this regard are the costumes, gorgeously designed and opulent and the muted colour pallette for some of them looks tasteful. Lanthimos keeps things going at a breezy pace while allowing it all to breathe, the surreal and strange elements that has not appealed to all in his previous films certainly present but more toned down here in comparison, which makes 'The Favourite' one of his more accessible films in my view.Do not agree with those panning the soundtrack. Sure, the Ferrari and Messiaen weren't to my tastes and some of the placement is repetitive in places, but the pieces featured are great pieces on their own. The most authentic uses being Bach, Vivaldi and Purcell (including one of his most beautiful songs ""Music for a while""), but most effective was the Schumann Piano Quintet (the opening chords and rhythms are truly haunting) and the poignantly sombre Schubert Piano Sonata, which happened to be one of his last works before his ultimely death. Apart from the repetition, the placement mostly didn't bother me with none of it really juxtaposing with the mood of the scenes (mixing a little camp and just as much seriousness) in question, there is a teasing and disorienting quality that is oddly captivating and clever.One of 'The Favourite's' biggest triumphs is the script, one of the most entertaining and most beautifully balanced and structured of the year. Many parts are irreverently witty, boasting a number of laugh out loud moments throughout and showing a farce with teeth and bite without being over-the-top or tired. It is also quite darkly disarming and pulls no punches, showing that a period that seems so beautiful and glamorous is not as much as appeared underneath. There is shock value here but it didn't feel that gratuitous and was one of the reasons as to why 'The Favourite' stands out as more than one's ""typical"" idea of a period film. The political elements are sharp and insightful. And then there is a sensuality that both disturbs and charms, the chemistry between the three leads being witty, chilling and tense. On a story level, only the ending misfired for me, everything else is thoroughly absorbing and the different tones and shifts are balanced expertly with no real jarring, the twists in the story being manic without being too much that one can't take it seriously and the deceptions really digging deep.A great job is done getting quality performances from the cast, all thoroughly committing to their roles and avoiding falling too much in overplayed caricature. Anne especially in her human fraility is given a good deal of depth that one does root for her, and the film did well providing some poignant emotion when needed without being overt amongst all the strangeness and irreverence. The supporting cast are on point, with Nicholas Hoult being particularly enjoyable in a very gleeful way. It's the three female leads that carry 'The Favourite' and all three give performances that are among the best of the year. Emma Stone is alluring and one roots for her at first, while making Abigail's shrewish character change unsettlingly believable. A perhaps never better Rachel Weisz brings caustic wit and authority to Sarah. Even better is Olivia Colman, a truly magnificent performance that gives the character many shades and vulnerability.Summing up, a great film and one of my favourite films of the year. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Palace intrigue,"If The Favourite had music by Michael Nyman. I would had said that it was directed by Peter Greenaway. I do think Greenaway was a big influence with the style of the film, as well as the Oscar winning Tom Jones that lent it some naughtiness.Director Yorgos Lanthimos adds a rich period setting and visual flourishes. He keeps his camera moving and has lot of fisheye views.Underneath it all is a power play between three women in 18th Century England. Two of them vie to be Queen Anne's favourite even if this means massaging more than her legs.Abigail (Emma Stone) has fallen on hard times. She arrives at Court hoping for employment from her cousin, Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz.) She is the Queen's trusted adviser, lady in waiting, confidante and even lover.Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is ill. She has gout, she is mentally unstable. She lost 17 children and she has 17 rabbits that she plays with. Governing the country is something she finds difficult especially as Britain is at war with France.Abigail wants to ingratiate herself with Queen Anne and climb the greasy pole to secure her position. Over time Abigail and Lady Sarah fight, dirtily to be the Queen's favourite.The Favourite is a crude, grimy, seedy, bawdy drama in tone and language. Lanthimos is certainly not interested in showing a wholesome chocolate box portrait of 18th century life.This is a sumptuous looking costume drama about fragile cruel people and egos. People who are desperate to get to the top and remain there.The film unravels in the second half and gets bogged down. At the end Abigail may not be quiet in control as she thinks, I did think the ending was weak and disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Yorgos Lanthimos Takes On Old-Fashioned England,"The Favourite was not what I expected. This isn't classic Yorgos Lanthimos, this is a whole new, more whimsical Yorgos Lanthimos, approached parallel to his usual sinister, vexing, and twisted spirit. In full hindsight, this more comedic and less calamitous manner ended with me completely and whole-heartedly digging it. And when I say, The Favourite is more cheer and juvenile than his previous work, I'm not inferring that Lanthimos loses his infamous psychologically poignant gift in this, I'm just inferring that it's done in a much more subtle way, hidden by cynical buffoonery.At the time being, I would claim that this isn't my favorite-sorry-favourite of Lanthimos's filmography-The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer still hold that spot dearly to my heart-but I would doubtlessly claim that The Favourite is by a long-shot, Lanthimos's most gratifying and crowd-pleasing film. I did not expect to had had such a blast with this movie. Not only is it funny as hell, but the comradery and rivalry between Emma Stone's character and Rachel Weisz's character-both who by the way, give the most dexterous performances of this entire year-was just too much fun to take in. And Olivia Colman's performance as the queen...comical perfection.The atmospherical tone of this movie also is one of the many aspects that won me over. It reputed like an old-fashioned, 1-on-1, battle of the minds movie, just with touches of Lanthimos's typical synthetic stylizations. It's the cherry on the top of this shrewd satire.The Favourite might not be as poetically relevant to today's society like The Lobster, or as tramuatizingly stirring like The Killing of a Sacred Deer, but it's a playful piece of mental spectacle that is oddly bone-crushing, yet, pleasing, all at once. Loved nearly every second of it. Bravo, once again Sir Lanthimos. (Verdict: A)",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Overhyped, Pretentious Historical Fiction","Here's something that I've learned about myself, and it has a direct bearing on my enjoyment of a movie, and therefore my review; I do not like the current trend of ""reimagining"" actual, historical people with modern sensibilities. I highly doubt Queen Anne and the people in her court went around liberally dropping f bombs. Then there's the ballroom dance scene that my husband called 18th century ""Dancing with the Stars"". Actually that made me laugh, so maybe that's what was meant when it was described as a comedy. Call me uptight, call me old fashioned, I don't care. It bothers me.Basically, Lady Sarah Marlborough, who is an actual ancestor of Sir Winston Churchill and Lady Dianna, was a childhood friend of Queen Anne and a trusted confidant and her personal assistant. She was intelligent, outspoken and did influence the Queen. This is all true. It is also true that her cousin Abigail was a Lady who fell on hard times and was taken in as a servant, and slowly replaced Lady Sarah as the Queens ""favorite"". I did a little light research on all of this and it is believed that Lady Sarah was pushed out because she was outspoken, domineering and blunt, as opposed to Abigail's softer approach. Serious historians ""highly doubt"" that any of the women were lesbians or sexually involved. I read that historical movies tell you more about the people that made it than the people and events they portray. Currently the mood in Hollywood is that men are weak and secondary, even when it comes to sex, and it's all about girrl power. That is the perspective this movie takes in telling the story, even though that's not what the reality was for these real people.I gave the stars that I did based on the strength of the actresses and the elaborate costumes and settings.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Enjoyably off-kilter, but yet rooted in strong characters and narrative","The awards and critical reception for this film made it a rather mainstream success, despite it coming from the maker of such odd films as The Lobster. The period setting, the class of performers, and the awards though make it seem accessible and 'normal' only for it to quickly set out its stall as not being that. Essentially it is the fictional story of Queen Anne and her dear 'friend' Lady Sarah, between whom a new maid comes, setting off a frosty power struggle for the ear of the ailing Queen. On its face it seems like a straightforward period drama, but the delivery makes it more than this.Much has been written by cleverer people on the selection of lens for shooting, the use of natural light, the fruity nature of the script for the period, all of it true and all of it making the film feel off-kilter from what would be expected. It does this in a way that feels odd but yet is still easy to go with and accessible - as opposed to being deliberately hard to penetrate. Certainly the look of the film keeps throwing me, and I wasn't a fan of the wide lens when it was used, but it did have the effect of making the scenes draw me in by virtue of how odd it was to find that look in a period film. In terms of narrative, it is lively with its fruity language and incident, as well as the twists and turns of the plot itself. This is all well delivered by the lead three actresses, who embrace the teeth of it as much as they do the absurdity of some of it.All told it is a surprising film in the way that it feels odd and off-kilter in many ways, but yet produces a sharp drama with wit and teeth throughout.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Eccentric, witty, and delightful","Enthralling from the very beginning and bursting with enthusiasm, this endlessly funny period piece, mixed with a ravishing love triangle, is Lanthimos at his most accessible, all while maintaining the mordacious social commentary and absurdist tone that made him such a phenomenon. Needless to say, ""The Favourite"" is marvelously shot, capturing with elegance the grandeur of its setting through gorgeous steadicam and extravagant wide angles, but what really sets it apart are the characters that are shown against it. Arguably the most fascinating showcase of acting from each of its three leads, the dynamics of the trio are effervescent, chock-full of disdainful side-glances, sharp smiles and lascivious touches, making every man look like a disposable accessory. Weisz is ever caustic as Sarah Churchill, the queen's confidant and lover, who actually rules the kingdom through her, and Stone is ravishing as Abigail, Sarah's cousin, who plays a naïve, gleeful servant, but secretly will spare no efforts in order to become the queen's new favourite. However, it is Colman who steals the spotlight, through her mesmerizing performance of Queen Anne. Infantile and broken, impulsive and lustful, needy and erratic all at once, she takes credit for almost every one of the most iconic moments of the film, which are several, through her delicious tantrums and hilarious excesses, but most notably, through a few long, mathematically precise close-ups, during which her expression changes so subtly, yet so richly, that she conveys an extensive array of emotions, disarming the viewer with desperate loneliness and melancholy.
All of that innovating and beguiling experience could never have been made possible without an incredibly solid script, whose segmented structure and whimsically titled chapters make the audience anticipate, with an expectant smile, what kind of wicked schemes and betrayals will come next. While it is riveting and lively until two thirds well into the plot, some of the viewers might be left disappointed at how it becomes hopeless and dark. The sudden change of pace, however, is deliberate and calculated, leading to a visually unforgetable ending scene, as each of the characters finally realize the inescapable consequences of their extravagant behaviours.
Ultimately, ""The Favourite"" is an admirable confluence of talent, whose likes mainstream cinema only glimpses rarely, and that will leave audiences marveled and eager for more.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

The soundtrack was as irritating as it was superfluous and the foul language as gratuitous as it was unnecessary. I thought that maybe my response was because I didn't get it, being English and familiar with this type of film, but I saw the film in the US and the mood of the audience throughout and especially upon the ridiculous ending was almost unanimously negative - and volubly so.

The Absurdity of This Film Was Too Much for Me,"Let me preface my review with me saying that I have never had a film experience where I have been genuinely uncomfortable in. I have watched The Human Centipede Series, Saw, and plenty of other gory cinema that has hardly made me cringe. But for some odd reason, The Favourite made me cringe and feel sick half of the time.Now STOP. Before you flag my review or declare me unhelpful. Let me say this: I think the film had a unique score, excellent acting all around, an intriguing story, and played off the tropes of stereotypical British historical dramas, but the film was not for me.Because honestly, the absurdity of this film was way too much for me, and I hardly ever say that. I will acknowledge the film was great technically and narratively, but I couldn't stand it.The Favourite is supposed to be a historical drama with tons of comedy and a light bit of thriller thrown into it, but when it came to the comedy, I couldn't get with it. While the Laemmle Playhouse audience laughed at every single line of dialogue that would come out of someone's mouth, I could not take it. I think throughout the whole film, I laughed maybe 15%, and about 80% of that laughter was cringe laughter. A lot of the film was pure bonkers, and I couldn't really get into it.The concept of playing against the trope that British historical figures are normally conservative and well spoken, and having them instead be balls-to-the-wall mentally insane and outlandish in this film, is an interesting idea, but it did not work for me. There is literally a scene where a character gives a monologue to the camera about their evil plan, while stroking her newlywed's member. And I was thinking, what in the actual hell?? It was funny, but it was more weird than anything.The film as a whole is just weird. I don't think it really cares as much about the narrative or the characters, but with how weird the setting can be. Whether it is really out of place dancing in the ball room (the only scene I burst out laughing at), the queen declaring how much they want to get oral pleasure, girls bathing in mud, really loud and obnoxious screaming, an annoying fish-eye lens, continuous rubbing of old women's feet, and even more screaming, I just couldn't find a point to any of it.It is almost like the director is like ""hey bro, look at how outlandish I made these uptight British royalty look. HAHA! Funny, funny!"" I did not even really care.I will give the film a rewatch when it comes out on digital, and have subtitles included, because sometimes that improves my film experience. But from what I can tell, The Favourite is definitely not really my cup of tea.I will say this though: I will probably enjoy The Lobster and Dogtooth more than I will with this. Perhaps because they are not in a British royalty setting, which I have a hard time getting to in the first place.Anyways, try not to hate me please. Remember, I acknowledge the achievements of the film, but it does not work for me. Think of that before you lynch me.",,Anonymous,Biography

A charmingly quirky film,"Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone are both brilliantly witty and Colman's performance is nothing less but sublime. The three leads are able to hold a fascinating performance that is difficult to achieve. Yorgos Lanthimos retains a pessimistic view of human nature but all goes down with a touch of British glam, as he pushes the idea of the capricious queen through the far reaches of comedy and almost into tragedy. With its brilliant and dramatic script, the sharp dialogues, the great performances, the wonderful production design contributions and a beautiful cinematography, may be for more open-minded audiences, but it's such a charmingly quirky film and is my front-runner for the Best Picture Oscar. nikisreviews.gr",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unusual period drama,"The Favourite had incredible performances from Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz. It's beautifully filmed with great dialogue that's smart and funny. But it's brought down by the repetitive and annoying musical score and an ending that somehow feels abrupt and overly long at the same time.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Will be a Favourite of the year.,"There are three compelling reasons to see this - Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, and Emma Stone. They go full force into this 18th-century world. Its a wickedly ridiculous and dirty dark comedy that only Yorgos Lanthimos could make with a brilliant whip-smart script by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara. Weisz vs Stone is a master class in acting, and Colman holds the Crown. Showcasing just how devoted one is for love (or power) but if it is truly worth the cost. If you didn't like The Lobster or The Killing of a Sacred Deer, you may not like this movie. While it is Yorgos' most commercial movie yet, it is still very much his style. The more that I think about this movie, the more that I love it and it will be everywhere this award season.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
I was left shaking after watching this film,"Honestly all I can say is that this film was not what I was expecting and far exceeded my expectations. The chemistry between the actors and also the visual story is absolutely stunning and I'm just wowed by how well done everything is done in this film. I can't say I have anything bad to say about this film. And please go into this movie without spoilers, I find that it is way more enjoyable to be surprised by the actual story and leaves more excitement for the viewer.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Headlined by a magnificent performance by Olivia Colman,"This peak behind the curtains of the court of Queen Anne of Great Britain in the early 18th century is a fun little piece of feminist revisionism detailing a supposed love triangle between the Queen (Olivia Colman), her advisor and confidant Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz), and a very ambitious newly hired maid named Abigail Hill (Emma Stone). This is one Yorgos Lanthimos' most narratively straightforward films, and his more restrained approach suits the material and lets the strong trio of lead characters shine. That being said, the use of fisheye lenses and continual focus on the characters' self-degradation ensure that you certainly feel the Greek director's pulling of the strings. The Favourite is at its most enjoyable and playful when detailing the farcical aspects of the court, from these people's daily habits and antics to their at times seemingly arbitrary handling of political matters. And it is headlined by a magnificent performance by Olivia Colman, who positively wallows in the Queen's array of qualities and flaws with full dedication, making sure she is presented with equal measures comedy and tragedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
what a horrible movie,"What a waste of time, i was eager to watch this movie especially Emma Stone is the main character, but after watching it and passed it till the end trying to wait for a story line that is yet to show up, but none of that has shown, the story is meaningless, the background music that drills into your ears to your brain is traumatic, the way the movie is filmed sometimes is painful. Skip this title, find something else, better, in fact anything can be better. Emma Stone, why you did that????",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Intriguing,"As you go through the plot it keeps getting more and more interesting, great performance from Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz and Olivia Colman it keeps you captivated with all the symbolisms and off course an ending with a hidden meaning as always in Lanthimos films who is one of my favorite directors and filmmakers I consider him to be extremely talented .The story unfolds leaving you with mixed feelings as all main characters seem to suffer in this battle for power and acceptance and finally no one seems to be really satisfied with how things end up.Recommend watching it's certainly a good one and deserves a chance.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Don't listen to all the bad reviews,"This is easily the best movie of the year in every measurable facet, most prominently the incredible writing, directing, ambition, cinematography, and most importantly the acting by the three lead actresses. Anyone who reviews this movie poorly simply and unfortunately does not understand/recognize the level of mastery exhibited in this film. It is clear that a lot of care and thought went into every single detail, and the director worked very hard to create many intricate layers of meaning and an endlessly watchable and absolutely hilarious dynamic between the main characters. If this does not win best picture and a slew of its other nominations it will be very disappointing, as I would compare the overall quality of this movie to the likes of Birdman, or The Kings Speech in terms of the best movies from the last decade. This is Lanthimos' best work yet, which is saying a LOT considering his works leading up to this, most notably The Lobster. But overall just make sure you see this movie if you have ANY capacity to appreciate real authentic art and moviemaking at its absolute finest and most innovative and passionate.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Well-Shot, Unconventional but Flawed Period Piece","I'm somewhat of a fan of Greek auteur Yorgos Lanthimos, and was excited to see this new dark comedy from him set in period Britain. The film centers around the relationship between Queen Anne and Sarah Churchill, and how such relationship is affected when the cousin of the latter arrives seeking employment. The film offers an eclectic mix of dark comedy and great cinematography, but doesn't completely hold together, which was slightly disappointing.Lanthimos' unique cinematography is outstanding throughout, as are many of his commendable aesthetic choices that help enrich the film's unique quality and tone. The acting is generally strong throughout, with the distinct nature of each performance among the three lead actresses enhancing the viewing experience. Unfortunately, however, the film's script has a number of concerns. The film's writing attempts to be witty and funny much of the time, but such lines of wit and humor do not always land. Some of the more raunchy moments are well-placed, but others just feel puerile or ridiculous. For a prestige film from an acclaimed auteur revered by many serious film buffs, the film can end up feeling quite lowbrow at times, which can alienate the viewer from some of the more serious commentary of the time period Lanthimos is depicting, particularly with regards to the issue of gender roles and the patriarchal nature of the society and culture. The total shifts can be quite jarring, even more so when one stops to consider that not all scenes played for comedic effect are particularly funny or even amusing at face or literal value. A majority of the film is paced properly and well, yet the third act can come off as anti-climactic. Ultimately, while I didn't dislike ""The Favourite,"" I did expect a bit more from what some pundits have determined will likely be a top-tier Oscar contender this fall. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A bawdy masterpiece,"I'll just put it out there. ""The Favourite"" is a masterpiece of movie making on just so many different levels.The story grips you from the off. The gout-suffering Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is being maniupulated from her bedchamber (both physically and mentally) by Lady Sarah Marlborough (Rachel Weisz), wife of a war-hero General. Arriving at the palace (actually Hatfield House in Hertfordshire) is Sarah's cousin Abigail (Emma Stone), fallen on hard times. But although joining the court as a ""dirty parlour maid"", Abigail is more than a match for Sarah in terms of political scheming and sculduggery. The scene is set for a no-holds battle royale to gain the affections of the queen and be the power behind the throne.First and foremost, the film presents a triumvirate of female star turns that would - I hope - immediately grab three of the slots for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress Oscar categories.We all know Olivia Colman as a UK national treasure, but with a movie past that has seen her primarily in smaller supporting roles, this should catapult her onto the worldwide stage. Colman is just unbelievably good as the mentally unhinged monarch Queen Anne. (If you look at the history of Queen Anne in relation to motherhood, referenced in the film, you can understand and sympathise with her mental state.) The camera spends leisurely periods focused on her features and many of these are just extraordinary. One such scene at a dance, with Anne unblinking and mentally deteriotating for what must be a good minute or two is so breathtaking that it made me giggle (inappropriately) with pure movie joy.Equally good is Rachel Weisz as the incumbant favourite Lady Sarah. Her transformation from someone fully in control to someone seeing a yawning turn in her fortunes approaching is just brilliantly done. Helped by superbly scripted lines (""How did you sleep?"" asks Abigail; ""Like a shot badger"" spits out Sarah), she delivers brilliantly on a role that was reminiscent to me of Glenn Close's turn in ""Dangerous Liaisons"".Probably in 3rd place in the awards ranking, but not taking away anything from her excellent kick-ass performance, is Emma Stone as Abigail. We've seen similar performances from Stone before: indeed the film has a nice recreation of her ""La La Land"" audition breakdown at one point!Excellent in supporting roles, but rather overshadowed by the ladies, is Nicholas Hoult fully be-wigged as the leader of the opposition and the ever-reliable Mark Gatiss as Lord MarlboroughBased on the strong UK-talent and the Oscar buzz, the film has received a widespread distribution into UK multiplexes, but I think it has more of an arthouse feel to it that might trigger some disatisfaction from the general cinema-going public. (Looking back, I made exactly the same comment about ""The Lobster"".)But it is technically brilliant, and I'll call out some of the star turns in the technical department (since it's impossible to read any names from the crazily over-stylized end-titles).I've already referenced that the script has some memorable whip-smart lines (""Look at me! How dare you! Close your eyes!"") all the more impressive that this is the debut movie screenplay by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara.It is strikingly filmed, using fisheye lenses and to reflect an air of disquiet and paranoia. This always seem to be in use, but seem to be ""more fishbowly"" (not sure what the technical term is!) in some scenes than others. There are also some remarkable low-angle tracking shots: one of Rachel Weisz walking along a passageway is breathtakingly done. The cinematography is by Robbie Ryan, who did ""I, Daniel Blake"" and ""American Honey"" and I would approve of seeing it recognised in the awards season.Also fantastic are the costumes on show, particularly those worn by Rachel Weisz which are just stunning. As such, there's a second shout-out in two films (""Mary Poppins Returns"") for Sandy Powell here.Also outstanding is the music composed and coordinated by Johnnie Burn. He's collaborated with the director on his previous films in various capacities as well as the surreal ""Under the Skin"". While the soundtrack comprises well-chosen period chamber music, there are also periods of intrusive and persistent electronic tones that reflect Sarah's rising crisis just beautifully.Holding the whole thing together is Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos. Lanthimos is a bit of an acquired taste that to date I haven't fully acquired. My one criticism with the film is the same one I levelled at ""The Lobster"" - that it is a tad overlong. A comedy, particularly a black-comedy, can outstay its welcome, and for me I think it would have been a better film if cut down to nearer 90 minute than two hours. (The film is divided into different titled segments, and if you want to orientate yourself as to where you are there are 8 of them.)I did appreciate though that Lanthimos managed to cheekily include a couple of lobsters into the script, along with his usual menagerie of rabbits and ducks! Having his work cut out then on this film was animal coordinator Gerry Cott!This is marketed as a ""bawdy comedy-drama"" and be warned that it is very, VERY bawdy. It's a 15 certificate in the UK (R in the US) and for once I'd view it as quite a lenient rating. There are lesbian sex scenes in the film which although subtle (you see less than in ""Colette"") are still relatively strong. However, the language is decidedly on the fruity side with liberal use of the F-word and the C-word. As such, it will not be for the easily offended.I don't bandy the word ""masterpiece"" around often, but in this case I think it's justified.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook. Thanks).",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bizarre and Forgettable,"This movie is not terrible. Olivia Colman gives an outstanding performance and the other actors hold their own as well. Nevertheless, nothing stays with the audience after watching this film. I watched this film about four months ago and still don't remember what exactly I was suppose to take from it.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Call This What it is -- A Masterpiece,"Let me start by saying I have not been a Lanthimos fan. I watched The Lobster for 20 minutes and stopped, and didn't want to see Sacred Deer just from seeing the trailer. This film, though, perhaps because he didn't write it, which constrained some of his worst inclinations, produced something that will live for decades in the annals of truly great cinema.
Unless you are into superheros, explosions, splatter and martial arts as your only movie fare; and if you appreciate cinematic art in its many expressions (acting, music, plot, layered symbolism, cinematography, direction, etc.), then this is a film that will stick with you for awhile.
Finally, I want to say a word about two things ( NOT spoilers):1) the ending that a few people seem to be dissing in thier reviews and 2) a few disparaging comments about historical accuracy.
In my viewing the ending was perfect. The Queen remains the Queen no matter who fights for or wins the place of Favourite. Winning is not what it looks to be from afar. Is who you become in getting to the pinnacle who you really want to be?
And take a look at Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough in Wikipedia, which references her letters reporting the Queen's lesbian bent. Was this out of spite? Who knows, but it's there. One of the only artistic licenses on historical fact that I could find was the tea and horse incident, which served to further the intensity of the drama.
Go see this movie as soon as you can. It's going to have some serious attention in award season.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pretentiousness ruining a potentially better movie,"I dont understand the fish eye cams, other than to show that ""Im so unique and deep""? Seriously, other than that I just can't imagine a single bit of reason for it. Simply because It's not like fish eye cam is a new thing and no one ever tried to do something with it, imagine lowering the resolution of the film randomly making it blurry sometimes in between key scenes for no reasons, yeah, such new avant-garde, such creativeness, right? why no one does it? because it looks freaking bad and serves nothing other than repulsiveness to some audiences.The plot is suspenseful most of time keeping the movie engaging, but on a story level it's average at best if not simply bad. Aside from being overly simplistic, there are hardly ever any character or character development, I understand it's a luxury to ask for realism even though with its almost absurd level budget or attention to the historic clothes and environment settings one would naturally expect so, then again one can only hope they can at least allocate 1% of that to the story to make it more reasonable or believable, to be at least worthy of all the dazzling fancy environment sets.
The movie is successful in depicting the most basic settings as to where the main characters are to the queen on relationship levels but that's about it, theres no character consistency after that, the queen is literally a cheap plotdevice with no personality of her own while the others had IQ and sympathy level that are conveniently changing every time the plot demands. One time a woman can threaten and nearly kill the protagonist directly with the slightest offense, next scene on the most serious intrusion of the highest seriousness, protagonist is merely ""dismissed"", giving her chance to fight back in the following plots.Probbly coming from a background of Asia used to all kinds of palace drama and movies of all kinds of princes and concubines scheming and fighting to the death, tons of the events in the story just feels stupid and naive, with actions of the characters uncharacteristic and fake. Like the single most powerful person in the country even controlling the Queen should have easily executed a mere maid along with the maid's whole family or the entire crew when she dared to use poison in cups served to queen, and even nearly killing her. A person as smart as her controlling every fair in the palace would not give the maid chance to plead to queen with self inflicted fake wounds when she ordered her to leave, no, she'd go directly to the guillotine, as if not already ridiculous enough, later when the maid is with the queen, an audience is suddenly required denying the woman more chance with the queen? The writer or director needs to at least learn and understand how an audience with the King or Queen works, it's not the door lock of a 13 year old girl throwing tantrum, If the Queen had the power to banish the woman out of the country, how dare , how dumb and why would the smartest powerful woman threaten the Queen with life and death matter?? thats simply not her character, and it serves literally nothing, this is not modern time world where a public figure can not be killed easily,, (in the end she's indeed banished from the country losing all her power just because of one command from the Queen), etc etc, there are so many convenient development that are dumb on many levels to anyone used to historical dramas inside a feudal palace.Another widely hated part is the background music which didn't bother me, on the contrary I found them just right for the atmosphere the movie is trying to create (could be that im watching it at 1.5-2x the speed rather than being forced to hear it all the way through in a closed theatre with heightened decibels though).Anyway, an average movie with an overly simplified and most of the time dumb story that is simply sub par and in sharp contrast to the grandiose visuals and environment sets.People say when the wave ebbs, the one that is naked is then exposed. IMO This movie is precisely the case showing exactly how much worth this director is at when he is no longer shrouded in this guise of ridiculousness of ""omg so deep""""so many meanings"",
like an artist known for drawing abstract random mix of colors that hardly anyone appreciates, but are always touted by a certain group of people as ""Deep! masterpiece!"", when this artist is asked to simply draw a picture of something in real world for the beauty of it simply rather than drawing ""deep things"", alas, the result just turns out to be this painfully average and at most place sub par drawing, worthy literally no more than a rating of average, 5/10. Plus 1 point for the high budget fancy set pieces that are a joy to the eye.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Mean girls in British Court.,"I saw this film at the San Diego film festival this weekend and it was quite a delight. Of course, being from the director it's from, I was worried it wasn't actually going to be a comedy at all and I'd be horrified. Not the case at all. This was Just a fun film of Emma stone and Rachel Weisz antagonizing each other for two hours. The ending was a bit strange, but a rather enjoyable film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Favourite is not my favorite,"I went in with the highest of expectations. This was probably the second film, first being Barry Jenkin's Moonlight, where I so badly wanted to like or even love it but that would really just be a lie. I respect the main three actresses so much. Olivia Colman is so good in this particular role. Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz were entertaining but their roles weren't as juicy as I thought. This was compared to the cinematic hit ""All About Eve"". Is it just me or does that sound like a compliment too good to be true. Weisz and Stone's rivalry was not as enjoyable as I would've liked it to be. The whole feel of the film was so creepy and bizarre. I got an uneasy feeling of confusion of boredom as I was watching it. Their costumes were exquisite but the story just didn't work for me. I left the theatre saying to myself, ""Did I not understand the film? Were there hidden messages that I didn't catch?"" I looked up the spoilers and whole plot and realized that wasn't the issue. The issue was how it was presented. It should've been directed by someone else. This film is just way too boring and bizarre for me. I'm not stopping anyone from seeing this film but just don't go in, thinking it's the best picture of 2018. It certainly isn't.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Two hours of quirky fun!,"""The Favourite"" is a rarity in studio films; it feels fresh and original, intellectual and weird. It defies both description and expectation, leaving you unsettled, confused, and yet pleasantly warm.Your experience watching ""The Favourite"" will not be enhanced by a deep knowledge of the plot, or of the historical events that surround the story. Indeed, the film reflects England under Queen Anne in much the same way that Game of Thrones echoes the Wars of the Roses, which is to say: sorta. In the world of ""The Favourite,"" historical figures blithely employ anachronistic dialogue. Slanderous allegations of yore become genuine plot points. If the movie were making any sort of pretense towards historical accuracy, this might all be grating. ""The Favourite,"" however, is far more concerned with constructing its sophisticated narrative than with faithfully depicting 18th century Britain to impress the four historians in the audience.Our players, affectionate, shrewd, and manipulative, are as follows: Olivia Colman plays Queen Anne-gout-ridden, somewhat simple, and yet warm. Rachel Weisz is Sarah, the Duchess of Marlborough-the Queen's friend, confidante, and puppet-master. Emma Stone, rounding out the triumvirate, plays Abigail-a noble cousin to the Duchess who has fallen below her station (her condition is most delightfully represented by her appearance in court: slathered with excrement). Lady Marlborough employs Abigail as her own maid, bringing her into the Queen's sphere with dramatic consequences.All three actresses are exemplary, imbuing their performances with expressions and tics that communicate the veiled struggle for influence that their dialogue disguises. As Lady Marlborough and Abigail begin to square off, the chemistry between Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone becomes electric, their interactions nuanced and pregnant with subtext. Were ""The Favourite's"" DVD release to mimic ""Lord of the Rings,"" with an hour of extra footage of Sarah and Abigail sniping at one another, I assure you, I'd be first in line at the Blockbu...internet to purchase it. Olivia Colman, too, is extraordinary. Her Queen Anne is stubborn and self-destructive, feeble, and eminently manipulable. Yet she is also witty, loving, and canny, making her sympathetic, rather than simply pathetic.Though the actors' respective roles could easily devolve into familiar tropes, ""The Favourite"" resists such simplification. Moral ambiguity is rife in ""The Favourite."" If you're hoping to divide the three leads into ""good guys"" and ""bad guys,"" you will be continually disappointed. Such explicit designations (and the gendered assumptions implicit therein) have no place in this film. Each main character is, at times, manipulative, trusting, duplicitous, and loyal. They are, in short, human. Cruelty and ambition often live cheek-by-jowl with kindness and friendship in the human heart. If all this friction has you eagerly anticipating a ""cat-fight,"" then I bid you welcome to 2018, Archie Bunker, but you, too, shall leave the theater disgruntled. You will find conflict to spare in ""The Favourite,"" but it is hardly a voyeuristic fantasyland. I know, I know, way too much talky-talky and not enough sexy-slappy. I get it. Now run along to the box office and see if they'll still let you swap your ticket for Robin Hood.""The Favourite"" defies cinematic tradition by surrounding three complex, nuanced female characters with one-dimensional men. The male supporting cast is neither uninteresting nor unlikeable, but their motivations tend to be simple, their personalities, caricatures. These men's foppish displays are entertaining, no doubt, but they do not captivate the attention like the exchanges between Anne, Sarah, and Abigail. Turnabout is fair play, and this story demands sophisticated interplay between its three feminine leads, while only requiring men for the occasional plot device. Never fear, my masculine brethren. No fewer than six male-driven films were released around the same week as ""The Favourite"". The feminist takeover of Hollywood with deviations like ""speaking roles for women"" remains in its infancy.Helming this new-age feminist hellscape is Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos, who deserves a great deal of credit for establishing the odd world of ""The Favourite"". Lanthimos' whole visual aesthetic is peculiar, with wide, fisheye lenses and odd, unexpected camera angles (""What if I put the camera under the table for this conversation?"" I imagine him asking). In addition, Lanthimos does not like to use traditional film lighting. His exteriors rely on natural light, while his nighttime scenes give a real impression of being candle-lit, with hard shadows and dark corners. If Lanthimos wishes to unsettle the viewer with his aesthetic, he succeeds masterfully. Even during otherwise innocuous conversations, you may feel a creeping trepidation as your neck hairs stand on end. ""The Favourite"" isn't particularly off-putting or violent, but you will feel strangely uncomfortable, despite all the humor, until the credits roll.Although ""The Favourite"" is thematically - and cinematically - dark, it is often also shockingly funny. The dialogue is snappy and well-tuned, and the actors' interplay with one another is perfectly coordinated. Dull, expository dialogue, usually wielded with all the subtlety of a self-important sledgehammer in historical dramas, here flits across the screen like a hummingbird, lingers briefly, and is gone again. Instead, a droll sort of whimsy prevails. At times, laughter felt wrenched from the audience, as we surprised ourselves with our own snorts of glee. Humor is rarely so cathartic as when your fingernails are digging grooves into your palms. It would be a mistake to classify ""The Favourite"" as a ""comedy,"" I think, but for all its gloom, it is hardly grim. Complexity necessitates a balance between darkness and light; between tragedy and comedy. ""The Favourite"" deftly manages that tension better than most films.""The Favourite"" is not a movie for everyone. It will be too ""much"" for some, too weird for others, and, sadly, too woman-centric for many (one does not expect a tweet from our dear president, for instance, extolling his love for this film). Nevertheless, ""The Favourite"" is brilliant. The writing is witty, the sets are lavish, and the acting is exceptional. It is a symphony of odd, eccentric anachronisms that will leave you tearing through a dictionary for the right words to describe it, always coming up a bit short.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

My Favorite film of 2018!,"So I saw The Favorite at the theater. I was really looking forward to the movie. It has an absolutely phenomenal ensemble cast plus the director Yorgos Lanthimos knows his way around an interesting and provocative film. Overall I was blown away with the movie. It may be my favorite film of 2018, pun intended. If nothing else it might be the best made film of 2018. I cannot recommend the film enough to everyone.The plot of the movie is very unconventional. This is not a movie with a grand historical scope. There are no intense battle scenes or extravagant narratives. While there is a war that occurs during the film it merely serves as a plot device to carry the actual narrative. The real meat of the movie is the political intrigue and rich dialogue. Pretty much the entire film takes place at the Queens royal estate. This is an immensely sharp and witty film that constantly plays with the viewers expectation. It somehow perfectly mixes elements of comedy, drama, and suspense perfectly to keep you entertained. I can say I was completely engaged the entire time.Instead of an epic narrative we witness the political and social struggles of two women as they fight for the affection of the queen. One a social climber hell-bent on achieving wealth and prestige while the other is a seasoned political matriarch who controls the kingdom from behind the scenes. In a complex mental chess game these two women attempt to outwit each other at every turn. They lie, cheat, steal, and even use sex to their advantage. It's a film the asks the question how far would you go to live a life of luxury. In many ways the film seems like the bastard child of Game of Thrones, The Lion in winter, and Barry Lyndon. This of course is high praise considering all three are at the pinnacle of political dramas and amazing dialogue.The genius of the film is in the rich textual layers of dialogue that are the center of every interaction. I haven't seen dialogue so smart and biting in a long time. It somehow is hysterical, but at the same time manages to not come off as campy and overdone. I had so much fun watching two people throw backhanded insult at each other all the while in the context of a royal palace.You really starting to love and hate most of the characters at the same time throughout the film. All of the characters were exceptionally well-written and very engaging. Everyone had their own agenda and motivations that felt genuinely human. There was no glamorizing the human condition here. Human nature was Illustrated raw and animalistic.The film was also a critique and attack on the decadence and disconnect that elites in higher social classes embody. The film illustrates how far removed the wealthy are from the struggles of the average man and that they have no problem manipulating and using individuals to their advantage. The movie also offers social commentary regarding gender norms and ideas of sexuality. Concepts of masculinity and femininity are questioned while the film also offers critiques on The Cult of Femininity. It was all around an incredibly layered film that says quite a bit while never coming across as preachy.Of course this might be one of the best acted films of the year. Other than the TV show Peep Show I wasn't very familiar with Olivia Colman. That was my mistake. She was absolutely incredible. She perfectly embodied the characteristics of a power drunk yet fragile Queen Anne. At every turn she brought something new to her charater that made the queen a richly complex figure. She also had physical and mental transformation as the film went along that would make Daniel Day-Lewis stop and take note. She deserves an Oscar for this role.Rachel Weisz is another actress that I was blown away with. I know her from a few separate roles but I was never very impressed. She always seemed like a competent, but forgettable actress. This roll completely changes how I feel about her. While the dialog was sharp her delivery was incredible. She brought so much to a well-written script with this performance. She really held a number of scenes together with her screen presence alone. I absolutely loved her in this. I can easily see her being nominated for best supporting actress.Of course I have to mention Emma Stone. Now I greatly dislike Emma Stone. She has some good roles, but there's something about her I can't stand. That being said this was easily one of her best performances. She managed to portray the wide range of emotions her character embodied throughout the film while still remaining very human. She could play sweet and naive one moment followed my cunning and brutal the next. She easily made a character fans could love to hate.Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz genuinely had some great chemistry together. The film provided an absolutely incredible ensemble performance worth seeing for its acting alone. While it's easy to overlook his performance in the face of so many strong leads Nicholas Hoult really did a good job also. His character was hilarious and provided some memorable scenes.If this film doesn't get nominated for best director then something is wrong. Yorgos Lanthimos made an absolute masterpiece of a film. He is known for his quirky and often out of this world storytelling. This is the man that brought us the Lobster which was such a bizarrely unique ride. With The Favorite he managed to tell a story in such a complex manner that is almost comes across that we're watching a play. He took a subject that was ultimately irrelevant and made it captivating. One of my personal favorite elements was his incorporation of sound. The score was outstanding, but the way he used it brought so much tension and life to every scene. The score felt like a character in itself that Incorporated an additional layer of depth to the film.Plus there was some truly stunning cinematography throughout the film that made the movie pure eye candy. The film is absolutely beautiful in so many ways. It perfectly captured the decadent aesthetic of the era. The costume and set design were flawless. You really felt like you were witnessing the day to day world of those living at the Queens manor.I loved the movie. The only real criticism I can think of deals more with viewer expectations. If you walk into the film expecting a rich historical epic you are going to be disappointed. If you are expecting action and a grand narrative you will be disappointed. If you expect something other than two hours of dialogue and political intrigue you will be disappointed. If you want a realistic portrayal of history you will be disappointed. If you want a story with a conclusion that is tied up with a nice bow you will probably get angry at the ending. It's hard to fault a film however for things it was never trying to be.The Favorite is officially my current pick for this award season. The movie offers so much to its audience, but you have to be an active viewer. The film has some of the best dialogue I've seen in years and utterly flawless delivery. The characters are complex and interesting and their interactions absolute carry the film. Technical wise this is the best film of 2018. I recommend it to everyone as this is certainly a must-watch film. It may not be for everyone, but it was a truly unique and engrossing experience. A 9.5 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Deliciously Wicked,"""The Favourite"" is a deliciously wicked and fictionalized account of what might have taken place between Queen Anne of England, her friend and confidante Lady Sarah, and a maid with aspirations named Abigail, as Sarah and Abigail vied for the Queen's favor.Director Yorgos Lanthimos, whose last two films, ""The Lobster"" and ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer,"" were marred by his determination to make his audience queasy, goes a little easier on us with this one. If you like his style, don't worry -- the film has his fingerprints all over it. But whereas those other films mentioned were so weird as to pull me out of the narrative, ""The Favourite"" is more like ""Dogtooth,"" the film that introduced me to Lanthimos in the first place, in that the weirdness is hypnotic and kept me on the edge of my seat waiting to see where this whacky movie was going to go next. And unlike ""The Lobster,"" which apparently was supposed to be a comedy, ""The Favourite"" actually made me laugh many times.The acting is stellar, with Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, and Emma Stone all giving crackerjack performances. The film explores the lengths to which people will go in order to yield power over one another. Though all three ladies get plenty of opportunities to shine, the film feels more ""about"" Abigail than anyone, and we watch her first wrestle with her morals as she realizes how skeezy she will have to be to beat Lady Sarah at her game, then commit to doing what she has to do to be top dog, and finally left wondering why she wanted to be top dog in the first place, a warning given to her by rival Lady Sarah that she refuses to heed. And Olivia Colman's Queen Anne is a wolf in sheep's clothing, her physical and emotional frailty a camouflage for her monstrous obsession with being adored.""The Favourite"" looks stunning, the kind of film that wins Oscars for production design, costume design, and cinematography but actually deserves them. The film reminded me once in a while of Stanley Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"" in its look and tone, though ""The Favourite"" isn't afraid to get its hands dirty whereas ""Barry Lyndon"" remained stately and pristine.Easily one of the best movies of the year.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
It wasn't my favourite.,"'The Favourite (2018)' certainly feels far longer than it is, thanks to - I feel - its 'chapter'-based and slightly episodic structure. It's never exactly repetitive - nor, indeed, boring - but it does settle into a strange, laid-back pacing that paints many of its, essentially, single-location events with what is ostensibly the same dry brush. While there is, of course, more to the piece than its aspects of black comedy, I do feel that your mileage will vary depending on how funny you find it. It functions far more as a comedy than as anything else (a period drama is the next closest thing, I suppose) and, for me, it just wasn't funny enough for that to be its sole function - or, rather, for it to be all that successful at it. There are chuckles here and there, don't get me wrong. It's not devoid of merit in other areas, either. Lanthimos' direction is prevalent, including his typically dead-pan panning, and the period design - from the sets to the costumes - all looks fantastic. The only issue I have with the film's look is the occasional distracting use of fish-eye lenses, which don't fit with its overall aesthetic. I guess the most noteworthy thing about the affair is the acting - it's certainly drawing awards attention. It is strong across the board, with the absolute stand-out being Olivia Coleman with her portrayal of 'Queen Anne'. Her character is easily the most interesting aspect of the narrative; she's unpredictable, child-like, physically-impaired and there's a real sadness to her, too. Coleman, of course, pulls it all off impeccably, being intimidating and insecure all at once. The other lead characters are portrayed well but, in terms of development or general intrigue, pale in comparison to the Queen. The flick is a strange one. It's not exactly compelling but it isn't disengaging, either. It is generally entertaining, too. It does feel very long, though, and, even if the ending nicely ties its themes together, seems as though it should have ended a full 'chapter' earlier (at least, that's how I felt as I was watching it). Like I said before, I think your enjoyment will depend entirely on how funny you find it. That's completely subjective. In the end, while I usually enjoyed it, it wasn't my favourite. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Worst director of the last decade,"I've seen all the films by this director, and I hated ALL of them. This one is slightly better, because he didn't write the screenplay (he's a mediocre director, but an awful scriptwriter, he's incompetent of writing well written characters and dialogues). But still, I really don't get how can critics and people call something like this a ""masterpiece"" and worthy of Oscars. What are they smoking? This is bad, pretentious art.
First, there is no plot. Nothing was happening, it felt like a series of disjointed skits. Second, besides a couple of lines by Colman, I didn't laugh with anything else. If this is considered a comedy, even a weird one, it was not funny. Third, it was absolutely dull, I was feeling bored from the first 20 minutes.I think most of the people who write good reviews about this film (or any film by this director), they just wanna impress, that they understand and like weird films. But I can not believe that they didn't feel bored and puzzled, especially towards the end.If this is considered good filmmaking and all (or most) movies were like this, I wouldn't bother with cinema at all. This is not good cinema for me. It's rubbish. I want to feel something when I see a film, any kind of film, from the most independent with the lowest budget, to the biggest blockbuster. This film gave me nothing to think about, it was void.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Welcome to Hollywood, Yorgos","To be short - this movie is a excellent example of exaturated borgoise humor, which Lantimos delievered to us in his previous works ""Lobster"" and ""Killing of a Sacred Deer"". ""The Favoutite"" keeps director's metaphors and adds some spicy humor. I really like this casual style scripted dialogue and sharp reactions (from burn to burn). Enjoyable, captive, smart, sexy and still meaningful and artsy.

Olivia Colman's Tour de Force,"Just because you're thrust into the position of ruling as King or Queen doesn't mean you're cut out for it. Olivia Colman is Queen Anne, whose existence is plagued by chronic illnesses and constant unhappiness. Ms. Colman is simply magnificent, as she embodies the pitiful woe-is-me, emotionally out-of-control, petulant childish Queen with her every manner. She's taken by the celebration of the festivities of dancing at a ball until she envies those who can dance, and get around better than her. Her life is a roller-coaster of feelings, emotions, and manipulations. Rachel Weisz keeps her in check and knows her inside out, but soon Rachel's place by her side is threatened by Emma Stone.Who will ultimately be Queen Anne's Favourite? The film and all actors are excellent, but Olivia Colman rightfully steals the show and you think about her even when she's not in the scene. Ms. Colman deserved the Oscar. Sorry, Glenn!

The Favourite: A Courtly Caper that Raises Eyebrows,"Buckle up, history buffs and comedy connoisseurs, because The Favourite isn't your typical royal romp. It's a visually stunning spectacle, dripping with opulent costumes and meticulously recreated sets, but the story unfolds like a drunken jester telling a scandalous court secret. Olivia Colman reigns as Queen Anne, a monarch both fragile and fierce, surrounded by advisors with agendas as sharp as their tongues. Enter Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone, who scheme and seduce with the finesse of fencing champions, their power struggle as captivating as it is cutthroat.Now, let's sip some tea and discuss the good stuff: The acting is a masterclass in wit and nuance. Colman delivers a great performance as the unpredictable queen, while Weisz and Stone balance ambition with vulnerability, making you question whose side you're even on. The dialogue is a verbal fencing match, laced with humor that's both hilarious and surprisingly dark. Prepare for double entendres that would make Shakespeare blush and situations so bizarre they'd leave a royal corgi speechless.But before you don your fanciest court attire, a word of caution: This film is no genteel drawing-room drama. The humor is pitch-black, with bodily fluids and fowl playing starring roles (yes, you read that right). The narrative unfolds at a leisurely pace, with some critics finding it meandering and even historically questionable (though who needs facts when the drama is this juicy?).So, should you grace this court with your presence? If you have a taste for the absurd, the hilarious, and the historically flexible, then The Favourite is a must-watch. Just remember, keep your expectations open, your sense of humor sharp, and maybe avoid the lemon cake. After all, this is a film where courtly intrigue takes a delightfully bizarre turn, leaving you both entertained and pondering the complexities of power, friendship, and the occasional duck-related incident.Verdict: 7 out of 10 royal scandals (with an honorable mention for the duck). The Favourite is a visually stunning, darkly funny, and beautifully acted film that will stay with you long after the final scandal unfolds. Just remember, it's not your typical historical drama, so prepare for a wild ride fit for a queen with a penchant for the peculiar. As for me, I'll be off searching for a therapist who specializes in treating laughter-induced duck trauma (apparently, it's a thing).",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Phenomenal - exquisite - savage,"Having watched nearly all of Yorgos Lanthimos' prior films, and loved them dearly, I've been overdue to give this highly lauded 2018 film another go after my first try at sitting with it was less than ideal. Being in a better position to appreciate it, it's hard not to immediately adore 'The favourite' right from the outset. To speak frankly there is nothing about this movie that isn't brilliant, and I don't know how I could have effectively missed out on it heretofore.What here is less than exquisite? The filming locations are simply grand, and the production design and art direction magnificent. The costume design is utterly gorgeous, and the hair and makeup lovely; even the choices of lighting are marvelously shrewd and fetching. Commendable as the cinematography may be in many a picture, Robbie Ryan's contribution is smart and stupendously rich to a degree far exceeding most anything else that readily comes to mind save perhaps for John Alcott's iconic work in Stanley Kubrick's 'Barry Lyndon.' There is nary a single shot that isn't immensely beautiful, or which wouldn't belong framed and hung on a wall as art. Somehow, incredibly, the screenplay devised between Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara is greater still: wry, offbeat, and satirical in its treatment of eighteenth-century royalty and nobility, and especially of men, while gifting us with fabulously bright, clever women of severe personalities, unyielding poise, and undisguised jockeying for power, position, and dominance. The dialogue and scene writing are splendidly sharp and cutting, not to mention forceful by way of being uncompromisingly commanding and brusque - culminating in storytelling that is marked by myriad intractable hard edges, yet with a stunning, calculated finesse that allows it all to land with the punctuated stringency of an assassin's blade.Fantastically intelligent and supremely skillful as all these elements may be - at once polished and precise in appearance, while also coarse and harsh in manner - Lanthimos' oversight and guidance as director is truly perfect, allowing each and every facet to strike with maximum impact, and achieve its maximum potential. I wholeheartedly treasure the man's other features, and 'Dogtooth' and 'The killing of a sacred deer' remain my personal favorites up to this point, yet there's a ferocious vibrancy in Lanthimos' direction in 'The favourite' that's outright spellbinding; whatever one thinks of the title at large, Lanthimos' direction, specifically, has never been more stellar. Furthermore, in much the same way I find myself doubting if the stars have ever given better, more entrancing performances than they do here. Even those in supporting parts, like Nicholas Hoult and Joe Alwyn, leave an indelible mark on the proceedings with unquestionable, fierce vitality. As Olivia Colman, Emma Stone, and Rachel Weisz take center stage, however, they demonstrate spirited, full-bodied acting skills with portrayals that are altogether hypnotizing. All three principals have proven themselves time and again in many other flicks, even if in fare much unlike this; we know Stone best for playing spunky, youthful modern women. Past credits are almost beside the point, however, for they erupt with such unflaggingly vivid, staggering depictions here as to completely outshine anything else they've done.Even the use of sound is tremendously witty, and the deployment of timeless, monumental music herein lends significantly to the bristling tension, violent energy, and cold atmosphere of the the saga. What we get, at length, is a film that deftly, seamlessly swirls together drama and satire; dark thriller vibes and funny warped humor; the madness of underhanded politicking (both personal and, well, political) of a bygone era, realized through the unrestrained sensibilities of modern cinema in a period piece. 'The favourite' is a captivating, dazzling, ingenious movie of salacious scheming where sex is but a weapon whose sensationalism is entirely superseded by the frigid savagery of how the characters work against each other. Down to the instances of stunts, effects, and choreography the viewing experience is a sumptuous, absorbing, highly satisfying ride that keeps us locked in from the very start to the very end. Being familiar with other efforts from those involved still does not prepare one for how vicious and consuming the totality is in these two hours. Given that tone, reflected particularly in the dialogue and acting, I can certainly understand how the picture won't appeal to all. Nonetheless, whether or not one is a fan of someone participating herein, all told 'The favourite' is so superb that it all but demands viewership. Be aware of the nature of the material, and how it is executed, but there's no going wrong here in my mind and I'm pleased to give this my very high, hearty, and enthusiastic recommendation!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Favourite,"Queen Anne was one of the few British monarchs still to have had her story committed to film and this was the Oscar winning result. Olivia Coleman stands out as the cantankerous and temperamental last of the Stuart's to reign; but otherwise the performances fall rather flat. The rivalry - and sometimes pretty vulgar visualisation of it - between Abigail & Sarah Churchill doesn't quite work for me and the foppish Nicholas Hoult is a parody of something from ""Blackadder"". It moves along quite sharpishly, and the craft skills behind it all are second to none, but I can't help feel that the subject matter - and the triplet of three strong women in leading roles earned it more attention that the film actually merited.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A Well-Balanced, Deliciously Mean-Spirited Battle of Wits","A pair of disingenuous young aspirants vie over Queen Anne's favor amidst the pomp and presumption of 18th century England. Sarah, the stand-offish, incumbent chief of staff, brusquely runs the country while her queen deals with depression, near-madness and a nasty case of the gout. Abigail, a disgraced former upper-class lady who stumbles into the palace smelling of dung and desperation, uses a delicate, sensitive touch to sway the monarch's opinion from the harsher methods of her rival. This pair launches a string of increasingly spiteful schemes and manipulations, always aiming to boost their own standing at the expense of the other, and even the queen herself isn't above such games. A vivid display of willpower, gamesmanship and raw nastiness masked under the guise of civility.Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone are both excellent as the dueling ladies, but I found the experienced, versatile Olivia Colman's turn as Queen Anne most impressive. Nuanced and complex, her performance transforms a rather frail, tragic figure into something larger, something damaged but still formidable. A Best Actress nomination well-earned.The camerawork sometimes grows over-ambitious (many early shots use a distracting wide-angle lens that feels out of place) and the ending is a bit of a head-scratcher, but otherwise it's a well-balanced, deliciously mean-spirited battle of wits.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Brutish, Boorish, British yawn","It's safe to say that Director Yorgos Lanthimos has a thing for animals, especially lobsters. So thus the Favourite answers some questions no one really asks, such as whether duck races are ethical or whether rabbits can serve adequately as a surrogate family. Oh, and hello to Emma Stone! How did you end up in this tawdry affair?I suppose it is a historical docudrama comedy or a statement about life being nasty and brutish even for a queen, but watching wealthy, upper-stuff elite act boorish in the face of bloody, distant war smacks of triteness, somewhat reconjuring feelings felt upon trying to fight one's way through an uninterrupted viewing of The Death of Stalin. The Favourite smashes together ideas from Amadeus, Barry Lyndon, and The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie, all of which, and each of which, are sorely and surely better films.What if a bunch of miserable, thankless, and uninteresting people all had to live together in one house? Perhaps The Favourite is a modern-day biting critique of The Real World, or even a subtly clever reboot of Fey Big Brother. Perhaps The Favourite is an homage to shooting guns, moist leg massages, fine dining, ballroom dancing, and heartless handiwork.Or perhaps, and this is the most likely scenario, The Favourite is another movie, and it is not one of my favorites.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Vicious, bawdy tale of a queen's court","Yorgos Lanthimos takes on the biopic genre in this serpentine and visually striking depiction of Queen Anne in her diminished condition and her shifting companionship between Lady Sarah, who largely took over the reigns of the state and Abigail, a young woman who comes to the court as a servant but quickly earns the queen's fondness. Abigail becomes a foil not only for Lady Sarah but for the male leaders in Parliament.Emma Watson and Rachel Weisz play well off each other as Abigail and Lady Sarah respectively. Olivia Coleman is a joy to watch as the frail but furiously combustible Queens Anne. Nicholas Hoult is solid in a supporting turn as the leader of Parliament opposition.The film is loaded with Lanthimosian dark humor but also cold mystery and austere cinematography and camerawork. In time, we get to know the quirks, hidden secrets and impulses of all three characters as the court confronts the pressures of war with France and political instability at home- and more privately as the queen's closest female confidants duel for their place.One of Lanthimos's best films to date, this one will keep you on the edge until the very last frame with one memorable sequence after another.

Interesting and intriguing,"Early 18th century. Queen Anne is the monarch of England. Her closest friend, confidant and adviser is Lady Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough. Lady Sarah's cousin Abigail comes to the palace, hoping for a job. She used to have status but has fallen on hard times. With Lady Sarah's help Abigail gets a job as a maid. However, her ambitions are much higher than that.Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, which made me sceptical about this movie. Lanthimos's previous two movies - The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer - were pretentious, pointless, random nonsense. Here, however, he adds a fair degree of much-needed substance to the style, creating a movie that is intriguing and interesting, even funny, while set against actual historic events. There's still a fair bit of unnecessary style-over-substance scenes (and sounds - the jarring music was annoying at times) but for the most part this is a good story.Lanthimos makes use of some innovative techniques to enhance the atmosphere. The use of fisheye lens shots was highly original and gives a great sense of the vastness, and emptiness, of the palace.Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone are great in the main roles. Colman as Queen Anne is superb and well deserved her Best Actress Oscar. Solid supporting cast that includes Nicholas Hoult and Mark Gatiss.The ending is a bit flat though.

Uncomfortable and a bit boring despite its talent,"The script for this star-studded period comedy-drama has been in circulation since the late 90s and has finally been greenlit with writers Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara and Director Yorgos Lanthimos. The setting is early 18th Century England (filmed at Hatfield House in Hertfordshire!) Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is in rule and assisted by her close friend and confidante Sarah (Rachel Weisz). A new servant arrives, Abigail (Emma Stone), who starts to work up the ranks and gain the trust of Queen Anne. And so begins a dangerous rivalry. This is the third film I have seen by Lanthimos and both films previously were completely different sides of the spectrum for me. I really didn't like Dogtooth; although it was an interesting premise, I found its rough edges to be too rough and isolating which I guess is the point of the film but not for me. On the other hand, I absolutely loved The Lobster which was a genuinely brilliant, funny yet darkly savage look at a dystopian future. The Favourite leans more towards the former for me; it felt strangely uninvolving despite the good performances and I found myself just looking at the screen rather than being engaged as it went on. There are some brilliant moments though particularly thanks to Olivia Colman who is stunningly great as always; the close up camera shots of her are so good, portraying the pathos and sadness of the character of Anne extremely well. Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz are also great as ever and have a lot of fun in the roles of consistently trying to outsmart the other. There is a brutal moment involving self-mutilation with a book that reminded me of the most shocking moments in The Lobster. The ending frames are also hauntingly amazing; edited beautifully by Yorgos Mavropsaridis! Lanthimos is a master of uncomfortable atmosphere and brooding darkness which can go either way; in the case of The Favourite it's a bit of a mixed bag. When it works particularly during the eerily quiet moments, it's really good but when it's uncomfortably bizarre which is the majority of the time it's a bit of a numb watch",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

Former lady Abigail vies to further herself and become ""the favourite"" of Queen Anne, played to great effect by Olivia Colman.There is a beautiful social critique contained in the film. It asks us why we cannot accept others for who they are if they have different preferences than us. Social mobility is touched on in the character of Abigail. Examined are questions are how much further really we've come from this time period and if we're as advanced as we think we are.

History high-jacked to provide vehicle for contemporary sensibilities,"I was invited to see this film by my wife and had no pre-conceptions other than admiring Olivia Colman's work on British television. I did not know the director or his previous films. I am no historian and know very little about the period in which the film is set. Understanding context is crucial to the telling of any story, yet the viewer is given very little information about how the main characters came to be in the situation depicted: How had Anne become queen? Who had given her multiple miscarriages and been father of her deceased offspring? We are not even given a date to hang the events on. This is probably deliberate since it gave the director the freedom that imprecision allows to impose his own agenda on what for many is little-known period of English history - which is exactly what he does.What follows is two hours featuring some fine female performances, lavish costumes and location settings, incongruous dialogue, clumsy 'shock' scenes, sub-Greenaway imagery accompanied by a disjointed and distracting soundtrack.Subsequent reading has revealed that director Lanthimos aims to produce a disconnection between dialogue and setting and to alienate through language - in this regard the film must surely be seen as a triumph.However, I suggest that cinema relies upon more than the implementation of an intellectual conception. The almost unanimous praise of this film by critics is notably at odds with the comments of those who have actually paid to watch the film, many of whom were encouraged by praise heaped upon it. The audience I watched the film with were not rolling in the aisles in response to the apparently intended humour, aside from the odd embarrassed titter, it was silent and the speed with which they left the auditorium wondering what possible connection Elton John had with Queen Anne was notable.This was probably not helped by the unreadable 'style over function' graphics used for the end-credits. As a professional graphic designer, I deplore the approach which is disrespectful to both contributors and audience.

dont read the hate mail!,"It is a 7/8 imdb correct.
complains about the sound track is exaggerated. Lots of classical style wt some simple tonal moments that also fit.
the same complain about the wide angle lenses use: it was only use sporadically and its actually pretty good.
The story is probably BS compare to the real thing but I was not looking for history value myself . probably look at it as a bad book adaptation.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Perverse , violent and vitriolicly hilarious Lanthimic brilliancy","Yes it is great. Yes the direction is exquisite , cinematography , atmosphere ,acting , story. In fact everything is great about it. Then again you are watching a film that is not quite like most other films but stands along those few weird ones on the corner ,reserved for the weirds. If you are the sort of person who wants a film like most others , then in the first place you shouldn't be watching a Lanthimos picture. On the other hand if you are the sort who can appreciate or even enjoy something that most people don't feel at ease with then I think you ll like this one a lot. I personally was in awe by almost every scene and kept saying secretly ""bravo "" to Lanthimos. The Favourite is my favorite of his films. The story as a story isn't even that weird it's pretty basic , just two women fighting against each other for power and statusbut what makes it weird is the little things the director chose to include ,chose to film for our pleasure. Some of you will like what he chose to film , most of you won't. It is made intentionally that way I guess. An artist can't compromise. It is what it is.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Entertaining, if crude, period drama with a very weak ending.","Fans of period dramas will be split on this movie. For many period dramas are a genteel affair which provide an escape from many of the trappings of modern movies such a explicit sex, violence and swearing. This point was brought home when I attended a screening of the favourite and noticed just how many of the audience were elderly women, keen on seeing what all the fuss was about with The Favourite.
It was clear that many were shocked by this movie as it is fairly sexually explicit and the use of course language is rife throughout. This is no BBC production.
The story itself concerns a power struggle between two cousins who try and outdo each other using any many underhand means as possible to gain favour with the Queen and become her favourite.
This is a very engaging movie for the most part however the ending just seems to happen without any real conclusions, its as if the final reel has gone missing and it is a major disappointment. More so because the story seemed to be coming to a head and then........... just nothing.
The cinematography however is stunning and so many scenes look like a painting come to life.
This is a modern slant on a period drama with explicit sex scenes, very vulgar language and cruel humour so be warned, if that is not your thing then The Favourite is not for you.
If however you enjoy great visuals and dialogue similar to that spouted on The Thick of It by Malcolm Tucker then you may find this to your taste. Do not however blame me for how you react to the ending as you have been warned!",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Favourite (2018),"Yorgos Lanthimos is quite an impressive filmmaker. I absolutely loved The Lobster. It was unique and cynically funny. I also enjoyed the creativity and somber delivery of The Killing of a Sacred Deer. For The Favourite it seemed like a different type of venture for Lanthimos, but certainly one where he would be able to implement his creativity and filming techniques. The Favourite is good in exactly the way you would expect it to be.The film is about Queen Anne and her favourite Sarah Churchill. Churchill's cousin, Abigail Hill soon arrives to the kingdom looking for a job. She eventually gets close to the ailing Queen and Sarah and Abigail start to battle for the Queen's affection. The Queen has a history of health problems so she needs someone to attend to her consistently. The motives of Abigail seem unclear because she seems to have many different interests and pursuits. The film stars an excellent cast of Olivia Coleman, Rachel Weisz, Emma Stone, with supporting roles from Nicholas Hoult and Joe Alwyn.Yorgo's style is still ever present in this film. The camera uses fish eye and wide shots that encompass the entire grand scenery and decor of the castle. He uses natural lighting which is a common thread in his work. The characters are very well acted, especially Coleman who was just born to scream at servants and complain loudly about everything. I thought the film touches on a relationship between women but doesn't linger on it long enough. The film has comedic one liners as is expected from Lanthimos' work. Its a very interesting film with memorable characters with motivations you can't see.The film is so very nice to look at but for me doesn't have as strong a presence of something like The Lobster. This is a historical work so I can see restrictions in the imagination that we are used to seeing from Lanthimos but its still a very interesting work because of the intricacies of the relationship between the three leads and how mad they become as the film goes along. its prim and proper in appearance but there's a royal madness to it all. Its worth the watch, and I'm excited for the next chapter of work from the filmmaker.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Film Review: The Favourite/www.nightfilmreviews.com,"""Favour is a breeze that shifts direction all the time.""Lathimos' third English language film following The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Dear is an exploration of the absurdities of the rich, powerful and bored.Yet no matter how many clever indications one my make about the film's title or the various tongue-in-cheek references that could be used to describe the film, or even Lathimos' canon as a whole, it comes as a surprise to many that the director's most tamed and least ghastly and disturbing film to date, is by far his most ravishing yet.While the specific genre of the film has yet to be determined, Lathimos' The Favourite is a hodgepodge of cinematic tropes; part black comedy, part period piece, part love story, part cat-and-mouse thriller, part buddy comedy, part completely insane, the film deconstructs everything that you expect from all of these categories of film and throws them completely on their head with immense style, fashion and perfection. To say The Favourite will be like anything you've ever seen, is a direct and misleading understatement, much like the characters it presents.Written by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, The Favourite marks the first film Lathimos has not written a script he has directed since making his big splash at Cannes in 2009 with his highly unconventional and controversial film Dogtooth. Yet, as much as we appreciate the auteur's uncanny ability of making people feel uncomfortable using the eeriness and awkwardness of other people by simply interacting with one another, this is one script that feels more Lathimos than any of the ones he has written in the past.While the film is made during a prominent and very loud #MeToo movement in Hollywood, The Favourite is set in 18th Century England, a land where Queens rule and Kings drool, especially when the Queen is Mrs. Morley Anne (Olivia Colman) ruler of Scotland, Ireland and England and currently waging war against France. While the Queen is surrounded by men, including her military commanders and parliamentary leaders, Queen Anne proves that at the end of the day, the women make the rules and own the house. Yet, as important and iconic Queen Anne is, it becomes clear quickly that Anne is no more of a mere mortal with a crown next to her life-long friend and council advisor, The Duchess of Marlborough, Sarah Churchill (Rachael Weisz). While Sarah is able to wholly intimidate, scoff and insult the Queen right to her face, it seem that Sarah is only looking out for one person and one person only, despite her illusions and deceit. Occasionally giving accord to Queen Anne or her husband for that matter, military commander of the Queen's army, Lord Marlborough (Mark Gatniss), Sarah is one a one-way ticket to riches, power and most importantly her, affection.As Sarah seems to seemingly pave a path of success for years to come, things come to a steady halt with the arrival of her cousin, Abigail (Emma Stone). Although Abagail arrives in a heap of mud, discontent and stalked by tragedy, she quickly hardens up and wilts to the whim of her commanding cousin, only to quickly gain her affection and take her opportunity for the Queen's admiration, following a natural herbal remedy for the Queen's disgusting gout infested legs. Once Abigail becomes the Queen's own personal leg-rubber, she begins plotting her dominance over the Queen and her affections, overshadowing her own cousin, proving that Sarah's protegé as quickly become her biggest and most intimidating rival.Where Sarah adorns the Queen with her brazen honesty and harsh truths, including advising when the queen looks like a badger, Abigail's approach to the affections of the Queen include lies, deceit and endless compliments, making the Queen feel unlike anything Sarah never has. Often times eroticizing the Queen and her mundane and bizarre daily routines with her bunnies and while eating, Abigail and Sarah begin to duel for Anne's love, doing whatever it takes to be her favourite.As it turns out, each woman is capable of much unpleasantness, not only to one another, themselves but also to the poor saps surrounding them. Manipulating every man, woman and child around them for their own personal gains; both in search of security, status and nobility, Abigail and Sarah turn the conventions of a chessboard on its head, and make the queens, rooks, bishops and knights all of their pawns in their sick and twisted little kinky game of pleasure.Attacking one another like vipers and wolves, jealousy becomes the weapon of choice for both women, who's use of men only intensifies their sadistic little game of mitral destruction and decay. Taking no prisoners, Abigail and Sarah create alliances, forms admirable teams with many of the men occupying the palace on a daily basis. Abigail learns quickly that her most valuable alliance is the head of parliamentary opposition Harley (Nicholas Hoult), despite his every opportunity to throw Abigail to the gutter. Although many of the men in The Favourite seem to hold their own against the two duelling cousins, it becomes clear with every ridiculous pastime that the men engage in, that the women, no matter how fragile or understated they are, truly hold the men in the palm of their hands. Where we see the men engaging in ludicrous activities of whipping food at each other while naked, duck races and ridiculous forms of dance, women are the only ones seen holding the guns, aiming and killing their prey and having their faces splattered with blood. The men in The Favourite are covered in make-up, wigs and fancy dress, while the women are stripped of their beauty and shown with the scars, bloody noses and battle wounds. Lathimos makes the gun range backyard the common area for Abigail and Sarah's verbal competitions, while the rest of the days, they leave their most valiant and best efforts on the line by exhausting the very people they claim to love.While the war against the French is always a constant plot within the castle, Lathimos and his talent crew uses the palace as a stomping ground for much haste and ugliness, never showcases physical battle rather the coyness and sneaky actions of each woman's slithering jabs. The trickery of each woman's constant blows are embellished in absolute pleasure thanks to the captivating fish-eye lens tracking shots of Robbie Ryan's camera. Shooting tracking shots from an ant's eye view, upside down, tilting and swinging the camera in every which way and direction, Ryan gives a sense of banishment and fleeting optics to a completely farce security in a castle where allegiance switch at the drop of a pin.The Favourite may very well be a perfect film and one of the most unexpected pleasures of 2018, but none of that would ring true if it wasn't for the performances of our three female leads. Constantly engaging in the moral destruction of one another's characteristics and pushing the limits physically, mentally and most of all, emotionally, our three leading ladies are at the top of their acting games, proving that the Academy may be in favour of royalty. Weisz is as cunning, sharp and ruthless as can be as a woman who utilizes history as a weapon towards establishing a future. Looking as sly as ever, Weisz is bound to be recognized for her performance that transform her soft eyes into sharp diamonds with razor-sharp edges. Stone, although she isn't singing or dancing, gives the best performance of her career, stripping down her clothing and girl-next door image for a woman capable of anything; including beating herself with a book and bloodying the battlefield of war. Stone's highly misunderstood pouted lips conceal her snake-like tongue and vicious bite. Yet, both women pale in comparison to Colman, an actress who has probably appeared in something you've watched before, but completely and unapologetically demands attention with Queen Anne's constant eccentricities. Whether dunked in mud, on the floor, covered in absurd make-up or having food hang from the very ends of her mouth, Colman gives a favourable performances that will no doubt take attention during the Awards Season and give new meaning the bondages of portraying a matriarchal Queen. Colman is nothing short of godly.Self-interest and selfishness is the goal and while casualties are expected, Yorgos Lathimos delivers one of the best movies of 2018. The Favourite favours bold acting, incomparable shooting styles, a magnificent score and one of the most unexpected and gruellingly enjoyable movie experiences of the year, and it asks for no apologies. One may be hard pressed to find something else within the year and may side with The Favourite, because Lathimos proves once again that the deconstruction of human values, is much more fun than building it up. Even though parents always avoid picking their favourites, when it comes to 2018, it'll be hard to choose a monstrous extravagance as good as this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A film that can't make up its mind.,"Despite stellar performances by the three lead actresses, this film doesn't seem to be able to decide whether it is a comedy, drama, satire, or relationship piece, and fails at trying to be all four.One other minor criticism, as one who assiduously pours over the credits, especially for certain production and music details, the credit graphics were absolutely the worst ever, and impossible to read.

There was a lot of ""oh, ah, ew, geez"" coming from the mouths of the other movie goers. If you are expecting a simple nice gentle movie about a queen then you will not like this movie.

Incredibly random viewing.,"I saw this during its original release, and walked out of the cinema feeling somewhat unimpressed, I waited some time before rewatching, and my review is based on my second viewing.The plus points, the visuals and acting. It looks incredible, the sets, costumes and general look of it are without fault, it looks fabulous, and is perhaps the best aspect.The acting is incredible, I am not surprised that Olivia Colman won a host of awards for her portrayal of the rather strange Queen. The supporting cast do a terrific job.The downside, I'm not sure if it's the script or the story itself, but it's actually quite an irritating watch, it feels very disjointed, her antics themselves are extreme, and there are a lot of them.What was done, was done incredibly well, it's one of those films that is definitely worth your time, worth it for the acting and visuals, but this isn't one you'll want to watch over and over.Worth seeing, 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Could Be Any Old Lesbian,"The Favourite is a lot of fun to watch. It has just the right blend of comedy, tension, and sadness. The performances are stellar, without question. Definitely worth watching. Just remember to overlook a few things: it has very little to do with the Queen of England. In other words, in the end, this could be a movie about any rich old lesbian who never really feels sure about the ""love"" given her by any young beautiful girl. Another thing that bothers me is that too much of the movie takes place in the queen's bedroom, giving the whole production a kind of stage-play feel. And since it feels like a stage-play, you expect sharper, more sparkling dialogue which, for the most part, is missing largely here. Good movie. But nothing to take away.",,Anonymous,Biography
Another notch on Lanthimos' bed post...,"The Favourite (2019), starting the year as I mean to go on.It's awkward when one of the first films released this year, turns out being on my top 20, last year 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' and this year apparently will be no different.Yorgos Lanthimos had created himself a hefty job to top either 'The Lobster' or 'The Killing Of A Sacred Deer', but he succeeds on all fronts making a deliciously hilarious and wildly unique experience (which will most likely go missed outside of the film community).As 'The Favourite' unfolds it reveals more than meets the eye. It is simply more than two people battling it out to win the affection of the Queen. Many subplots cause ripples in this story making a thoroughly enjoyable rollercoaster.I would be kidding myself if I said the strongest aspect to Lanthimos' newest feature wasn't himself. He continuously proves himself to be an outstanding director and a more than capable film maker. His films are always aggressively unique and feature admirable storytelling methods.The performances however cannot go unnoticed. I can finally release a huge sigh of relief as I can comfortably say Olivia Colman has finally managed to break onto the big screen with a leading role, which subsequently is one of her best. Her charm and wit does all the work and carries the film leaps and bounds. It goes without saying both Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone, are nothing short than exceptional also. The two share remarkable chemistry. All three leads are entrancing and deserve all the praise they seem to be getting.The structure of this, is told in almost as set of chapters, to a book, which marvellously breaks up the film and allows the scenes to have tonal and pacing variations without making it seem messy.'The Favourite' may be the first film of the year, but it may also be one of the best. Good luck to 2019 on topping this.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Absurdity at it's finest,"Yorgos has really outdone himself with this one. While watchers could hint that he had a special directors charisma, he leaves his own stamp in his movies. With the Lobster being one of the weirdest movies to date, I knew that this director had something in him. His unusual viewing angles could baffle some watchers and take some aesthetic away from the movie but that's not my case. The akwardly long close-ups bring more tension and confusion which leaves the watcher thinking. This movie is definitely not for everyone, but I think it's a setting stone for upcoming comedies and absurd movies to come",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
It's just not weird enough,"There are two things you expect when going to see a Yorgos Lanthimos film. One: that it will be visually appealing and two: that it will be strange to the point of absurdity. This film meets the first expectation with flying colors. It is without a doubt his best looking project to date but it falls short in terms of the second. It is almost a normal movie and that is not necessarily a bad thing, it was just unexpected. The problem comes from the story itself. The events that the film is based on are fascinating and the film does them justice but there is only so far you can take this story without completely betraying the history. Now, this is only conjecture but it's possible the increased budget came with the goal of making a film that appealed to a wider audience (the director's other films certainly not being for everyone). Anyway, it is not a bad film but it certainly leaves me with something to be desired.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Sumptuous, Sardonically Hilarious, Impeccably Acted","Best known for a film about forced therianthropy, director Yorgos Lanthimos has never been one to adhere to conventional rules of filmmaking. His latest piece is a perfect example of this, pitting its three note-perfect leads against each other in a gripping and witty triumvirate of female power-hunting.'The Favourite' is buoyed by the tightest script of 2018, as produced by AACTA-award winner Tony McNamara and newcomer Deborah Davis. Complete with vicious insults and pithy one-liners, the film often takes on an absurdist feel due to its quintessentially modern approach to the eighteenth century setting. While not a straight-set comedy, it is in many ways the perfect dramedy, using its finely-judged tone to forge a uniquely satirical period piece.The three central performances are each excellent and the actresses deserve every award they receive. The ever-fantastic Olivia Colman explores the bipolar and gluttonous depths to which she can take her character of Queen Anne, revelling in the attention she receives whilst a deep vein of tragedy simmers underneath. Rachel Weisz's character goes through a lot, and the acerbic wit she demonstrates calls out for her future inclusion in more comedic material. Stone is at her best here, displaying a Machiavellian moral ambiguity attitude in order to become the Queen's favourite. The interplay between the three is great fun to watch, and indicative of their effortless chemistry.The setting allows for some exquisite production and costume design. Technically, the film also boasts some fascinating explorations of cinematography from 'Slow West' DP Robbie Ryan. The frequent use of the fisheye lens creates a confined, claustrophic atmosphere which enables all the relevant parts of a given scene to be visible. Excluding the fitting collection of sweeping baroque music, there is no traditional score to speak of, and at times the minimalist soundtracking does become too jarring and overstays its welcome. There are a few too many such occasions (including the ending) which could have benefitted from a stern edit, but for the most part the film is refreshingly expeditious.Overall this is one of the year's strongest and wittiest films which is definitely worth taking the time to watch. With a trio of flawless acting performances, it is Lanthimos' finest work to date. 87/100",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Well-crafted but gross and depressing,"Sometimes we come up with a movie that is well-produced in terms of production, acting, directing and style. However, the story itself, the very core or the theme of it, is just absolutely pointless. This movie is one of those. Even worse, there are a lot of terrible things that I don't know why I was watching them for. I felt depressed afterward because the story is full of backstabbing, lesbian sex, hunger for power, pathetic characters, insincerity, and the most terrible one in my opinion....animal cruelty.If you are sensible and you choose movie that do give something more than entertainment, you should skip this one. It doesn't give any valuable points of view but just show wretchedness of humanity. There is no real love, no true loyalty, there are lots of meaningless violence and nudity.It was produced with style, with good performance from quality actresses, but that go to waste because once you watch it, the only point you get is ""humans are such dirty, heartless, stupid, violent and lustful, and cannot be trusted.""

Queen Anne's Revenge,"A phenomenal film, loved every second, acting was superb and the direction quirky, dark and constantly surprising.

Behind the scenes of Queen Anne's Kingdom,"Yorgos Lanthimos' latest production is a disturbing period drama telling us about the highly manipulative, insanely clever and cruel minds behind the doors of Queen Anne's kingdom.Olivia Coleman won the oscar for best actress for her performance as Queen Anne and once you see the film is is clear why, she shows every piece of the characters grief - her pain, her sadness, her anger, her confusion and her cruelty that she can burst out with in moments. A absoloutely brilliant performance.
Rachel Weisz plays Lady Sarah, the right-hand woman and advisor to the queen. She too demonstrated her excellent acting skills to show a person who is constantly thinking, constantly planning her next moves in order to always come out on top, she dominated every room she was in.
Emma Stone as Abigail Hill was something quite unexpected, starting off as a young and smart character who was fairly innocent yet underneith was just as calculating and as cruel as her co-stars. In her own words she is ""capable of much unpleasantness"".Every second of the film is filled with high amounts of tension, watching these three characters with eachother - all of them attempting to be the ultimate winner. Scraping and scratching at one another until the other two keel over or give up.

An absurd period piece that delivers in every way,"The Killing of a Sacred Deer was one of my favourites from 2017. Yorgos Lanthimos brought something new and fresh to that film that I truly admired. With The Favourite, I believe Lanthimos made something even better.The Favourite takes a look at Lady Sarah, Duchess of Malborough, and Abigail, a servant, who are both competing to become the favourite of Queen Anne.Knowing that this was made by Yorgos Lanthimos, I was expecting to see a very dark and weird film like The Killing of a Sacred Deer. However, The Favourite is a big departure from that. This film is essentially an 18th Century period piece and whilst it does contain the absurdity you would expect from a Lanthimos film, it works more as a satirical comedy. Whilst the film contains real life figures from the 18th Century, Lanthimos incorporates many artistic liberties to present this time period in a heightened reality. As bizarre as it may be, there is an obvious sense of mockery towards the time period and its figures. Lanthimos clearly understands this as there are many hilarious moments throughout utilising this very notion. It's the kind of dark humour that won't get everyone laughing but it certainly appealed to me.It's been a long time since I've seen such an interesting trio of characters. From Queen Anne to Lady Sarah and Abigail, each one of these characters are so well realised and I loved seeing the constant rivalry between Sarah and Abigail. From when we first see to how we perceive them by the end, there is so much change in terms of who we align ourselves with. I found myself constantly switching between the two as we learn and witness their actions and the meaning behind them. The portrayal of these two are marvellously done by Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone. Weisz is extraordinary as Sarah whilst Stone possibly gives her best performance as Abigail. There are many layers and reveals about both personalities that both these actresses convey extremely well. Caught in between the two is the frail Queen Anne, played by Olivia Colman in her best performance to date. She is absolutely hysterical yet tragic as we learn later on. The script is one of the best I've heard in some time. Not only is the dialogue rich but the characters are given so much depth and complexity which made the story so compelling to watch. These three actresses fully deserved their nominations and are a delight to watch.The acting and script aside, what Lanthimos also did incredibly well is recreate this era. As a period piece, the film shines in all the technical departments. From the intricately designed sets to the beautiful costume design and hair and makeup, The Favourite transported me into its heightened 18th Century world and immersed me into it fully. Not to forget how gorgeously lit scenes taking place in the dark were. The Favourite had me in awe of its beauty let alone the fantastic writing, direction and acting.What Yorgos Lanthimos achieved with The Favourite is outstanding. His films have such an absurd yet unique voice that I don't see with many directors. With The Favourite and The Killing of a Sacred Deer, he's slowly becoming one of my favourite directors working today.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not what I expected,"I absolutely loved the acting, especially Olivia Coleman's performance. Unfortunately, I expected a high-end period piece about Queen Anne, not a far-out, fictionalized dry comedy. I disliked how much fiction was inserted into this story - but that was just myself being 'off' in expectations. I suppose if one goes into this movie with different expectations, they would appreciate. I laughed out loud at the weird dance scene, tho it was one of many bizarre moments. The one-note, repetitive music score was also bizarre, and a little annoying, although it was appropriate for what I believe the director wanted you to feel. The fish-eye camera angles were... unnecessary? Maybe it is beyond my own tastes. I loved the costumes, and realistic makeup. (I can't stand it when period pieces show 21st century makeup trends. I assume what shows here is more realistic for the time and makeup quality.) At the end the of the movie, I did want more -- more of the real story. Thanks internet.

An Outright Brilliant Film,"No other period pieces come to mind when trying to find a comparison for 'The Favourite,' and even if there were, none would hold a candle to this 18th century tale of social scheming and palace politics.Director Yorgos Lanthimos previously caught the attention (and admiration) of art house audiences with 2015's 'The Lobster,' followed by last year's 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer.' However this film is different, and it will justifiably earn Lanthimos a spot at the table reserved for Hollywood's elite directors.The cast is outright brilliant. Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, Emma Stone, and Nicholas Hoult each deserve their own paragraph of praise. However, it is Colman who ultimately takes the cake for her performance (pun intended!). She looks to be the early front-runner for the Academy Award for Best Actress--a statement that is further bolstered by the fact that she just won that award category at the BAFTAs.Expect her official nomination come January ... along with a slew of other nominations covering just about every Oscar category.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"""This movie is weird.""","I see this comment over and over in other reviews for this movie and have to agree. It's weird. I watched a funny trailer for it which led me to expect a historical period drama/comedy. In fact, this goes overboard and it's a piece of period CAMP. Things that jarred me: the gratuitious use of profanity (what is this, 17th century ""Superbad""?), the corny dancing, the annoying single piano note key for background music, the incorporation of lesbian scenes ...wha..?? The insinuation that it had to be women manipulating each other through sex instead of honestly having non sexual affection and friendship with each other really made the movie disappointing. I mean, show some originality and make a modern play about these issues -don't besmirch history with your dirty mind. It's a self-indulgent la-la-land. The acting was good and the scenery and costumes were great. It wasn't terrible, but I'm glad I saw this movie for free instead of at the movie theater.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Theatrical in the most cinematic way,"This historical so called ""comedy drama"", which I consider a non term (at best I'd call it a drama with comic moments, but I actually consider this a historical satire about the politics and machinations of the British court). I don't care how exact are the historical details, I did check, and the basic historical drama depicted here did take place, and for me that's the only importent question - historically.Cinematically we get a story presented in a very theatrical style, pointing to the theatrics of politics, and of royal politics. But this theater is a very cinematic theater, we get a very nuanced performance of the three leads, nuances that would often be lost on the stage of theater. And we do get three leading roles here. All three are superb, and the fact that Olivia Colman is written down as the lead is arbitrary in my book. She might have a little more screen time than the other two, (one would have to check it with a stop watch to be certain), but plot wise, both Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone, are her equals, and Olivia Colman herself has acknowledged it more than once. And as I said , they're all amazing. And actually, this trio makes the movie. I mean, every aspect of movie making is done here at the highest level: cinematography, editing, soundtrack, lighting, - it's all here, but without this trio none of it would matter, they make this story come to life, and they make us care.One final point, I rated this movie 8 (bordering on 9), it could have been higher, if the point it was making was a bit less subtle. I feel that the final scene did make a point, but it was only half made, almost muted. And in my humble opinion it should have been a bit more forceful. Maybe thats the British understated way, but the rest of the story was fairly blunt, with the acting cast, and most of all the leading trio keeping it British. So I think, such a blunt story demands less subtlety at the finish line.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Some wounds do not close; I have many such. One just walks around with them and sometimes one can feel them filling with blood.,"The Favourite is directed by Yorgos Lanthimos and written by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara. It stars Olivia Colman, Rachael Weisz, Emma Stone, Faye Daveney, James Smith, Mark Gatiss, Willem Dalby and Nicholas Hoult.In early 18th century England, a frail Queen Anne (Colman) occupies the throne and her close friend, Lady Sarah (Weisz), governs the country in her stead. When a new servant, Abigail (Stone), arrives, her charm endears her to Sarah.A critical darling with awards and nominations to match, The Favourite, to me at least, is something of an acquired taste. Firstly it should be noted that as a history lesson it's pure bunkum, so much so I wondered if Lanthimos is actually Mel Gibson. Though to be fair to Lanthimos, he never hid from the fact he and his writers were pretty much making it up for entertainment purpose.The craft on show is top level, with three high quality lead lady performances giving their all for the director. Lanthimos also has some nifty camera tricks up his sleeve, it's clear that this is a talent to follow for those so inclined to his off kilter type of film making. Helps, too, that the costuming and set designs are also from the top draw. It's hard to fault from a production standpoint.Narratively the pic is pulsing with parliamentary politics that blends with royal shenanigans. Yet ultimately the prime concern is about the battle for Queen Anne's soul between Sarah and Abigail. This consistently remains fascinating, even as Lanthimos continues to sex things up and pitches black comedy alongside the tragic thrum at the core.It's an odd mix of a film that I personally don't think works as a whole, and with the finale a crushing disappointment, it leaves one in awe and yet also unsatisfied. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good acting, but...","Have to say that I am not disappointed, but neither excited with that what I saw today. For sure there is a very good acting, especially of Olivia Colman, whom I saw recently in one episode of ""Midsomer Murders"" tv series. That lady knows how to act. In some moments it is funny, in some heavy and surprising full of faster rhythm, but that with what I am not satisfied is ending. It is empty. Something is missing.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
The most conventional Lanthimos movie,"This movie is great fun. Women, while always lacking in their contributions to science or art or philosophy, were never absent from the realms of power, as queens and female prime ministers, sometimes hysterical, but often extremely cruel, are well known through history. This movie sheds some light on the intrigue and backstabbing dealings on the court of Queen Anne, and shows that when sociopathy is concerned, women have it all over men, and that evil potential has been cultivated on the British isles, to the benefit of the aristocratic and powerful yet de generate, and via the violent abuse of the Indian and countless other imperial and later shrunken UK subjects, since Anne to Victorian age to Margaret the iron witch. A quirky, fun and cynical look into the British court, through the wise Greek eyes. Excellent!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Dark and Fun.. tad too self important,"The Favourite's premise is too familiar to surprise us. However, it is always fun to watch women show the depth of their character and unbounded shrewdness in an archaic setting. Kudos to Yorgos Lanthimos on delivering a darkly entertaining story about power and it's twisted influence on human beings. It is made particularly enjoyable by the enthralling performance of the three lead actors. Olivia Colman's portrayal of Queen Anne is riveting. She flawlessly executes the role of a bitter queen pushed to circumstances and responsibilities for which she hadn't prepared. The cinematography fits perfectly the mood of the movie and helps the accentuate the emotions of those on screen. However, the film is not without flaw. The pacing seems uneven at places. The script in places does not seem to serve it's own purpose. I did not love the ending. The last 15 min seems wholly unimportant. But the final shot is powerful and something to hold out for. All in all, I had fun watching the movie and would recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Spectacular Acting,"What an interesting story about a Queen of England we seldom hear about. Very well done, although there were some uses of camera work that I found distracting.

Who is your favourite?,"The Favourite is about Queen Ann (Olivia Coleman) and Lady Sarah's (Rachel Weisz) relationship as they try to rule England. Queen Ann takes the position of the front figure whereas Lady Sarah is more in the shadows ruling through Ann. One day Emma Stone enters the castle playing the young wide-eyed maid named Abigail. A battle of power and cunning ensues between Sarah and Abigail as they fight for the Queen's attention and affection.The movie is directed by Yorgos Lanthimos a man known for a more wired kind of arthouse film. This movie is way more straightforward than his other films. His style is very vibrant, the colors pop in almost every scene. He also has a keen eye for framing and subtle storytelling. The music is insistent, always blasting through the scene impossible to miss, it's not as wild as in The Lobster, but it's still noticeable, it works wonders since it brings tension to seamless tensionless scenes breathing life into selective scenes.The only real problem is that it moves kind of slow which is not necessarily bad, but I did feel the last 15 minutes were a bit weak compared to the rest of the film. It feels like the movie spins its own wheel for a little bit too long.All the actors did a great job, and especially Rachel Weisz deserves credit as the cunning and at times ruthless Lady of the castle.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Favourite,"Queen Anne (Coleman) is ill and ineffective and so Lady Sarah (Weitz) essentially manages queen and country. That is until Abigail, a lady on hard times but with ambitions, arrives at the palace to compete with Sarah for the top spot.It is just so refreshing to see something so original, that is so near to a bizarre art house movie but remains so hugely accessible to us simple folk. The camera work and lighting is deeply strange but somehow seems right, the script is wonderful, with the humour jet black and laugh out loud funny and the supporting cast particularly Hoult all over the top but great fun. Key to all this though is the 3 leads. Weitz's role as the power behind the throne is the least flamboyant of the 3 but she is great in it demonstrating a determined and scary strength throughout. Stone's character is the real cornerstone of the plot and she's clearly having a whale of a time conning her way to the top. Finally there is Coleman as the queen, a women of power and a wrecked life, unable to rule anything. Coleman mixes sweetness and madness effortlessly whilst at the same time giving us most of big laughs - a superb performance.This is not for everyone and not for maiden aunts as they say - 'Victoria' it ain't, several people walked out of the screening I went to after 20 minutes leaving the rest of us to soak it all up and enjoy the razor sharp wit.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

There is no plot, a story, but no plot. One would think this hack of a director would have learned this in film school. I mean the rest of the film with its sophomoric over the top lens selections and transitions screamed ""look, I went to film school!"".

A twisted tale of royal monarchy gone bad,"Yorgos Lanthimos continues to be one of the most unique and dynamic filmmakers working today. In his latest film, Lanthimos engages the audience in 18th century royal British politics that is centered around three women. We have Queen Anne (Olivia Colman), the emotionally unstable and sensitive ruler of England who would rather spoil herself with treats and play with her pet rabbits then engage in any sort of politics. And by her side and constantly controlling her every decision is Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz). Cold, cynical and mean-spirited, Sarah makes sure the country runs the way she prefers by speaking on the behalf of the queen herself. And then comes in the final girl, Sarah's cousin Abigail who finds the Achille's heel in Anne and Sarah's relationship to exploit. As Sarah and Abigail go to war with each other for Anne's affection, it begins to have huge affect on the literal war that is going on with France.The dynamic chemistry between all three of the actresses and the engaging script by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara is what keeps you hooked in this heightened period piece. From the beginning, Weisz, Stone and Colman portray their characters in one way that you would seem straightforward but by the end your view on them turns a complete 180. Weizs's confidence and dry wit makes her character Sarah feels like a force of nature you want to avoid crossing. By contrast Stone's charm and humour shows her character Abigail as appearing sweet and you wanting to root for. However, once the table turn in the game of manipulation and favouritism, Weisz display vulnerability in Sarah and Stone expands her dramatic chops to the reveal the dark trickster that hides behind Abigail's sweet smile. However the most fully ranged performance is that of Colman. While Queen Anne seems written to be as comic relief at first, Colman gets to put on show of emotional depth that by contrast makes her feel more human then the rest of the royal over-the-top characters we meet. Colman's comedic time definitely does earn most of the laughs in a very dark and twisted story. However it's through her emotional performance that gives the Favourite a sense of humanity that would otherwise be lacking.Robbie Ryan's cinematography makes the Favourite visually stand apart from previous period piece dramas. The wide dynamic perspective shots make the character's interactions with each other feel like a you're removed from their presence because of their wealth and class status. The feeling of alienation from the shots is what helps it to sell its cold atmosphere. With close-ups of character's face the film then lets you get inside their heads to know where their minds and emotions are at in the moment. This then allows the story and its characters to be seen as being flawed but also honest and real.Like Lathimos's previous films The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Favourite is a film that will leave feeling very cold and disturbed but is definitely joy to watch three amazingly talented actresses to perform with and against each other.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Odd, meandering film enlivened by some great performances","I'm truly not sure what the point of THE FAVOURITE is...why was the movie made. Loosely based on the story of Queen Anne, but mostly an excuse to let three great actresses run wild with a saucy, witty script full of cutting one-liners (and some elaborate costumes).Olivia Coleman, plays the sad, pouting Queen Anne. Alone and having failed to produced any offspring who survived, she is winding down her days at monarch by remaining willfully out of touch with what's really going on in her kingdom, barking contradictory commands and generally just being unpleasant. Her backstory excuses much of her behavior, and Coleman makes her loneliness and sorrow quite palpable. Thanks goodness, because her character is very difficult to like.She does have one seeming bright spot, her relationship with her ""lady in waiting"" (Rachel Weisz). Weisz is a master of political machinations, and she has fully insinuated herself into Anne's life, providing companionship of all kinds and thus taking de facto control over much of the governing of the nation. The various lords and dignitaries who fawn around the queen understand who the real power broker is.Into this already complex political landscape comes the lowly Emma Stone. Given a job as a scullery maid, she quickly grabs notice of the queen and insinuates herself into the queen's good graces...to the dismay of Weisz. The two women engage in a hilarious high-stakes battle of wills. Each bounces in and out of favor with the queen. The court intrigue becomes quite thick.Watching these three women interact (aided by a juicy script) is the delight of the film. It is not a racous comedy...it requires careful attention to the words and the underlying meaning of those words. It certain reminds me of a Comedy of Manners from bygone centuries.Yet when it's all said and done...it seems to add up to less than the sum of its parts. It's so fun to watch, then ends rather abruptly and rather meaninglessly. It feels like a statement has been made about the dangers of mixing politics with matters of the heart...but can that really be all. That's hardly an eye-opening topic. The film just feels pointless beyond its own amusements. And insular world that we can laugh at, but draw nothing from. (Also, the sound mix for the film was not great...much of the dialogue was mushy and hard to hear. That's not good for such a wordy piece.)I certainly think the film is enjoyable to watch, and it certainly isn't boring (even if some of its themes play out one too many times). Weisz, Stone and (especially) Coleman, give it their all...clearly having a blast. Weisz seems almost to burst out of her role, she is so clearly relishing being able to let loose a little bit after so many roles as more reserved or tightly wound characters. But for all the fun I had, I was still let down at the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Sharp, Witty, and Visually Striking Period Drama","""The Favourite"" is a darkly comedic and visually stunning period drama that reinvents historical storytelling with its sharp wit, unconventional style, and outstanding performances. Yorgos Lanthimos crafts a film that feels both grand and intimate, blending political intrigue, power struggles, and biting humor in a way that keeps the audience captivated.The film's greatest strength lies in its phenomenal cast. Olivia Colman delivers an Oscar-winning performance as Queen Anne, portraying her with a mix of vulnerability, unpredictability, and tragic depth. Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz are equally brilliant, bringing layers of cunning, ambition, and desperation to their roles as they battle for the Queen's favor. Their chemistry and sharp exchanges make for an engaging power dynamic that shifts constantly, keeping the film unpredictable and thrilling.Visually, ""The Favourite"" is a masterpiece. The cinematography, with its wide-angle shots and dramatic lighting, creates a unique and immersive atmosphere. The costume design and lavish production values add to the film's authenticity, while the offbeat humor and modern sensibilities make it feel refreshingly bold for a period drama.While the film's slow pace and eccentric style may not be for everyone, its razor-sharp script, striking visuals, and powerhouse performances make it a standout.

"Too weird, confusing and pretentious","I was expecting better. The film has some bones to which a good movie could have been made. I believe in the 3 main actresses and the general idea for the story. The costumes and sets looked great.But a lot of the storytelling came off as pretentious, over the top, confusing, boring or dumb.I didn't understand the point to a lot of the movie and after reading some of the reviews, even the positive ones and ones with spoilers, it appears I'm not the only one who couldn't explain a lot of the movie.I agree with the common note that the music is annoying. There were a couple scenes where they replayed the same couple rhythmic notes over and over and over and over again. And it was to no obvious purpose unless their point was to piss me off and distract me. Dunkirk has some similar musicnear the beginning. But in Dunkirk it reflected the building tension of the scene and sped up. In the Favourite it felt like a poor imitation which didn't understand why it worked in Dunkirk.Most of the time the score was fine. But the 2 moments with the repeating rhythm were difficult to overlook.The use of fowl language and gratuity didn't bother me. But too often I couldn't understand the overall purpose or goal or insinuations of other moments. At times I wondered what exectly we were supposed to think was really going on. But given that at times the film wasn't afraid to gratuitously say what was going on, it made it rather difficult to suppose the less literal take on events was the justifiable presumption.Many of the wide fish-eye camera Angles were also distracting. And the pacing felt slow. I think more daringly odd choices typically work when they are added more subtly than what is seen in The Favourite.To put it simply: the style and content were too prevalent and confusing for me to sufficiently get invested in a good story or a good movie.

A modern day sordid sister to Barry Lyndon?,"Whilst I can see that the absurdity of Lanthimos' films might be too much for some to handle, I for one absolutely adored this film. Having watched and also very much enjoyed Poor Things, I'm not the least bit surprised to learn that Lanthimos also directed The Lobster.The Favourite provides the viewer with a fascinating exploration of the human psyche and the depths of depravity, the manipulative lengths to which they will stoop, and the motivations of what drives people to seek to obtain positions of power. It had more than a hint of another favourite film of mine, Kubrick's period masterpiece, Barry Lyndon.The film is as beautifully shot as it is expertly casted, with Colman, Stone and Weiss particularly stealing the show with outstanding performances. Additionally, it contains a sheer litany of hilariously quotable dialogue, packed to the brim with a level of acerbic dry wit that would cut deeper than the sharpest of blades. Whilst it might not be to everyone's taste judging from other reviews I've read, I thought it to be a truly remarkable film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great work that deserved a better ending,"Despite the criticisms made about the use of fisheye lenses in the film, this was one of my favorite elements of the film's look, in addition to the use of natural light, the vibrant nature of the visuals and the script with a language despite the formality, rich in humor, This dynamic between humor and drama in the clash between the characters, for me, is one of the best parts of the film, making it constantly unexpected. Despite this balance of several dishes, Yorgos makes it easy and accessible - rather than rigid and difficult to engage with.You see the nominations for best screenplay, best costumes, editing and cinematography among the TEN nominations that the film received and they are unquestionably the strongest elements of the film, with moments that combine these elements that constantly attract your attention because of how strange and fun It's for a period film.In terms of narrative, it is quite entertaining due to its balance of language and symbolism, as well as the twists and turns of the plot itself. All of this is well delivered by the three main actresses, who embrace this as much as the absurdity of some things and the way the film shows how Abigail and Lady Sarah behave with men, in addition to being charismatic, also shows their determination for a greater goal with an excellent contrast.Despite several qualities, the ending seems to be missing something, it appears that Yorgos needed to make a decision in the editing room to maintain the film's dynamics, but it leaves the feeling that something was missing at the end, despite having loved the final frame and how presents Lady Sarah.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Yorgos Lanthimos' Masterpiece.,"Rarely does a film feature in my mind quite as this one did, raring for weeks for its arrival. Yet in the futures stead, this may stand a the one to define this decade. A hail to the Lesbians, a cry for mastery, a perfection in comedy, a masterclass in drama and what brings a director from auteur to master.This film shall not be easily forgotten. I say this not lightly, but this possibly the best directed motion picture that I have ever seen. This is Yorgos Lanthimos' masterpiece, on par with the classics of bygone eras and delivering a new wave into the future of filmmaking. I believe for this film's influence to lay beyond one awards season, and be heard in the years to come, as two hours in which this enfolds is the greatest that film can be. It challenges normality, has strengths where others do not, and makes perfection of what it can.The narrative, from full picture perspective was perfect. Perfectly paced, and I have never seen a film balance it's tones so incredibly. How they say: 'You'll laugh and cry' - well I did, and by god did I love it. Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara's screenplay is the years best, without a shadow of a doubt I can say this. Its characterisation os a momentous achievement that will be subject a great many analysis in video and book. Their perfect act structure is one of great pleasure and uniqueness, for I suspect that this film play over not 3, but 4 acts. If one were to watch this feature, and pay attention to its screenplay's structure, I think others would suspect it to be this way. This is a peculiar number of acts, but it plays to this films strength, making it more engaging, though some may say the end drags on a bit, I found it to be to my personal liking.The direction of this film by the great Yorgos Lanthimos was his best, the years best, and among the best ever put to film. The best I have seen. His mastery over performances (Which I will get to later), over cinematography, over sound, over the physical look of the sets and costumes, it has his mark all over it. And by the day, does it come to fruition in an ablaze of glory. This film is distinct, yet its flavour its certainly more palatable than his other features, Lanthimos' strong flavour is unwavered in my opinion. While it is more accessible than his other films, it is simply more subliminal, that his fans would understand and normal visitors will not.The performances were simply astonishing. Olivia Colman as Queen Anne was the best performance I have seen from any actor or actress for the entire of the 2018 film season. Her performance is enough to see this film on its own, her character was tragic, hilarious, deeply troubled, and yet a frightening reflection of what could happen to anyone. 'Stalked by tragedy' is one way she is described, and while I will not quote historical facts which are spoilers, her character was far more compelling than I had expected her to be, thanks mostly to Colman's performance. Her acting prowess is surely on course for great honours in the weeks to come.Rachel Weisz was Sarah Churchill the Duchess of Marlborough, (Who is actually related to Winston Churchill), was incredible. Her characters command over scenes, even ones where she is in loss, cruelty or evil, is a control over the screen that is formidable and unforgettable. In particular the shooting scenes, the hot chocolate scene and her and Annes final scene (Not a spoiler), they were portrays of perfect chemistry, perfect acting, on levels that were scarcely see a few times a decade. Could there be anything more grand, more gorgeous than this performance, a perfect portrayal of all the worse sides of aristocracy, and of a manipulative friendship, one that is a vie for power, for control, to be the favourite.Emma Stone as Abigail Hill was I think, her best performance to date. Though it was only this films third best (in my opinion), it was etherial, stark, incredibly well layered and portrayed. The fact that it is only this films third best, as is still of such a level, goes to show the caliber of this feature. I found for her portrayal of arrogance to be the part to discern the most from the others, but truly this is an amazing performance.The rest of the cast was also stellar. Nicolas Hoult in particular was a welcome addition, as well as the rabbits. The rabbits represented so much more than cuteness and cuddliness, they were love, fear, hate, depression, gout, and a cruel past all rolled up into little bundles of fun. This film wouldn't be the same without the rabbits.The Cinematography was astounding to say the least. I had heard that cinematography Robbie Ryan had stated that Yorgos Lanthimos was basically the director of photography. And this does show, its his mark which is most present, in its sweeping left to right turns, and specific colour palette (Mostly browns and greys in this feature) it is pure Lanthimos, as most of his films follow a two colour palette in most of their composition. The use of natural light was also well chosen, highlighting light and dark, the duality of people, very excellent things most normal viewers do not notice on first viewing. The shot design was unique, more so than other Lanthimos films. The use of Panavision super-wide shots was great, really fun. And his signature angulation of not showing faces is toned down in this film, but is modified in certain ways and is just as strong and unique as his other films.The set design was remarkable, mostly shot at and Hatfield House, it feels more immersive than any other film set in this period. Everything felt real, despite the small budget. The costumes, just give them an oscar. They were easily the years best, and I would say on the level of the best this side of 2000. On the level of The Lord Of The Rings, they never faltered, and were highly suited, pure eye candy. The makeup and hairstyling were also of the highest quality, also the years best. They were messy, fun, outrageous, immersive, all the marks they aimed for were hit. a perfect shot, not a beat missed. These factors all weighed in, especially the wigs and 'Badger' looking makeup are what historically sold the time period, as well as supplementing the narrative, setting the greatest backdrop for Lanthimos' direction.The Sound was also a notable factor. Rather more immersive than I had imagined, ever book thrown, tea cup set, and step taken is accounted for. Adding to eeriness, love, endearingness and fear of every scene. Also it subliminally sets one into he film more comfortable, making one notice their own surroundings less, it was highly clever and well executed.On the weaker side, there was a momentarily feeling I had during the first act that it wasn't all clicking together as well as I had though, however by 20 minute this feeling had passed. Especially since this film has perhaps the strongest second act in the film this side of 2000. Many contemporary films weaken and lose pace in the second acts, but this actually maintains it's trajectory more strongly than anything made during my own life time (That I have seen).Finally, in the end: This was, I can say with confidence,the best film of the year. Everything, as a final product, fitted together so supremely. This is one for the history books and sets Yorgos Lanthimos' name into stone. For its portrayal of love is so intimate, and truthful, yet subliminal and as all lanthimos features do, sets more questions than it answers. It is now down to the viewers to decide what they thought of its questions, and in that, it is true cinematic perfection. Also classic Lanthimos weird dancing is present, which is always a treat. 5/5",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Authentic and polished but often ponderous and puzzling,"The acting performances of the three female leads Olivia, Rachel and Emma are engaging and impressive along with Nicholas Hoult who nails his part superbly. Hatfield House is showcased very well albeit the entire film seems to have been shot in one week of very overcast and bleak weather between the death of Daffodils and the first flowering of Wisteria during the coldest Spring on record. The drab light adds a wonderful authenticity to the lighting which seems either genuinely natural or candle lit. The costume design is very well done from the peasant and servant garb through to the gentry fineries. Sadly this is neither the Madness of King George nor the Draughtsman's Contract as it becomes ponderous and at times dull while it dawdles to its puzzling and unsatisfying conclusion. It's the first 15A film that I ever knowingly attended. Your average accompanied 15 year old might not thank you for stealing 2 hours and 1 minute of their youthful lifespan.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Lanthimos is too good for Hollywood,"I'm glad people are finally seeing the appeal of Greek auteur Yorgos Lanthimos. His The Lobster only got a Best Screenplay nomination in 2017, Dogtooth was loved by some, and The Killing of a Sacred Deer went relatively unnoticed. Now we have The Favourite, a ""deliciously nasty satire"" with more Oscar nominations than I could ever expect of a film of such distinct vision.Its characters bizarre and/or pitiful like only Lanthimos knows how and its comedy delightfully cruel, The Favourite also excels at production design, costuming, and photography. Lanthimos' presentation and keen eye for detail have been likened to the works of Stanley Kubrick and this is his Barry Lyndon, not only in terms of its authentic appearance.In the year 1708, Queen Anne of Britain (Olivia Colman) is an absolute wreck, clearly unable to deal with the responsibilities of queenhood. At her side, and running the country whilst she is busy watching duck races and feasting, is Duchess Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz), also secretly the queen's lover. Sarah's down-on-her-luck cousin Abigail (Emma Stone, who has been called ""menacing"" in the role) arrives to work as a maid in Anne's court, eventually getting closer, much closer, to the queen and thus her lost nobility. Who shall be the queen's favourite?As you'd imagine, the relationship between these three women is what fuels the film; there is as much love and sexuality going on as there is concentrated hate and jealousy. But Lanthimos has skillfully directed the supporting cast as well, including a beautifully foppish Nicholas Hoult as the scheming 1st Earl of Oxford. There are also bunnies, and lots of them.The acting is nonetheless spectacular. I know not why Weisz and Stone are considered Actresses in Supporting Roles (one of these days I need to get my hands on the Academy's rule sheet), as they seem at least as important and brilliant as Olivia Colman, but at least one win is certain. Also recognized is the screenplay (though my vote for this category may ultimately go to First Reformed), and Lanthimos winning Best Director could happen if Cuarón gets unlucky this time.And of course, it wouldn't be a just world (not that we necessarily live in such a place) if The Favourite wasn't also nominated for its striking camera work (by Robbie Ryan), convincing costumes, and authentic production design. Almost every shot in The Favourite resembles a painting from the century the film depicts. Like the costumes and sets of the aforementioned Barry Lyndon, everything feels lived-in and never comes off as fake.Much of this is thanks to costume designer Sandy Powell (previously nominated for Carol and Hugo) and production designers Fiona Crombie and Alice Felton. But as others have observed, this may also be Lanthimos' most accessible and relatable film to date, heavy on timeless anxieties and emotions to which many a viewer can connect, though perhaps particularly women. It isn't as quirkily robotic as his previous movies, but his eccentric nature thankfully remains intact in some way.Really, The Favourite has just about everything (I didn't even mention the classical, often wonderfully disturbing music). I'm just so glad Yorgos Lanthimos exists, okay? Even if he's too good for Hollywood.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Engaging, well paced and well acted","When I looked at the list of the Best Picture nominees at the Academy Awards this year I immediately spotted 'The Favourite' as the one I was least looking forward to seeing. I'm not a big fan of period pieces and neither the cast nor film-maker garnered much interest from me. As it turns out I was wrong to single this one out. It is a middling film on the list. Certainly not the best, however certainly not the worst either. I was surprised at how engaged I found myself with the story. The pacing too, while not lightning quick, did just enough to always keep me focused and looking forward to what was coming next.Three actresses from this film have been nominated for acting awards. Olivia Colman for Actress in Leading Role and Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone for Actresses in a Supporting Role (despite them both probably having equal or even more screen time than Colman?). Colman was pretty darn good I'd have to admit. She plays utterly miserable very well I'd have to say (that may be all I've ever seen her play come to think of it). It's hard to see her getting the nod though as she was never given one big scene to blow everyone away. Supporting Actress is usually a very weak category so with performances as strong as Stone's and Weisz' I would usually have said they had a great chance of winning. Unfortunately for them the category is slightly stronger than usual this year though and so I can't see them getting the nod either.As for Best Picture, again I see it coming up short. While the film is good for what it is, it isn't going to be to everyone's liking. All a film can do is succeed at what it sets out to, however that isn't always enough to win an Oscar unfortunately. I loved that the film had an R rating. It added so many layers to the characters and made for a much more fun viewing experience.

Impactful.,"Yorgos Lanthimos is a unique filmmaker and he proves this film after film. His style is surrounded by ethereal and almost surreal passages, unconventional and somewhat unorthodox storytelling, distinctive camera techniques that allude to certain narrative moments in film. For example, the use of fish-eye lenses in The Favourite, which brings a distorted image of the protagonists, leading to the notion of emotional instability and disruptiveness. The film counts with three leading ladies, all of whom are exceptionally brilliant in their performances, specially Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz (her portrayal gave me chills). The acting definitely feels much more vivid and much less monotonous in comparison to Lanthimos' previous films such as The Lobster, which makes it more accessible for people unfamiliar with his work. Having said that, The Favourite still contains elements that may cause casual viewers to shy away from this effort, most notably its dark humour, its remarkable use of natural light, along with meticulous photographic compositions that inevitably make The Favourite a painstakingly elaborate feature, an artistical product that even with that ultra-careful attention to composition details can make unfamiliar spectators feel uneasy and slightly disturbed.That is how Lanthimos' film aesthetic works, he uses any element at his reach to provoke and disturb filmgoers, and he achieves this with this film, although to a much lesser extent than his previous works. Undoubtedly this has had mixed opinions, and with absolute reason, but I have to add, that to understand pretty much every aspect of this film (dialogue, acting, camera movements; lenses; techniques, aesthetic, themes) you have to be a bit familiar with the director's work, so that you won't easily disregard this film for its unusual approach, because I'm sure most viewers would expect a simple take on a period piece, but this is much more than that, so much more. And do you know why? His name is Yorgos Lanthimos.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Innovative, Very Impressive","I'm not a Yorgos Lanthimos fan. I've seen his previous films and I've either loathed them or didn't agree with them entirely. Sometime he's just a provocateur adding ""edgy"" scenes to every movie without really thinking about the plot. This time I was utterly impressed. There's a frenzy about him in my country (Greece) I went to 3 different movie theaters to find a ticket. Well made, beautifully shot. A movie that you will be thinking for days. The leads are astonishing. I was mostly impressed with Emma Stone.

Totally absorbing,"Well researched historical fact, skillfully enhanced with fiction when necessary timewise to emphasise the development of attitudes and relationships, and the odd surreal sequence, make a fascinating blend that provided me with two hours rapt enjoyment. Not only is the acting faultless but the decor and costumes facilitated my travel to a time when the European Royal Courts were claustrophobic capsules of opulence idleness and decadence. We are only thirty years or so on from the Restoration and the Court of the Merry Monarch Charles II. Morals were lax, language was sexually explicit, encouraged and practiced by the King himself. The young bucks of that era were now in late middle age - the types of weird practices portrayed in the film were common.at Anne's Court.Lanthimos is clearly in love with his characters. His cameras dwell long moments in close up on their motionless faces. A free spirit, he will leap out of period to provoke extreme emotional response. Without giving anything away, we have hip hop/dirty dancing to provoke jealousy, unarmed combat skills to illustrate dominance in courtship. These surreal sequences are hilarious..I cannot speak too highly of the performances of the three main characters. Olivia Colman as the Queen handles the complex character and sudden changes of mood as totally believable - imperious without ever losing the air of vulnerability and fear of isolation. Rachel Weisz as Sarah is impressively dominant, hugely self confident until everything suddenly changes for her - beautifully handled. Emma Stone is quite ravishing as Abigail - I stood by her even at her most dastardly! The lesbian activity? It certainly heightens the tension and there is historical documentation that there were suspicions voiced that both affairs actually took place..I have rarely felt so sorry to see the titles rolling after two fleeting hours, not because the end was not clear - the message was there for all to see - but because I just wanted this film to go on and on...",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent Period Black Comedy,"Having just been to watch The Favourite today, I think it would be of value to remind myself of an all too important definition... Black comedy, also referred to as Dark comedy, is a style of comedy that makes light of subject matter that is generally considered taboo, particularly subjects that are normally considered serious or painful to discuss. Often used as a tool for exploring vulgar issues, thus provoking discomfort and serious thought as well as amusement in their audience.The Favourite indeed fulfils this definition consistently and delivers accurately and handsomely what was promised by the script. A period costume drama movie like no other. For some reason, Kubrick's Barry Lyndon came to mind whilst watching The Favourite. Mad, unsettling and with quite a liberated approach for the depicted period of Queen Anne's reign in England, Scotland, Ireland and then united as Great Britain. Not the mainstream average period drama by any means and that is exactly its subtle beauty that will without doubt be mistaken by some who will hurry to condemn the movie and award single star ratings. Coleman, Weisz and Stone deliver a top form performance as the female gender takes the central roles.The wide angle/fish-eye cinematography and the lowered camera angle add to the overall opulence, making the three protagonists stand out grandiose. I loved the movie and hope Yorgos Lanthimos brings more of these unconventional movies to our screens. Finally, I watched the movie in a UK cinema with the majority, if not all, of the audience being in the senior age group. No reaction, no laughter! Oscar Wilde came to mind with one of his famous quotes: Nothing is so aggravating than calmness.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
An aquired taste...,"... but Lanthimos has always been so. The Favourite will be appealing for those who can appreciate his abstract sense of humor, film snobbs and film critics - not the mainstream audience. The actors are an appealing bunch, dressed beautifully but swearing like sailors. There are a few good chuckles to be had, no more, and the movie is a tad bit too long.
So, if you know what you are getting into or if you love arthouse movies, by all means see it. If you are more of a ""Pride and Prejudice"" type of person, this is not for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant in every way,"This film is an absolute stunner in its settings, costumes, music and above all the acting. Its brilliance was literal as multiple candles glittered and flickered in the gloom of a pre- electric world, while the brilliance of the three women at the heart of the power struggle was outstanding. The men came off second best in this even though they actually held the power. I cannot recommend it highly enough to anyone who appreciates the genius of film making. It never lost pace throughout and was daring in its use of long held closeups of the actors, who seemed to revel in their chance to give us an insight into their inner worlds. It reminded me of Barry Lyndon in the recreation of a period world without losing sight of people's essential humanity, warts and all.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The less authorial Yorgos film delights in its technical and artistic quality.,"""A Favorite"" Director Yorgos Lathinos' new film is his least authorial feature, we missed some of the tense script with numb logic and theatrical performances but we gained something more mature and focused without losing his classic soundtrack and sublime camera use. And that just proves that Yorgos is a great director, because even though he's fleeing from his comfort zone, ""A Favorite"" impresses with technical and artistic issues and consolidates as one of the best films of 2018, in my opinion.
""The Favorite"" succeeds in being an uncompromising empowerment film, from non-boring romance to non-monotonous thriller and non-boring comedy, a blend of genres scripted by Deborah Dean and Tony McNamara that works perfectly in the hands of the talented Greek director. We do not have a high moral or a great dilemma, we have only the history of two women surrounding the Queen of England for power or comfort.
The two women in question are played by Emma Stone, Rachel Weisz and Queen Olivia Colman and James Smith form one of the best performance quartets I have ever seen in a movie. Emma Stone, after winning the Oscar is light and loose, and shows all her artistic ability interpreting multiple facets and feelings making a captivating and disguised character, Rachel Weisz makes a character mature, cold, her performance scares and impresses by the intrinsic violence, and calls more attention if we pull the story of Rachel with characters who are usually ""Bobinhos"". Olivia Colman plays the most broken character in all, a woman with social and health problems, with a great power in her hand but clumsy intelligence, an exquisite performance that requires an artistic and physical delivery, and lastly, James Smith, the most discreet of all, but his character is fundamental to architect the plots between the trio, in addition to a convincing, funny and cunning performance.
Yorgos uses his cameras, he likes, many against plongee, fish eyes, medium and closed planes, with lots of natural light and a composition of simply perfect scene, added to a great costum, hair and makeup we have a direction of art that borders perfection and very similar to the perfect art direction of ""Barry Lyndon"", but that reinforcement, is still better thanks to the director's frameworks. Something that remains of Yorgos's classic signature is its incidental soundtrack that matches the film.
The division of the film into mini chapters is not a good choice, it makes the rhythm of the long regret a lot, it is like extending the two hours, and that in the practical sense, it makes no difference, since the acts of the film are well defined. ""A Favorita"" is a great film, with the very technical and artistic aspect that puts Yorgos Lanthimos in the big showcase of Hollywood.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Favourite is so odd that you'll either love it or hate it. It's characters and relationships make it good,"In any high-pressure position (political, business, entertainment, etc...), power is the most addictive drug anyone can succumb to. Most can tell that once your at the top of something, it's hard to imagine your life before that or after. It really has to do with that subconscious instinct in which all people want to feel important. Once they do become important, it's scary for them to think that no one would want to listen anymore. They have more authority and can feel like a king in their own domain. So the longer they retain that power, the harder it becomes to accept should they lose it.Today's movie deals with a interesting situation involving three people that are addicted to power; one who is starting from the bottom, one whose been at the top for a while, and another at the top whose mental state is becoming worse. Putting two together is bad enough, but a third one can only create chaos. The situation happened more often then not in a monarch, especially an older one. For the situation within The Favourite, we find a mad queen, her lesbian lover, and a woman who sees potential in a declining crazy person.It's the early eighteenth century where Brittan is at war with France. Queen Anne (played by Olivia Colman) is suffering physical ailments and is losing her interest in politics in favor of wealthy parties and caring for her seventeen rabbits, which also represent her seventeen children that have passed on. Because of her disconnect with parliament, her confidant and lover Sarah Churchill (played by Rachel Weisz) has so much influence that she pretty much runs the country from ideas she passes onto the queen. At the same time, a new state tax is initiated from a landowner Robert Harley (played by Nicholas Hoult) that proves to be unpopular with the rest of parliament.One way, Sarah's younger cousin Abigail Hill (played by Emma Stone) arrives in the queens court for a job. Abigail once came from a baron family, but lost it when her father lost her in a gamble. She's hired to work as a scullery maid, but ends up winning the queens approval when she offers herbs that soothe pain from gout. Abigail becomes the queens lady-in-waiting and soon learns about the affair between Anne and Sarah. It becomes a power game when the younger cousin starts to gain a friendship with the queen while Sarah's power is challenged.The Favourite is the kind of movie that is the example of divisive. People are either going to like this or hate it. I personally liked it enough to say that it works more as a comedy then a historical retelling. The historical aspect is good, but ill get to that in a bit. The reason this works is because of the characters and the relationships their a part of.This is a movie that belongs to all three of the main stars; Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, and Emma Stone. I'm not sure how accurate everything was, but these feel like oddball, but dangerous people I could see within government. Olivia hits the points of carrying a lot of nobility and worsening mental state, yet never leaning too far to one side. Rachel Weisz is great as a serial manipulator whose had years of experience pulling off the job. And of course, Emma Stone is one of the better two-facers I've seen in cinema; playing herself as delicate when she needs to be, and then back stabbing the next. Her performance is almost on par with Scarlet in Gone With the Wind.As far as the movie goes, this is where people are going to come at a crossroads. Director Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster) knows how to make the palaces and costumes feel big with the constant use of wide angles and fisheye shots. In fact, there isn't too much use of movement, even though everything still feels fluid. This is either going to pull people into the story or detract them. It can sometimes be a little distracting as it does try to be more ""artsy"" then it needs to be.I'll give this seven racing ducks out of ten. The Favourite fits in the same category of Baroque historical movies like Barry Lyndon and Amadeus. It's clear that a mainstream audience isn't going to be as invested as they would for a blockbuster. But that's why I give this more credit; it knows it's audience it's trying to reach. If your hungry for power and a more oddball royalty movie then your used to, then check it out.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Based on the real Queen Anne, early 1700s, a fine first half but the second half falls apart.","My wife and I watched this movie at home on DVD from our public library. Its greatest claim to fame is Olivia Colman, who plays Queen Anne, just recently was awarded the Oscar for best actress.It seems to be a mostly fact-based glimpse into the later years of Anne, sickly and overweight, often confined to a wheelchair. A new worker comes to her residence and there arises a competition for the Queen's affection.We pretty well enjoyed the first half of the movie, it sets everything up nicely and shows the great contrast between the royalty and their entourage, enjoying themselves at home, while husbands are on the front lines fighting the French. As the movie gets closer to its conclusion the story doesn't hold up, and when it ends we are left wondering, ""What is the symbolism of all the rabbits running around the Queen's bedroom?""The movie also uses some interesting, but sometimes annoying background music. And the extensive use of fisheye lenses for many shots becomes disconcerting. When the viewer starts to focus on the filming technique then it ceases to be a useful approach.I am glad we saw it, but I came away with a great degree of dissatisfaction.",,Anonymous,Biography

The Favourite is sure to be a favourite.,"It's kind of a sad tale about power. And what you'll to do to get it/keep it. And none of the characters are very likable. If I had to pick one, I would say that I sympathized with Queen Anne the most. It's clear everyone is using her for their own gain. Yes, I do think that Sarah genuinely enjoyed her company, but she also was using her. She was practically Queen except in name. Wouldnt let Anne make any decisions for herself. Abigail used her to raise her status. The government was using and manipulating her to get what they want in terms of the war and taxes. However, the end scene really cements that Anne was also awful and proves her ""power"" to Abigail. Sarah and Abigail are constantly trying to one up each other, like they're just not very nice people. But that doesnt bother me really because its such an interesting story. And its quite witty. Sometimes, it does delve a bit into the pretentious category. Certainly with the ""Acts"", but it was enjoyable nonetheless. I could have done with the fish eye cameras though.

It is very unlikely that poor Queen Anne after 17 miscarriages and wracked by disease had the energy, or desire to carry on two torrid lesbian love. Also she was reputed to be a woman of conventional morals.By the way her husband Prince George was still around and lived with his wife, Where was he when all this was going on?Also Sarah's husband Marlborough had strong politcal opposition, but he after the ""events"" depicted in the film he did manage to build Blenheim Palace, the ancestral Churchill home, Alright maybe no-one cares about 18th century history, but this is just modern trash attempting to normalize a cynical hyper sexualized Hollywood world view . I'm just tired of it no matter how pretty the package is.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A darkly humorous spin on the period drama,"With Olivia Colman set to follow on from Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth in the third season of The Crown, it seems a satisfying coincidence that Yorgos Lanthimos' latest film The Favourite sees the actress take on the role of another monarch. The Crown may be the dictionary definition of period drama, but The Favourite is a very different affair, a tantalising twist on what often promises to be a dull sub-genre.
Here, Colman stars as Anne, the last Stuart queen ""stalked by tragedy"", ravaged by gout and depression, with her pet rabbits her only solace. She has passed on the keys of power to her closest confidant and secret lover, Lady Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz), but all is turned on its head with the arrival of Abigail Hill (Emma Stone) a once noblewoman whose family has fallen on hard times. As Abigail surprisingly gains the favour of the Queen, so begins a ruthless battle that plays out before our eyes in a particularly captivating power struggle between the three women.
The Favourite is an enthralling film; Lady Sarah and Abigail turn loyalty into an increasingly vicious blood sport, making for a narrative littered with gratifying double-crossing, carnal intensity and stylish brutality, all accompanied by an almost illusionary sense of madness. It can only be defined as a tragicomedy, subtly hilarious yet hiding timely subtext that is delightfully ambiguous. The lines between love and deception are expertly blurred in a film that takes no prisoners in its uproarious execution. There is more deliberation in the overblown final act, however, that feels lengthy and distinctly less focused than the rest of the film.
The movie finds its greatest strength in its stellar cast, led by Colman, Stone and Weisz. Colman is outstanding as Anne, hilariously petulant and childlike, reminiscent of Miranda Richardson's Queenie in Blackadder. There's a blunt imperiousness to Colman's performance that carries the film through with black humour. Beyond this, however, the scenes of greatest emotional resonance are those that show the more tragic side of Anne, as a woman who has lost seventeen children (""Some were born in blood, some without breath and some were with me a very brief time"") and has never recovered from the trauma. Colman breezes through these harsher scenes that cut surprisingly deep and help to give the film a greater purpose.
Rachel Weisz is the epitome of calculated steeliness as Lady Sarah and Emma Stone is pitch perfect in her first period role as the opportunistic and marvellously Machiavellian Abigail. Nicholas Hoult's flamboyant Leader of the Opposition leads several foppish male roles, but these lie clearly in the peripheral; Yorgos Lanthimos makes apparent that the film's sole focus is its women, all of whom are callous, yet vulnerable, but all quite brilliant in different ways.
The Favourite is beautifully designed, lavish costumes by Sandy Powell and a regal set giving the film all the expected grandeur of a period drama. The film's more salacious side, however, is shown in Robbie Ryan's absurdist cinematography which, whilst occasionally pretentious, gives a haunting contemporary spin. I was less of a fan of the wide-angled bend shots, as well as the film's soundtrack (from Handel to the itchy modernism of Anna Meredith), which felt invasive and ceaseless.
Here, Yorgos Lanthimos has struck a fine chord. The Favourite is a wonderfully unusual and unsettling film that is at points gratuitous, but generally audacious and exciting. Spellbinding performances and an intriguing story make this not one to miss out on.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Nothing really happens, ever!","I think this is a general critic i have for Lanthimos. Most of his films feel like an ""absurd"" scene from a Luis Bunuel film. Yes the production is luxurius, the scenes, the camera work are beautiful, money is never the issue, especially with his latest work but there is zero evolution. The premises are set, the characters, if you can call them that, never develop and after the first 20-30 minutes in the film, we just have to wait for it to end. Also he doesn't seem to have any ability to evoke emotion with his films, either on screen with his character's acting or with his writting, adaptation. His characters are more like empty shirts, moving in front of the camera not unlike Zombies would. Most of the time i feel i am watching a practical joke stretched in length. Initially i get hooked by the premise but it always end up in boredom. I believe his films sound better when you describe them than what when they ""play out'. That is a big weakness for a director. Anyway visually the favorite feels like a mix between Kubrick's odysssey and Barry Lyndon. This is not the first time i've noticed Kubrick's ""presense"" in Lanthimos films. The sacred deer was also very Kubrick-esque and really i am ok with that, had it been an interesting film to watch. The rating is more for the production values, than the essense of it. I still need to watch Poor things (i've watched all of his other work) but i am not expecting much. Once someone ""tells"" you who he is, there are not many suprises. A cold joke told baddly whilst having an expensive dinner.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Opulent savagery and wicked fun,"Yorgos Lanthimos is the very definition of chaotic good. His films are disturbing, shockingly violent, outrageously humorous and eerily allegorical to ongoing political and socioeconomic turmoil. His most recent film, The Favourite, is no exception.The Favourite tells the tale of Queen Anne, the early 18th century monarch of England at a time ravaged by war, and her wavering relationships between Lady Sarah and Abigail as they fight to win over her affection and favor.I remember reading a quote from someone that said Lanthimos' films are very akin to a horrific car accident: ""you can't avert your eyes from it."" While The Favourite is surely no exception, it differs from the rest of Lanthimos' filmography in that, while there is still a sense of outrageousness and frivolous absurdity, there is an obvious metaphor at the core of the story.The film is about power, specificially amongst women during a period in history known for the achievements of men. Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) acts as the queen's consultant and closest friend, a relationship that is put into trial when Abigail (Emma Stone), a young woman whose family has fallen on hard times, attempts to work her way up the political ladder. The entire duration of the film shows these women manipulating, deceiving, and brutally brawling with each other to win the affections of the queen but they both have different reasons for it. Abigail, who is rebuilding herself after being gambled away by her father, wants to be on top because she understands what it's like to have nothing. Lady Sarah wants to maintain her loving relationship with the queen, but also wants to continue to play with the big dogs in the court.The film cleverly outlines how out-of-the-loop the queen was in terms of the ongoing politics of the country. ""The war is over. We won,"" she contends to Lady Sarah after awarding her her own palace. ""Oh, but it is not over. We must continue,"" Sarah responds with a sense of determination. ""Oh. Oh, I did not know that."" And the film follows through with this on just about every issue. It's certainly not entirely the queen's fault, however. She was ailing with physical and emotional pain, and was known to be despondent and unstable. Olivia Colman's portrayal of the decrepitude queen is masterfully commanding and darkly comedic; she perfectly captures the spirit and troubled soul of Anne. The two contending women, Sarah and Abigail, are portrayed by their respective actresses in a hilarious and horrifying way. We lose ourselves in their battle of the wits and not once does the film ever stop to justify their actions as having the best intentions. Nor does it ever try to paint them in glorified canvas. These are simply terrible, power-hungry people who will stop at no means to obtain or maintain their statuses. This is achieved by the excellent screenplay.This is perhaps the most finely-tuned script that Lanthimos has adapted into film; it is also the first that he did not have a hand in writing (Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara are to blame for this slanderous entertainment). But, I think his attention and pertinence to a story he did not write pays off incredibly well because the end result is a film so ravished by opulent savagery and decadent deliciousness that it is endlessly fun and shocking at every turn.
Another thing that I found interesting was the direction. Yorgo Lanthimos has never really experimented with the camera on his previous films; sure, he's done a lot with negative space in his shots and the drab, neutral coloring of the cinematography has always worked in his favor. Here, he gives us a glimpse of a classical time through the eyes of the beholder.The use of fish-eye lenses in certain shots are jarring and grab your attention, and they do so to show us just how overtly glamorous everything is. The immensity of the palace is compressed into this tight, claustrophobic space within the lens as a sort-of metaphor for how the excessive extravagance substitutes the vacancies at the core of the royalty. Love is not truly felt, but the allure of power is.The Favourite is easily Lanthimos' best film to date. It is hilarious, gorgeous, and disturbingly exhilarating. Every turn is unknown and unpredictable in a way that only Lanthimos can fully capture. The Favourite will surely be a favo(u)rite for the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Garbage,A tragic waste of two hours that I will never get back.,1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Godawful direction saved by superb performances,"The first thing that strikes one once the story begins is how ""peculiar"" the direction is. Like a film student just out of college who needs to learn that tricks. fish eye lenses, weird camera angles and fancy flourishes are totally unnecessary and merely distract from telling the story. This viewer's reaction was that the director needs to go back to film school to learn how to direct. The second thing that becomes blatantly obvious is that the director is neither American or British (without actually knowing that he is Greek). The directing style is simply odd and leaves one wondering how much better this movie could have been with a more traditional storyteller. Obviously such an off the wall director is instantly embraced as a critic's darling, which kicks the mass audience's appreciation to the curb. What saves this movie is the superb performances from the three supremely talented actresses, all at the top of their form. A lurid script, needlessly peppered with the most graphic four letter words, is saved by the fascinating story and the onscreen battle between all three actresses. Olivia Colman gives an Oscar worthy performance and it would be hard to choose between Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz for best supporting actress. All in all this is an enthralling story that really kicks into action in the third act, when the director stops directing and just allows the actresses to do their work. No question this movie will be nominated for a bunch of Oscars but the tiresome distraction of the director who needs to stop drawing attention to his peculiar style (look at me, look at me, I'm the star of this movie!) would be the least deserved. No question it's going to happen as the critics love him. Oh well, at least we have the fine performances of three wonderful leading ladies.",,Anonymous,Biography

A wonderful depiction of the powerplays inside a royal court,"This period piece focusses on Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) of Great Britain's latter days, in the early 1700. Her frailty leads to her governing role and responsibilities largely being taken over by a friend Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz). The royal applecart gets well and truly upset when a new servant, Abigail (Emma Stone) comes to court. Sarah helps Abigail find her feet at the court, where her former aristocratic position in society assists her blossoming friendship with the Queen. The interplay of these three characters, all brilliantly portrayed is the heart of the film, and one where the outcome really is more than the sum of the parts.I wasn't familiar with Queen Anne (except as the inspiration for furniture legs) and so it opened new ground, both politically but also socially in the implied lesbian relationships between the three women.One thing this period drama gets correct that so many do not is the lighting. At night, the film is dark, really dark, with a few spluttering candles, lamps and firelight. It makes the intrigue of dark corners and whispered secrets come to life.Olivia Colman won that year's Oscar for Leading Actress, which I suppose she deserved, but I would have found it hard to say which of the three main characters was the lead and which were supporting roles.
It sets a high bar for this film genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
'Oh it is fun to be Queen sometimes!',"Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos has directed dance videos, television commercials, music videos, short films, theater plays and a few movies. He has a strange view of history and finds the secrets and bad habits of 18th century England under the brief rule of the gouty, slightly mad (in the film's stance) Queen Anne and with the screenplay by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara we have an entirely unique view of England's royalty and court manners (or lack of them).The production company offers a rather clean overview of the ""story"" - 'Early 18th century. England is at war with the French. Nevertheless, duck racing and pineapple eating are thriving. A frail Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) occupies the throne and her close friend Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) governs the country in her stead while tending to Anne's ill health and mercurial temper. When a new servant Abigail (Emma Stone) arrives, her charm endears her to Sarah. Sarah takes Abigail under her wing and Abigail sees a chance at a return to her aristocratic roots. As the politics of war become quite time consuming for Sarah, Abigail steps into the breach to fill in as the Queen's companion. Their burgeoning friendship gives her a chance to fulfill her ambitions and she will not let woman, man, politics or rabbit stand in her way.'What actually happens on the screen is naughty, spicy, indulgent and colorful X-rated survey of the sexually discordant reign of Queen Anne. Not only is there excessive raw language (were those words even in the vocabulary in the 18th century?) and considerable acting out of various forms of sensual release and nudity, but the pace is spinning, accompanied by an at times unbearably raucous 'musical score' (except for the actual insertion of classical tunes) by Komeil S. Hosseini. Granted, Olivia Colman has the work's version of Queen Anne down pat, including the post CVA weakness in her left side at film's end, and both Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz make their strange roles credible (well...?...). They are supported by James Smith as Godolphin, Nicholas Hoult as Harley and Joe Alwyn as Masham, as well as some of the most beautiful castle interiors - in lush color and bizarre lens distortion - on film.The film feels much longer than two hours, but then the time spent on the sexual proclivities maintains a strange sort of voyeurism-type attention. A funky look at Olde England...Oscar worthy?, meh...",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
This is one polarising movie and a masterpiece!,"I know my rating says 8 stars right now but I probably will change into 9 or 10 stars. I always check if I understood everything and thought about it enough.The movie is absolutely unconventionel and this is one thing to make movies interesting. ""The Favourite"" is splits people into those who want to see Jane Austen story and got disappointed/don't understand/regret watching the movie and those who recognize this is a special movie with much depth and love how film makers surprise with progressive ways of film making. The second one got it right. The fact that people only go to see cinema to watch what the expect shows that they don't understand how art progresses. This is sad for the critics of the movies but also goo because people will talk about the movie.
The characters of the movies a well defined and surprising in the way they change, the atmosphere is very tight and matches perfectly, and these 3 actresses were just great. Emma Stone never acted better before and convinced me into seeing her as a real artistic actress who can do much more than I thought she could. The other actresses weren't such a surprise but did a beautiful, fantastic job. But I knew they are good before I watched the movie.
I would recommend people who are not familiar with progressive movies to starts informing about symbols and interpretation of them. I can imagine those movies are hell on earth when don't get anything. I recommend it to the rest!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

It's not really a comedy, it's not really a biography and it doesn't really have an ending.

A film for fans of Yorgos Lanthimos. Not one for the casual moviegoer,"Yorgos Lanthimos makes films that could almost be their own genre: the plot is odd, the scenes are beautiful. These are films not meant for a general, popcorn-munching audience; the films could be described as ""out there."" What we see here recently happening is the director breaking into the mainstream crowd via award buzz. This film should most definitely be viewed by those who have seen and enjoyed his previous work in The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Deer. If you hated those movies, you'll certainly dislike this one; it falls into that same genre.But for those who did enjoy the two aforementioned films, this movie is worth the watch. I'd recommend going into this one knowing as little about the plot as possible. You can tell so much work was put into the film, and it's interesting to see where the film zigs and zags throughout the two hour runtime.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Viewers pay to be reprimanded for enjoying the first two-thirds of the film,"As I left the theater I realized I had just been punished in the end by the director/writers of ""The Favourite"" for earlier laughing at/with their own depictions of royalty and royalty wannabes squabbling and performing cruel acts on each other in their one-up efforts. The ending section is clearly meant to throw viewers into a last-minute depression and sadness for the awfulness of it all after about 2 hours of romping in the sometimes darkly silly childishness of human behavior. It didn't sit well with me, but it will with some others, and that's fine. It's a ""life lesson"" film, then, disguised as a darkly comic romp (trailers for the film are particularly deceptive in making it seem a full-on comedy). Again, fine, but I'd learned this lesson long ago in life, and didn't enjoy the fact I'd spent money to eventually be preached to, in a quietly withering way, that I should feel bad for laughing earlier. The film is admittedly well-made and acted, but it's ultimately a true downer, and depressing as hell.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Worth the investment,"It, admittedly, took me a bit of time to get into the cadence of this movie. This is not unusual with many period pieces. But, once I got into the rhythm, this movie unfurled into a truly interesting, cinematic experience. I believe, that if you were looking for a standard, by-the-numbers, period piece, you will probably be disappointed. However, if you keep an open mind, you will be rewarded with a superb, mildly disjoined, slightly absurdist experience. This movie reeks of the reality of life during these times. I'm guessing it was a dirty, grimy, almost lawless place and time to live. The acting and writing were (as many have noted) outstanding. Even the oft-times strange soundtrack worked in the general context of the movie. I would NOT recommend this movie to most of the people I know who are wowed by the Marvel gang and phony-baloney slasher movies.

The Vidiot Reviews....,"The FavouriteThe best thing about being friends with the queen is using your selfies to counterfeit money.Unfortunately, to make their fortune the royal besties in this dramedy must swing.Disgraced Baroness Abigail Masham (Emma Stone) arrives at the court of Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) in hopes of finding work. With help from her cousin Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz), the queen's current consort, Abigail becomes a servant. But after discovering a secret about her kin and the Queen, Abigail attempts to reclaim her station by dethroning Sara as Anne's favourite.While it presents a quirky take on the unsubstantiated relationship between the three parties during Britain's 1703 conflict with France, this stylish and well-acted biography vacillates too much between upper crust laughs, lurid encounters and political intrigue; never lingering long enough at either to feel authentic.Moreover, if the Queen is using chambermaids to please herself what's the point of the Beefeaters?

I won't simplify the plot to avoid spoilers but it really didn't justify a 2 hour film.

Fearsome Femme Three,"After so many films about Elizabeth I, it's interesting to see Queen Anne at the centre of things in this, the latest in a genre of stylised recreations of the Eighteenth Century such as 'The Draughtsman's Contract' and 'Ridicule' which drool over the costumes (Sandy Powell does her usual magnificent job here when let loose on a bygone era) and decor while happily confronting the more squalid aspects of Eighteenth Century life, such as Queen Anne's gout.The constant fussy use of steadicam and fisheye lenses (plainly originally inspired by Kubrick's 'Barrie Lyndon') fortunately doesn't detract from the absorbing and sometimes amusing machinations between the fearsome sapphic triumvirate of Oscar-winning Olivia Colman as the Queen literally on her last legs, saturnine Rachel Weisz and lynx-eyed schemer Emma Stone.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A striking and considerably ""artsy"" film.","What. The. Favourite. For those of us watching all of this year's Best Picture nominees, The Favourite (2018) is certainly the token ""artsy"" film of the set. It felt like it was following in the footsteps of last year's Phantom Thread (2017) in that the set decoration and costume design were exquisite, despite the-let's face it-weird characters. Regarding the plot, though, I did find The Favourite to parallel the events in the 1950 Best Picture winner, All About Eve. While its art is on full display for all to see, The Favourite is a bit more than how it looks.Aside from the aforementioned set decoration and costume design, I have to applaud this movie's cinematography. I'd wager that it'll win in these three categories, but the cinematography stands out because it's so different from most films. Heavily utilizing wide-angle fisheye lenses, as well as copious amounts of natural light (perhaps as an aesthetic homage to Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (1975), which also shares a somewhat similar plot), the continual movement of the camera is both brilliant and jarring. This accentuates the awkward and uncomfortable situations these characters put themselves in for the duration.While The Favourite is pretty to look at, the characters and their interactions reveal the true ""artsy"" elements of the film. From tons of lesbian overtones to odd actions and dialogue that is distinctly modern in its vulgarity, some moments definitely made me cringe. All that being said, the nuance and subtlety of the actors' fantastic performances allowed so much to be said without uttering a word. The Favourite excels in the ""show, don't tell"" mentality by also including many parallels and realizations that nothing has changed for these characters. Fortunately, moments of levity, especially with Nicholas Hoult's character, help to keep this movie from getting too dark.A striking and considerably ""artsy"" film, I give The Favourite 4.0 stars out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Not usually my thing, but I enjoyed this one","Period dramas have been popularised of late by the likes of 'Downton Abbey' and 'Call the Midwife', and while personally period pieces aren't my cup of tea and I've never been particularly interested in watching them on TV, I was drawn to watching 'The Favourite'.

'The Favourite' does a good job at appealing to more than just the typical 'Downton Abbey' fan audience, which is probably down to the fact that it is surprisingly funny and the lead characters deliver entertaining performances.

A unique period-drama let down by its plodding pacing and under-developed characters.,"'The Favourite' is somewhat of a mixed-bag. It certainly tries to do something different with the 'period-drama', and Lanthimos' distinct style and the fantastic performances are evidently what makes it distinct. It is also clear, however, that this is the first time in which Lanthimos isn't directing his own screenplay. In terms of the narrative, this definitely isn't Lanthimos fair and this is what really lets the film down. It's never exactly boring, but you are also never really fully invested in the story and, overall, the piece feels extremely long. The core conflict between the three lead characters doesn't seem to have a lot of development, either, and it's hard to really care about them much. Sure, there are a few good scenes that explore the character of Queen Anne deeper, but I felt that, in a picture that really relies on the relationships between its core players, they are only glimpses of what should have been. Personally, I don't think that the humour really landed and this is likely something that limited my engagement in the film - it is a 'black comedy' after all - yet in my screening there were quite a lot of belly laughs, so I suppose if the humour works for you, then the film will be much more successful. Luckily, despite the weak characters and plodding pacing, Lanthimos and the cast keep it from being bad. It's definitely not my favourite Lanthimos film, but it makes for a unique 'period piece'. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Unrewarding and wastes good opportunities,"This is not my favourite film. Apparently it's a comedy, but I found it unrewarding and not funny at all. Though perhaps superficially true to the historical facts, it's completely lacking in depth and only ""nods"" towards its historical background. The War of the Spanish Succession (1701-14) is a backdrop to the film but, absurdly, seems the only public issue in the reign of Queen Anne (Olivia Coleman).True, there was a triangular relationship between Anne, Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz) and Abigail Hill, later Baroness Masham (Emma Stone). However, there seems to be no evidence of a real lesbian relationship between Anne and Abigail, just an allegation by Sarah - who according to evidence could be cold, bossy and vengeful.The film makes Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford & Earl Mortimer (Nicholas Hoult), look effete and rather effeminate, but he was in fact effectively Anne's First Minister from 1711 to her death in 1714.The historical figures are, then, pretty crudely drawn. Anne is often caricatured in the film. She seems to have had quite a hard life, with serious ailments - especially gout, which the film doesn't treat seriously - and, as she mentions herself, she lost 17 children. She's also portrayed as prone to alarming mood swings and pompous behaviour, e.g. by exclaiming ""I am The Queen"" and ordering Abigail only to speak when spoken to. No one would know from this film that she was deeply religious.The portrayal of Anne reminded me of George III in Alan Bennett's film and the lesbian faded soap actress ""Sister George"", both in much better dramas. Perhaps ""The Favourite"" is a film in which ""The Madness of King George"" meets ""The Killing of Sister George"".""The Favourite"" wastes some good opportunities. As it's based on real events, it should have exploited them in some detail. At least I found the leading actresses' performances very powerful and was impressed by the film's lighting, which suggests how much an interior depended on natural light from outside. The sound track, however, is rather strange: in a couple of early and late scenes there's a noise like a siren. Some of the dialogue (leaving expletives aside) sounded far more 21st-century than 18th.Queen Anne would make quite an interesting subject for a serious film. She has a pivotal place in British history, as the last Stuart monarch and the daughter of this country's last Catholic monarch, James II. Parts of her biography could be interwoven on film with scenes from her personal life based on reliable sources.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

Study about the human condition wrapped in a gorgeous looking period piece,"It seems, by all accounts, at least in a cinematic way, that this new year is getting off to a brilliant start. This movie is a jewel, and not only in the visual sense, but also screenplay wise. A study of how fickle, unpredictable and mean, human nature can be, hasn't been put to the screen with such attention to grousome detail in quiet some time. Helped by a magnificent script, spot on cast and gorgeous cinematography, this is one the best movies I've seen this year and according to sources, it promises to get better and better. Lanthimos uses witty, ironic and often abusive language to portray a series of characters and an era, that was well known for cultivating an appetite for the excessive. Not one character in this movie escapes unscathed and the visual style and cinematography, remind me very much of another masterpiece, Kubrick's Barry Lyndon. See it with an open mind. It'll blow you away. Mesmerizing.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Yorgos, please come home!","I have witnessed how the careers of non-American filmmakers who were once nonconformist, critical and rebellious, changed when they received awards from Los Angeles, New York and, to a lesser extent, European film festivals. I am not questioning the awards, for I believe that when someone deserves a prize, it is fair to grant it. The unfortunate thing is that, to guarantee a position in the factory of mainstream cinema, some filmmakers who previously questioned the bad side of ""what is established"", become submissive and conformist when they receive Oscars, Globes and other awards; others lose the strength of their radical positions, while a few renounce the cultural force that their first films had, which were made in their homelands.Two illustrative cases are those of Spaniard Pedro Almodóvar and Mexican Alfonso Cuarón. In the first case, although the man from La Mancha preserves the ""Spanish cultural brand"" that has made his cinema always attractive, his recent films conform to a catalog of common places in melodrama, applauded by a group of moviegoers who never saw his imperfect and corrosive, passionate and exemplary cinema that he made in the 1980s. Then there is Cuarón, the traveler who, from his applauded debut in Mexico jumped to Hollywood, to little princesses, Harry Potter and Dickens, recovering his original cultural stamp each time he returns to Mexico, although «Roma», his 2018 movie, shows him as an orchestrator of an excessively elaborate exercise for the Netflix era. Both men are talented and know their trade, there is no doubt about it, but from «Matador« to «Hable con ella» there is an abyss, similar to that between «Sólo con tu pareja» and «Gravity».Now the ""evil eye"" has touched Greek Yorgos Lanthimos. Here the transformation breaks one's heart. He even poses differently for the photos now: from those, in which the daring novice appeared in the projections of «Dogtooth», to those of Yorgos 2019, it has rained a lot. He already directed Kidman, Farrell, Weisz, because he also has talent and know his trade, of course... If in the next installment of the Oscars to 2018 films, I had to choose between Cuarón and Lanthimos for the Best Direction award, I would give the prize to the Athenian.It is true that «The Favourite» is the kind of costume piece that the British have been making for centuries with their eyes closed. They are perfectly assembled, resplendent and cold, whoever makes them, including Taiwanese Ang Lee. This version, however, is more passionate, Mediterranean and some features of the Lanthimos of «Dogtooth» and «Alps» persist, as postmodern licenses in language, in a few scenes such as dance, and in the use of music. It also has three performers at the peak of the acting profession (Emma Stone, Rachel Weisz and Olivia Colman) to illustrate this historic portrait of the struggle for power, tinged with eroticism and opportunism. The stories of women in love have always sold a lot. Both men and women lose their composure with an erotic triangle of women, especially when one is Queen Anne of England with her sufferings of gout.And, yes, concessions to fashion are welcome to develop a career in the West and guarantee a job. But the court intrigues extended for two long hours... and I, at least, could not help thinking ""Pity of Yorgos ...!"" A fact, in my opinion, very important to take into account: unlike his four previous features (""The Lobster"" and ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"", in addition to the two already mentioned), this was not written by Lanthimos and his co-writer Efthymis Filippou. It is a pity.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

One of the best period pieces ever made,"I had to drive ninety miles to see this in an art theater in a wealthy part of a city, but it was well worth it. I absolutely loved this movie, from start to finish. It's a period piece the director took seriously. Lighting during the day and night seems authentic, characters try to speak as they did back in the early 1700s as well as carry on with the mannerisms. Actors are all solid, the studio didn't force the director to cast actors that can't act and fit in with the time period. Think of the egregious casting of Channing Tatum in ""The Eagle"", set in Ancient Rome. That was so close to being a great movie. It was tragic. Everyone around him tried to play the part, except Channing, who probably never had even heard of Ancient Rome when he first showed up on set. Sets are all detailed and gorgeous to take in, the music is authentic, nothing modern to be heard at any point.It's an British movie that isn't stuffy. It's set among the rich and powerful yet gritty and realistic. Rachel Weisz and Olivia Colman definitely should be considered for Oscars for their performances. Emma Stone, Nicholas Hoult and Joe Alwyn also do a stupendous job that should warrant recognition.My one complaint lies with the trailer. That's why I took one star off. AMC advertised this movie constantly for months. Initially, I thought it was awful and that I would never see it because it was so weird and offbeat. Then it grew on me, literally around the 6th time I saw it. I guess I was brainwashed. Sad to say, they took all of the funniest, wittiest parts, pivotal scenes and put it in the trailers and clips released online. The scenes are not out of context either, it plays out in the movie exactly like it was edited into the trailer. What on Earth were the people behind the trailer thinking? It's not like this movie lacked filler scenes that would have sold the film just as well! So beware, if you have not seen the trailer but are interested in the film, do not watch it. The last trailer that was about as bad and revealing was the infamous Terminator Genisys trailer. Hollywood, please stop doing this!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A wow, what the heck kinda film","The Favorite was something I didn't expect. I expected a period drama with eerie elements of revenge, but what was brought to the table blew my expectations away. I was given a multi-tiered masterpiece highlighting sexuality and hierarchy, and everything in between.
First of all, the costumes, cinematography, and the casting was very well done. The camera took a rather unique perspective, and definitely kept my interest throughout the entire film. Unfamiliar with most of the actors in the film, I enjoyed the chemistry between them and the truly comedic moments brought by each individual talents.
The overall plot was wild in itself, there would be moments where you had no idea what was happening but still were expected to believe it as a legitimate part of the story. It was incredibly unique, to say the least.

A Trio of Great Performances Overcome the Flaws,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A good, not great, period drama due to the director's excessive style.JIM'S REVIEW: I must admit that filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos has never been one of my favorite directors. While his films have a visually acuity that is distinctively his own, they lack strong storytelling. His initial premise is always intriguing, but his over-intellectualizing, convoluted plotting, and third act ambiguous endings never satisfy. (The Lobster (2016) told a story of two people forced to find love in a dystopian sci-fi world or they would shape-shift into an animal. The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017) is a film where a father must decide which of his family members he must kill in order to save the others from otherworldly forces.) His trademark use of off-kilter camera angles, music scores that resemble sound installations, and remote characters caught in dire situations are all present in his latest endeavor too. The Favourite is another example that less would have been more.Yet, this film has become a critical darling and is garnering many accolades. (Even this reviewer's expectations were high, though inaccurate due to a movie trailer that stressed the farcical aspects of the film and portrayed the movie as a comedy...It is not.) But it is an improvement on the director's resume of arty films and at least he is going in a more positive direction by reining in some (not all) of his excessive touches. (Actually, the film would have been quite successful had it been directed as a farce allowing it to be humorous in spirit and cattier in tone. That would have been a far more entertaining moviegoing experience.)The story goes like this: Lady Abigail (Emma Stone, very good in the role) wants her place in aristocracy. New to the royal court, she is a cunning ambitious wannabe who craves fame, fortune, and, most importantly, power. Her arch rival is a woman just as cruel and demanding, her cousin, Lady Sarah Churchill (a winning Rachel Weisz) who is firmly entrenched in all the decision-making in the House of Stuart. These ladies-in-waitings scheme and battle to gain control of the court. They rely on the manipulation and oneupmanship of a very unstable Queen Anne (a magnificent Olivia Colman), whose physical health and mental issues cloud her judgement.While the film is flawed, it does have a trio of wonderful performances which enhance the film greatly. The political and sexual intrigue may be the crux of the film but it is these actresses that punch up the drama. They create memorable characters as they deliver their lines with verve and delicious venom. Particularly moving is Ms. Colman who takes this mad queen into areas of unexpected pathos and vulnerability, from a screaming harpy to a tragic solitary figure with all of her mercurial mood swings.The screenplay by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara has pithy one-liners and depicts a court on the brink of disarray and corruption. Although I was always involved by the plot and its rich characters, the film allows the intricate hierarchy of the palace household and their quirky and strange behaviors to unfold, albeit too slow-paced for my taste.Mr. Lanthimos stages his drawing-room set pieces with much skill, filling the screen with gorgeous costuming from Sandy Powell and a stunning production design achieved by Fiona Crombie. Still the director relies on too much theatrics with the overuse of anachronistic fisheye photography and an annoying modern-sounding score with snippets of loud classical music that interferes with all the sumptuous period atmosphere. These overindulgences become a major misstep in a film that held great promise...and again, there is that third act denouncement faux pas once more that undercuts the storytelling.The Favourite plays like a comedy of ill manners without much comedy. Yet it is technically accomplished filmmaking with much to admire. It also boasts some of the best acting this year. Yet with all of this talent, the film is still in search of a story better told.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing movie that demands a thing or two from the viewer,"The acting as well as the dialogue is outstanding. Every line has depth and the witty dialogue moves the movie forward. The soundtrack was, in my opinion, quite annoying sometimes but I can see the reason for choosing it. It gets you tense and adds to the dark development of the characters. I also enjoy the ending, since it's not the usual and expected Angelo-Saxon ending (everyone lives happily ever after and people being divided into good or bad).All in all, this is a witty and twisted story. If you're into an ordinary movie with an ordinary ending, and do not like lesbian love nor cursing, then maybe the new Mary Poppins movie is more suitable for you.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Needy women can be favorites,"The movie The Favourite directed by Yorgos Lanthimos (think often of his movie The killing of a sacred Deer) is extremely interesting and tells the story of Queen Anne(excellent acting by Olivia Colman) and her reign and relationships with women between 1707 -1714. Loss of 17 children and Queen Anne's moments of depression, despair and helplessness and attachment to her bunnies are shown very well. Lady Sarah , a married woman (superb Rachel Weisz) and her discipline in learning politics and showing true love, caring and compassion for physically frail and mentally sad Queen Anne are great. And then comes Abigail, simple , nice and loving (my favorite Emma Stone) as a maid but desires to be treated and live like a lady because she knows she is a lady. But then Abigail realizes being nice would never get her what she desires. Abigail becomes hateful and evil and causes lot of pain to Lady Sarah. When Abigail sheds a tear and the scene when she tramples upon one of 17 bunnies is very touching. Terrific movie and I am glad I saw this 119 minute movie . Music is great and the cinematography is very pleasing. Definite Oscars. Emma Stone is nice, childish, graceful, kind, rude, mean and cruel as Abigail. Great acting by Emma Stone. Terrific acting by Olivia Colman as someone in power, rich, depressed, sad, needy, affectionate, afraid to be alone, lonesome . Oscar worthy.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Direction Masterclass,"Ever since ""Dogtooth"" Lanthimos has steadily been creating cinematic experiences which seem exceptionally innovative, highly provocative and extremely interesting. Until now, however, his somewhat minimalist preferences, coupled with his Orwellian scripts, seemed to limit his direction to cold, impersonal scenes, that were more suggestive of what was missing rather than what was being shown on screen. Ironically, this feeling was perfectly captured on the movie poster of the Lobster, depicting a man hugging a empty space in the shape of a human.
Until now.
Leaving behind his close scriptwriter and collaborator, mr Fillipou, and working on a period piece instead of a sci-fi allegory, Lanthimos the director has decided to show up -probably for the first time- and to prove that his work of genius is not reliant upon his usual themes: in the Favourite, he creates a claustrophobic movie, set inside a vast palace of breathtaking beauty and natural colors, constructed by a symphony of magnificent shots. The camera work in this movie is for the ages. The cinematography is as bold (if not bolder) than Barry Lyndon. The actors deliver top performances with a ""scent"" of Lanthimos's usual impersonal flair. And the music is an integral part of the overall experience.
This is a master class in film direction.
Lanthimos is precise, to the point, daring, innovative, and extremely consistent in every scene.
With the exception of the (deliberate?) vagueness of the last shot, which deviates from the Kubrickian accuracy of all other scenes, this movie is exceptional, to say the least.
It deserves all the praise it gets.
It elevates Lanthimos to the status of one of the great directors of our time, with a vision of pure cinematic genius.
And it delivers a passionate story, told in a way that can only be said by a cast and crew of exceptional artists, all of them in perfect sync and at the top of their game.
This is almost certainly the best period movie since Amadeus, and possibly the most beautifully directed period movie since Barry Lyndon.
In my humble opinion, this is without any doubt not only the best directed movie of the year, but also one of the best directed movies of the 21st century.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Female apocalypse!,"In a year like 2018, in which the cinema has produced tons of rubbish, a film that I saw yesterday has appeared and refuted the saying that there is nothing new under the sun .Presumably, historical dramas and biographies are always inflated and overburdened with surpluses that I have always tried to escape.
It is incredibly rare for a film to be as accessible and honest as it is in the case with The Favourite. I remember two other similar movies that attracted me over the years and left a trace in my personal notebook, Orlando (1992) and Marie Antoinette (2006). They played with naturalism without exaggerating with unnecessary details in the historical context. Of course, along with The Favourite, they are all delving into another different surface, which we will be talking about in this review.So let's focus on the film by George Lanthimos, who has so far become known for The Killing of the Sacred Deer (2017) and The Lobster (2015). The story is quite simple but multi-layered. Lesbian-queen with unpredictable temper (Olivia Colman) has a mistress Lady Sara (Rachel Wise) who actually manages the court and state affairs at moments when the queen is incapable of doing so. As we notice these moments are way too many because the queen is almost absent from being a head of state. Abigail (Emma Stone), Lady Sara's cousin, appears in the court trying to regain her lost title and reputation. She uses every single chance to win the Queen on her side.The film is divided into eight parts, each of which contains a quotation from the subsequent dialogue.There is something extremely introvert in the movie, despite the use of a fisheye lens and the incredible shooting angles. Olivia Colman gives Queen Anna maximum human dimensions. Here she stands in front of us without makeup, mask, grounded and exposed to godlessness. This is a woman without a desire for life, suffering from bulimia, gout, and the only thing that keeps her alive are the rabbits and her lover's company.Abigail gradually pushes away her cousin from the favourite's throne , settling herself closely to Anna and then marries Lord Samuel Marsham, rewarding her with the needed honor and cementing her reputation.The Favourite is a female apocalypse, a female kingdom and a female matrix in which men are only present as small figurines. This is a crazy but real story in which everyone is using each other. The genre is difficult to define because the pendulum sways between black comedy, love story, historical drama, and a thriller game of cat and mouse. All these segments are totally deconstructed and sent to you, so that you can then assemble them personally in your own head. That's why I like such films because there are no solutions here, but there is an eccentric, inspirational and dimensional vision in a tragicomedy. Tragicomedy is a genre that stretches the action from all possible angles of psychology, and gives the context a certainty and credibility.
Each character at one time is duplicitous, but faithful, manipulative, but also trusting. Visual aesthetics extracts Baroque and renders it on the screen, inhabiting it with animalistic and raw characters. The dialogue is brutal. C.nt and f.ck are widely used and this is only a plus for the film, because the human history is shown without idealisation and romanticising.The incredible soundtrack with lots of Bach and Handel, and as well modern experimental compositions of Messiaen and Ferrari, filters and dozes the splendour and glamour, and that's what, of course, every real movie needs.Costumes, and oh, surprise but! the incredibly English accent of Emma Stone (who is from Massachusetts) is raising the bar high (even) over Hollywood level, and that (for sure) will be noticed and generously rewarded by the Academy.I have read a lot of criticism of how the film is missing an end. Nothing like that!No one needs an end, only modestly shaped souls, which necessarily require an explanation of a historical fiction so that they can fall asleep quietly. In this line of thoughts, the film is not at all calm and quiet and will remain forever in you. Precisely with this open end.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Why is the Music So Loud?,"I'm still trying to get through this film and it's entertaining so far however the score volume is SO LOUD to the point of being crass sometimes.

Just toned down a little bit would have made this picture so much better. Stop it.

I loved this film,"It is clear from the huge number of very low rated reviews on here that many people hated this film. I guess there was never a better example of the way some films can divide opinion because there are also many high rated reviews although not as many it has to be said.
I am very definitely in the 'loved it' camp. I thought the three female lead performances were absolutely brilliant, the cinematography, costumes, soundtrack, locations, script and directing were all first class. From start to finish I found it original, funny, and also, at times, quite sad. The interplay between the two protagonists was beautifully played.
I know we can't all like the same things but I genuinely don't get the amount of vitriol that has been poured into some of the negative reviews on here.

"If you love history, and satire, you will love this film","Reading the reviews for this movie, I am shocked that none of the writers seem to get the tremendous level of political satire imbedded in this story. This film has two levels. The first is about the decadence of royalty in British history. The second is about the situation in our political world today. These two ideas are put together like the layers of an omelette. You cannot separate these if you are watching with a critical and astute eye.
As such, this is a masterful depiction of greed, gluttony, betrayal and revenge. The fact that this tale is through the story of three women is a delicious irony that works like a clock clicking. This is a tale of witchcraft (Emma Stone), power (Rachel Weisz) and gluttony and greed (Olivia Coleman). The characters are a dance with the devil that echoes through history and right to our world today.

Innuendo,"This is a stylish and innovative genre film. The camera movement and angle of photography is not typical for such a film. Similarly, the writing approach is fresh and the terse characterization, along with dialogue, has a sharp and regenerating effect. Add the locations, and the strong cast around the principals, and it's an entertaining film.Even with these artistic qualities it's a bit of a hoax: it's not history and it's not genuine biography. Sure, it exploits historical entities in some inferred behavior, but that is just speculation and not even toward an objective, that is to say, that some imagination was used to concoct as to why a policy was imposed, such as to pursue a war. No, this film is simply a salacious invention in order to titillate an audience with the idea of what may have occurred. Possibly.In itself that is not incorrigible: Robert Graves did it brilliantly in his books on the Roman Empire. But it is just fiction, it's not history and it's no historical biography, nor anything like it. It's gossip and innuendo.The question then is: would anyone watch this if it was invented and just about three women at any time, or does it only work on the basis that it might have been historically true and that authenticity is the necessary ingredient in which an audience gives its time. If that contingency of historical truth is removed than it's a type of fraud because it means only the smallest measure of historical truth makes it watchable and for prurient reasons.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

The return of the wide angle shot.,"Three character leads, all female. Quite a feat in itself. There's the queen. Two competing females surrounding her. Two male characters supplementing those functions. Plus a lover. Which makes for a nice geometrical figure, a hexagon one might say, and the narration balances it out very nicely, in the natural top-to-bottom way. Thus making for an intellectually and aesthetically pleasing experience.The film employs a few techniques you would normally consider gimmickry, like the application of very wide angle shots, but here they're effectively not. I.e. where wide angles are often combined with closeups for the distortive effect, in this movie they actually do provide you with panoramic views of even small places, and organically blend into an overall coherent visual concept.There's some sources the film appears to draw from, like The Draughtsman's Contract and Barry Lyndon, but it confidently implements its own handwriting throughout. Locations, costumes and production design are superb. Music fitting. The color palette leans more towards a natural tone. Lighting is great. And personally I very much appreciated what seems to be a complete absence of steadicam photography.Overall one of the very, very few contemporary films actually worth the price of admission.",,Anonymous,Biography
Yesteryear was just as messed up,"Even through I ended up really enjoying this film I was a little bit disappointed in it. It isn't quite as bold as I was expecting. It is more intellectualized than I was expecting as well. It remind me more of All About Eve than Tom Jones, and I was expecting the latter. Nonetheless, the film is extremely entertaining. It is a funny combination of palace intrigue, social satire and genre deconstruction. It is certainly the most vulgar costume drama I have seen and it really drives home the point that the past was just as ugly as today. Queen Anne somewhat does remind you of a Trumpian figure with her vanity, self-delusion and preening need for attention. Colman really is a force in this film and she makes Queen Anne tragicomic that it is too painful not to laugh.The best part of the film, to me however, is Hoult. Pretty much everything out of his mouth is comedic goal. He also delivers an early barbed insult in the perfect, just perfect manner for the tone of the film. It is so important for the film that the line generates laughs and it does. The screenplay, for all its wit, would have died if not for Hoult in that early scene.I think my disappointment stems from the direction/technical aspects. They are all too beautifully crafted and while it works on an ironic level I would prefer more of the washed out look used in Tom Jones. While parts of them are pushed to an absurd degree they are too conventional for this script. The script is a send up of this sort of story and the visuals are too pristine for it. It works, overall, but a more daring film with less polished visuals would have been better.Very good film through. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of My Personal Favourite Films this Year,"This is a fantastic movie. It might be my favourite of the year, but I'd have to watch it once more to be sure. It's certainly one of the most meticulously crafted films of the year, and undeniably one of the most entertaining.
As far as tone, this movie was no different from Lanthimos's other films: the script and story were viciously written and executed, the performances were utterly captivating, and the world itself was exquisitely imagined. The characters we get to know are indeed based on real people, though, I admit my knowledge of the history of this time period is vague. Do not look to me on questions of its accuracy; I've read a touch from wiki just now to brush up a bit, but I couldn't give you history lesson. What I can tell you is that this film is remarkably entertaining and venomously devious. It's like reading Jane Austen and Oscar Wilde, only with a pinch of deadly nightshade sprinkled in.

Except, the final scene really confused me, and I get to get my friend to explain it for, which did not particularly help, and, while it is important to the matter of 'winning the game', I still question it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Refreshing life breathed into historical characters,"You don't have to love history to enjoy this movie, but this movie will make you more interested in history. The script is deliciously written, and is based on the intimate relationship between two women using power and influence, and a third one who comes in to disrupt that relationship. Emma Stone is amazing, Rachel Weisz is excellent, and Olivia Colman is great fun to watch. Nicholas Hoult, always impressive, has never been better. After watching this movie once, you will be haunted by it and want to watch it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Disappointing,I keep telling myself if they rave about a film and it wins an oscar avoid. Its just all the luvvies voting for it. I didnt stick to that. Because I like what Olivia Coleman has done in the past I though I would still watch it. SO I wasted 1 hour 59 minutes of my life on a film that just dragged the same rubbish out. As for the last 5 minutes of her stood there and the bunnies fading into the scene. What the heck. I mean the acting was good but the story was nothing.,6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Masterpiece!!!,"Masterpiece!!! Great film, great actors, great derecting!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bound to be a classic,"""The Favourite"" is a near-perfect film that solidifies Yorgos Lanthimos amongst the rarified club of master filmmakers. Its script crackles with caustic dialogue that rivals ""The Sweet Smell of Success,"" its dark humour rivals ""Dr. Strangelove,"" and its costumes rival ""Barry Lyndon."" The top-shelf actors are at the top of their game. And what a beautiful film, with stunning photography that elegantly captures the massive scale of the palace, often utilising a fish-eye lens to lend an off-kilter feeling, reminiscent of the Czech New Wave. As a lover of film, there are a lot of suspect reviews here. I'm never surprised that there are a few people who are turned off by something or other-period pieces, sardonic humour-but to give a low rating to a film as well-acted and well-crafted as this film-clearly one of the year's best-is completely disingenuous. Catch it on the big screen, it's deserving.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Stunning & Unconventional Historical Drama,"Yorgos Lanthimos who is known to make movies about the dark nature of humans and the cruelty they can show towards their fellow people crafts one of the best movies ever. After his dark and depressing ""A Killing of A Sacred Deer"", Lanthimos tries his hand in a historical drama about 3 women of complex characters set in 18th century England. I don't to say anything about the film and I also wouldn't recommend you to watch the trailers, knowing nothing about the central plot makes you enjoy the film more. Firstly. the performances were terrific especially from Emma Stone, who delivers her finest performance yet. The production design, makeup and costumes were like they were straight out of the 18th century and you would forget about our current world. Robbie Ryan has done a great work as the DP and his close-ups were very impressive. Shooting the movie on film stock was the right decision. The original score of this film included many pieces by famous musicians and its perfectly fitting to story. This is Yorgos Lanthimos; best film by far and I hope the Academy recognizes his work.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Painfully Mesmerizing,"I tend to admire films that de-romanticize history but not necessarily with those that try to make misery amusing. While the performances in this film are astonishing, it is agonizing to watch the pain these characters endure, and there is precious little comedy in it, at least to my way of thinking. Although this film does force us to imagine what it must have been like to live without an effective treatment for gout, it absolutely drills the point into our heads. The scene in which a woman is dragged by a horse through the forest is agonizing. Have movie-goers reached the point where they must have their noses rubbed in agony before they get the point? The lesbian scenes are among the saddest in film history. The moral of this story: Do not get your history from movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

History through the eye of a fish!,"The cinematography of this film and editing are so incredibly bad to the point of utter distraction. Most of the film seems to be shot with an annoying style for style's sake fish eye lens. The editing is choppy with no flow. This was a horrible film, and another in a long line of films these days preferring to be arty, modern and pc as opposed to simply telling a compelling story. This movie would fit nicely alongside the equally if not more reprehensible Mary Queen of Scots in the bargain bin at the drug store. 2 stars are for some nice sets (even if they look distorted half the time) and usually good actors (going through the motions here).",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Hate it as you will, I'm happy on the other side of the fence","I almost never write film reviews, but after seeing the incredible spitting waves of feelings on this movie, I felt compelled to chip in.The Favourite is a dark, exquisite, disturbingly humorous, and humorously disturbing work of arts. The use of fish-eye lens, the stilted and close-up shots all lend a beautifully haunting and comical quality to the movie, enriching its satires. The music is absolutely brilliant and is one of my favourite things about this film (it's surprising that the music is actually the very thing that grates on many other viewers). The repeated notes and passages of bleak, haunting melody so excellently accentuates the tone of the film, and I believe without this superb score, the film would not be nearly as successful in its deliverance. The extravagance is made possible by the gorgeously lavish set designing and costumes, another of my favourite things about this film.Yet, we do not forget the true stars of the film, the triumvirate whose wicked performances are the deciding factor to the success of the film - Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz, and Emma Stone. It is simply impossible to pick between the three as to who is the true star of the film, for they all fulfill their assignments so perfectly. My personal star of the show would be Colman. In her close-up shots, you can see and feel the subtlest outbreak of emotions, be it an uncontrollable paroxysms or a silent, ominous realisation. Weisz and Stone, as well, also achieve this themselves and deserve as much admiration for their acting.The ending might come as a disappointment to many audience, though to me it is a most appropriate and perfect climax. The ending caps this entire piece of dark comedy in a bleak, hopeless cloak, leaving its characters no way out. This film shows the twisted desires of humans, for power, for safety, for love. The more you think of ending, the more you see how perfect, how right it is for the film.I can totally see why The Favourite is too ""weird"" to be well-received by half the audience out there. I myself also thought this film is extremely bizarre and can thus elude many's taste. However as the film expanded itself, I gradually came to appreciate - and even like - its weirdness. Lanthimos set the bar high with The Lobster, and yet The Favourite, to me, live up to it, that speak volumes about this movie. Go watch it, and see for yourself which side of the fence you are on.",,Anonymous,Biography
The Favourite -my favourite of 2019 so far,"Historical costume melodrama (based on actual events).I'm not familiar with the director or his previous films, but apparently the tone and atmosphere is a trademark of his work. Set in the 18th century, England is at war with France. During this period in history England always seemed to be at war with France.The film revolves around three women, Queen Anne (Coleman). Her closest advisor, Lady Churchill (Weisz) and the newly arrived, fallen from grandeur Abigail Masham (Stone). Abigail was previously a 'lady' and sees any devious association with the queen as a chance to return to her aristocratic past.Whatever you first think of Abigail at the beginning is turned on its head by the end. The film is a struggle for power and position.The end is a little weird and abrupt.

Good period comedy drama,"Very funny period film chronicling the relationship between Queen Anne, Lady Sarah and Abigail. Great cast and excellent acting by all especially the lead trio Coleman, Weiz and Stone. Very much like a play with a majority of the movie talking place within approximately 4-6 sets and a few outdoor locations. With each section introduced like the chapter of a book. That's not a negative though as it's an intimate movie focusing on power, gain, jealousy and loss. Eerie but fitting soundtrack also. This film would have benefited from a better ending though it's abrupt and while it's arty it's trying to hard. A traditional end would have been better. The positives outweigh the negatives with this one. Go see it.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great Anna, Whom Three Realms Obey","The script for ""The Favourite"" was written as long ago as 1998, but the project spent twenty years in development hell as writer Deborah Davis tried to persuade the reluctant studios that, contrary to their assumptions, there was indeed a market for films with a lesbian theme, with three women in the leading roles and with no male characters of equivalent importance. The times appear to be changing in this respect, as recent weeks have seen two historical dramas with a lesbian theme, the other being ""Colette"".""The Favourite"" tells the story of the rivalry between Sarah Churchill, the Duchess of Marlborough, and her cousin Abigail Hill at the court of Queen Anne in the early 18th century. Anne (1702-1714), the younger daughter of a younger son, was one of Britain's more unlikely monarchs. She owed her elevation to the throne to a combination of three factors- the failure of her uncle Charles II to produce a legitimate heir, the conversion of her father James II to Catholicism, which led to his being overthrown after a brief three-year reign, and the premature death of her childless elder sister Mary II. Sarah was the wife of John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, a man who has gone down in history as something of a British national hero, but this film only strengthened my view that his main achievement was to win a series of tactically brilliant but strategically meaningless victories in a pointless war. His stately home Blenheim Palace was, metaphorically speaking, built on the graves of all those slaughtered in its namesake battle.The Anne we see in this movie bears little relation to Pope's ""Great Anna, whom three realms obey"". She is an eccentric woman, confined to a wheelchair and prematurely aged by ill-health. (At the date when the story opens, 1708, she would only have been in her early forties). She shows little interest in governing, preferring the company of her pet rabbits to that of her ministers and official advisers. The effective ruler of the country is Sarah Churchill, her friend, her confidante and, in this version of history, her lover. (Most historians, in fact, have taken the view that Anne was not actually a lesbian and that Sarah's accusations to that effect were merely sour grapes). Sarah's position, however, is undermined by the arrival at Court of her pretty younger cousin. Abigail, whose branch of the family have fallen into poverty, is at first forced to work as a maid, but rises to become a lady-in-waiting, a position which she exploits in an attempt to supplant Sarah in Anne's affections.The film has been described as a comedy, and there is indeed something comical, even farcical, about Olivia Colman's portrayal of the silly, petulant and childish Queen, and about the machinations of the two rival cousins. We are, however, never allowed to forget that serious matters are at stake. While Anne plays with her rabbits, war is raging on the continent, a war which Sarah is determined to prolong for as long as possible because she sees it as providing an opportunity for her husband, the commander of the British forces, to distinguish himself and to earn even more rewards from a grateful nation which has already given him a Dukedom and Blenheim Palace. Abigail's chief ally at court is Robert Harley, the leader of the peace party and a sworn enemy of the Churchills. As played by Nicholas Hoult, Harley comes across as an extravagant dandy, but beneath his foppish exterior his is a voice of reason, even if his pacifism may owe less to moral or humanitarian concerns than to resentment of the taxes he and other landowners have to pay to support the war effort.There are two very good performances, and one excellent one, in the three main roles. Rachel Weisz's Sarah is a rather mannish character who frequently wears male clothing, yet Weisz is still able to suggest the sexual attractiveness which lies at the heart of her domination of Anne, whereas Emma Stone's Abigail is more conventionally feminine. Stone also deserves praise for a faultless British accent; she clearly did not want to take the lazy way out of ""Well, British people in the early eighteenth century probably did not speak in the same way as we do today, so it doesn't matter if Abigail sounds a bit American"". The acting honours, however, must go to Colman as the Queen, whom she makes a curiously sympathetic character despite her silliness and obvious incompetence as a ruler.In some ways this is a typical British costume drama, but unlike most ""heritage cinema"" productions this one has a strongly satirical element. Indeed, its relevance to modern politics has probably grown since the project was first mooted in the nineties. The way in which John and Sarah Churchill manage to prolong the War of the Spanish Succession to their own advantage recalls allegations that certain members of the Bush administration were seeking to profit personally from the Iraq War. And we can all think of politicians (no names mentioned!) who, even if there is no sexual impropriety involved, allow themselves to be manipulated by ""advisers"" whose advice may be motivated by self-interest rather than the national good. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Not too bad,"The Favourite has been getting a lot of buzz. It was overall unique and a different take on historical events. The humour is done very well and works naturally. The performances are very good and believable, this is a strong cast. The story and plot and what is illustrated should receive mixed reviews. Politics and power struggles is a great theme but this was a bit sloppy to follow on screen. This film is a dramedy but the drama aspect was a bit weak and lacking. A good dramedy has a good mix of comedy and drama. There was a lack of flow for the plot and drama, one could get the basic gist but so much was not explained or left out it felt disjointed and all over the place. For e.g. even a short text on the screen to set the tone or setting could have worked. That way we take the time/setting seriously but with a twist.

It's modern yet authentically period, funny and quirky but tragic and serious.

That said as others have pointed out society itself doesn't necessarily come across all that differently than the more male dominated society.

Admittedly, the acting was quite good but at what cost? All of the characters were very unlikable.. By the end of the film it merely felt pretentious, gross, whiny, and boring.

Play to Win,"Of my many projects, one of the least likely to ever see light of day, is a chronological History of the World compiled from feature films. If it does, however, The War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714) just ensured a prominent entry with The Favourite.The Favourite is the 7th feature film directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, Greek critic darling with a distinct surrealist/absurdist style whose recent efforts (The Lobster, 2015, and The Killing of a Sacred Deer, 2017) have been showered with prizes and nominations. The Favourite covers different territory but is set to top its predecessors in terms of recognition, I suspect (not having seen the aforementioned films) deservedly.The Favourite tells the true story of Abigail Hill ( Emma Stone), an impoverished young lady of gentry extraction, and of how she finds her way into service in the kitchen of Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) and thence eventually and very eventfully into her favour, to the dismay and aggressive opposition of the previous favourite Sarah, Duchess of Malrborough (Rachel Weisz), the background being, as mentioned above, the War of the Spanish Succession and the fights of the pro-war Whigs and anti-war (as the landed gentry they represented bore the brunt of the financing) Tories for the kings ear, often though the favourites´ voices.If memory serves, George Clooney´s The Men who Stare at Goats, (2009) started with a caption that went something like ""more than you think of the following actually happened"". I bet that applies to The Favourite, the many pleasures of which include a seamless blend of 18th Century English palatial courtesies and double entendres with crass sexual profanities, although I suspect the otherwise perfect script still errs on the side of pudency in this regard. Other (pleasures) include the high drama/black comedy register Lanthimos chose for this period piece, his first, in many aspects reminiscent of Barry Lyndon (Stanley Kubrick, 1975, the luscious asphyxiated baroque interiors, the pervasive clavichord soundtrack, the stuffy wigs and makeup of men and women, more on this below) with a (mercifully) slight whiff of Fellini (members of the royal household making it an afternoon´s entertainment of throwing ripe tomatoes at a naked wigged man, he cavorting in slow motion like a hairy oversized Botticelli cherub trying simultaneously to dodge the tomatoes and hide his privates) and a perhaps unconscious nod at Fritz Lang (women with facial scars, but maybe that´s just me). And not least the high octane histrionics of the main characters, a perfect schoolgirl triangle in an adult (well...) world. Bette Davies and Joan Crawford in their heyday wouldn´t have topped Stone and Weisz, and no Golden Age parallel occurs for Colman, but her heartbroken half-demented disease-ridden tantrum-prone Queen Anne doesn't steal the show (the other two don´t allow it) but adds to it much more than its share.The Favourite is a rollercoaster ride of Shakespearean proportions, its power like that of the aforementioned Barry Lindon, deriving from the very same proposition: what it takes to go ""up"", or back ""up"", in life in a cripplingly stratified society.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Favourite is my favourite,"Let me begin by saying that this is the best film of the year. The Favourite is simply exquisite, mischievous and irreverent. I've followed Yorgos Lanthimos since The Lobster, and with this film he has proven to be one of the most original filmmakers today.Everything about The Favourite is perfect. Since I saw the trailer, it was love at first sight. The acting ensemble is absolutely phenomenal. I refer not only to the trio of ladies, but also to Nicholas Hoult. I would nominate them all for their performances. However, the Oscar belongs to Olivia Colman. Her performance has to be one of the best I've seen in recent years.The Favorite is a true masterpiece because it's unique, eccentric and politically incorrect. In my opinion, it's art in one of its most rare forms. I would easily give this film over 10 Academy Award nominations, with a total of 5 definite wins for Best Motion Picture, Best Director, Best Leading Actress (Colman), Original Screenplay and Production Design.Nevertheless, I doubt The Favourite will win the Oscar for Best Picture as Green Book and Roma have swept most award shows.

"""The Favourite"" vs. ""Mary Queen of Scots"": and the winner is...","""The Favourite"" (2018 release; 119 min.) brings the story of Queen Anne. As the movie opens, we see her, in frail condition, while her closest confidante, Sarah, seems to be directing most of Britain's business. Then arrives Abigail, Sarah's cousin, desperately looking for a job. She gets a low-level job but it isn;t long before she manages to findthe Queen's interest (treating her legs' burns), and before we known it, Sarah and Abigail are in a fight for the Queen's graces... To tell you more of the movie's plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just haven to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Yorgos Lanthimos, who previously brought us ""off center"" movies like ""The Lobster"" and just last year's ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"". This movie is very much in the same vein, another ""off center"", this time, historical piece, based on more-or-less true events taking place in the early 1700s. Frankly, it took me a while to get into the movie, as the first half establishes the overall sense (Abigail the newcomer vs. Sarah the power-person), and it wasn't really clear whether this was comedy or drama, but the movie's second half resolves that dilemma: this is drama, and court intrigue at the highest level. The movie's greatest asset is the lead performances of the three ladies: Olivia Colman (as Queen Anne), Rachael Weisz (as Sarah) and Emily Stone (as Abigail). I don't think I can point out which is the better, all three of them are just outstanding. But make no mistake: this is not just another historical drama, as director Lanthimos puts his very much ""off center"" stamp on it and it makes not for your ""standard"" viewing. The movie has been getting rave critical acclaim, and while I think this is a good movie for sure, I am just a little bit puzzled, frankly. On the other hand, when you compare this to that other recent historical drama (set 150 years earlier), ""Mary Queen of Scots"", then ""The Favourite"" is the better movie of the two.""The Favourite"" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The early Christmas Eve evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay (about 20 people or so).

Don't waste your time or money on this one,"Throughout this movie characters vomit. While I wouldn't say that it will make you do the same, I certainly found it deadly dull.
And pretentious.
The story has some basis in history. It takes place near the end of the reign of England's Queen Anne, around 1711-1713, during which time the War of Spanish Succession-the war between England and France that is mentioned on occasion-was drawing near its end. The Queen's husband, Prince George of Denmark, had died in 1708, after having gotten her pregnant 17 times - enough to justify switching romantic interest away from men for any woman. Sarah, the Duchess of Marlborough, who had already managed to become the Queen's friend, and-at least in this movie-something more than that as well, has come to exert real influence over the Queen because of her willingness to play to the monarch's desire for affection from other women. As the movie opens, Abigail Hill, a distant relative of Sarah's, arrives at court with the hope of getting preferment there. She sees how Sarah receives favor from the Queen, and decides that she can play that game as well if it will allow her to advance at court. Lesbian intrigue follows.
The costumes are fine, there is some intriguing lighting, and early in the movie some different types of lenses provide unusual shots. The acting, to the extent that the women in these roles get to act, is all fine.
But, for me, this was a succession of too-often unexplained scenes and strange behavior that I found pretentious in the extreme. I can understand that, if they have to consume a steady diet of play-by-the-numbers action movies, film critics get excited over something different and not formulaic. But for me different and not predictable does not, in itself, produce a movie interesting enough to hold my attention for two hours. I found myself nodding off on occasion-and it was only the middle of the afternoon-because none of it held my interest.
Nor would I say that is movie strikes a blow for lesbians. The characters aren't interesting, so you don't really care about their relationships, which are presented as manipulative rather than romantic. The Queen never gets to say that the relationships she has with women are more fulfilling, or at least less stressful, than the marriage she had with Prince George.
I just didn't see why the director wanted to resurrect this element of history in this way.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Royal, Stellar, Sumptuous, and Wickedly diamond-cut of a period piece and a Crowning Achievement.","Yorgos Lanthimos, who is responsible for some of the absurdist films such as Dogtooth and The Lobster, makes a tour-de-force and magnificently crafted direction with his renegade deviltry filmmaking that makes it as a wickedly brilliant and profound movie that blends well with historical period drama with comedy.Much of the stellar yet gorgeous imagery and style of The Favourite can be attested to Robbie Ryan's brilliant cinematography, the grandiose production design, and Sandy Powell's surreal, meticulous and historically accurate costumes as well the detailed make-up and including a grand collection of classical music. But what truly summed up as the film's beating crowning jewel is an intricate story that features female empowerment with witty sensibilities and a compelling combination of LGBT themes and the accurate depiction of political power.From the get-go, The Favourite truly shines in its profound glory with the three crowning jewels featured through the powerful and magnificent performance of Olivia Colman as Queen Anne, whose serves as the film's beating heart and are further boosted by the exceptional and charismatic performances of Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone, who makes the most of the glorious scenes that they've commit within the movie with witty style and eccentricities in an excellent way. Nicholas Hoult's performance is nothing short but wickedly hilarious and fascinating.The Favourite makes a clear point of not just showing itself as a period drama with costumes as the centerpiece but makes a compelling yet fascinating story that take centerstage and display a range of elements from drama, comedy, and a biography, which blends well perfectly. The Favourite definitely can be stated as an apple of an eye and no doubt serves as a glorious masterpiece that any patrons of arthouse films can truly appreciate.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Love Lanthimos, Hate period dramas","I didn't really know what to think of this film going in. I hate period costume dramas, but Lanthimos' last two films, The Lobster and The killing of a sacred deer were both my films of their year. Having watched it, I guess only Lanthimos could make me enjoy a period drama. Whilst not as sinister as his earlier films (and no doubt more accessible to the mainstream as a result), I still found myself laughing out loud uncontrollably at moments which others may have found anything but funny. Olivia Colman is probably going to get all the plaudits - and she was brilliant - but I thought Stone and Weiss were equally great. Easily passed the 6 laugh test, but didn't quite pass my emotional involvement test that Lanthimos' other films have.

The Emperor's New Clothes,"I generally love historical dramas, the lavish scenes, costumes, settings and so on. I was all set to be thrilled by this, considering the cast. But what was this? A case of Hans Christian Anderson's 'The Emperor's New Clothes', methinks.I can understand why some viewers/reviewers would laud it and that is good for them, why should they not? Each to their own. I can almost hear them singing ""Isn't it grand! Isn't it fine! Look at the cut, the style, the line! - The suit of clothes is all together but all together it's all together the most remarkable suit of clothes that I have ever seen"". Never mind the naked truth.Someone said that when there was a great divide in ratings, the zeros and the tens, then that indicated it was a masterpiece. Yeah, might it not also indicate it is quite the opposite? I cannot tolerate reviewers who suggest that those who do not share their views are Philistines, simply too plebeian, too uneducated, to appreciate the ""masterpiece"" they are watching. Well, for me the Emperor was stark naked tosh and I saw right through it.The Favourite starts off badly and doesn't improve. Within minutes we have strong language, a guy playing with himself within close proximity of others in broad bawdy daylight. To top it all we have the weird banging-noise soundtrack which I thought was a flaw in the film for a while. The cinematography is very frequently through a fisheye lens which makes walls appear to be caving in and trees appear to be toppling towards one another. Really, it's all very style over substance, like a magician deceiving us with sleight of hand. There are lesbian scenes (ooh, how risque, how very modern!) and dialogue delivered in a way that much of the time I couldn't tell a word which was being spoken.Yorgos Lanthimos must be laughing all the way to the bank.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Very surprised,"I was not quite sure what made my stomach so sick watching this period piece, whether it was the way the film dutifuly re-created the filth and lack of hygenie of the Middel Ages or the film dutifully re-created two beautiful women actually locked in battle for the right to have sex with an aging old doughy frump of a queen easy to manipulate with all her sorrows. There it is.I was surprised at the screenplay which was humorous, clever, and quite on target with the characters. I love to see movies that sometimes take me by surprise and I was surprised to see how my fondness with one mean girl then shifted over to the other mean girl by story's end. That was impressive albiet an embarrassing showing of my interest in the Middle Ages.

"The Favourite deliciously balances courtly politics, devious deceit and sexual jealousy with dark humour.","Yorgos Lanthimos is a director that does not hide any aspects to his films. If it's unusual, explicit or perhaps even downright mad, he will show it. Audibly separating himself from Hollywood manufactured creations that would never dare to take such bold risks. Whilst The Favourite might be his most accessible film to date, it is certainly his funniest and most sumptuous. During the War of the Spanish Succession, two cousins attempt to convince Queen Anne to be the court favourite. However it soon spirals out of control and turns into a deadly game of jealousy.Three powerfully inclined women that boast complex mental states. Writer Davis is almost a puppeteer, pulling at the strings of these characters. Each one horrendously unlikeable, whether it be Anne's inexplicable childish behaviour or Abigail's ruthless goal to no longer be impoverished. You dislike them, yet Davis' ingenious screenplay allows you to sympathise with them. They each have experienced sorrow and it is soon revealed that these characters are tragically broken. Their bonds are tested through viperous actions of lust, envy and greed. One spoken word could change your view immediately. One heinous act, particularly purposefully crushing a rabbit, could make you almost indefinitely despise a character you once thought to be the protagonist. It's not a story with grand gestures and lavish plot devices. It's entirely character driven. The subtle twists and turns that further the plot, come from these three sexually ambiguous women who would do anything for power. Lanthimos, whilst still embedding his signature surrealism, never goes over the top or makes the story abundantly dark (unlike 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer'). It remains grounded and Davis' unflinching humour adds that extra depth of ill-mannered politics. Five minutes in a frivolous Hoult exclaims the worst expletive possible in a high-pitched voice. It was from that moment I knew I was watching a Lanthimos feature. The unwavering sense of boldness.The majority of acclaim that this film has already garnered is towards its three leading performances. I can categorically say now, these are career bests from all these actresses. Stone flawlessly pulled off a British accent and held your attention through falsified innocence. Weisz enigmatically remained captivating with an assured performance that explored the lengths one would go for Queen and country. However it's Colman that steals every scene. Predominantly a TV actress, she was absolutely sensational in this picture and translated to the big screen outstandingly, proving she is one of the best actresses working today. The change in character from a stubborn child to a commanding Queen, which can happen in a split second, was exceptional. The additional layer of melancholy and desire for attention was conveyed simply through Colman's facial expressions. A performance that quite simply deserves any and all awards. Even supporting cast members Hoult, Alwyn and Gatiss were excellent. But the praise doesn't stop there, oh no. Ryan's cinematography was gorgeous and presented 18th Century Britain with style and vigour. The inclusion of natural lighting also enhanced the authentic style that Ryan was able to capture. The use of fisheye and wide lenses enabled the characters to feel claustrophobic in the large room that is shown, capturing every detail within the luscious production design. The mixture of classical pieces from Vivaldi and Bach with modern composers allowed Lanthimos' contemporary filmmaking to intertwine with the period setting. Also the costumes were beautifully designed, particularly the royal dresses.It's a two hour film, and occasionally it can be felt. The political subplot regarding a battalion in the war and bringing in state taxes was underdeveloped. Understandably the focus is on the behind-the-scenes of these courtly politics, however it never truly feels captivating. Consequently these various scenes allows the pace to dip. Fortunately the proceeding scenes shifts the focus back onto the favourites, with the rapid pace resuming. At first, I was not keen on its conclusion. It left me wanting more. But actually it was incredibly powerful and full of purpose, further asserting the Queen's power. Oh, also loved the chapter title cards. Found them to be rather humorous. In the end, The Favourite nobly presents love, honour and power through jealousy, deceit and manipulation. Proving that Lanthimos is not just a director, but an auteur filmmaker who is here to stay.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Period Film Written for a 2018 Audience,"Everybody requires something different from their moviegoing experience. Some of us need explosions and high-speed chases, and an obvious distinction between the bad guys and the good guys. Some of us need quiet moments of clear introspection or subtle drama.There aren't explosions in this film- there are deafeningly loud musket shots. There are no high-speed chases- there is plotting, brooding, mind games and manipulation. And finally, there are no good guys in this movie, save for, perhaps, the quietly valiant husband of one of the characters.""Every man or woman for themselves"" is the ethos of the film, The Favourite, starring Emma Stone, Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz. It is about two women, one of stature and rank (Weisz), another of similar upbringing (Stone), who befell the whims of their father and was left with nothing. Both are power-hungry and will go to great lengths to earn or keep their place as the ""favourite"" of Queen Anne (Colman), depicted as a petulant, emotionally stunted woman riddled with ailments.Queen Anne ruled England, Scotland and Ireland for just five years, then Great Britain and Ireland for seven more. If you are of a certain mind, this movie will feel to you as if it is a number of years long. I was not one of those people, but I did see the film with one of those people.It could have been cut by fifteen to thirty minutes and maintained the brisk, sharply funny pace it began with. However, director Yorgos Lanthimos is film-student-as-director, and requires you to feel uncomfortable for as much time as he or you can stand it. Luckily, our one saving grace is that Mr. Lanthimos did not write the screenplay, which was penned by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, an Australian filmmaker.With his 2015 film, The Lobster, which Lanthimos co-wrote, it was clear that he has a sadistic streak. It landed on some year-end lists of best films, but I'm here to tell you, that movie deserves no accolades, except for ""Best Way to Torture Yourself for Two Hours."" I laughed a few times, but by the end, rather than a lobster, I was a frog, left in a pot that began cold and by the end was boiling over. That movie was pure indulgence of dry, cruel humor drenched in nihilism.This movie continues to tell the story of the darker side of human nature explored in The Lobster, but the humor is more deft here. The pacing is stronger for the most part, and there is more story to tell, the characters more richly inhabited. By the end, you may be rooting for none of the characters, but you will be won over by the performances, especially Emma Stone, who arguably gets the most screen time, and makes great use of it. Olivia Colman is brilliant as the aforementioned Queen Anne, whose emotions shift on a dime- was the character of the Queen of Hearts from Alice in Wonderland based on her, or vice-versa? (There is a nod to Lewis Carroll when she quietly sing-speaks ""Off with her head, off with her head,"" during the first, lighter half of the film."") Rachel Weisz is also great, and perhaps the only reason she is mentioned last is that she is always great, and so it comes as no surprise. She also has less whimsy to work with.It could be argued that the weakest performers in the film are the men, but that is not their fault. We don't get to see too much of them. The one we see the most of, Nicholas Hoult, is the only actor in the film who feels, instead of an adult with autonomy, like a child playing dress-up. He is ill-suited and miscast as another power hungry player, a member of Parliament and advisor to the Queen, dressed in full man-of-the-court regalia, complete with an artificial mop of grey curls (a wig.) It took me out of the film watching him struggle to speak his lines with any naturalism or nuance. He was also equally as bad in Mad Max: Fury Road. Lowering one's voice an octave and pouting does not a man make.Men's power over women, and their sexual ownership of them is not painted with broad strokes. Instead, it is merely understood. A few lines about rape and uncomfortable heterosexual intercourse are played for laughs; why take seriously what is innate and unchangeable?The Favourite is a queer film. The greatest love story is of course, that of power, but there is, at the very least, gay sex. There is also a queer lens through which we view the quite literally ""gay"" dress of the women, and especially men, in this period of English history. High heeled shoes, wigs, and blush: a drag queen's dream.That lens also pierces through the morbid nature of class, status and wealth and the whims of those who hold it. They race lobsters, rabbits and ducks. They slap each other when they are perturbed. In the opening scene, Queen Anne offers her closest companion, the Duchess of Marlborough, a castle, as a way to ""do something nice.""The most distasteful scene in the movie is one in which a nude, heavyset man is pelted by blood oranges by a group of men, who ditched the grey wigs for ginger ones, all of them laughing, including the target. All of this is rendered in slow-motion, buoyed by the score. It reminded me of a similarly grotesque scene in Tom Ford's second feature, Nocturnal Animals, which opened on a group of morbidly obese nude women jumping up and down, their tasseled breasts flopping, again in slow motion and set to violin music. While the theme of people and animals (and people-as-animals) as objects and playthings is evident in the film, it felt entirely out of place, and left me feeling like I was watching a film-student who ""couldn't get this scene"" out of his head, and instead of filming it and watching it alone for his own pleasure, had to insert it into an otherwise tightly composed film.This is a period film written for a 2018 audience. It succeeds mostly at blending surrealism and absurdism with realism, and one might believe every word of dialogue, save for a line about a woman's ""vajeejee."" The sociopathic tendencies of the characters echo that of a titular Mr. Ripley, a groundbreaking character in his own right as a gay man conceived of and written in the 1950s. The innate queerness of the characters of The Favourite is debatable, but what is perhaps more important is watching women get to be as absolutely monstrous as men can be. Women may not get to escape the seductress or mistress label in the film, but it does make for interesting conversation and does posit one main theory: Men use their power to get sex, women use sex to get power, but in the end, we are all animals.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Never seen so many people walk out during a film,"There seems to be a fashion amongst directors keen to gain attention, to snigger at historical figures and make them look ridiculous, regardless of their true character or achievements. The more fictional the representation, the more clever they think they are. Put the film into a sumptuous setting which is historically accurate, throw in some salacious lesbian sex scenes whenever possible and then sit back and rake in the money. I thought this film would be amusing, admittedly reasonably historically inaccurate, but well acted and have some depth. Instead I felt bored, disconnected from the characters, unable to understand any historical context or how they had come to be as they were portrayed. Throughout the time that these supposed actions took place the real queen Anne was married and adored her husband. She had after all borne him seventeen children and lost her young son. This was briefly touched upon now and then but there was no explanation as to how she became the pathetic waste of space that they chose to portray. Every opportunity had to be a bed or sex scene. Boring. Yes she had favourites. No it wasn't proven that they were lesbian. She is widely considered to have been the most stable, sensible and successful of the not very good Stuart monarchs. I realise we don't go to the cinema for history lessons but why make a totally fictional film and pretend it is hidden history, misleading and almost mocking the audience. I thought it was a terrible and distasteful film, only lifted by Olivia Colman having a vague physical resemblance to Queen Anne, and from the number of people who left during it and those who were complaining at the end as they left the cinema, I was not alone.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lanthimos' baroque royal menage a trois dark comedy,"Yorgos Lanthimos' THE FAVOURITE is a mordant menage a trois film about royalty. 18th century Queen Anne (Olivia Coleman) is portrayed as a doddering ruler getting played by her attendant, Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz). A new servant has arrived at the palace, Abigail (Emma Stone), and she too learns to use her whiles to get her way with the weak Queen.
The screenplay by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara is full of biting wit, each character setting out to use their tongue like a rapier. The three ladies take - and dominate strongly = center stage, but the men in the cast including Nicholas Hoult, James Smith and Joe Alwyn hold their own in clear supporting parts. The script, while sharp at times, also lets itself fall prey to anachronisms and modern phrasing - certainly part of the construct, but a bit more polish could have made it less distracting (and, if one of the writers weren't a woman the frequent use of the ""C"" word would have stood out even more).
Lanthimos (working from other writers words for the first time since he debut feature), still manages to put his undeniably offbeat stamp on the project. The cinematography (on 35mm by Robbie Ryan) is baroque in its use of wide-angle lenses (too much so) and the compilation soundtrack combines both period classical music (Bach, Handel) as well as more contemporary experimental sounds by Messiaen and Ferrari. It's an, at times, uneasy blend - as Lanthimos, no doubt intended. The nod to Ingmar Bergman's PERSONNA is carried off with a deadpan Lanthimos twist.
While the actresses carry the tricky dialogue and directorial quirks with aplomb (hard to pick an...ahem...favourite among the trio), the movie eventually bogs down by the last couple of acts (the film is broken down into eight chapters). Once the three main characters are set, there aren't enough surprises to drive the drama. Even the acrid dialogue loses steam as it goes along. THE FAVOURITE is a well played film, but not fully realized.",,Anonymous,Biography

"An Outrageous, Gleefully Offensive Comedy Masterpiece","It is rare to find a film that is at once as highbrow and lowbrow as The Favorite. It's an almost stately period piece filled with the finest costumes and sets, as well as the most refined accents and outlandish wigs, which concerns itself with court intrigues and addresses matters such as parliamentary politics and the royal finances. It's also an outrageous, dirty minded, and sometimes downright lewd sex comedy not unlike the works of Jude Apatow. And this massive dichotomy is what makes it all so much fun.The plot revolves around the fierce competition between cousins Sarah Churchill and Abigail Masham for the favor of an aging and increasingly addled Queen Anne. It all starts subtly and mostly innocently enough, but rapidly becomes more outlandish and deeply bitter until we're not sure everyone is going to come out alive. All boundaries of decency and believability are crossed well before the end, but that's half the fun.It's notable that while there are certainly protagonists and antagonists, there is no-one who could be remotely describes as a hero or heroine. Aside from Queen Anne, who is extremely mercurial, rather needy, and increasingly detached from reality, practically everyone in this movie is ambitious, scheming, backstabbing, and incredibly petty, if not downright b*tchy. And it's a far more interesting movie for it. There is something fascinating and deeply shocking about watching these educated, wealthy, supposedly refined nobles constantly bickering, cursing like students at a public high school, and ""romantically"" pursuing each other with all the fervor and subtlety of drunken frat bros and sex starved sorority girls, while somehow maintaining a façade of genteel manners when anyone is looking. It's rather like a regency period Mean Girls.And what girls they are. Emma Stone is in a rare form as Abigale. Intelligent, cultured, conniving, and utterly ruthless in her climb to the top, she's equally willing to betray her closest friend or jettison her own dignity, and we can't help but root for her most of the way. This may be her best performance to date. Rachel Weisz is also very good as Lady Sarah. Though not as outrageous or conniving as Abigale, she is extremely strong willed, resolute, and not at all above being a catty B when it suits her.And Olivia Colman is priceless as Queen Anne. Capricious yet oddly stubborn, she's begging for attention and affection one moment, then erupting into mad tantrums the next. She would be a petty tyrant if she had the ruthlessness to be tyrannical. Instead she's like that rich, crazy old great aunt that everyone in the family has to pretend to like. Or perhaps an unruly toddler who must be very carefully coddled to sleep. And her comedic timing is impeccable. Just when you think she's calmed down and the argument has passed, she says or does the darnedest things. The whole movie's like that really, delivering the biggest shocks and laughs with no warning.From a historical standpoint, this is mostly utter nonsense. But for a comedy which makes no claim of historical accuracy, this is hardly a problem. What I do consider a problem is the unfortunate inclusion of the ""fruit throwing"" scene. At the very least it could have involved better looking people, perhaps with more clothes. And admittedly it does get a bit slow in one patch towards the end. But those are very minor faultsThis is a very unconventional blend of elements which easily could have pushed the film apart into a disjointed mess full of wild tonal shifts. Or overemphasis on any one part could have dragged it down into overwrought soap opera clichés or boring crassness, like the recent Sherlock Holmes spoof. But instead the filmmakers and cast have carefully walked the tightrope, delivering results that are oft fascinating and wildly funny. I don't know why this didn't win best comedy at the Globes, because it surely should have.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

It wasn't bad at all and if you love history, costumes, dark comedy and a little fun, this movie really is amazing, as it was for me. I was blown away by the performances of Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz, I think both deserve Oscar nominations.

I loved the costumes, loved the wide shots, loved the script, it was all done so well.Only negative thing might be some of the background music which sounded very annoying as it lasted some minutes, wouldn't recommend anyone who's distracted or oversensitive to sounds to put your sound all too loud.Overall I loved The Favourite and since I want to compromise for the low ratings I'm giving it a 10/10.

Sensationalism at the Expense of History,"The beautiful cinematography and wonderful acting in this over-the-top period piece barely makes up for its historical inaccuracy and a grueling 2-hour run time. Written by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara and directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, The Favourite is artistically filmed, the acting is wonderful, and cinematography top notch. If you're looking for a realistic account of Queen Anne's 18th Century British court, however, you'll be sorely disappointed. The Favourite chooses to enshrine gossip and rumor as historic fact, while delivering a film that is as tedious as it is tantalizing.As the film opens, Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) is deciding whether to continue a war with France after an English victory, or sue for peace. Her natural inclination, and that of opposition leader Robert Harley (Nicholas Hoult), is for peace, but her influential friend and Keeper of the Privy Purse Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz), wife of Lord Marlborough (Mark Gatiss), wants to prosecute the war to the bitter end. During negotiations, a dirty but charming Abigail (Emma Stone) arrives seeking employment in Lady Sarah's household.Things get complicated when Abigail discovers Queen Anne and Lady Sarah's dirty little secret, and uses it to her advantage to get closer to the Queen. Abigail and Lady Sarah engage in a private war for the Queen's affection, while Robert Harley and Samuel Masham (Joe Alwyn) conspire to use Abigail to get closer to the Queen, wh0 only has time for one friend, I guess. Who will become the Queen's favourite?Using extreme wide-angles (shot with Panavision lenses) to achieve a sense of expanse even in a small room, the filmmakers capture a delightfully Baroque portrayal of an outlandish and amoral British aristocracy. The acting is top-notch, with Emma Stone giving one of the best performances of her career. Olivia Colman should receive an Oscar nod for her portrayal of Queen Anne. The film, however, could've been improved by cutting at least 20 minutes of silence, screeching violins, and arthouse chapter titles.Historically, Queen Anne ruled England, Scotland, and Ireland (and then Great Britain) from 1702 to 1714. The film takes place during the War of the Spanish Succession. John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, the husband of Queen Anne's close friend, Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, was commander of Allied forces in that conflict. Marlborough was caught between the two political parties in Britain: the Tories and Whigs. Queen Anne favored the Tories, who wanted peace, but the Whigs had gained considerable power alongside Sarah Churchill, who had the Queen's ear and advocated on their behalf.Sarah was notoriously headstrong and spoke her mind freely and openly, which began to get on the Queen's nerves. In 1711, Queen Anne dismissed the Duke of Marlborough from service over charges of embezzlement. John and Sarah Churchill went into exile a year later. Sarah's break with the Queen was exacerbated by her rivalry with her younger cousin, Abigail (Hill) Masham. Sarah tried to have Abigail removed from the Queen's household, and when she could not, accused Abigail and the religiously conservative Queen of having a sexual relationship (among a litany of other insults).The Favourite indulges in sensationalism at the expense of history. It depicts Sarah as a jealous lover carrying on an illicit sexual affair with the Queen and omits Queen Anne's great religious devotion and her marriage to Prince George of Denmark, though he died in 1708. The only evidence of a love affair comes from romantic-sounding (but entirely Platonic) letters and rumors spread by political rivals. Director Yorgos Lanthimos admitted he didn't care whether a real love triangle took place between Queen Anne, Sarah Churchill, and Abigail Masham. ""We never really discussed it (the historical accuracy),"" he said.As a story of two rivals competing for the affections of a monarch, The Favourite is similar to The Other Boleyn Girl (2008), directed by Justin Chadwick and starring Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, and Eric Bana. It is about the rivalry between sisters Anne and Mary Boleyn for the affection of King Henry VIII. Sarah Churchill and Abigail Masham were also related (though distantly). It wasn't uncommon at the time for ambitious families to seek employment at a royal court, and becoming a royal mistress could be very advantageous.Like The Favourite, The Other Boleyn Girl has little regard for historic accuracy, but where The Favourite imagined sexual trysts where there probably were none, The Other Boleyn Girl turns the Boleyn sisters into innocent virgins. In that film, Anne is depicted as a pure and devoted wife when she met King Henry VIII. In reality, she had already been kicked out of the French Court for sleeping around (King Francis called her ""my English mare""). You know it's bad when even the French think your sex life is scandalous.The Favourite currently holds a 94% positive rating from critics and 58% audience favorability on RottenTomatoes. Despite winning a litany of praise and awards, it barely made back its $15 million budget at the box office. Why the discrepancy? This is exactly the type of film critics love, and it will appeal to art house aficionados. There's nothing wrong with that. But while general audiences might snicker at the absurd spectacle, they will feel the clock ticking on every single minute of this two-hour film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The most masterfully created standalone film in 2018,"Where do I even begin. There is not a single aspect of cinema that this film did not tackle well. I was drawn into the world quickly and powerfully. The characters were potent, ambitious, and relatable. The themes were clear and intriguing. The cinematography and costume design were second to none. The performances by Emma Stone and Olivia Colman were stunning. This film was damn near perfect. From a film appreciation stand point, I would even argue that it may be the best I have ever seen. The reason that I am not giving it a perfect score is because it didn't quite scratch that ever-present itch I have for plot twists and betrayal in cinema.The Favourite is a story about manipulation, perseverance, elder abuse, and gaming the system. I highly recommend everyone see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Olivia Colman Achieves Greatness in Yorgos Lanthimos's Wicked Tale!,"'The Favourite' is Director Yorgos Lanthimos's most accessible film to date. Yes, the man who gave us a film like The Lobster (I haven't seen his other works hence I only have that one film as a reference), now presents us a period piece, of power, greed, cruelty and lust. While not perfect, 'The Favourite' is nonetheless an entirely well-made tale, who's wicked behavior is hard to resist. And Olivia Colman, in the film's meatiest role, achieves acting greatness. It's a virtuoso performance from the firebrand actress.'The Favourite' Synopsis: In early 18th century England, a frail Queen Anne (Colman) occupies the throne and her close friend, Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz oozing ease of a seasoned veteran) governs the country in her stead. When a new servant, Abigail (Emma Stone, a complete hoot) arrives, her charm endears her to Sarah.'The Favourite' is a twisted tale of three complex women who are unable to look at life without power in their hands. What I particularly loved here was the diversity of its principal characters, who have only one similarity: the greed for power. And while not all of their cruelly ambitious motives land as arrestingly as expected, its hard not to be seduced by these women. I really enjoyed the sexual tension as well as the unpredictability among the women.Having said that, 'The Favourite' has a few shortcomings of its own. Deborah Davis
and Tony McNamara's Screenplay is a little too long and lacks some sharpness. Sure, length is never a problem, but the Writing lacks some bite in the film's latter half. While the first-hour is a mix of sadistic humor and delicious twists, the second-hour is less effective in the same nature it begins upon. But again, these aren't flaws so deep that they take away from an otherwise engaging film. The Writing, for a large chunk of the film, is swift and arresting. Lanthimos's Direction is lush. The man has outdone himself here and has Directed this period piece with sheer class. Robbie Ryan's Cinematography is gorgeous. The Lensman has captured this classy affair with absolute ease. Not one frame lacks beauty. Lanthimos and Ryan deserve Oscar-Attention, next year! Yorgos Mavropsaridis's Editing is crisp. Art & Costume Design are astoundingly done. The Score is top-notch.And now to the performances! 'The Favourite' has a strong ensemble cast, who bring in their A-Game. Colman takes the lead, of course. As Queen Anne, Colman is acting greatness at its truest. She expresses grief, pain, jealously, love, fear and humanity, all at once, in a performance that deserves respect and accolades. Colman is the underdog this year, who has left us all spell-bound, with a portrayal so deep and personal, it would be unfair to rank it only among the best of the year. It's much more than that.Following up to Colman, Weisz and Stone are exceptional. Weisz is quietly powerful as a women who fears losing her power and love, adapting and entirely inhabiting the character for a first-rate turn. Stone is at her most uninhibited and portrays the opportunist to perfection.And while it's the Women who rule the show without any doubt, the men here also do credible jobs. Nicholas Hoult, in particular, is a complete revelation in a key-role, while Joe Alwyn delivers a yet another impressive performance.On the whole, 'The Favourite' is not perfection, but it most certainly is a well-made, gorgeously shot film with some excellent performances, and one that merits an Oscar.

Yorgos and 3 great actresses,"Greetings again from the darkness. Our biggest fear was that Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos would one day soften the twisted edge he blessed us with in THE KILLING OF A SACRED DEER (2017), THE LOBSTER (2015), and DOGTOOTH (2009). That day may yet arrive, but not today and not with his latest. It's his first time to direct a screenplay he didn't write, which likely explains this being his most accessible film - though labeling it ""mainstream"" would be a huge stretch. So brace yourself for an unusual and odd costume period piece unlike anything you've seen before.Co-writers Deborah Davis (her first screenplay) and Tony McNamara (TV background) deliver biting dialogue and treacherous situations, and benefit from three staggeringly terrific lead actress performances. Olivia Colman stars as Queen Anne, Rachel Weisz as Lady Sarah Churchill, and Emma Stone is Abigail. The three combine for one of the strangest and most convoluted love triangles and power struggles in history.It's very early 18th century and Britain is at war with France. Queen Anne is frail and in ill health due to severe gout and who knows how many other ailments. Her erratic behavior and quick temper convey childlike behavior from an adult body with a crown. Lady Sarah (Winston's great-great grandmother, if I've calculated correctly) has strategically become the Queen's trusted political advisor and often governs in her stead, while also sharing moments of intimacy. Sarah pulls no punches and certainly doesn't subscribe to the 'kill 'em with kindness' approach, and instead frequently insults the Queen to her face. When Sarah's cousin Abigail appears after her family's fall from grace (her father lost her in a card game), Sarah takes pity on her due to Sarah's fondness of Abigail's father during her childhood.Abigail's naivety and kindness soon win over the Queen's affections. Is her sweetness an act? Is it due to ambition or desperation ... is there even a difference here? We soon learn Abigail treats conniving as a profession - she views it as her only path back to respectability, and she's willing to take on many acts lacking in respectability to charm her way into the inner sanctum. We are plopped into the wicked fun, delicious cat-fighting, strategic backstabbing and crafty political and personal maneuverings ... right up until the story turns to vicious bleak darkness in the final act.It's fascinating to watch three women hold the power during this era, as the noblemen are relegated to constantly playing catch-up (kind of like the real world) and struggling to figure out the rules of the game. Power struggles abound, as do director Lanthimos stylistic touches. Noblemen played by Nicholas Hoult and Joe Alwyn are frequently dressed in frilly costumes, giant wigs and heavy make-up - quite the contrast to what we typically see in these period pieces. Other Lanthimos touches include royal duck races, pet bunnies representing deceased children, and fisheye lenses used from every conceivable angle.Ms. Colman and Ms. Weisz were both in THE LOBSTER, and both have a knack for the Lanthimos style, and Ms. Stone surprisingly is also a natural with the twisted, vicious material. Each of the actresses have an extended close-up allowing them to show-off their immense and subtle talent ... Ms. Colman's is especially impactful. Extreme profanity (numerous c-words and f-words) is at times startling and effective, and the music is unique and diverse - as we would expect. As an added bonus, it requires little imagination to connect the dots to our contemporary political state, although that approach would likely stifle one's enjoyment of the film. Mr. Lanthimos has quickly reached the 'must-see' list of directors, with a guarantee that we are going to see something unusual and interesting. It's one of the year's best, even if it's not for everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A grand guignol of self-interest and sabotage,"""The Favourite"" retells the later life of Queen Anne, focusing on her relationship with her close confidant Sarah Churchill, and the arrival of Sarah's cousin, Abigail, whose presence ignites a battle of wits that tests the limits of moral decency.I've noticed the reviews of this film on IMDb seem to alternate between abject hatred and ""you Americans just wouldn't understand/don't know British history and therefore won't get it."" The fact is that, despite the film being aesthetically high-brow, it does not demand its audience have written a dissertation on 18th-century British history to comprehend or enjoy it. What the film ultimately represents is a battle of wits between two women; one, a longtime companion of the queen who has a lengthy history with her (Rachel Weisz), and the other a disgraced ex-lady-cum-social climber who will stop at nothing to fulfill her own security (Emma Stone). The triangulated narrative is as old as time, but what really sells the film is the witty writing and stellar performances from Weisz, Stone, and Olivia Colman, who portrays the queen.What I found remarkable about it, among numerous things, was that it seems to cross genres nearly undetected. At times it's wickedly humorous, at others poignant, and sometimes it's even utterly suspenseful. The stakes run high for all of the characters, and both Stone and Weisz play off of one another remarkably well. Colman is also alternately endearing and petulant in her portrayal of Anne, who is in the center of the mess. All of this is punctuated by a phenomenal musical score that alternates between lush and baroque, and something so nervy it sounds as though it belongs in a horror film. The cinematography is incredible, and the costumes and setting is truly something to behold.I think the only real downfall to the film is its ending, which feels outwardly unresolved, though it thematically makes sense in regard to Abigail's character arc--does she not end where she began? All in all a very well-plotted film that works as a historical drama as well as it does an off-kilter, Machiavellian display of feminine grand guignol. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A strong queen and two strong women. Who will prevail?,"The Favourite (2018) was directed by Yorgos Lanthimos. It's an account of a period in the life of Queen Anne, who reigned in the early 18th Century.Olivia Colman plays Queen Anne, Rachel Weisz plays her friend and confidante, Lady Sarah, and Emma Stone portrays Abigail Hill, who wants to be the queen's friend and confidante.I looked at the Wikipedia entry for Queen Anne, and the history is extremely complicated. (It was complicated then, and it's even harder for us to understand 300 years later.) However, the movie plot appears to me to conform closely to history. If you're a history buff, you may know the history, or you may want to check it before you watch the film. If not, let it pass, because the film is really about interpersonal relationships rather than history.Lady Sarah was, indeed, the queen's friend and confidante. The family of Abigail Hill, Sarah's cousin, had fallen onto hard times, and Hill arrived at the palace pleading for a job. She was given a job in the kitchen, but she rose far beyond that.So, my suggestions is to forget the War of the Spanish Succession, Whigs vs. Tories, and Catholics vs. Protestants. Concentrate on three brilliant actors. One is the queen, and the other two are scheming to be the closest to her.I enjoyed this movie, and I recommend it. When was the last time you saw a movie with three women actors as the leads, while men have only supporting roles? That in itself makes the film worth seeing. Of course, better yet, Colman, Weisz, and Stone are wonderful actors, who fit into their roles perfectly.We saw this movie at Rochester's excellent Little Theatre. All the scenery and royal finery will be better appreciated on the large screen. However, I recommend the movie even if watched on the small screen. See it!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Acting was good all-around, especially Rachel Weisz as the Lady-in-Waiting to Queen Anne.But what was needed was a timeline and a sense of location. Characters seemed to wander around the Queen's estate at different hours and there is no hint as to the era, or even the year this film takes place.

The only problem is that it doesn't have any ending. It just gets to a point in the story and stops. I guess maybe they ran out of money.

If you love film you should recognse this IS a masterpiece.,"I have seen this movie twice now.
Anyone who gives this less than a 9 - please ignore their view. They are not into movies. That simple. That might sound completely pretentious of me but truly. Anyone giving this a bad review... it is beyond my understanding. You can dislike it sure. But you cannot as a film fan hate this.What you have here is a masterpiece.
The Favourite is not at all a comedy. It absolutely DOES have comedy liners of genius delivered by a female trio who all deserve the highest of praise. It is not a comedy though. This movie is deadly serious. I don't hear enough praise for this film from the feminist crowd complaining there are not enough strong female leads. This has three. Quite possibly three of the finest most powerful figures to grace cinema. and oh how they mock the men. and boy do the men deserve to be mocked.Quite why the Golden Globes placed this in the comedy/musical category will forever be a mystery and a big mistake.
It is very very hard to pick which actress gives the best performance. Rachel Weisz probably but only by the tiniest of margins.My first viewing I was captivated. Mesmerized. I was in a small crowd. some people laughed at the oddest moments. Everyone seemed to find a different section hilarious. My favourite comedic line was about 'bathing in cream to soothe haemorrhoids' but there are so many swift sharp comedy blows. The script is magnificent. Again I stress this is not a comedy. I don't even want to gategorize or pick a genre. A period piece, a drama? A comedy...
The Favourite is so many things.On my first viewing I left the cinema feeling like I had quite possibly watched the most perfect film. Genuinely a film of perfection. Is that possible? Certainly the best movie of 2019 and 2018. By a long long way.The Directors last work 'The Killing of a Sacred Deer' unsettled me so so much. I have watched that twice and on second viewing again it shook me to the core. The Favourite excels though in every way. It is way more accessible than any of Yorgos Lanthimos previous work. The historic elements are plainly and clearly stated yet never overstated. Characters are introduced with such ease and lines of such power. The glorious mesmerising spectacle of it all made me feel gluttonous. Greedy. I felt a passion and desire for the spectacle of it all. and felt shamed. Which I believe is the point. Queen Anne tries as she might to enjoy simple pleasures but all they do is bring back the panic of loss. Watch her face as she begins to enjoy a piece of dance, or music. Then watch as the pure panic sets in. She is terrified of a simple life pleasure dare it be taken away. I think Olivia Coleman said something about Anne being absolutely allowed to act however she pleases. Anyone going through such suffering is justified to act mad, eccentric, greedy and naughty. Of course they are. The Queen Anne of whom I knew nothing about before this movie is not a pathetic figure however. She has strength. Assuredly. She is not someone to be mocked and laughed at.You have three main characters all striving to forget their pains through pleasure and power. A never ending life struggle. We all have this struggle and the message sent here is power obviously corrupts. Greed, love and lust will never conquer the pain you feel. No one ever truly wins. Manipulation to get what you want is a prominent theme and again providing the same result. Temporary pleasure then deep loss and pain.This film caught me at a very sombre melancholic period of my life and I felt every single intimate agonizing second. This will be a movie I watch into double or maybe even triple figures. Laugh with the script and madness of it all. Bathe in its beauty for as long as you can and possibly quite possibly you will never reach such dizzying heights again. The ending was glorious and made complete sense to me. What you make of it... well that's for you. I am sure many people will take many different things from this masterpiece.A bad review should never be one of them. Ignore them and get to the cinema as soon as you possibly can.Masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Period drama for the #MeToo generation.,"I am a big, big fan of Yorgos Lanthimos whose two previous deadpan comedic features (The Killing of a Scared Deer and The Lobster) are outstanding movies.The feature of both of these movies is Lanthimos' extremely black humour delivered in a unique style.However, for The Favourite Lanthimos has taken a big decision in abandoning the scriptwriting and handing the duties over to Deborah Davis (her debut) and Tony McNamara (lots of minor TV but no cinema history). It's a strange choice of writing team because they don't bring any previous to the mix, and neither are fresh-faced youths. But what they bring is an entirely different tonality to Lanthimos' work and that leaves him to focus on direction, with cinematography provided by Robbie Ryan, who made a big contribution (in my view) to American Honey. Indeed, the cinematography is a major talking point after the writing. Gone is Lanthimos' naturalistic, almost clinical, lighting of the Lobster and ""Deer"" instead, although we again go au natural, it's through a gloom of candle and fire light that renders the screen largely black for a great deal of its 2+ hours.His frequent choice of extreme wide angle (almost fish eye) lens to capture the scale of the huge palace rooms is highly unusual in cinema and is much more like stills photography. One scene, shot in a long corridor, makes it look like a u-bend when in fact it is completely straight - unlike the principal characters!But the real meat here is this terrific all female star line-up. In the #MeToo era this is a real vote of confidence in female actors with attitude and sheer quality. Come March it is entirely possible that all of the leads; Olivia Coleman (national treasure that she is), Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone will be career Oscar winners because Coleman's performance is quite brilliant. The other two already hold this distinction and each has a good chance of adding to their trophy haul.Although, As Queen Anne, Coleman (who gained 2.5 stone to play the gout-ridden Queen's part) is the designated lead, the film is essentially a three player ensemble with some ineffectual men put into bat to be made to look ridiculous and, oh, they do in Sandy Powell's outrageous costumes and Beverley Binda's even more outrageous hair and make up. (""You look like a dead badger"" Weisz tells the Queen as she sets out on a royal engagement.)The story echoes All About Eve as Queen Anne's favourite lady in waiting, and lesbian lover, Lady Sarah Marlborough, The Wife of the Duke of Marlborough who is leading the war with France, is gradually pushed out of favouritism by one time lady and now servant girl, Abigail (Emma Stone). Although she does not go without fight.This is where the scriptwriting team get the nod to create a bawdy and vicious rivalry set in a Draughtsman Contract-esque world.Overindulgence, poisoning and illness leads to all three leads vomiting at least once each, reflecting this world of excess.The music track is at times intrusive, but to my mind in a good way; it's a sort of early 18th Century version of Atticus Rose and Trent Resnor's soundtrack to The Social Network.What everyone is talking about is the lead performances. Each is supremely talented and each is given so much scope to truly flex their acting muscles that what results is an acting master-class. In the trailer it seems like a knockabout farce but in reality the movie is actually quite slow-paced with moments of true hilarity and enough foul language to shock some of our more prurient audience members. That said, my wife who abhors the C-word volunteered that it was used to great effect several times in this.The lesbian relationships Queen Anne enjoyed are worthy of note. In a life that saw her lose 17 children (5 still born and many miscarried) her tipping of the velvet was, apart from a bulimic relationship with food, one of her few pleasures. Both Lady Marlborough and Abigail are adept in their duty to pleasure their monarch.The first half belongs to Rachel Weisz but Coleman steadily comes into her own as the movie progresses. Emma Stone plays a beautifully judged and paced role in which she will do anything to get ahead - but in the end it's Coleman who wins the day, with the last 20 minutes belonging to her as she suffers the consequences of the vagaries of her life. Her portrayal of Queen Anne as a stroke victim is as good a performance as you will see anywhere this year.It's a fascinating movie, although I'm not convinced it's quite as good as its hype. That said, for lovers of history and lovers of Olivia Coleman it has to be seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Tale of Two Halves,"These type of offbeat period dramas are typically not my cup of tea. I just don't find a lot of them to be interesting subject matters but heck, I was excited for The Favourite. Not only do I love Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz, but Yorgos Lanthimos' last film (The Killing of a Sacred Deer) was an insanely enjoyable near-masterpiece. But I wasn't thrilled with The Favourite. It doesn't get interesting until about an hour in, and at that point it had already almost lost me. With that said, once the turn of this movie begins, it's like a trainwreck you can't help but keep your focus on (and I mean that in terms of story, and in all the best ways). Some of the deceptively evil things Weisz and Stone do to each other's characters is a joy to watch, and the time period adds to it, for some reason. If only the entire film was that gripping.7.2/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"beautiful, dirty and powerful.","Lanthimos proved that there is always a fresh way to approach direction. The film consists of a great rythm which follows perfectly the tention of the characters. I enjoyed the film from the first to the last second due to the unique use of timing. Slow parts follow the quicker ones and the opposite so succesfully. Great photography, great costumes and music. The addition of so many clever details gives to the plot not only the colour and the realism of that times but also helps the three actresses to achieve exceptional levels of acting. I believe that this movie takes the whole perspective of cinematography a bit further in all of its aspects. Clearly a masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Little bit of everything..,"So, I already wrote a review but then deleted it because I gave this movie one more chance since it was praised so much.. And, after I opened my mind completely I came to realise that it wasn't as bad as I thought in the beginning.. It has some funny notes and makes a good point. It shows the true nature of relationships between maids, queens and other court ladies. And men.. But it all comes down to one thing.. Bare survival.. That was the thing that I liked the most about the Favourite.
What bothered me most was queen Anne's character. Sure, Coleman did great acting job but her character is pretty much repulsive to me.
Stone was ok but definitely not her best work.
Weisz, on the other hand, was superb and I wouldn't mind if she takes home one statuette at the oscars.BUT that doesn't mean that the movie itself deserves so many oscar nods because it is not something that we already haven't seen.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Don't let the trailer fool you. This film is one big cartoonish farce carry-on.,"The film does touch upon the absurdism of the ruling elite but barely which is why I will give it a 2 instead of a 1. It is stunning that this film is THE first film that elicited a desire for me to go to sleep. Sadly, I couldn't because of the appalling repetitive strings and organ playing, the former of which attempts to create a sense of pacing, the latter a sense of imminent castastrophe. The advertising of the film led me to believe that the film would focus on the wider history of why Queen Anne is the way she is, examining her reign and so on. However, this is not what the film does at all. NOTHING HAPPENS.Instead we get an initially semi-interesting but quickly uninteresting story of two largely similar machiavellian women who fight for the queen's affection, interspaced with a melange of scenes of palace debauchery, stunted attempts at comedic irony and absurdism, the odd slapstick moments and sarcastic ""witticisms"" that aren't really all that interesting of funny except if you are one of those who boast and prattle on endlessly endlessly about sarcasm being your ""second language"". The attempts to make the audience laugh are so frequent that the drama in the film is more akin to a bad television sitcom comedy-drama than a periodic drama. It's a shame that Queen Anne didn't play a more central role in the film. The acting was good, the writing and style of the film just wasn't.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
It's hard to know which is more pretentious...,"The film itself, or the highest rating reviews?For some reason, people seem to think enjoying this weirdly filmed, annoyingly scored piece of work makes them in some way more knowledgeable about film making than the non-purist.
Films, this one is not an exception, are made for profit, not just for the feeling of superiority they might engender among their viewers.Emperor's (or should that be Queen's) new clothes of the highest order.Where to start?A few ""C bombs"" thrown in for tittilation value and the playground conversation enhancing lesbian scenes. Not that any schoolboys would watch long enough to get the excitement necessary to produce that conversation in the first place.A comedy which doesn't make the viewer laugh (or even smile in our case) is not a comedy. Just calling something ""darkly comic"" or ""black humour"" doesn't make it funny when the actual humour is missing.Some of the camera angles and lenses used could cause a feeling of motion-sickness.
The use of repetitive stringed instrument notes bordering on the intolerable. I assume they are in there to give the impression of tension building. Without any tense ending to a scene when it finally subsides.A sure sign of a bad film, and make no mistake, this IS a bad film, is that the trailers for it gave NO indication of what it was about.I STILL have no idea of what it was about. Unless it's just 2 hours of the explanation of a tryst or two!!!The graphics are as pretentious and pointless as the rest of the film and many of the higher rated reviews I read.Little bits of nastiness between characters, for no legitimate purpose are thrown in, but any references to real history or events are scant, at best.Overall a triumph for the director, who obviously knew exactly what he wanted.
Which could have been OK if everyone else could have had a clue what he was thinking.I truly wanted to find a reason to give 2 stars to The Favouite, especially having looked forward to seeing it for so long - which is testimony to the hype surrounding it paying off - but I couldn't.
The single star is for costume and scenery.The rest, from the ""story"" to the acting, the camera work, the sound and especially the direction is overblown, tacky and hollow.Honestly one of the most over-rated films ever made.",,Anonymous,Biography
It's Good to Be the Queen,"The Favourite is a movie that tells the real life interesting story of Queen Anne (Colman) who did, indeed, allow herself to be influenced and manipulated by two women that were total polar opposites -- the extremely wealthy and beautiful Duchess of Marlborough (Weisz) who bullied the Queen, and the Duchess' lower class cousin Abigail Masham (Stone) who flattered the Queen. While this serves as the core story-line, the movie takes on its own interpretations to fill in the historical gaps, although many of which are actually based upon reliable sources.Ultimately, The Favourite is a well-done historical drama with some comedic elements, and packaged in a way that brings the early 18th century English court alive with beautiful sets/locations, elaborate costumes, and dry wit that is typical of English dialogue.While there are many reviews from others complaining that the movie was boring and lacking on comedic content, perhaps they missed that this is a historically based story intended to be realistic. So you shouldn't expect to see a real 18th century Queen of England to be depicted as a stand-up Sarah Silverman delivering a litany of crude, adolescent jokes. If that is what you are looking for, you probably need look no further than the $1 movie bin at Walmart.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Favourite has really set the bar high for 2019!,"I have never written a review before but having read through tons of reviews on here I could not keep quiet. Its actually frustrating just how many duplicate negative reviews there are on here, showing just how far people will go to hate on a film?! As well as these duplicates, I also noticed a common theme througout the negative comments, many of which praised the acting, sets and costumes but ultimately all had a seemingly unproked hatred for the film. I cannot help but think that this common opinion is more than just a coincidence!I saw The Favorite this evening with my wife and must say, even with our quite different tastes in movies, we both loved it! Keeping this simple. The Favourite, is funny, at moments even laugh out loud, it's quirky, but not too off beat and it's a fantastic story of love, loss, betryal and deception. Brilliant film all round! The movies of 2019 have a lot to live up to!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Will This Be Your Favorite,"Robbie K with another quick review as he hits the more artistic nature of the film this holiday season. With a wonderful reception at the various film festivals, this movie held high hopes for being a winning masterpiece for the late year. With a promising cast, good direction, and a unique twist to normal films, I went in eagerly to see what awaited. What was the verdict? Robbie's reviews here to share his opinions as he reviews:Movie: The Favourite (2018)Director:

Writers:
Deborah Davis, Tony McNamara
Stars:
Olivia Colman, Emma Stone, Rachel WeiszLIKES:The Acting
The Setting
The Costumes/Makeup
The Character Development
The Strategy
The Presentation, mostlySummary: Film festival features are seldom squandered out of acting, and the Favourite is no exception. Rachel Weisz succeeds in her abilities as the lady of the manor, with poise, regality, and a cunning nature fitting of the character designed. Stone's transition throughout the movie is admirable, starting on end of the personality spectrum, yet showing the evolving psyche of the players of late century politics. Colman as well is an integral piece, ushering in the role and acting as the key pillar for this mad state of affairs.
But acting aside, The Favourite stands out for it's beautiful setting, with the location team and set crew working hand and hand to fashion a fitting battlefield for our femme fatales of the silver screen. The manor and all its hallowed halls and manicured lawns will take you on that international trip to historical England, immersing you into the themes at hand. As such, the characters themselves are quite dashing in their costumes, every politician, maid, and governmental officiant a welcoming tribute to the paintings of old. The leading women in particular have ravishing costumes and makeup, helping to unleash the full effect of the movie.
Yet it is the character centric story that really takes all the aforementioned strengths and pulls them together. The Favourite's focus on developing all the characters, including a few secondary characters that at first seem mere parlor tricks. As the film progresses, the strategy at hand also starts to evolve in a Game Of Thrones like technique without so much blood and murder, as inner wants and jealousy lead to some rather interesting choices. And all of this is presented beautifully in the film work's techniques. Odd angles and dark hallways mirror the tone of the movie, as a haunting soundtrack of European orchestra plays in the back adding more to the emotions of the characters. Presenting all of this as if it were a Shakespearean play only adds to the ambience of the movie, and helps this film stand out a little more in terms of artistic wonder. Yes, it certainly feels like a Thespian tragedy at hand and a nod to this approach and helping it shine in victory.DISLIKES:The Pace at times
The Animal Cruelty
The Inclusion Of Seedier Culture
The Ending's FinesseSummary: While artistic and brilliantly presented, the movie for me ran a little slow at times. The opening of the film did its introduction well, with the first couple of acts taking time to introduce the world in appropriate detail. Eventually as the rivalry develops. Things really start to take off, only to slightly take a rather large detour that offset the pace disrupting the very thing I fell in love with on the movie, with the end probably being where the steam was fully lost. Certainly some of the loss of detail comes in with the focus of documenting every move in this game of human chess, which I didn't mind.
Instead, the real loss of pace came from some of the extra details added for more of a cultural reflection of the times (details Shakespeare loved). While some of the animal cruelty showed the off the past times of the British high life, I did not need to see the repeated defeat of the small creatures, while other times were just unnecessary quirks that seemed forced and rushed in at the end. In addition some of the seedier shots such as rape, self-pleasure, and other acts of hazing didn't quite add anything to the story or feel of the movie, when my main goal was to see the power play between the two champion actresses. Sadly, this semi-focus on the animalistic side of the characters sort of deterred from the plot for me and added unnecessary length to the movie.
And like my fellow reviewers, I do agree that the film's ending did not quite suit me given all the build-up. It ends rather vaguely, and although it mirrors the Greek Tragedy's delivery, it did not quite have the same satisfaction that those ancient playwrights had. Instead, it seemed that the Favourite had a rather rushed, messy finish that gives you all the pieces you need to draw up your own conclusions of what occurred. Outside of throwing off the pace in the final two acts, the ending just didn't deliver that last punch I had wanted, or at least in the manner I wanted.The VERDICT:Overall the Favourite is worthy of much of the praise it received from the festivals. The presentation is beautiful on many levels as it deters from the usual linear fashion, and it seems to really pay tribute to the tragedies that this tale is based on. In addition the story really speaks out to the culture and darker parts of history that sometimes don't get told in the text books. Yet, it's ironically that very presentation that took some of the flair away from the movie, as getting lost in the grimier aspects of human nature threw off the pace of the film and left the ending a semi-complete telling that could have used twenty minutes more to flesh out the final number with that woman's scorn I think we wanted. Overall, the movie gets points for its presentation style, but it may not quite have all the categories needed to warrant a trip to the movies in my opinion. Still, give this one a try at home if you are looking for something.My scores are:Biography/Comedy/Drama: 7.5

Brilliant! Hilarious!,"And beautiful locations, sets and cinematography. Good acting as well, I really liked all of the 3 women leads. Crazy and very character driven plot, about the lifestyle for some women in the royal home of the queen of England in the 1700s (I think that's the time period?). Not sure if this film holds steady to any real particular historical events, doesn't really matter, that's not what it's about at all anyway. It's about people and relationships people have to each other. It's very funny, all though the comedy here, is very unique, because it isn't potrayed at all as it's trying to be funny, still it is. Probably because it rings true somewhere, even if it's totally insane, it's relatable, I'm not sure but I think that is why the humour works. I had a good time with this film. It's beautiful too.

Not a review,"It is really not a review. Just a question maybe.
Why do people watch this movie when they literally know they'll not like it?
Since directors can't make their own movies like they did before, we know that people want to see sequels and watch the same thing over and over.Those that go to the cinema to see something with Dwayne are hate this movie.
Those people would rate almost every movie from the top250 with a 1 because they too much used to see trash only. I understand it.
But why do you go to see a movie like this and then come here and rate it with a 1? Really.Imdb needs a change. It should not even allow to count the votes from people under 1000 votes. Sick of it.Otherwise, I loved the movie until the very end. Felt like Barry Lyndon a little.
Too much fish eye. I liked it, it was fitting in same cases, it was new and good use of it, but it was too much. Low light shots could have been better but I'm not here to teach that cinematographer. (He did a bad job for sure, along with the director. Again, Barry Lyndon. They could have easily achieve the same.)Overall, it was all good until the very end.I liked The lobster more.

IT'S A CURRENT FAVORITE FOR ME...!,"Yorgos Lanthimos' Oscar bait from last year which yielded Oscar gold for Olivia Coleman (for Best Actress) is a period piece which dusts off the stodginess off of most period pieces. Not being especially well liked by me (especially 2 of his earlier efforts The Lobster & The Killing of a Sacred Deer), Lanthimos finally finds a project which perfectly suits his esthetic. Queen Anne is out of sorts in her kingdom both externally (they're at war w/France) & at home (she's childless) & the only thing holding everything together is her loyal (& conniving) lady in waiting played by Rachel Weisz but things get more interesting when a distant cousin (played by Oscar nominee Emma Stone) comes into the picture & turns the household upside down. Mixing influences as disparate as Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (its use of fish eye lenses & natural lighting) & Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette (modern sensibilities brought to a chamber drama) w/a razor sharp wit that could cut diamonds, this film opens the possibility for future takes which can winnow out the cobwebs of a genre most viewers may find quaint or picturesque. Also starring Nicholas Hoult (the current Beast in the X-Men series) & more bunnies you can shake an Easter Sunday at.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The Favourite: A Game of Power, Desire, and Historical Distortion","The Favourite is a visually arresting period drama that delves into the power struggles and emotional entanglements of 18th-century British court life, magnifying these elements to their most extreme. Director Yorgos Lanthimos, known for his unconventional approach, infuses the film with modern aesthetics and dark humor, creating a world that feels both absurd and claustrophobic. However, despite its undeniable visual appeal and strong performances, the film's treatment of historical accuracy leaves much to be desired, particularly in its portrayal of Queen Anne.Set during England's war with France, the story revolves around a frail and emotionally unstable Queen Anne (played by Olivia Colman), her confidante and adviser Lady Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz), and the ambitious newcomer Abigail Hill (Emma Stone), who rises from a fallen noble to become the Queen's new favorite. As Sarah manages the kingdom in Anne's stead, Abigail seizes an opportunity to ingratiate herself with the Queen, sparking a fierce rivalry between the two women.Visually, The Favourite is nothing short of stunning. Lanthimos' use of natural lighting and wide-angle lenses heightens the suffocating atmosphere of court life, while the opulent costumes and meticulously designed sets bring the decadent, decaying world of 18th-century England to life. These elements work together to create a palpable tension, where power and ambition simmer beneath every interaction.However, I found the film's handling of historical figures deeply unsatisfying. The real Queen Anne, despite her health issues, was far from the weak and easily manipulated figure depicted here. Historically, she played a critical role in the political decisions of her reign, and while she was undoubtedly a complicated character, the film reduces her to little more than a puppet, swayed by the whims of those around her. This dramatized version sacrifices historical nuance for the sake of theatrical conflict, stripping Anne of the agency she possessed in reality.Olivia Colman delivers a memorable performance, one that earned her an Academy Award for Best Actress. Yet, the film is largely driven by the perspectives of Weisz and Stone, whose characters engage in a twisted battle of wills for the Queen's favor. Both actresses are at the top of their game, with Weisz embodying Sarah's calculated strength and Stone portraying Abigail's cunning rise to power. However, as the story progresses, the once thrilling rivalry between them begins to lose momentum, and the film's pacing falters in the second half, becoming somewhat repetitive.Moreover, the film's deliberate anachronisms, such as the bizarre and out-of-place dance sequences, while humorous, clash with the overall tone and may alienate viewers seeking a more historically grounded narrative. These modern flourishes, though perhaps intended as clever subversions, ultimately detract from the film's coherence, pulling the audience out of the period setting and into something more akin to a farce.In the end, The Favourite is a visually sumptuous drama, but its heavy-handed historical liberties and reductive character portrayals prevent it from reaching its full potential. While the performances and aesthetic choices are certainly commendable, the imbalance between style and substance leaves the narrative feeling hollow. For viewers who appreciate Lanthimos' stylized direction, this film may still offer an engaging experience, but for those hoping for a more faithful retelling of history, it will likely disappoint.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Okay, this calls for another kind of reviewing, doesn't it?","I guess I went through as many stages of appreciation as acid pills taken during the making. Did they try to make a punk version of 'Dangerous Liaisons' or was the director channelling Darren Aronofsky making 'The Madness of Queen Anne', I can't articulate my feelings in order to form a general appreciation, not now anyway. I have to enumerate all my key-reactions in chronological order.1st minute:. It's got quite a nice look, the costumes are all right. I know like period movies, I like 18th century, Barry Lyndon, The Duchess, and all that. I think I'm gonna like thi.1st minute 10 seconds: I'm suddenly not so 100% sure that it's gonna be your average costume movie. I should have figured that with the credits and titles' display.2nd minute: what's with my camera-lens trick? Another ""And Now For Something's Completely Different"" moment and I'll be groaning.10 minutes: (groaning)15 minutes: feeling like that judge in the trial films: ""this is better getting somewhere""....25 minutes: the slap! finally, this got somewhere after all. Cool I waited for it.My faith is restored.
25 minutes, 10 seconds: Not so fast. Never mind the profanity but I didn't know the term ""OK"" was used in the 18th century England.
25 minutes, 20 seconds: playing with the wheelchair... what the bloody hell?!
25 minutes, 30 seconds: OK, they might as well kiss each other, nothing will surprise me...
25 minutes, 45 seconds: What did I say?!30 minutes: at that point, I would see Weisz sticking her booger on a Stone's face, I wouldn't be surprised, seems like randomness is mistaken for pointlessness, or is it the other way around, I don't think I care anymore ... my brain is telling me ""Mama, I wanna go home!""40 minutes: OK, characters are well-established, Im getting used to the overall iconoclast tone and there were a few genuinely good parts (even genius at time) and the acting is truly Oscar-worthy..1hour 20 minutes: OK if I forget about that naked man with the tomatoes thrown at his body, we've had almost an hour of cinematic consistency where I could appreciate better the performances of both Stone, Weisz and understand why Colman is credited as the lead.1hour 40 minutes: my mind is processing, is it supposed to say something about women in power or the different layers of power with the favorite playing like consiglieri, is it about women power or just the way power corrupts everyone so there's no reason for women to be least corruptible... or maybe we have just a fantastic duel between two rivals who want to be the one who pulls the strings even if it means strangling the other with them. Seems like we already have a winner then, right?1hout 55 minutes: that scene is dragging on and on, it'd be better be the ending... oh so it's finished. She did win but was it the ""she"" I expected? not really. Well, the film outgrew its initial bizarreness, was consistently interesting, made me think and had a satisfying ending. I can see the hype was somewhat deserved after all. But I can't say I had an instant liking, it's really demanding in terms of patience but maybe it's a film that takes time to grow on you.Not for any taste or audience, but definitely a memorable experience, and so unpleasant at times you've got to admire its daringness, you can say it's over-stylized but that's the kind of thing you say about film that are all flash and no substance, this one has both and sometimes, flash and substance act like the two favourites in the film.

Wickedly entertaining and accurate depiction of an unwelcome menage a trois,"Firstly, this is not for simple palates. It lacks obvious dramatic moments and the kind of crowd-pleasing finale that the cousins seem to need. In their place, the film offers endless nuance, psychological and emotional truth and an ending that perfectly fits the story as told. And it packages all of that in a deceptively simple movie. And deception is the word here. This is like Liaisons Dangereuses for real people.
The cast, Rachel Weisz, Emma Stone and Olivia Colman all bring their considerable A game to a very smart and very witty script. The cinematography is spot-on and the music is idiosyncratic and sheer perfection.
Of course, all these attributes inevitably limit the film's audience. I imagine that showings outside the big coastal cities of the US will be less than enthusiastically welcomed but that's a very small and unavoidable price to pay. If you got past third grade and have an IQ in triple digits, buy a ticket now.
A footnote for those who gave the movie a poor or worse rating: because you lack the education, breadth of vision or humanity to understand what's really a very simple story, don't blame the film, the actors or the filmmaker.

Understand that this is not a comedy,"This is my first review and I'm writing it to address some of the ridiculous 1/2 star reviews I saw on here before watching the film.I've seen a lot of negative reviews suggesting that this film was billed as a comedy. I personally haven't seen anything to suggest as such and I think it's worth understanding the type of film you are going to watch before actually...going to watch it.The script and cast are incredible and whilst there is an underlying dark humour and some very funny lines for Queen Anne (the amazing Olivia Coleman), this is a period drama based (very loosely) on the true story of Queen Anne and her two subordinates in the 17th century. It is not a comedy.This film/genre isn't something that I would have paid to go and see normally however I was convinced by the make up of the cast and the positive critic reviews. I wasn't disappointed. Throughout, the film was entertaining, funny, dramatic however the reason that I have not scored this 9 or 10 stars is just that it was a little too bizarre for my taste. Some of the fisheye lens shots and the score seemed just a little too much at times to a simple cinema-goer like me however on the whole thoroughly enjoyed it.

"Not for everyone, and that's the point","Yorgos Lanthimos is a director that loves to challenge his viewers. He uses a variety of subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) film-making and story-telling techniques that assist him in punching up the story he is trying to tell. The viewer will likely fall into one of two camps: people that are interested in the art of filmmaking enough to pick up on, appreciate, and understand these techniques, and people that just wanted to watch a movie and not be subjected to subtle psychological prodding.You can see this division play out in these reviews, with most people either highly praising the film, or saying it was boring, a waste of time, unsettling, disturbing, and nonsensical. The funny thing is that the critics are not entirely wrong with these labels - the film actually is at times unsettling, disturbing, and nonsensical, and intentionally so. This is trademark Lanthimos.The classic example of one of Lanthimos' techniques, and something of his own trademark prior to this film, was the way characters in his films would speak in clipped, unnatural ways to keep the viewer off balance. Thankfully he has dropped that from this film, as I feel it was starting to hold him back a little. But he has included in its place a wide variety of interesting camera angles, lenses, lighting (such as intentional bad lighting, with faces darkened, something you rarely see), a soundtrack that transitions from pleasant to jarring and back, and anachronisms thrown in (Intentionally I believe).Where I diverge strongly from the critics is that I found this film to be highly compelling and not boring in the slightest. The acting was absolutely superb, with Emma Stone in particular knocking it out of the park. The interplay between the three female lead characters was fascinating. The historical context created by the sets and scenery were mind blowing and I wish I could have seen this on the big screen to really appreciate it. And the aforementioned techniques kept me on the edge of my seat and guessing at what would come next throughout.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
I was entertained,"I love historical movies for the costumes, location, and music and I thoroughly enjoyed that from this movie. I also liked the dynamic of the characters although the last 20 minutes kind of fell flat for me. Save your pennies and wait until it comes out on Netflix if you're on the fence to see this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tastless waste of time,"Agree that the scenery is beautiful and costumes authentic; however, what a waste of 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. Story line is trite, flimsy, and often in such bad taste it's hard to stomach. Needless nastiness. Could have been somewhat of a classic; however, it is trash.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Definitely Not The Comedy It Was Marketed To Be,"Olivia Coleman performs superbly as Queen Anne in this period drama that was somewhat deceptively and misleadingly marketed more as a comedy which it definitely strains at accomplishing such a designation. Instead this strongly more somber and serious drama with mild interludes of humor should be expected as such when viewing this movie. The photography is striking in its bold and sharply projected visual impact, reminiscent of amazing camera work from This is Cinerama (1952) and Brainstorm (1983) both very still relevant in today's photographic approaches to visual artistic endeavors. The background music and sound effects are eerily similar to the more creepy and sinister motif of the Under the Skin (1983) and cast an odd off-balance mood during the movie, definitely off-setting the supposed comedic tone of the film. But it is in the presentation and scripted story that the more graphic and decadent, sometimes even raw and gross behavior of the Royal Court that oozes out of the movie that can captivate the audience with its voyeuristic behind the scenes purveyor of sordid delights. The movie jumps around a bit with its editing and its characters eventually are not that endearing making this movie somewhat less appealing then the typical and much more traditional movies that attempt to capture the vicarious mood of Victorian England.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Opulent, beautiful, outlandish, psychodynamic! ...either love it or hate it. I LOVED it.","One can tell from divergent reviews everywhere, one either loves the style of the film and Lanthimos storytelling - or hates it (or has very high and unfulfilled expectations).Personally, I was blown away by the well composed images, tilted angles, muted colors, weird emotional close ups and melancholic, surreal wide-angle shots. In my point of view, the actors fill their characters brilliantly. The music, the costumes, the production design, the lighting, the typefaces - all is super well executed! Love for details - you can feel it in every frame. WOW.The film torments the viewer with unreal, dragging passages, metaphors, allegories (which made me think of e.g. the first part of MELANCHOLIA by von Trier, where nothing 'really' happens for 1 hour...), but delights the viewer with funny, grotesque, thrilling, haunting, disturbing moments in between. I believe that this contrasting behavior strengthens the plot, overall storytelling dynamic and the emotional impact onto the viewer.I, personally, am very glad I've sat through those 2 hours of raw human nature disguised as rich, royal monarchy - the images gave me a long lasting inspiration and the music plays on. Thank you for that masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Theatre,"I hated the music. I actually thought something was wrong there.I hate spoilers, and the title kinda spoiled everything. I guess you can say that ""Titanic"" is a bigger spoiler.Loved the actors.It was sort of like going to the theatre.I didn't know the story beforehand, so thanks for telling it.Normally I would give it 5, but I rate it 7/10 because everything is done a little differently than we're used to seeing. And Emma Stone.",,Anonymous,Biography
I don't usually like place intrigue...but this works,"Don't really enjoy palace intrigue stories much, but I enjoyed this one. The big difference? Farce. Most films about courts take themselves sooooo seriously (and move sooooo slowly). This on did not. And every extreme (from events to performances to dance moves) pays off with a laugh. Plus, those laughs never undercut the tension created by the main characters. I had seen this story before, but I had not seen it done this well.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Not the best Lanthimos, but still a good movie","It is curious to think that Yorgos Lanthimos' most conventional and less ""insane"" film is being the most successful of his career. In fact, ""The favourite"" that has been collecting awards. There are already a total of 134, entitled to a Golden Globe for actress Olivia Colman and seven awards Bafta, The film still won ten Oscar nominations. But ""The favourite"" is far from having the complications, the sadisms and to cause that discomfort that had its previous works, ""The killing of the sacred deer"" and ""The Lobster"". With a more palatable film that was not written by Lanthimos and his latecomer Efthymis Filippou, the Greek director eventually got the chance to win more sympathy from the members of the academy.And this proves that no matter how much the Oscar tries to be more sympathetic to other, less expensive Oscar production - and the ""Black Panther"" nomination for the best film signals that - the academy always has its limits. Films in which you have to decide whether or not a family member with echoes in Greek mythology such as ""The Sacrifice of the Sacred Deer"" or a little more intricate scripts like ""The Lobster"" still has not come this far. Everything, however, can change with the winds.But of course ""The Favourite"" is still a good movie because of it. If there is a mark of Lanthimos in this film is the irony and the almost contempt with which its characters are treated. Lanthimos is almost marvelously cruel to ridicule royalty with a subtlety and at the same time a caricatured tone of a great charizard. All right with a few shots that send a spectator who seems to be just lurking, looking through the keyhole and scenarios of kitschy exaggeration, a luxury that provocatively borders on bad taste.In their hands, the whole monarchy tradition is pathetic. The way the queen should be treated (never turn to her, do not look at her without being asked) the ridiculous makeup of the men and even a fierce run of ducks and lobsters. Everything sounds kitsch as if Lanthimos told us: ""How did we sustain this ridiculous theater for so many centuries and still today?""In the center of ""The Favourite"" is a dispute involving hatred, jealousy, envy between two women, Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz) and Abigail (Emma Stone) for the attention of Queen Anne (beautifully lived by Olivia Colman). The fight is ridiculous, childish. Worse, rich and spoiled children.From the outset a rivalry has been established between the two distant cousins. One wanting to maintain the power of influence over the queen and, consequently, over the government, which is facing a military battle against France. The other, an ex-lady who lost everything in some failed marriage wanting to recover the money and status she had once had. It's all about power, influence, and wealth.For this, both use all the weapons they have. If they sabotage, they ironize themselves, all with the perceptive look of the queen, who loves the dispute of the two to seduce her. At bottom, the queen has a wit at the same time that Lanthimos exposes the strange eccentricities of the monarchs.At bottom, the question of war inside the palace has more to do with the mood of the queen and the political and extra political games inside the palace than properly a practical and objective question. But is it so in any political scenario, we could argue? Yes, but when it comes to royalty it gains even more proportions in the futilities and eccentricities of the court.Lanthimos filmed the ridiculous with a mixture of satire and poison and, best of all, making everything seem very serious. It is not your most interesting film, but how can you not delight in the display of luxury and kitsch in a court of futile and miserable values such as that built by the Greek director?In fact, Lanthimos did it again. And on this we can only applaud.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
In the land of the postmodern artefact,"The Favourite is a period farce, exploiting the ills of a weak British monarch, Queen Anne, and the ambitions of two court ladies who are vying for power and money, using sex as a weapon.
So what is new? The ancient Greeks knew all about ambition or the scheming female mind. Shakespeare borrowed material avidly. Both the Greeks and the Great Bard knew their way around the human heart and navigated expertly past the Scylla and Charybdis of every passion imaginable, examining what is lowly and petty, but also what is noble and lofty. The old Masters were no fools; they knew the exact extent of the depthless pit to which humanity can stoop, from Medea to Lady Macbeth.
What is new is that the old Masters did not sweep everything under the carpet - even if that is a royal one. They did not equate all actions under the guise of mirth. They did not hide the vacuousness of ambition behind a royal costume, did not curtsy when faced with a cute line or a pair of blue eyes, did not hesitate when the time came to place a value on human action. They took their audiences to human hell, again and again. But they brought them back, too! The audience knew a fallen hero, but they also knew a hero who rose again in all the glory of redemption. There was a clear delineation between noble and low, divine and beastly, light and darkness.
The Favourite makes no such distinctions. Everything goes. In the labyrinth of the palace corridors, viewed through the distorted, elliptical lens of Lanthimos, who admittedly knows his stuff, the audience becomes witness to a dirty game of sex and power. And if we are left starving for a little moment of kindness and simplicity and pity, mainly for ourselves, a moment that might redeem humanity, Lanthimos will not relent. A persistent sound, reminiscent of that other vacuous film, Irreversible, which was built around the brutal sodomy of Monica Bellucci, reverberates persistently through the palace corridors and through our mind, sodomising again and again our need for a little hope for our human selves. The cacophony shreds to pieces any notion of redemption, as an ugly, fat, ailing, lost Queen Anne - chapeau to the performance by Olivia Colman - stumbles through the artfully ornate chambers of the palace, screaming: Where am I?
I will tell you where you are, your Highness. You are in the land of the postmodern artefact. The land where, as Jameson, the Marxist critic would say, a random cannibalisation of old styles is carried out with dexterity, a land where the Grand Masters and the old hierarchy of what is ariston and what isn't, are meticulously muddled up, dressed in pomp and duck races and a little seemingly innocuous fun, as men and women cannibalise each other senselessly. But the fun is not innocuous and the parody is but a pastiche, that fails to condemn that which it parodies and does not provide any alternatives for that which it supposedly cauterizes. Because it does not cauterize and therefore does not heal. The wound remains open, much like the wounds on the legs of the Queen, much like the pain for her seventeen dead babies or her need for a friend. And much like our need for the artist, to come along and clear up the mist of any doubt and present us with the perfect diamond of our humanity. We are more than that, more than a quick hand job in the dark, more than a desperate pleasuring with the tongue in return for a title of nobility or a handful of golden sovereigns. Much, much more than that. Art has an obligation to itself to go past the Scylla and the Charybdis, wave to the sirens from afar and then reach the rightful place of its destination.
That is the real palace, the real hegemony.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Masterpiece,"Yorgos Lanthimos's unique directing makes it a film that you either love or hate. For me, I loved it! It is eccentric, humorous, entertaining, dark and tragic.

You find yourself changing the leading lady you root for throughout the film due to the tonal shifts.Their characters are well crafted and complex.The writing is full of wit and the pacing is good.

An odd take on one particular British monarch's legacy and the ones who served her,"The Favourite is a period drama directed by Yorgos Lanthimos (The Lobster, The Killing of a Sacred Deer). Starring Olivia Colman, Emma Stone, and Rachel Weisz, it is an odd take on one particular British monarch's legacy and the ones who served her.In the early 1700s, Britain is at war with France and the British Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) sits upon her throne taking advice on ruling from her loyal adviser Sarah Churchill, the Duchess of Marlborough (Rachel Weisz). However, one day Sarah's broke cousin Abigail (Emma Stone) shows up looking for work and catches the attention of the Queen. Over time, Abigail gains the Queen's favour and is promoted as her personal attendant, much to the envy of Sarah, who feels she is being pushed aside for someone better.Well-acted and shot, The Favourite is an interesting yet strange film about an intense rivalry in 18th century England. Both Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz are appropriately catty and spiteful towards one another, and it is fun to watch how each one tries to outdo the other. Olivia Colman also shines as Queen Anne, clearly having fun playing up her character's eccentricities. The film has wonderful set pieces, much in the vein of Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon and Milos Forman's Amadeus, and one can certainly appreciate the effort that has been made to make the film look as authentic as possible. Unfortunately, though, the film does suffer from some pacing issues and a questionable ending. In terms of plot, there is not much shown other than the two servants vying for the Queen's attention and considering the film's two hour running time, this almost feels like a wasted opportunity for some showcase of the war between Britain and France. In addition to this, the film is a slow burner, not becoming particularly engaging until about twenty minutes in. It is understandable why this has little mainstream appeal and most audiences will be put off by its slow start, but overall, the film is still worth seeing for the solid performances of the three lead actresses and the eye catching set design.I rate it 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A more crowd-pleasing Lanthimos film, but still Lanthimos style","Well, I guess Lanthimos is a top notch in Europe right now, trying to ""win"" international market (mostly US), that are used to delightful comedies , badass adventures and Super heroes movies.
This is a film that makes you feel a bit weird, uncomfortable , and makes you think in many levels. A typical Lanthimos film but lighter. If you felt very weird and sick watching this, then don't bother watching any of his other movies! I dare anyone to watch ""Kynodontas"" ! It's the most daring (I cannot find words to describe it) film I've ever watched, but every Lanthimos movie does something to your head and makes you see things clearly (if it doesn't watch it again and again).
This movie is not a waste of time (as some of you describe...) , it IS a Masterpiece, and it IS so True! It is about survival , manipulation , woman power , witty , using sex to gain power , and lots of rivalry !
So if you want just to relax in your couch , eat popcorn , watch a film and then sleep, don't watch a Lanthimos film!!! That's a general advice. But if you want to watch something that you'll remember for the rest of your life, that could be life-changing, then that's a movie that you should watch!
Lanthimos has a unique style (kind of reminds me of Stanley Kubrick) , and I'm always looking forward to watching his films!
So great that he managed to get all these awards for this movie. The performances were above perfect! I'm curious to see how it goes at the Oscars. I would give him the oscar for everything by far!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Scathing but just critique of our world,"The negative reviews here come from those who:
1) expect historical accuracy
2) are puritanical
3) expect films to adhere ruthlessly to conventions of plot, character development, soundtrack, etc.4) want to feel good about themselves and the world and will not tolerate anything less.Yorgos Lanthimos is one of the brightest talents today who has been telling us what he feels about our way of living since Dogtooth, The Lobster, The Killing of a Sacred Deer, and The Favourite.In each viewing, I've found myself asking myself the question- what is he trying to say? And the response comes in the form of more questions- what is the significance of this manner of lighting, this type of shot, this expression, this sound effect? I find myself more and more immersed in his world, and this kind of thinking goes on after the film ends. Lanthimos is, in short, an artist who respects the capability of the viewer to meet him half way, to take on the challenge of responding to his art. He asks that the viewer look beyond the face value.Contrast what he says about class relations-culminating with the powerful final scene-with what Bong Joon-Ho says through Parasite. Lanthimos recognizes that the wheel crushes us all, whereas Bong revels with sadistic glee in the film that made him bedfellows with Hollywood. The same Bong, who in his masterpiece Memories of Murder demonstrated a generous, humane vision.I can't wait to see what Lanthimos does next.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A lost opportunity,"Having seen all the rave reviews, the awards and the short clips, I was really looking forward to seeing this film. However, whilst the acting was excellent and the film moved along quite briskly, this was frequently spoiled by either the very irritating bonging or over-loud music. None of which seemed to add anything to the story.I accept this was not intended as a biography, although the main characters were based on real people, the plot could actually have been more interesting if 18th century politics rather than the bedroom had been explored in more detail. Both Anne and Sarah outlived all their children and in Anne's case must have affected her already poor health. However making fun of this seems a rathe dismal approach compounded by some ridiculous scenes - the dancing for example - which were not funny, just puerile. More wit and less lavatorial humour could have really helped.An okay film but I shan't be watching it again..",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Great acting, plain story","It's interesting to see such film gets so much hate and love from people in the same time. There are certain ""love it or hate it"" kind of movies but I think this is not one of them. I'd say it's an average story, definitely not boring, but also not fascinating.Great acting, costumes and decore are the highlights but after investing 2 hours into a movie, they are not enough saving the day. But great acting will leave some memorable moments I'm sure, especially Queen Anne character (got the Oscar for it and deserved it)By the way I had the feeling that I'm watching a Paul Thomas Anderson movie at first. The tone and especially disturbing (but this one is failing) soundtrack made me feel that director's style is a bit too much influenced by him. Also one other thing I'm glad I haven't seen this one in theater.

A fly-on-the-wall exploration to a story nearly lost to time.,"A drama woven with dark comedy, much like Lanthimos' past films The Lobster (2015) & The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017), set in 18th century England yet feeling just as relevant today. The locations & costuming are impeccable while utilizing natural light to give the film the feeling of a Caravaggio painting come to life. Wide-angle lenses are used in many shots to show the entirety of a room, displaying our subject small in the frame as if trapped inside something bigger than themselves. The fish-eye lens also gives the audience the view of peeking into this world we don't belong to see all that it has to offer, from its glamour to its garbage. But where this film truly shines are the performances by the three female leads: Olivia Colman, Emma Stone, & Rachel Weisz.

Superb acting in a fanciful tale,"Superb acting by the three principals - Olivia Coleman, Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone. This is a decidedly unflattering account of Queen Anne's reign frivolously disregarding timelines (Queen Anne's husband was alive during much of this movie's fractured timeline) and embracing gossip (about Anne's lesbian predilection that is disavowed by most historians). The rise and fall of Sarah Churchill and Abigail Hills influence as favourites, although a reality, had other credible political motivations. Much of this movie paints a picture of an ineffectual culture of fops and frivolities in court life, whereas the politics and the principles of the time were a lot more serious and calculating, as was Queen Anne's legacy (the United Kingdom was birthed under Anne's reign). But, as a fanciful history, there is great humour and tragedy in this movie and the acting is truly superb. I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Costume Comedic Drama}",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Favourite,"The Favourite is a period piece with the touch of Yorgos Lanthimos unique style all over it . It is unfair , I feel , to compare it to Barry Lyndon , as I see this movie stands on its own as one of the best period pieces that were filmed.
First of this movie is just gorgeous to look at with great costumes and makeup , cinematography was good not with issues but not big ones , and the use of mostly practical lighting was a great choice by Yorgos and
Robbie Ryan .
Although Lanthimos didn't make his actors look emotionless and talk like robots but Olivia Coleman was brilliant playing the depressed Queen Anne who was a sensitive child looking for love , accompanied by what I think must be Emma Stone's best performance and a solid one from Rachel Weisz , playing the cousins who want to win her over .
It is a funny movie with clever dialogue and some political commentary from here to there and lots of good performances and a director who is going to make his name remembered in the not so distant future , just go watch it .",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Favourite: 'It's all about me!',"Set in 18th century England, Director Yorgos Lanthimos's ""The Favourite"" stars Emma Stone as maid Abigail and Rachel Weisz as Lady Sarah, who both serve Queen Anne, played by amazing Olivia Colman. In ""The Favourite"" Abigail and Sarah contest to be Anne's 'favourite' in more than conventional distinctions.Rachel's Sarah is Lady Marlborough, whose husband leads the English military campaign against the French. The physically unattractive self-aware Queen suffers from gout and associated maladies; thus, rendering Sarah as her renegade proxy. The Machiavellian Sarah instructs Anne to double the taxes to finance the War effort to support her husband, ending the War, and bringing him home.Pretty young Abigail, played by Emma, arrives on the scene reunited with her cousin Sarah, played by Rachel. Abigail was from a noble family, but dark financial times beset her Father, who sold her to the older German rival, essentially selling her into sexual slavery. Consequently, Abigail is driven by redemption. She seeks to regain her nobility and stature at any cost. Perhaps, cousin Sarah becomes her leverage point?Sarah enlists Abigail to tend to the Queen, while she basically manages the affairs of England. The skilled herbalist Abigail soon gains favored status of Anne, played by Olivia. One night while surprisingly educated Abigail reads in Anne's library, she discovers the nature of Sarah's relationship with the Queen. It becomes transparent to Abigail what she must do to become the Queen's ""Favourite"".Olivia plays Anne with touching wounded loneliness. Her Anne knows that she can get whatever she wants, because she is the Queen. If not for that, hardly anyone would want anything to do with her. Olivia's profound sadness in Anne humanizes the angry beast. She exposes the lightness and darkness in Anne, and in ourselves. Anne is all about herself, as is everyone in Writers Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara's narrative.In a defining scene in a local bar, Emma's Abigail confesses, ""I'm on my side!"" The hysterical, yet mostly anguished narrative of ""The Favourite"" is: It's all about me. In Yorgos's tale women rule with power up front and behind the scenes. This is not necessarily the polarized #Metoo narrative either. Yorgos depicts the well of ugliness in society in vast contrast to the stunning visuals of Robbie Ryan's beautiful cinematography. We see Sarah riding her horse on the immaculate English estate. At the same time, Abigail and Sarah scheme to one up the other in gaining the Queen's favors in the palace.Both Emma and Rachel are inspired. Rachel's Sarah is the regal lioness, who takes no prisoners. However, in her utter humiliation Rachel reveals her humanity in redemption. Emma is brilliant initially enrolling us in the suffering innocent maiden with the tortured soul. Emma subtly transforms Abigail as the gentle eyed ruthless mercenary. For Abigail the ends and the means are the same. In the heartbreaking scene Sarah cries to Anne, ""I never lied to you... That's love."" Perhaps, love is more than just that.""The Favourite"" might be one of the best movies of the year. Yet, I wasn't on anyone's ""side"" in ""The Favourite"". Everyone in the movie is all about themselves. I suppose that's Yorgos, Deborah and Tony's point. ""The Favourite"" is hysterical with its clever banter of classism and sexism. Yet, ultimately it is all very sad. Everyone uses someone else. And so goes the world of ""The Favourite"". ""The Favourite"" is a great movie, although not my favorite. Let's put it this way: I won't be seeing it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Love has limits."" ""It should not.""","Undoubtedly, The Favourite is extremely entertaining, but it is still very ""Lanthimos"". The film reverses time to 18th-century England, and the story is taken from the real event between the Duchess Sarah Churchill and Queen Anne. Curiously, unlike most orthodox British court dramas, the primitive etiquette and political laws of the upper class society have been reduced to the fringe, and the movie has been replaced by the strange and absurd triangle love talk under the power structure. Absurdity always is the first consideration for Lanthimos to build a character survival system.Lanthimos uses a large number of wide-angle lenses, fisheye lenses and low-angle upward shots to create a grotesque, alienated atmosphere.For most people, these lenses may not be as visually comfortable, but when you choose to accept this shooting method, everything are full of other charms.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

It's completely ludicrous, clever and very amusing- but definitely don't go into it expecting a historically accurate period drama. Approach it in the same way as you would a Wes Anderson film and you won't be disappointed. Loved it!!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Regal Intrigue and Timeless Wit: 'The Favourite' Dazzles with Masterful Storytelling,"In the grand tapestry of cinematic art, few films manage to weave threads of historical intrigue with the deftness of a master storyteller. ""The Favourite,"" directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, is one such film that embroiders its narrative with the precision of a meticulous craftsman. Set against the backdrop of early 18th-century England, the film unfolds within the opulent halls of Queen Anne's palace, where the politics of power, love, and betrayal are as intricate as the laces on a royal gown.The film's narrative pivots around the trifecta of Queen Anne, portrayed with a fragile intensity by Olivia Colman; Sarah Churchill, the Duchess of Marlborough, whose steely resolve and cunning are brought to life by Rachel Weisz; and Abigail Masham, played by Emma Stone, whose ascent from the scullery to the Queen's confidante is as meteoric as it is mesmerizing. The performances are nothing short of sublime, with each actress delivering a complexity of emotion that is both profound and palpable.Lanthimos, known for his idiosyncratic style, orchestrates this period piece with a contemporary flair that never feels anachronistic. Instead, it serves to highlight the timelessness of its themes-ambition, desire, and the human need for connection. The script, penned by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, is a marvel of wit and dark humor, with dialogue that dances between the characters like a well-choreographed ballet.The cinematography by Robbie Ryan is a visual feast, employing fisheye lenses and natural lighting to create a world that is at once familiar and surreal. The camera roves through the palace with an almost voyeuristic gaze, inviting the audience to become silent witnesses to the private dramas unfolding within its walls.Nicholas Hoult, in the role of Robert Harley, delivers a performance that is both comical and conniving, embodying the slippery nature of a courtier navigating the treacherous waters of favor and fortune. The supporting cast, too, is impeccable, each actor fully inhabiting their role, no matter how small, to create a tapestry that is rich in detail and authenticity.The film's score, composed by William Lyons and Johnnie Burn, with music that underscores the emotional beats of the story with precision and grace. The use of classical pieces, juxtaposed with more modern compositions, creates an auditory experience that complements the film's visual storytelling.""The Favourite"" occasionally indulges in stylistic excesses that, while visually arresting, can detract from the narrative's momentum. Certain scenes linger a touch too long, as if the film is enamored with its own beauty, risking the indulgence of form over function.The film's pacing, deliberate as it may be, sometimes borders on the lethargic, particularly in its second act, where the intrigue takes a backseat to the characters' introspection. While these moments are crafted with care, they can test the patience of viewers accustomed to a more brisk narrative cadence.""The Favourite"" stands as a testament to the power of cinema to transport us to different times and places, to immerse us in the lives of characters who are as real as they are flawed. It is a film that delights and disquiets in equal measure, a sumptuous feast for the senses that reminds us of the enduring allure of storytelling. In its reflection of the human condition, with all its grandeur and folly, ""The Favourite"" secures its place as a modern classic, a jewel in the crown of historical cinema.",,Anonymous,Biography
Too normal for a real Lanthimos.,"Yorgos Lanthimos is well known for absurd movies such as ""The lobster"" (2015) and ""The killing of a sacred deer"" (2017). It is almost a surprise when he makes a rather (but not completely) normal movie. ""The favourite"" (2018) is such a movie.Unlike his previous two films, ""The favourite"" is definitely a genre movie, the genre being a costume drama and the subgenre a film about the English royal family.With respect to the costume drama's the film reminded me of ""Barry Lyndon"" (1975, Stanley Kubrick), especially in the beautiful way it covers candle light, which was of course a much harder to do in 1975 than in 2018.With respect to films about the English royal family I immediately think about Shakespeare adaptations. This association is not fully unjustified because, just like a Shakespeare adaptation, the film is all about palace intrigues. The only difference is that in this case the intrigues are between three women. This is not without importance because it gives the film a touch of the flavor of ""All about Eve"" (1950, Joseph L. Mankiewicz).The story is about Queen Anne (1655 - 1714), but does not claim any historical accuracy. Queen Anne is in poor health and entrusts government activities to her adviser Sarah Churchill. During the film the position of Sarah is challenged by her impoverished cousin Abighail Hill. So the fight is not about being King / Queen, like in so many royal dramas, but about the possibility to manipulate the reigning Queen. See also ""A royal affair"" (2012, Nikolaj Arcel). The risk of such a fight is thet you can never be sure that you have really won. In my opinion that is the message from the much criticized final scene. The one who thought she has won finds out that the Queen can not always be manipulated in the desired direction.Queen Anne is played by Olivia Colman, Sarah Churchill is played by Rachel Weisz and Abighail Hill is played by Emma Stone. All of them are giving a terrific performance. My ""favourite"" is Olivia Colman, portraying Queen Anne as vulnerable at some times, headstrong at other times but at no time caricatured. Olivia Colman got an Oscar for actress in a leading role, the other two ""only"" got a nomination for actress in a supporting role.Many reviewers mention the good performance of the lead actresses. Apart from their own merit this is also attributable to the more natural dialogue compared to earlier films of Lanthimos. I do agree with these reviewers, but strangely enough this is one of the reasons I prefer those earlier films. ""The favourite"" is just too normal for a real Lanthimos.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good movie not for everyone,"This is well done history based movie by my favorite director. After the Dogtooth and The Lobster he is on my top list. BUT it is definitely not for everyone, so if you appreciate a different take on movie making, you will agree with high ratings. As for soundtrack: people, this is 18 century!, sure you don't expect hip pop or salsa as a music background. I think it was almost perfect, and actually first time describes favouritism when talking about queens rather than kings that had million lovers. Very unique movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Impressive movie of female rivalry for the affection of an ill queen in England of 1708,"The year is 1708 and Queen Anne ( Olivia Colman) is ruling England. She is not in the best of health both mental and physical because she has undergone personal tragedies and she gets regular painful bouts of gout because of which she has to move around in a wheelchair or drag herself along a wall. She now faces a dilemma as she has to decide whether to raise taxes to continue the war with France or to take the easy way out and sign a peace treaty. She is lonely, bored, paranoid, moody, screams often and throws tantrums on minor issues. However she has her faithful companion Lady Sarah Churchill ( Rachel Weisz) who is her advisor in personal and political matters and whose companionship also extends to the royal bedroom. Into this scenario enters young, pretty, gutsy, ambitious lass Abhigail ( Emma Stone) who is given the position of royal ""servant "". She is quick to win the favour of the Queen through her services, and in no time displaces Sarah as the trustworthy companion of the Queen and this companionship extends to the bedroom. Sarah is extremely upset and doesn't give in easily, tries a few manipulations but of no avail. Abhigail has now assumed a strong position of authority.Director Yorgos Lanthimos uses the script to build up the royal ambience of the 18th century with huge sets, royal beds, grand costumes and candle lit lighting . He has used the cinematographer and editor to make an absorbing narrative. (Hopefully the heavily made up men with ridiculous hats do represent the fashion of those days). There is palace intrigue, dark humour, stifling royal formality and caustic wit in plenty. All three ladies are powerful and give orders to the high ranking gentlemen officers and staff who scurry about obediently. A highlight of the movie is the superb acting of all three ladies particularly Olivia Colman who has lived the role and brings out all the pain and angst of an ill queen. Both Rachel and Emma have also put up superb performances which match Olivia's acting. The production design is grand and the cinematography and editing give the movie regal splendour.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A magnificent period piece that virtually sets the Benchmark for the style.,"Diane and I saw this Brilliant film this afternoon at our favourite cinema in Fremantle.As I typed in the Lead the film takes your breath away in it's ability to bring the viewer into the rooms and halls of a pre-industrial castle with it's savage darkness everywhere and therefore seeing candelight as I have never seen it filmed before.This, for me, lack of light envellops the actors totally; it is as if they are showing themselves in a science-fiction story that had so little to do with reality. Of course this betrays my complete modernism because I and nobody in the film has ever had a taste of profound richness envelloped in virtual darkness.The costuming was as brilliant as the lighting and the actors playing their roles in this medieval staging were superb: I will leave it at that.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Nice work by Yorgos Lanthimos...,"""The Favourite"" is a Comedy - Drama movie in which we watch the tense rivalry between two cousins, Sarah Churchill and Abigail Hill, as they vie for Queen Anne's favor and influence over the British throne.I liked this movie because it had a nice plot and a beautiful combination of biting humor and unexpected twists. The direction which was made by Yorgos Lanthimos was very good and the dialogue was witty and sharp with his unique style-marked by quirky camerawork. The costumes and production design were visually stunning. The interpretations of Olivia Colman who played as Queen Anne was simply amazing. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Emma Stone's who played as Abigail Hill and Rachel Weisz who played as Sarah Churchill, who also shined as the scheming cousins. All in all, I have to say that ""The Favourite"" is a nice, intriguing movie and it offers a compelling exploration of ambition, loyalty, and betrayal so, I would recommend it to you.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Favourite - but not everyone's...,"This film divides opinion and rightly so. It is a film about not very much, in a historical period that is not widely covered (The end of Queen Anne's reign, she was the last ruler from the Royal House of Stuart). However, it is a bizarre, funny and entertaining dark comedy.The period costumes rightly deserve their Academy Award and the historical locations used for filming are wonderful. The three lead actresses are absolute powerhouses any one of those three could have won the best actress Oscar!The music is unsettling and makes you fear that something awful will happen at every turn, but with the backdrop of politics, favouritism and manipulation it does work and holds your attention throughout.The dialogue is snappy and there are moments of genuine hilarity. Often it concerns the absurdity of court life, but there are also some funny slapstick moments.The ending was ambiguous and leaves you feeling a little unsatisfied, but it shouldn't detract from what is a wonderful work of art. (The first thing I did after watching it was go on Wikipedia and read about the real life historical figures...fascinating).",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
My sole issue with the film is what so much of the 21st Century's...,.....'offer' of what is 'culture'. I am not that old to know few women used the 'f' word some 30+ years ago. Now it is 'de rigeur' in any 'cutting edge' drama. While that may seem 'ok' in the good ole' 'boys/girls' bull sessions I find it unconscionable that a director would permit use of that word by a women attending to the British monarch in that very palace at the beginning of the 18th Century.It is a bit slow and the ending offers a meandering 'settlement' of sorts. All three females leads are excellent but use of that word....said more than once in said scene....is what makes this a '6'.,6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Cinematic brilliance.,"At once lavishly sumptuous and brutally intimate, this film delivers a promise fulfilled. Yorgos Lanthimos' fish-bowl vision of the early-18th century court of Queen Anne, prodded and poked at this viewer's expectations and prejudices, and ultimately served up a cinematic treat scarcely enjoyed since 2015's ""The Lobster"". Driven by frank performances that astound and pervert, and a deliciously dour score sounding like an amalgam of heartbeats, foghorns, and creaking clockworks, the droll gravitas of this dark dramedy reminds one of Voltaire (to paraphrase): ""God is a comedian playing to an audience afraid to laugh"".",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Yorgos Lanthimos' Most Accessible Film To Date,"From the director of The Lobster & The Killing of a Sacred Deer comes yet another idiosyncratic feature, this time a period comedy set in 18th century England. The Favourite may be more accessible than Yorgos Lanthimos' previous efforts but the film certainly isn't devoid of the absurd, whacky elements that define his works.The story takes place in 18th century England and focuses on the power struggle that erupts between a frail queen who occupies the throne, her close friend who governs the country in her stead & a new servant with an agenda of her own who steps between the two after she senses an opportunity to realise her ambitions.Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, the first act is an absolute riot that finds the Greek filmmaker doing what he does best with a series of quirky moments that help set up the stage while introducing the relevant characters whose arcs only get more complex as plot progresses. The story is straightforward but the execution leads to one wicked ride.The skilfully executed technical aspects provide excellent assistance, starting with the sumptuous production & costume design that brings the period setting to life in splendid detail. The exquisite use of fisheye lens, smooth camera manoeuvring & low-light photography provide its frames a bizarre but lifelike quality that's all the more uplifted by its eclectic score.But it's the female trio that power this film. Olivia Colman, Rachel Weisz & Emma Stone lead the show with outstanding inputs and their chemistry with each other only intensifies with time. All three of them get to have their shining moment and make the most of their screen space. But Nicholas Hoult also deserves a mention, for his supporting act doesn't go unnoticed in a film steered by terrific actresses.On an overall scale, The Favourite is a tale of power, passion & politics bolstered by first-rate performances from its leading ladies, and marks another fascinating entry in Yorgos Lanthimos' steadily rising career. The third act doesn't really hold as strong as the first two but there is no denying that it's a well crafted & smartly executed work from a filmmaker in prime form. Worth a shot for the powerhouse performances it has in store. And the power dynamics at play. And that duck race!",,Anonymous,Biography
Oddball surrealistic period movie,"Olivia Colman was brilliant I thought in a recent TV series called Landscapers and as I knew she had win the Oscar for The Favourite I watched it. I can only assume that the Academy members who voted for her did not know her in 2018 as Olivia has mostly been seen on British TV. Perhaps if she was new to their eyes they were impressed by her but I thought this was way short of being an Oscar winning role, in fact it wasn't even the best performance in the movie which is given by Emma Stone. Rachel Weisz is also just as good as Olivia. Nicolas Hoult gives more or less the same performance as he gave in the TV series The Great recently. It's sumptuously shot with eye watering scenery and decor although I did find some of the camerawork distracting when it looked like distorted mirrors in a funfair. It is very rude but not enough to offend me as somehow coming from women it doesn't grate as much as from a man, at least to me. I am not a historian but equally I do not go to see movies to be educated as I know they are frequently chopped up to suit the entertainment value. I was entertained although it was too long by half an hour. Whether or not Queen Anne was a lesbian, taking advantage of her position to abuse her maids and ladies in waiting I know not but the romping does keep it mildly interesting. Billed as a comedy I only laughed once in an early Emma Stone scene but I kept watching. I do think ultimately that Emma saved the movie for me otherwise there is not much to commend it.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"The Favourite is a very enjoyable, mad tale, webbed in glorious design,","During the early 18th Century, Queen Anne (Olivia Coleman) becomes bedridden from a severe case of gout, while needing to tend to serious matters regarding the war with France. Her confidant; Sarah (Rachel Weisz) tends to the Queen's duties herself and comforts her in an extreme intimate nature. Arriving at the palace is Abigail (Emma Stone) cousin of Sarah who seeks employment , but is degenerately put to work in the slum kitchens where she is forced to sleep in a cramped room with countless others. While Anne is helpless in bed, Abigail sneaks her self into the Queen's favour becoming her new bedroom maid, toppling her friendship with Sarah, and emotively aggravating Sarah.Within the first moments of the Favourite, I think you immediately decide whether you are on board with it, and I found myself in comfortable arms from the very beginning. In a very quick and witty story, the Favourite is an easily enjoyable and elegant tale, if you are compatible with the world of wigs and mad humour. Slightly far off the tone of Lanthimos previous films, unlike The Lobster (2015), and the Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017), The Favourite is a less challenging and more entertaining watch.This is systematically brought to life in widely smart and funny script by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara. The tension and powerplay in the narrative is almost Shakespearian with its wicked ensemble of double crossing. The pleasure of these character's quibble is truly smashing.The film's true charm is achieved in the love triangle between Queen Anne, Sarah, and Abigail, as both court favourites compete over receiving the Queen's praise and friendship for their own gain. The talents of Coleman, Weisz and Stone are undoubtable expectational, with an exquisite dynamic on screen. Weisz is uptight and tough and an intimidating presence who dominates the film. Although still a confidant, Sarah seems to be really pulling the strings on he political matters. Sarah even walks over the spoilt childlike Anne who roams her palace helplessly shouting at her musicians and cuddling her seventeen rabbits. Coleman's British wackiness seems never out of place. Then Emma Stone; first a sweet and innocent Abigail is sympathetic lead, but gradually reveals only to be a self serving villain herself as she greases herself up to the Queen. Although Coleman's role had been identified as the lead, it feels at times that her presence is mostly overtaken by the performances of Weisz and Stone.Additionally grand is the film's gorgeous periodical production design, covered in the delicate artwork infested hallways and ballrooms, to the coordinated outdoor gardens and palace landscapes. There is an almost post Barry Lyndon-esc serge that echoes through Robbie Ryan's sharp photography. There are frequent shots of spherical frames twisting the scale of the land, but capturing beautiful texture. With a high contrast with the palace rooms, the film's art direction powerfully embodies it's historical period, almost overwhelmingly so.The Favourite is a very enjoyable, mad tale, webbed in glorious design, precisely crafted by Yorgos Lanthimos, but it's heart is truly made in the ensemble cast. If his other films are too weird for you, then I think the Favourite will be a much more amusing experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Mixing mainstream with experimental pays with the critics,"Some movies are born to be darlings of the critics. Take ""experimental"" director Lanthimos, lately very much in favour, thanks to puzzling movies such as ""The lobster"" and give him a script whatsoever. You may bet the critics will applaude the results, perhaps also thanks to the abundance of salacious, politically-correct scenes.Allegedly, this should be a ""nastily funny"" historical romp, with focus on the powers struggles at court and between the Whigs and the Tories, but the sex indiscretions are a wink to modern voyeurism and manage to derail the movie.Loosely based on historical facts, compressed and distorted, we spy on Anne queen of England, who after having given birth to 17 children - all of which died in infancy - decides to turn to safer sex and enjoy the intimate company of her best friend, Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough.We're not given any information about the absence of Anne's husband and her switch from heterosexuality (or any of the background whatsoever).Enter on the scene Abigail, Sarah's poor cousin and the happy couple is torn apart by jealousy and betrayal. Anne is sick, childish, weak, mentally unstable, easily pushed around by any strong woman who may happen to be around. Sarah is harsh, domineering, power-hungry, but perhaps loyal and Abigail is a hypocrite manipulator. Everything is in background, apart from Sarah and Abigail manoeuvring to get close to the queen and getting close means only the most classic love-sex-jealousy plot, only with all female characters.Add lots of profane language and modern mannerisms, strident soundtrack, way too many fish-eye shots and weird angles, anachronistic costumes and what you get is a movie loved by the critics. For me it is just a missed chance, given that the three lead actresses are doing a great job and the plot was compelling enough without the overdose of sex.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Stylish, witty and original period drama","I have a rapidly growing admiration for Yorgos Lanthimos (it doesn't exactly trip off the tongue, does it) as a director. I recently watched The Lobster, which is one of the most original, bonkers and fabulous films I've seen in a long time. So, quite a bit for Mr Lanthimos to live up to with his most current film, The Favourite.
The story covers a scarsely considered, brief period in British history, the latter days of the reign of Queen Anne, whos failure to produce an heir led to the house of Hanover taking over the British throne. On the face of it, it is hard to imagine how this era could be portrayed in any other light than one of sombre reflection, but the lightness of touch and wit evident here is very refreshing. The three principal characters are all women (Queen Anne played by the excellent Olivia Coleman, her principal political adviser and confidante Lady Marlborough, played by the wonderful Rachael Weisz, and Abigail the desperate newcomer played by the revelatory Emma Stone), which is highly unusual in big-budget film-making (even in this day and age), and the actors who play them are uniformly excellent. Someone I know made a valid point that none of them are terribly likeable characters, but that's sort of missing the point; they existed at a time when men typically dominated every aspect of life, so despite their favoured positions in the pecking order, they could only really exercise their influence on each other. They are also quite complex, 3-dimensional characters, with moods, rational and irrational behaviours, fears and regrets.
The film looks wonderful, with a variety of interesting shots, including a kind of fisheye effect used to great effect, the dialogue frequently sparkles with wit, and there is a lot of humour. Only later on does the tone turn more serious and sad, which reflects the overall change in the state of mind of the queen. The acting ranges from good to superb across the board, and I loved the artifice of the intermissions with Roman numerals and a character quotation, acting as a form of chapter heading; nothing new, but it fits the tone of the film perfectly. The only thing I took issue with was a small aspect of the soundtrack, involving two brief periods dominated by a two-note dirge, with what sounded like a single fiddle note followed by the pluck of a double bass, repeated ad nauseum. Mind you, that's just my personal feeling. Don't let it discourage you from seeing the film - it certainly wouldn't be the first time a bit of soundtrack distracted and annoyed me in a film which was otherwise excellent.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Witty and raucous, even the jaded will be delighted.","As a period, drama about baroque palace intrigue, The Favourite, concerning early18th century's British Queen Anne (Olivia Coleman) and her courtiers, is a pleasant companion piece to the intrigue-laden Dangerous Liaisons. Only this time the Queen has her eye on her two close female attendants, Lady Sarah (Rachel Weisz), who has been with the queen since childhood, and Abigail (Emma Stone), a former lady arriving at the manor to be a lowly attendant. The principal location, the Jacobean Hatfield House estate in Hertfordshire, is a regal playground for shenanigans fit for pets in cages, like bunny rabbits.Part of the perfection of this killer comedy is the set design with tapestries and furniture as ornate and beautiful as you'd expect in a fine museum. The palace is about as gorgeous as Blenheim, and the costumes are as plush as the draperies. In short, the mise en scene is to die for baroque. This attention to detail is what can be expected of director Yorgos Lanthimos, whose Killing of a Sacred Deer and The Lobster were memorably rich while spare at the same time. In Favourite the occasional use of a disorienting wide lens to survey the house and landscape while furiously moving is worthy of Orson Welles at this wildest.However, it's always about the people, and this house of liaisons and deceptions is two hours of putdowns and poison; not a moment is dull. Abagail's co-opting the Queen's affection from Lady Sarah provides the spark for the fire between the two ambitious young ladies. Without being too obvious, the film speaks powerfully about the need for women then and now to employ serious wit to get around the male-dominated world. The battle has further significance because the Queen needs all the help she can get, and these ladies are ready and willing. Along for the contest are factions of British politics, vying for the Queen's attention to a real-world battle with the French.As the credits roll, some of the film's eccentricity becomes evident: ""Nude Pomegranate Tory"" and ""Fastest Duck in the City"" remind how silly and yet shocking it can be. Notwithstanding the chapter headings like ""The Mud Stinks,"" from Handel through Vivaldi to modernist Anna Meredith, the music counterpoints the raucous doings, which are accompanied by biting, crisp dialogue.Through it all the determining factor is the off-balance Queen, whose whimsy could bring down a kingdom. The comparison can be made to contemporary times, where a chaotic White House begs for overthrow or at least complete dysfunction. History repeats, and if it must, we'd do well to look back a few centuries when palace intrigue appears highly amusing but through a camera lens, frightening.",,Anonymous,Biography
Beautifully Shot Period Dramatic Comedy With Excellent Performances,"Period dramas aren't in my wheelhouse. But I will see anything with (almost) Rachel Weisz. The Favourite when I saw the trailer the first time interested me but not enough to run out to see it. Months passed and it starting getting on tons of top ten lists. Then I was listening to the SlashFilm podcast and there were multiple people just raving about this film. And there was an element about the film that piqued my interest. More about that later. I had not seen a film from Yorgos Lanthimos before viewing this. I've heard mixed things about The Lobster and The Killing of Sacred Deer. They are both on my watchlist now. One thing I had read is that those films were odd and maybe because he was directing from his own script. This time around he was shooting from a script by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara.The film takes place in 18th century England, following the relationship between Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) and her faithful aid Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz). Lady Sarah governs in the Queen's sted as her health is failing. But Sarah's cousin Abigail (Emma Stone) arrives, her charms win Queen Anne, leading to a bitter rivalry and fight for the attention's of Anne and to be her favorite. At times this movie is utterly hilarious. There were moments I was laughing out loud. But then moments when it was hard to watch these three women just tear each other apart. And they do tear each other part, mentality and psychologically. It's such an entertaining watch because I didn't know where the film was going.All three leads are excellent here. Colman is the standout because she has a wonderfully honest portrayal of a woman in power who's health is failing. She's gone through so much in her life she's quick to cling to anyone who is kind to her. But from the start we know she's not in the right frame of mind. I see exactly why she's one of the front-runners for all the lead actresses categories this award season. One person I definitely think needs more attention is Rachel Weisz. As Sarah, she's tough, firm but kind and caring. There is a genuine love that Sarah has for Anne. She just knows that Anne isn't always thinking clearly. Sarah makes the tough decision that Anne can't make which puts in not in a good like with parliament, one member which happens to be Nicholas Hoult as a biting member named Harley.Emma Stone is good here. For the longest time, I was a ""hater"". But lately with her roles specifically this and Birdman, I'm starting to enjoy her on screen. For me, this is the best I've ever seen her. She takes what she wants as Abigail, having a rough past, does everything she can to get to where she can be content. But is she really content? All of these women want to be happy but do everything in their power to be totally miserable. I did not see elements of the loving relationship between Anne and Sarah. It's not shown off in the trailer but it's a key part of the film. Abigail uses her knowledge during a passionate moment to gain an upper hand. That spins the story upside down.Lanthimos shoots this so well, with many pants, long takes and interesting use of fisheye lenses. The movie is beautiful to look at. Like a good oil painting, the cinematography will transport the viewer to this version of the 18th century. There are moments when modern-day traits show up. The dance during the middle of the film is hilarious to the point I really thought the actors on screen were going to start a breakdance battle. Even with the setting, the still film to engage on a dark comedic level. But it doesn't get as dark as expected. I thought things might get horrific. But it seems Lanthimos wasn't to show how horrible can be without being physically horrible.I will say that the end, even though there was no way to for a happy ending, the film's end kind of let me down. I was expecting more. Maybe one last act of villainy or a character trying to get redemption. But no one is redeemed, everyone gets what's coming to them. The Favourite was entertaining with a great job by the lead actresses, all who show be get some recognition during this award season. It's dark, funny, depressing but overall a nice trip to a time that was in a country going through turmoil. I'm happy with my first feature from Yorgos Lanthimos. And very happy to see he didn't play up the LGBTQ factors for but let it play out naturally as a key point to express how much some of these characters love each other. I'm excited to see his previous films and see what he can come up with next.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Courting the absurd,"This film does not fit neatly into the established cinematic genres, which may account for some of the negative reaction it has received. Its narrative is in turn grotesque, bizarre, comic and tragic - and perhaps Lanthimos has begun to create a new kind of film - the cinema of the absurd. For some, this could take some getting used to as its sequencing will be unpredictable and its tone sometimes uncomfortable.There is no doubt that the three central performances are of the highest quality, and Coleman in particular is inspired in her portrayal of the lost soul that is Queen Anne. It's not always easy to feel empathy for a monarch, but this was deftly achieved and deserves acclaim and awards.The cinematography is perfectly pitched and frames the bestial dysfunctionality of the court - around each corner and in every nook and cranny the rich and powerful (mainly men) are behaving like spoilt children, debauching themselves in the shadow of the queen's weakness. The other main protagonists - Sarah and Abigail - are more ambitious, determined and focused in their exploitation of the situation. Nature abhors a vacuum, and Queen Anne's troubled isolation creates one. Meanwhile, outside the palace, there are murmurings of public unrest.In its unique way, The Favourite is an evocative portrayal of a particular time and space in English history with an exploration of the dynamics of power and their interplay with sexuality.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
2024film-003(2024/1/31),"The narrative depicts power struggles within the court surrounding Queen Anne in 18th-century England. Queen Anne, grappling with numerous miscarriages and early deaths of children, appears visibly distressed. Everyone in the court exhibits a chilling madness, creating an unsettling atmosphere.Emma Stone's acting skills shine once again, showcasing her adeptness in portraying characters with unhinged traits, as seen in her previous role as Cruella. I look forward to watching the currently acclaimed ""Poor Things"". Olivia Colman as Queen Anne and Rachel Weisz as Sarah deliver outstanding, mad performances alongside Emma Stone.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of my new favorite films!,I laughed out loud in the theater. This ensemble cast brought an amazing script to life!,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A nice movie about two women at the court of the queen Anne,"The movie tells the story of two women at the court of the queen Anne. They are both interested in reaching a high position in the society and they use the fragility of the queen to get what they want.
It is a nice tale about the condition of the women in that age, although the historical contest is not described enough.
Good the protagonist and the other actors.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
definitely different,"I think I would've rated this movie higher if it weren't for the ending. I will give no spoilers, and having said that - the ending was all wrong. To show an interspersed faces & bunny rabbits to fade to black was a horrible way to end this movie. The acting was fantastic and the comedy in the story, very good. But there are aspects of this film which are unsettling and uncomfortable. I recommend this movie for the acting more than the story. Beautiful scenery and costumes. The music is perfect with unsettling scenes. I wouldn't take any children.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
