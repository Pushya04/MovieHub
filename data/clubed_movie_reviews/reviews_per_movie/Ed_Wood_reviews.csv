The one he'll be remembered for,"It's sort of embarrassing to admit it took me ten years to see this film. I'm not really a big fan of Tim Burton, and while I never had anything against him, I've only recently started to enjoy Johnny Depp's work. Given the subject matter, this just wasn't a movie I was interested in for a long time. But sometimes good things really are worth the wait.Ed Wood, of course, chronicles the Hollywood career of its eponymous subject, truly one screwed up individual; a cross-dresser with a fetish for angora, Wood churned out one horrifically bad film after another, culminating with Plan Nine From Outer Space, before descending into crappy porn films toward the end of his life. It isn't necessarily a happy story, and Burton wisely only tells a small sliver of it, from Ed's first movie, Glen or Glenda, through the premiere of Plan Nine.But the love that Burton has for Wood and his movies shines through in every frame. Though I find Burton needlessly artsy as a director, here that tendency serves him frightfully well, as he manages to do the near-impossible; make a film about someone that plays like one of their films (the abysmal Dragon is a shining example of how NOT to do this). Shot entirely in black and white, we see all of Wood's weirdos not as they were, but rather as Ed probably saw them, through the bizarre filter he must have viewed life with.Depp is simply brilliant here, probably even better than he was in Pirates of the Caribbean. He captures Wood's enthusiasm and slanted viewpoint, but he does so in a loving, positive way. Wood accepts, as we must, that he was a screwed-up hack, but it never drags him down; in fact, Depp has him reveling in it, and it is that very passion that buoys up the movie. It doesn't hurt that nearly everyone else is very strong too, from Jeffrey Jones' crank 'psychic' Criswell to Bill Murray's Bunny Breckenridge, who often talks about having a sex change but never goes through with it. George 'The Animal' Steele captures Tor Johnson perfectly, and even Lisa Marie is excellent as Vampira. But the true great performance of the film, outshining even Depp, is Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. He won the Oscar for this, and deservedly so; he presents Lugosi at the end of his life, a washed-up has been, a shell of a man who was once a great star but is now no more than an addict. Landau virtually disappears in the role, and all you get is Lugosi, every tragic inch of him. Again, we see him not only as he was, but how Wood and even Burton see him, and the effect is masterful. One speech in particular, where Lugosi repeats a speech that Wood wrote for him about once being the master of the world but now on the verge of coming back is particularly haunting, and Landau is simply riveting.Ed Wood is a rare beast Â– it's a Tim Burton film that doesn't go overboard, it's a movie about Hollywood (sort of) that isn't self-indulgent, it's a nostalgia trip that manages not to be sappy but is still very warm and caring, and overall it's just a strikingly well-done film. I was impressed on many levels, most particularly with Depp and Landau, but really with the whole movie, that such a truly screwed-up human being could be shown in such a positive, indeed, loving way. Ed Wood is nothing less than a tribute to its subject, and in that, as in many other ways, it succeeds marvelously. If somehow you've missed this film, as I had until recently, you owe it to yourself to see it. It's simply a wonderful piece of film-making that should not be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"More than merely a biography, or an homage","I am a Johnny Depp fan, and this film only reinforced my enjoyment of his genuine talent. He's whatcha call a real actor. He's on record (""Inside the Actor's Studio"" & elsewhere) as saying that his characterization of Wood was a mixture of ""the blind optimism of Ronald Reagan, the enthusiasm of the Tin Man from 'The Wizard of Oz' (1939) and Casey Kasem."" Well, I must add that either he left out channeling Jon Lovitz or that's where Lovitz got his inspiration, too. It is at moments positively eerie how well it works, and without feeling like Depp stole Lovitz's act--his overall character is so much more, so much else, that the Lovitz echo becomes a small part of a larger coherent whole, although it never disappears entirely.Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette as the principal women in Wood's life are each endearing and effective in their own separate ways. Bill Murray is fun as always, and the secondary and bit players are very well cast.Martin Landau . . . well . . . Martin Landau simply left me awestruck. Depp is all over the screen doin' his best wacky movie guy and chewing the scenery, Parker, Arquette, Murray, and the rest are obviously having a real fun time backing him up, and Martin Landau is shuffling around in the foreground muttering in Romanian and writing a book called ""How to Steal a Movie."" Mind boggling performance, and absolutely deserving every award it got him in 1995, which included a Best Supporting Actor Oscar, Golden Globe and SAG Awards, and the American Comedy Award for Funniest Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture. (Incidentally, his daughter Juliet, better known to millions of Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans as the vampire Drusilla, is one of the supporting players.)If I weren't already a Tim Burton fan this movie would have made me one. He here makes an almost perfectly crafted period piece (anachronisms noted--see the ""goofs"" page--and dismissed), half cheesy fake scifi B movie and half period noir thriller, as a cinematic biography about the quintessential cheesy fake noir scifi thriller B movie guy. This film goes beyond pastiche, and beyond homage to a genre, although it is both. With this film Burton genuflects--no, prostrates himself--before the gods of 1950s low-budget black and white, and the gods are pleased indeed. It seems like he must have watched every movie made in America for under a million dollars between 1948 and 1962. I lost count of the echoes and parodies and pastiches and mini-homages that fill, I think, every darn frame of the movie, and which by no means are mostly of Wood and his work.As with, I think, every movie biography, there's the odd gratuitous fact changing (see the ""goofs"" page again)--you know, the ""Why'd they do that when the truth wouldn't make any difference?"" kind of stuff, and as glowing as this review obviously is I must also say that it is in some ways an imperfect film--it glosses over Wood's later career, for example. But it it so obviously a labor of love and joy for all involved that in my opinion its imperfections are inconsequential. Ed Wood stands proudly, with that slightly odd gleam in its eye, with the best movie biographies made.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Why, I thought he was dead.""","Although I had never heard of Ed Wood before hearing of this film, I now understand why anybody would even consider making a film about him. Even though branded as ""the worst director of all time,"" Wood was refreshingly passionate about what he did. Of course, I can't really judge his work, but from what I saw in this movie I'm pretty sure that the critics are right about him.But that's not the point of Ed Wood. Not at all. My favorite scene in the whole movie is the conversation between Wood and Orson Welles. One perhaps the best filmmaker of his time, the other a young, struggling filmmaker without experience or talent, but each knows what the other is going through. They have the same problems and the same ambitions. The fact that one is a genius and the other a total failure is only secondary.The performances are all first-rate, starting with Depp and Landau and going all the way to the supporting cast which includes a great performance by Bill Murray. Opposing Ed Wood's statement that ""filmmaking is not about the tiny details,"" Tim Burton gave us another great film filled with wonderful details.The film does not go into detail about Wood's experiences prior to and after making his first films which is understandable when you make a little research on this very website.This film made me curious about Ed Wood's work and maybe I'll get over myself and check out Plan 9 from Outer Space or Glen or Glenda.8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Best of Burton-Depp,"Without question it's Tim Burton's best, most complete work and Johnny Depp is superb. Perhaps it's the total understanding of his subject that allows Tim Burton to fly so high here. The beautifully tailored script gives room for some exquisite character drawings, Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Wells. ""When you re-write a script it gets better and better"" tells Ed/Johnny to his girlfriend with a smile full of innocence. What a performance! Johnny Depp is a unique kind of actor, we never had anyone quite like him. How can he manage to disappear behind a character and still bring with him his full bag of tricks, I don't know, but he does. I only wish he wouldn't get lost in mediocrities like ""Nick of Time"" ""The Astronaut's Wife"" and ""Secret Window"" He belongs to the world of real, great filmmakers. Better to risk with an original idea by Emir Kusturica than a ""safe"", tired, Stephen King thing. Johnny, remember, we're looking at you for clues about ourselves. More Ed Woods , please!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Burton's grand masterpiece, too bad so few have noticed","As one of the most overlooked films ever made, ""Ed Wood"" does for Tim Burton what ""Malcolm X"" did for Spike Lee and ""JFK"" did for Oliver Stone, it ruins any expectations one can have of Tim Burton, because he has set a standard here that he will never achieve again.  An interest in the period in which it is set is essential, given the set decoration is the film's greatest triumph.  It's not surprising that Burton's first ""biopic"" is about someone revered in the b-movie heyday of the 1950s - that spawned Burton himself. Burton must have felt he had to make this picture because without filmmakers like Ed Wood, Burton himself would have never existed. Set in seedy B-movie Hollywood in the mid 1950s - and wisely and beautifully shot in black-and-white, Johnny Depp plays the titular character; a young, talentless, but optimistic auteur who dreams of being a film director; going so far as to model himself after his idol, Orson Welles.  Despite an over-reliance on stock footage, a tin ear for dialogue, and a fondness for wacky, exploitative horror and sci-fi fare, Wood wiggles his way into B-moviedom.  Casting anyone willing to step before his camera, Wood cranks out a series of cheesy movies.When he has a chance encounter with horror film legend Bela Lugosi, now a 74 year-old, foul-mouthed morphine addict wrecked by his lost fame, Ed sees his meal-ticket. Quick for his next fix, Lugosi doesn't seem to mind that Wood is also an out-and-proud transvestite with a particular fondness for Angora sweaters, and soon begins starring in Wood's features. Lugosi, played by Martin Landau, gives the story its biggest jolts of energy. Landau is hysterical in scene after scene utilizing the ""dirty old man"" routine. Remember, there is nothing funnier on earth than an old man who likes profanity.  A gentle - albeit somewhat fictionalized - bond forms between Wood and Lugosi.  Depp does a spectacular job of fleshing out Wood's quirky innocence and unbridled passion for moviemaking.  This may also be the only Johnny Depp film where you actually see him smile!What ultimately makes this film so stellar is the impeccable production and costume design and the crisp B&W cinematography; it literally transports you back to the clean-cut, wide-eyed days of the 1950s.  I cannot recommend this film enough if you have an interest in the world of 1950s B-movies that produced titles like ""Teenagers From Outer Space"" and ""Project Moonbase"". This film functions quite well as a time warp.  I liken ""Ed Wood"" to epics like ""JFK"" because like those films, this movie doesn't seem to be about what happens as much as how it FEELS to be there; and that's what draws me to the film every time I see it.  With ""Ed Wood"", I'm not always interested in following the story, but I'm totally fascinated with being inside that world.  Tim Burton did the best job that anyone could in taking you there.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Nice to meet you Mr. Wood,"It is a well known fact by now that Johnny Depp is a subtle, tender, beautiful force of nature. Tim Burton has been able to create universes that Johnny Depp can inhabit with the strange naturalness of someone who belongs. ""Ed Wood"" is the ultimate demonstration of that theory. You're introduced to the world of someone who appears almost a figment of someone's imagination to realise that there is something of him in you and me. What is incredible is that the realisation comes hand in hand with a personal discovery. That funny weird kid represents more than something but the best of you and me. Angora sweaters and childish dreams. The purity of an artist with a talent that is concentrated in his heart. Remember the Salieri of ""Amadeus"" torturing himself cursing God for giving him the gift of recognising the talent in others without having any of his own. Ed Wood, as told by Burton and Depp, is so far away from that pathology that to watch his films after having met him with Johnny's face is an entirely different experience. Everything makes sense. Strangely enough (or not) ""Ed Wood"" died at the box office but as it happens more often than not, ""Ed Wood"" is more alive today than many of the greatest moneymakers of all time. Yes, that business of time never fails. Greatness prevails.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Unlikely Masterpiece,"I hear that ED WOOD took just $6,000,000 on its initial cinematic release in the USA.  I'm not surprised.  The extraordinary thing is that the film was financed and released at all.  Had it not been for the prestige that Tim Burton had already earned from his previous projects, ED WOOD would no doubt have foundered long before the cameras began to roll.  The result could have been another 1941 Â– but it wasn't.  What came out of Tim Burton's fascination with the `Worst Director of All Time' was something very rich and strange Â– perhaps the most un-Hollywood Hollywood picture of the 90s.I see two main themes in ED WOOD.  The first is the dreadful fear that hovers over everyone who enters the creative arts Â– `Am I any good?'  `Is my work any good?'  `How do I know if it's any good?'  `What if I think it's good, but everybody else thinks it's rubbish?'  Artists use all kinds of strategies to deal with these fears Â– some become eccentric, others arrogant, others diffident.  Without the right to fail, no artist is likely to take the sort of risk that sometimes, just sometimes, leads to great work.  Tim Burton knew this.Edward D Wood Jnr believed himself to be a creative artist.  Oh, how he believed.  But he still failed to create anything worthwhile.  And this leads to what I believe to be the second theme of the movie, and the reason why I think it failed commercially.Look at all the things Ed did right.  He believed in himself.  He followed his dream.  He worked hard.  He was an entrepreneur Â– he did his best to make others believe in his dream and help him to turn it into reality.  In short, he did all the things that the self-help books, the daytime TV shows, the junk ballads and the feel-good movies tell us will give you success. Just wish upon a star, work all the hours there are to turn your vision into reality and you will succeed.  Ed did all of these things.  And still he failed.  He died short of his 60th birthday, living in a crime-riddled apartment building, drunk, broke, supporting himself and his loyal wife Kathy by writing formula pornography and making sex instruction flicks on 8mm.America doesn't want to hear this.  Hollywood doesn't want to tell America this Â– that you can try and try and try and still get nothing but heartbreak.  This is why ED WOOD is such an un-Hollywood film Â– and why it's one of the best Hollywood films of the 90s.",,Anonymous,Biography
A masterpiece about failure,"It's truly ironic that Tim Burton was able to make such a great masterpiece out of the life story of Edward D. Wood Jr. The least you can say is that his life wasn't. What makes this film so great is that Burton never makes fun of Ed Wood. His way of film-making, his lifestyle and his vision of things are always shown with respect. It's obvious that Burton didn't intend to make a comedy about Hollywood, but a drama about a man with a dream to make films. And he won't give up that dream, no matter what. I'm a great fan of Tim Burton. Especially when he casts Johnny Depp in the leading role. Edward Sciccorhands, Sleepy Hollow and this Ed Wood can easily make the top 50 films of ALL TIME. There's chemistry on the screen, when those 2 work together. And Johnny is not alone this time. The Oscar that Martin Landau received for his role of Bela Lugosi is perhaps one of the most deserved ones in the history of the Academy Awards. He's very creepy as the washed up actor, but very pathetic at the same time. It really is an outstanding performance. Patricia Arquette is just adorable as Kathy, the woman who stays with Edward in good and bad days. She's always giving him support, believes in him, accepts him as he is ( his confession to her in the spook house is really heartbreaking ) Lisa Marie is really sexy as Vampire. People can think she receives all her roles because she sleeps with the director, but she really can act. Very well as the matter a fact. One little disappointment maybe, I was hoping the role of Orson Welles ( played by Vincent D'Onofrio - one genius plays another one ) would have been a little bigger. ""Ed Wood"" is one of the best films of the 90's... what am I saying ? One of the best films EVER !!!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Enjoyable, but not terribly accurate","As a big fan of Ed Wood's work, (more specifically: as a BAD movie buff), I must say it is great to see Edward D Wood, Jr. get some recognition for his hard (bad) work.The movie has many inaccuracies, things such as the sequence of Wood's films, and other details of the movies.   But in my mind the real life of Wood would not have made for a very good movie, so Tim Burton took some liberties.  For a change this does not destroy a historical representation, but rather makes it easier to follow.Last of all, the cast was excellent.  Johnny Depp is one of the finest character actors in Hollywood today, and he managed to bring a warmth to a man who was, in real life, deeply, deeply disturbed.  Depp was surrounded by many other fine actors, and the cameos by some of Wood's real life friends were a delight!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The worst director of all time seen through the eyes of one of the best directors of all time,"This was the movie that Johnny Depp should have been nominated for! He was amazing! And seriously, this movie deserved so much more than just make-up and best supporting actor. ""Ed Wood"" is a terrific movie that every film fanatic will love. It has humor, drama, and romance. The thing is, I had heard a lot about Ed Wood, and was curious on what his life was like. My sister recommended this movie, and I think I might steal it from her. Just kidding! But it's worth not only a watch but a buy as well.Everything about this movie is perfect. I don't think there is a way you can change it to make it any better.

Attractive and optimist biography about the worst filmmaker of all time  supported by  magnificent portrayals of his motley crew,"A biopic of the life and work of the legendary 'worst director of all time', 'Edward D. Wood Jr.' and who now occupies a lofty position as a cult icon ; being based on Rudolph Grey's book Â¨Nightmare of ecstasy : the life and art of Ed WoodÂ¨. This is a touching and comic tribute to a Hollywood maverick , a cross-dressing , angora-sweater wearing director, concentrating on the best-known period of his life in the 1950s, when lack of financing and repeated failures led to make a lot of bad films , in spite of Wood's optimism and vitality . And focusing his relationship with Bela Lugosi and his rare troupe of actors . This is a mostly true story of the legendary director of awful pictures and his strange group of friends and actors .This is a splendid tribute by Tim Burton to bring to the screen the tale of a filmmaker many consider to be the worst of all time . Lavishly produced , in fact , this film cost more to produce than all of Edward D. Wood Jr.'s films put together . Tim Burton said that he was drawn to the story because of the similarities between Edward D. Wood Jr.'s relationship with Bela Lugosi , now ageing and unemployed horror star , and his own friendship with Vincent Price late in the actor's life . Burton focuses on Ed's relationship with Bela , whose career is over by the time Wood befriends him . Depp is extraordinary and engaging as Ed , the strange filmmaker whose Angora sweaters were his weakness , women were his inspiration and movies were his passion . Johnny Depp has said that his characterization of Edward D. Wood Jr. was a mixture of ""the blind optimism of Ronald Reagan, the enthusiasm of the Tin Man from The Wizard of OZ and Casey Kasem."" . Martin Landau's winning of the 'Best Supporting Actor' Academy Award for his portrayal of down-on-his-lucky Bela Lugosi marked the first time in Oscar history that a performer in any category won for playing an actual movie star . However , Bela Lugosi Jr.'s only objection to the film's portrayal of his father was his speech. In Lugosi's memory, his father never used foul language .Sensational support cast , the secondary actors are mostly convincing and enjoyable , almost every role has an appropriate resemblance to his or her Z-player counterpart and the performances are adequate such as Sarah Jessica Parker as Dolores Fuller , Jeffrey Jones as Criswell , Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge , Max Casella as Paul Marco , Brent Hinkley as Conrad Brooks , Lisa Marie as Vampira , George 'The Animal' Steele as Tor Johnson and Juliet Landau as Loretta King . Ed Wood was a low-budgeted auteur of such lousy actors and notoriously bad movies as Â¨Glen or GlendaÂ¨, Â¨Bride of monsterÂ¨ and Â¨Plan 9 from outer spaceÂ¨ . Agreeable musical score by Howard Shore , the sweeping music during the epilogue is based on the music from Glen or Glenda and being the first film by Tim Burton to not feature Danny Elfman's soundtrack . Evocative as well as luxurious cinematography in black and white by Stefan Czapsky . The motion picture was compelling and stunningly directed by Tim Burton . Rating : Better than average , well worth seeing . Essential and indispensable watching .",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Kinship with a Fringie,"The theatre wasn't exactly filling up fast: so far my husband, a friend and myself were the only ones seated. Just before the movie began, a young couple walked in. And shortly after the movie began, they walked out. I wonder if they asked for their money back. I hope they didn't get it.The movie was ED WOOD, Tim Burton's homage to trash-film director Edward D. Wood Jr., which only played in Greenville for two weeks and did not show up at the second-run movie houses. Apparently no one wanted to see it. Their loss.But perhaps I'm being too hard on those who don't appreciate the subtle nuances of Eddie Wood's movies. To me, Eddie was a glittering bead hanging on Hollywood's lunatic fringe. However, Eddie, a transvestite who often directed his masterpieces wearing high heels and an angora sweater, was not exactly your mama's director. He was no Frank Tashlin, who tried to make Jayne Mansfield respectable in THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT. He was no Norman Taurog, who made Elvis look like a dork in countless girls-cars-and-guitars flicks. He wasn't even Russ Meyer, whose exploitation films are legendary in their trashiness. No, Eddie just never seemed to get a break. He wanted to be Orson Welles. He didn't even find the measure of fame accorded to Orson Bean! He remained a pathetic outcast, forever a fringie.Perhaps it is appropriate that Johnny Depp was chosen to portray Eddie Wood. Depp has a long history of playing outcasts and fringies -- Edward Scissorhands, Gilbert Grape, Hunter Thompson. Depp makes it clear that Eddie's angora-covered heart was in the right place. He worked hard on his scripts, he gave important roles to spectacularly talentless actors like Vampira, wrestler Tor Johnson and Eddie's own main squeeze, Dolores Fuller. And he was very kind to the drug-addled has-been Bela Lugosi, even dissuading the drunken Drac from committing suicide (which wasn't entirely altruistic, perhaps, as Lugosi had threatened to take Eddie with him). Depp makes Eddie appear almost human.Depp's portrayal is just one of several that are outstanding: George ""The Animal"" Steele as Tor Johnson, Jeffrey Jones as Criswell, Vincent D'Onofrio in his cameo of Orson Welles and Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge -- one of the rare times Murray has immersed himself in his character and not been merely Bill Murray with someone else's name. Also delightful is a brief appearance by organist Korla Pandit, 1950's television personality once billed ""The Prince of the Wurlitzer.""However, all the performances in ED WOOD are overshadowed by Academy-award winner Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. For those enough old enough to remember Landau in TV's ""Mission: Impossible,"" it perhaps isn't surprising that Landau was able to hide so completely behind a spookily accurate makeup job; seeing Landau's Lugosi watch himself on television was eerie because Landau looked enough like Lugosi to make it seem real.The film ends on a high note, which Eddie's life didn't -- he died in his sleep, watching a ball game, just a few days after he'd been evicted from his apartment.ED WOOD is not a family film. Some of the language is strong, drugs and drink are abundant, and many of the characters are a shade on the bizarre side. It might be hard to explain to one's children why this apparently virile man loves to raid his girlfriend's closets.Unfortunately, ED WOOD hasn't exactly burned up the box office. Perhaps it is because so few people can relate to someone as weird as Eddie, with his terrible stories about men in angora sweaters, killer octopi, blank-eyed wrestler slaves and, the piece de resistance, aliens with eight failed plans to take over the universe. I believe Eddie himself felt like those aliens, which is why, viewing PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, he said, ""This is the one I'll be remembered by."" And perhaps that very weirdness made the story appealing to me. Having lived as a misfit and outcast, working hard all my life to reach a goal that has remained elusive, I can, to quote someone I don't care for, feel Eddie's pain. It's too late for him, but perhaps there's hope for me yet ...",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
different,"this is an interesting film,sort of a biopic of Edward D.

An odd thing.,What an enigma of a film. It wasn't as funny as it could have been. It wasn't as interesting as it could have been. And yet it held the attention. I think the film itself was supposed to be as tacky and ephemeral as the dreadful Ed Wood productions themselves. That's a dull concept but Depp made it watchable despite his annoying grimace and unconvincing angora fetish. His character needed to be fleshed out a little more. He came across as just a bit mad whereas he must have had some substance to his life. They could have had much more slapstick fun with the hopeless actors and hangers-on!

Burton & Depp: Perfect For This Story,"It's appropriate that Tim Burton would direct this and even more appropriate that Johnny Depp would play the lead character as this story profiles an unusual subject: the worst director of films, perhaps, in Hollywood history....and one of its strangest characters.As interesting as the story is, I found the black-and-white photography to be the best aspect of the film, but that's no surprise since Burton usually excels in making great visual films. Depp was hilarious as ""Ed Wood."" The eternal optimistic attitude and silly smile on his face in this film always makes me laugh and actually is inspiring in parts. You can't help but like poor Ed.The most dramatic figure is Bela Lugosi, played memorably by Martin Landau, who deservedly won many awards for this performance. What a tragic figure.To no surprise, there is a cheap shot against Baptists, who are made to look like meddling fools, something Hollywood loves to portray when it comes to any Christian character.

A brilliant movie about a not so brilliant man.,"When you see an Indian organist playing in a meat-house with the meat still cooling in it, while a transvestite is performing a belly dance without his teeth and is making Bela Lugosi swing, you know it...you're watching a Tim Burton movie.The movie brilliantly tells the story about Edward D. Wood Jr. widely know these days as the worst movie director of all time. It tells the story with lot's of humor but it never gets disrespectful, or makes fun of Wood. Instead you actually will gain lot's of respect for his passion and his will power to make just that one movie that he would always be remembered for. The story of Edward D. Wood Jr. is tragic but the movie never becomes sad. It is the perfect homage and tribute to this unfortunate director. You can see by watching this movie that Tim Burton in a way really admires Wood's life and his work.We get to see Wood as a filmmaker and as an individual. We get to know his weird lifestyle and his eccentric famous friendsOK the movie might no be a completely fair biography about Wood. It takes lot's of liberties with telling the story and it only shows the bright days of Wood's life but as movie it works really well and is next to ""Edward Sciccorhands"" Burton's best movie till date, truly a masterpiece!The cast is terrific. Johnn Depp in a Tim Burton movie is always jackpot. Sarah Jessica Parker impressed me and Martin Landau truly is perfect as Bela Lugosi. Bill Murray does what he can best, acting crazy! The Danny Elfman like music by Howard Shore is really great and also great as an homage to the 50's horror soundtracks.The movie works both as a comedy and as a drama. It knows to find the perfect balance but mainly still the movie is just extremely fun to watch. The movie really has tons of laughs and is filled with some incredible crazy character's but like I said before, it never becomes disrespectful to anyone.I must say that ""Ed Wood"" really changed my life. It got me interested in not just only Ed Wood movies but 50's horror movies in general. It also made me a big fan of the famous Hammer film's.A brilliant, strange, tragic, fun homage to the man who will always be remembered as the worst director of all time.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
If you didn't laugh about it you'd cry - so Burton wisely takes the route of weirdly dark comedy,"Ed Wood is a frustrated actor and director who's small theatre productions barely can get a good word said about them.  When a cheap little production company advertises a project about sex change, Wood jumps at the chance and uses his personal fetish for women's clothing as the hook to get the job. Despite his final project being laughed out of the major studios, Wood now has the taste for it and starts to try and get funding to make his own films - aided by the ailing star Bela Lugosi who is desperate for work to help fund his habits.  With a collection of freaks and oddballs, Wood made what are now considered to be some of the worst films ever made.Some things in life are depressing and it is often the case that we try to look on the bright side and make jokes about the situation as an attempt to deal with it.  I'm from Northern Ireland and my humour is quite dark and gallows style simply because that is the kind of comedy I grew up with was draw from the background of murder and violence - gallows humour is an appropriate term.  This film may not be based on gallows humour but it is such a potentially depressing story that the only way to do it and make it enjoyable is to tell it with humour.  Burton treats his subject with a great deal of affection and thus makes this film a funny tale of a dreamer who we know will never see his dreams fulfilled in the way he would like.  The story is funny but not in the cruel mocking way that it could have been but in a fanciful way that is amusing and all the better for being based on truth.  This strand continues all the way through the film and helps us to like Wood even if it is impossible to defend his films - the ending is perfectly upbeat considering that Wood then ended his life an alcoholic making cheap nude pictures.  The characters are exaggerated but still quite true to the real life people they represent (I take this from comments made in documentaries).As director, Burton is excellent.  He gives the whole film an otherworldly feel that is very fitting for a tale that involves characters that are very weird indeed.  The affectionate approach that Burton has for Wood really helps - I wonder does he relate to the guy just trying to make the films that appeal to him or what it is that makes him feel this way towards him? Either way the end result is very good and it stands out as a film that is pretty much without flaw.  I questioned the film's inclusion in the imdb top 250 but then I thought well, what is wrong with it? I had to admit that almost nothing is wrong - the only thing would be that the story may not be to everyone's tastes and not everyone will buy into Burton's affectionate look at Wood.The cast is led by a magnificent performance by Depp who I have long maintained is one of the finest actors (or at least bravest) of my generation.  Here he continues Burton's affectionate approach by portraying Wood as a man filled with hope and dreams - even doing a good job of turning cross dressing into an amusing quirk.  The cast is truly all star but they all do a great job playing their characters.  Landau's Oscar may have had a touch of sentimentality about it but it was still deserved - he plays Lugosi really well and manages the difficulties of his drug addiction really well to make him both amusing but deeply sympathetic.  The support cast includes good turns from Parker, Arquette (quite interchangeable really!), Jones, Murray, Starr, D'Onofrio and Spradlin.  All the cast do well but it is those that play Wood's wooden cast members that do the best job - managing to do both natural performances outside of Wood's movie but also doing justice to just how bad their characters really were!Overall this is a great movie but the tale of a rubbish movie director who enjoys cross-dressing and hangs out with a group of weirdoes is likely not to be to everyone's taste.  Regardless of this, if it interests you then you should be pleased with a slick movie that takes an amusing and affectionate look at what is a fairly depressing story.",,Anonymous,Biography
weird - thank god,"There isn't enough weirdness of this ilk in the world. I rated this a 10 because it is perfect in its imperfection, just like Ed Wood was. Come on, the guy did 'Plan 9' for cryin' out loud. How perfectly horrible was that movie??Landau was flawless as Bela Lugosi. Johnny Depp was his usual wonderful weird self. What is there to say about Bill Murray that hasn't already been said? Sarah Jessica Parker was brilliant as the not quite an airhead girlfriend/wife.Frankly, I just can't find anything wrong with this movie except that it ends. I just wanted the weirdness to go on and on.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A must-see for Ed Wood fans although others might not get it,"This is probably my favorite Tim Burton film because I love the incredibly wretched films of Ed Wood and appreciate a bio-pic of this king of dreck! Having seen BRIDE OF THE MONSTER, GLEN OR GLENDA, PLAN 9, NIGHT OF THE GHOULS AND JAIL BAIT, I was absolutely thrilled that the stories behind these films was finally brought to the screen. Plus, it was a great thrill to see the behind the scenes work that crazy of Ed did to get his horrible films made. It also helped that Johnny Depp played the character with so much energy and sincerity. It helped even more that the producers took such great pains to replicate the weird group of stock characters from the Wood films. Of course Martin Landau got a lot of attention (and an Oscar) for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi, but the rest of the characters were so close it was spooky. Plus, I admired that even the clothing and sets were dead on as well. Instead of simply making fun of Wood's horrible career, the film is more of a loving homage to a man who made rotten films that were still somehow very appealing--leading his films to be regarded as trash film cult classics. Perfect and enjoyable throughout and a truly wonderful time capsule.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Charming,"This movie is interesting and well-made, a fun romp through the less than professional Hollywood lots of the day. Johnny Depp is great as director Ed Wood who comes across as a really nice guy, but devoid of the strength of character or vision needed to be a good director. The subplot is also interesting and even sad since it illustrates how the once-famous Bela Lugosi ended up in the obscurity and poverty all Hollywood stars must surely have nightmares about. Tim Burton's directing is very good, and the end product is quite satisfying.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pull the string?!?!,"If you ever seen Samurai Cop,The Room or even Dolemite you'll know all about cringe-worthy entertainment. These movies are so outrageously bad that you'll enjoy them on many levels and will be quoting them probably for the rest of your life, more so than well- respected movies. But behind every disaster is a director with heart, and a cast in need of a paycheck.Call it irony, but Tim Burton assembled a fine cast of character actors and made a film about the worst director of all time and in the process spent more money than Ed Wood could ever dream of. Like Dolly Parton once said, ""it costs a lot of money to look this cheap"". Say what you want about Ed Wood, but 50 years after his monstrosities were produced, people are still watching them. I doubt you could guarantee this longevity for The Hobbit or any of the current 40 million films that star Benadryl Cabbagepatch.Martin Landau carried away an Academy Award, as Best Supporting Actor, as did Rick Baker for his make up effects, but, even with these selling points, audiences never gave it a chance, which is a real shame because the movie needs to be seen to be believed, and for all aspiring or struggling filmmakers out there you will find many familiar problems between yourselves and Mr. Wood, regardless of your talent.Chronicling the events of the mid-Fifties, through the production of three of Wood's classic disasters, Tim Burton's biopic achieves the impossible - we side with Ed, we identify with him, we wish him and his eccentric gaggle of pals only success and happiness in his cozy little world of half-baked ideas and misguided optimism. Success eluded Wood, but he achieved a greater fame and lasting appeal beyond his short life and this eccentric movie, which will make you faceplam for most of its running time, is our portal into Wood's oddball mind.Alternately hilarious and touching, our sympathies lie with Wood and his ever loyal, declining co-star Bela Lugosi (a barely recognizable Martin Landau). Other characters pop up, including the hairy-as-hell Tor Johnson (George 'The Animal' Steele), wannabe transsexual Bunny Breckinridge (Bill Murray), a very, very buxom Elvira-type (Lisa Marie), Criswell - the most famous predictor in the land (Jeffrey Jones), and a beleaguered Orson Welles (Vincent D'Onofrio) - an atypical assortment of rejects, failures and weirdos.Burton is inclined to produce a flop, when he indulges too much. Just as the audiences stayed away from Mars Attacks!, they never even considered Ed Wood, because of the black-and-white photography, which was a truly inspired decision. One cannot imagine how much the movie's legitimacy would have been lessened if it was in color. I must assure you that, no matter how offbeat and strange it looks, this film is an absolute classic that begs to be seen. It may not be to everyone's taste, but it has a wicked sense of humor and is sure to have you in stitches.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
His Talent Did Not Match His Ideas,"Poor Ed Wood, celebrated only now not for any great work he achieved in life, but for the spectacular mediocrity of his productions. Yet I'd like to think that somewhere in the great beyond Edward Wood, Jr. is pleased at how Tim Burton and Johnny Depp captured the very soul of a man who was born too soon or too late for various points in history.As a biographer on his page at IMDb correctly points out during the hey day of the Poverty Row studios he could have settled comfortably in a career putting out shlock and making a living at it, had he come along in the Thirties. If Ed Wood were a young man today, he would find acceptance and support for his cross-dressing in a growing movement for transgender rights.It was his sad misfortune to come of age in the fifties when movies were competing with television and could no longer inflict shlock on the public. He could no longer get work at Monogram or PRC or any of those other minor studios as a hack writer. But Wood was ambitious and like Orson Welles who he idolized he wanted to be a one man creative force.As a cross-dresser Wood dreamed of a project that could explain his story and the stories of millions of others. He went to battle in several campaigns in the Marines with female undergarments. As Johnny Depp tells us his biggest fear was getting wounded lest his secret be discovered.In his film Glen or Glenda he tried hard to tell of the duality of his sexual nature. Sad he didn't have the talent to pull it off.Johnny Depp who made a deliberate career choice of eschewing teenage idol roles which he could have had after 21 Jump Street, notches his best screen performance as Ed Wood. Depp should have gotten at least an Oscar nomination for Best Actor.One man who did win an Oscar in Ed Wood was Martin Landau who really does make you think you're watching Bela Lugosi. A Lugosi who puts aside the mask of horror he wore on his public face and lets you into his inner sanctum. A broken 70 something narcotic addicted actor who forms a great kinship with Wood because he feels needed and wanted again by somebody. And Wood basks in the attention that a former film star gives him. It's one of the most touching symbiotic relationships ever shown on screen. Landau's Best Supporting Actor was a foregone conclusion.Long after the action of this film concluded Ed Wood died in 1953 in total obscurity. Johnny Depp and Tim Burton have given his life meaning in this film. As transgender people demand their just due in the public square, I'd like to think that an eighty something Ed Wood would be right in the forefront of things. I myself went to Washington, DC this year and lobbied with a number of transgender folks all over the country for federal hate crimes and anti-discrimination laws as a friend and ally. Ed Wood would be there no doubt in my mind.I'm willing to bet that he would have been doing a documentary on a subject near and dear to him. And it would have been a subject near and dear and Oscar caliber stuff like his own life story was.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
It is OK to have monsters...,"This is an interesting movie... The plot has to do with the real life of Ed Wood, a wanna-be director of b-movies and the people in his life. I found a parallel with ""All about my mother"" from Almodovar with the scene of Ed's (or should I say Eda's) dance. In the film from Almodovar it was Segrado's speech - here it was a dance. Both seemed to me very profound messages going something like - ""It is OK to have monsters""...I think that this movie would benefit greatly from a greater engagement of emotions since these where usually playing in sotto voce...! I think the relationship of Bela and Ed could be more developed and so could relationships in general.I feel that Tim Burton's work (here and in nearly all of his movies) has to do with coming in terms with monsters within - these may or usually may not be as frightening as before approaching them... As such I am really interested in watching all of his movies!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
when cinema surpasses reality,"After all the fuss about Ed Wood being the worst director of all times, it's been a logical choice to see this movie. In retrospect, this movie might be an important contributor to this ""fame"".After reading about Ed Wood's life, i must admit that Tim Burton's effort was one of those movies that painted reality in bright colors, making it much nicer than it actually had been. Ed Wood was genuinely untalented. Perseverance with which he approached film making has been his only true strength. Otherwise he seemed to be unhappy in this life, even according by Tim Burton's movie and Johny Depp's portrayal.One scene stuck with me. After an overdose Bela Lugosi called Ed Wood. He rushed to the scene only to be asked to bring goulash which should supposedly help the incapacitated Bela Lugosi recover.Overall, the movie is not bad. It is rather a question why such fascination with such a character...",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
A perfect example of a film that had me completely gripped right from the beginning!-Utterly brilliant!,"This biopic on ""the worst director of all time"" Ed Wood Jnr is utterly brilliant from start to finish. From its exhilarating beginning, helped by Howard Shore's brilliant score and Jeffrey Jones's delightful turn as Criswell, it completely gripped me. For me it isn't only one of Burton's better movies, but also one of the better movies of 1994. Tim Burton's works are admittedly strange and offbeat, and while people mayn't like that, I do. And that is why I loved this film, it was funny, it was touching, it was strange(well sort of) and it was offbeat. It is gorgeously shot, with black and white photography that is really a marvel to the eyes, and Burton lovingly directs. The script is funny and poignant, and the restoration of Wood's productions are astonishing. It was even nice to see Plan 9 From Outer Space, I know that critics cite it as the worst movie ever made, but there are other people who consider it as a ""so bad it's good"" movie, the way I have heard people talk about the film, whether they love or hate it, is quite fascinating. And the performances are brilliant; Johnny Depp is amazing as Ed Wood, portraying him as an optimist and an ""anguished cross-dresser"", and Martin Landau is absolutely superb as Bela Lugosi. Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette are alluring and convincing as Delores and Kathy, and as Bunny Bill Murray does well even if Bunny could've been developed a little more. Overall, gripping, funny, touching and brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Cut, print, we're moving on; that was perfect""","What a delight! Dreamlike in tone, ""Ed Wood"" lovingly imparts to viewers the humorously delusional world of 1950s bad-film artiste Edward D. Wood, Jr. (Johnny Depp), creator of legendary bad films, most notably ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". Part of the film's charm is how it portrays Wood, gushing with uncalled-for enthusiasm and optimism. Depp's facial expressions are priceless; that glib smile, those bugged-out eyes, the raised eyebrows, all enhanced by exaggerated makeup.But no amount of incompetence can deny Wood's passion for making films. With a big megaphone to call out commands to his actors, Wood is like a ten-year-old boy, thoughtless of the finished product; he just wants to play movie director.Wood surrounds himself with a motley crew of Hollywood misfits, including most especially washed-up ""Dracula"" actor Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), whose relationship with Wood propels most of the film's plot. But there are other, equally eccentric, people drawn to Wood, the most interesting being Bunny Breckinridge (a surprisingly good performance by Bill Murray), Vampira (Lisa Marie), and Criswell (Jeffrey Jones), that otherworldly seer of the future. The misfit label applies to Wood too, of course, who directs his actors, dressed in women's clothes, seemingly oblivious to the managerial discordance of such attire.The script's characters and the film's high-contrast B&W lighting combine to portray Hollywood as a comically nightmarish place of delusional unreality. Simple sets mirror the cheapness in Wood's world. And that bongo-laced score with accompanying Theremin and crashing symbols is almost hypnotic.Acting is way, way above average. Depp is absolutely terrific. And so is Landau. I can't think of any weak performances. My only problem with this film is that the plot gives a tad too much attention to Lugosi.That Wood was anointed as the ""worst director of all time"" seems a bit cruel. At least he had heart and soul. Yet one cannot deny the unintended humor in his films.Wonderfully nostalgic, ""Ed Wood"" reflects back to another era in film-making, when thinking big, self-assurance, and nerve were all a young man needed to make his Hollywood dreams come true, no matter how untalented.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the most charming movies ever,"When thinking about Ed Wood there is a word that always comes to my mind in first: charm. This movie oozes a worthiness for loving it few movies do. Because underneath its mix of genres, it's the most unnoticed one which ends up revealing itself as the most important: affecting drama.Ed Wood is an all-around player. It has tons of humor (white and dark), including many comic scenes and hilarious characters. It has an experimental feel too, reflected on a couple of bizarre shots. It is an impeccable drama, full of feeling and transcendent events. But in the end, Ed Wood is, overall, a sort of a romantic comedy between the characters and the audience. I know it sounds pedantic and weird, but remember this thought when the final credits roll.What does this feeling come from? It comes from Tim Burton's genuine love for the characters. No matter how pathetic they are, Tim shows love for them in every shot, and he shows it so well that the affection is contagious. You just can't help but feel that Ed, Bela, Tor and Vampira have been there in your life forever. They are family.And just because of that, the film is so affecting. Bash me if you want, but Bela Lugosi's death saddened me more than 200 dramas. The affectionate friendship between Ed and Bela is touching, and Bela's death put an end to that. It also helped the fact that Martin Landau nails the character, playing the role of his life. His performance is one of the most astonishing I've ever seen, and clearly one of the three main reasons to watch this movie. Hats off.Tim Burton is in top form too, constructing, in my opinion, an almost perfect film that ranks first in his work. Other Burton's movies are tremendous, but this simply has it all: awesome performances, intelligent script, prominent aesthetics, historical accuracy (although this is not an inherent value in Burton's work, it is here), and a jaw-dropping direction. Just take a look at the scene that takes place inside the ""spook train"" and you'll know what I'm saying. There's a care for detail too that shows in credits, music...And one more thing: if you don't laugh with this film, you're dead.RATING: 9.8",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Masterpiece,"Ed Wood (1994)**** (out of 4)Burton's masterpiece is a loving tribute to ""B"" monster movie maker Edward D. Wood, Jr. played perfectly by Johnny Depp. The film covers Ed's life up to the release of Plan 9 From Outer Space but the true heart of the movie centers on Wood's relationship with a washed up Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau). To me this is perhaps the greatest film about the making of movies because of how it shows the ups and downs even though the majority of Wood's life were full of downs. The movie is about a lot of things and includes many great jabs at Hollywood but the true brilliance of the film is in its relationship between Wood and Lugosi. This here is where the movie really jumps off the screen because the love story between these two struggling men is where the heart is at and it's these scenes that are going to make the movie last for a very long time. The beautiful B&W cinematography also stands out and Burton has no trouble at building up a realistic setting. I know Burton will always be best known for his big budget action pictures but there's no question this here is his greatest work. The amount of time and detail in every shot jumps off the screen for various reasons but one is the performance from Depp. The way Depp brings Wood to life is something incredible to watch as his always joyful personality jumps out at the viewer and grabs ahold of them making him impossible not to love. As great as Depp is though the film still belongs to Landau who rightfully won an Oscar for his role as Bela Lugosi. Having seen nearly every Lugosi film available, I'm still shocked at how well Landau does him to this day. After numerous viewings of this film I still can't believe at how well Landau got his accent as well as certain gestures and moves. Depp and Landau together make for one of the most beloved duos in film history. Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette, Jeffrey JOnes, Vincent D'Onofrio, Juliet Landau and Bill Murray all turns in strong supporting performances as well. Mike Starr, as producer Georgie Weiss, also sticks out in a great comedic performance. I can't think of too many film's that contain a bigger heart than this one. Not only showing the love between Wood and Lugosi but also being able to show respect and love for this type of movie. Burton was a big fan of these ""B"" and ""C"" movies so it was nice seeing him pay them respect and this really comes true when the premiere of Plan 9 From Outer Space where the cast and director get cheers for what joy they've brought many fans.",,Anonymous,Biography
HUUUUGE surprise...,"I didn't know anything about this movie until i saw it. All i knew was that it's an autobiographical film about an old bad director.I was surprised to see a great film, and the shock came from the first seconds when i saw that it's black and white. A sign of originality.Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood, a stupid movie director from a long time ago, desperately fighting with all his critics and with his financiary problems to see his dreams come true.Never give up. That's the best line for this film. No matter what, never give up in trying to accomplish your dream. Ed Wood, although it's obviuos that he's really bad, has one huge quality, that every filmmaker wannabe should have: the perseverence. He keeps trying and trying and with the help of old Dracula, Bela Lugosi, he succeeds in one of his films.Johnny Depp is great as Ed Wood and manages to play another brilliant role to add to his long list. Also good points for Landau and Sarah Jessica Parker.All in all, very good and nice to watch. Do yourselves a favor and don't miss this one.

one of the best films of 1994,"Here is an example of film-making elements coming wonderfully together, in a package that can entertain the usual moviegoers and give the movie-geek his or her money's worth. That it is also perhaps the most well-rounded of Tim Burton's films, with enough does of comedy, drama, and movie-within-movie stylings, to fit two movies is an added plus. He tells the story of Edward D. Wood Jr (Johnny Depp), who may or may not be the most well-known bad filmmaker ever to exist with enough humanity and care to not make it at all parody, even if there is comedy interspersed. His story is one that is actually quite the same of most filmmakers, who want to make it somehow and have big dreams and lofty visions. Though taking into account Wood's preclivaty of wearing women's clothes (particularly the angora sweaters), hanging out with transvestites and other undesirables, and his best friend is a thought to be dead ex-horror icon (Martin Landau as Bella Lugosi, in a richly deserved Oscar turn) addicted to methadone, the path of his story is rather unconventional to say the least.But the style of the film is quite ingenious, with rich and cool black and white photography, a finely moving and appropriate score (though not by Danny Elfman), and touting an all around best-in-show cast. Depp especially has a lot of fun playing this man, who may or may not be close to how he was in real life (from what I've read about him it's a fairly close depiction), and his portrayal of Wood is not at all cheating and is, in some scenes, really touching. The ones that stick out for me are the ones with Landau at his house, and filming his one scene from Plan 9 From Outer Space, but the ones with him on his 'sets', filming such drek with the passion and ambition of the greats, is really refreshing to see. Ed Wood is quite the biopic, showcasing Burton in another maturer form outside of films like Pee Wee and Batman, but with the same knack for entertainment. After all, how can you dislike a film with Tor Johnson, Elvira, and Bill Murray desiring a sex-change operation?",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tim Burton & Johnny Depp's Best,"I thought this movie was overall very good. It's one of those movies that you have to ""get in to"". The thing that makes it ten times better is watching the Ed Wood movies themselves. They did an excellent job at recreating the sets and matching the dialog. I'd say that this film was arguably Tim Burton's best. ""Big Fish"" was good, but it didn't have the Tim Burton style. ""Edward Siccorhands"" had a little too much Tim Burton style, but that didn't detract from the film at all. I guess it's all just a matter of opinion. If you're more into a story and character driven movie, this is definitely for you. If you like cheap action and cheap laughs, don't watch this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Edwood candor-hands (cinematheque) (vhs),"Well, a movie about movies, it's always a bit narcissus for me. Speaking about his art is the easiest project that a lazy author can imagine. Here, i can make an exception because the real Wood was so goofy that it's funny after all. Above all, he is a passionate man and his fire is contagious.Beyond this, the movie is foremost a story about an extraordinary friendship between Wood and the old Bela. Martin Landau is totally moving playing this waned star and it's totally right he won the Oscar for this. I was surprised to see that his daughter is playing along him too but even without this, the talent of Tim is to impulse a familial mood to his cast. I would also give a very honorable to her then girlfriend, Lisa Marie, because as Vampira, she vampirises the part!I really don't know what could have brought Danny but it's certain that Shore is an excellent substitute and his Wood's theme is really good.Finally, i wonder if Wood was so a disastrous director. For example, i find it was really a stroke of a genius to have the cast printed over the tombstones at the beginning and in fact, the original idea comes from Wood himself. His ""Plan 9 from outer space"" opens like this but in the same time, i admit i didn't have the desire to go further !",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Burton's best!,"Filmed entirely in black and white, the story is a fictionalized biopic of Edward D. Wood Jr, (Johnny Depp), a 1950's film director who writes, produces and directs a series of low-budget, science-fiction/horror films. Struggling to break into the film industry as a Director, Wood serendipitously runs into aging film star, Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau,) believing he is his ticket to success.While the film essentially lampoons Wood's attempts at film-making, its central theme is the heart-warming friendship between Wood and Lugosi as the latter battles morphine addiction. The performances are exceptional. Depp entertains as the deluded, eccentric, transvestite filmmaker while Landau is equally brilliant and delivers an Oscar-winning performance as Lugosi. The supporting cast are just as memorable with good performances from Jeffrey Jones (Criswell), Bill Murray (Bunny Breckenridge) and Sarah Jessica Parker (Dolores Fuller).",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tim Burton's best film ?,"With this film, Tim Burton planned  to tell us the life of the worst director in the world ever. His name was Ed Wood and he lived in the fifties. We learn that Ed Wood loves wearing angora pullovers and women clothes. He also loves being dressed up as a woman and above all he's fond of the actor Bela Lugosi and his horror films. When Wood's meeting him for the first time, he's so elated that he wants him to play on his poor films. On the other hand, Burton show us the way Ed Wood used to make his films and we can say that they were very eccentric: for example a wholesaler in meat accepted to produce one of his films ""Bride of the Monster"" and the special effects are ridiculous: in the worst film ever made ""Plan 9 from outer space"" (even the title doesn't mean anything), flying saucer are made of cardboard. Then, in the last years of his life, Wood was living in poverty, took a lot of alcohol and finally died in 1978 at the age of 54 years old.This film is very successful because Burton attempts to reconstruct Ed Wood's life as precisely as possible and Johnny Depp is very convincing in the role of this fascinating man so Burton succeeded in his plan. Of course Wood's films are the worst films ever made but he thought that he was making masterpieces just like Orson Welles! I found it both funny and extraordinary. But the film is worth being watched thanks also to Martin Landau who is very good in his Bela Lugosi role; thanks to his performance, he won an oscar for the supporting role. The other actors like Bill Murray or Patricia Arquette are very well used  Moreover, the film alternates comic moments, especially when Wood is making his films, and tragic moments such as Lugosi's funerals. At last not only made Burton a masterpiece but he also paid a tribute to Z films.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fantastically good biopic,"Ed Wood is, for me, without question Tim Burton's best movie. It's not exactly a typical Burton movie, although it does still have his stamp. It, of course, tells the story of the director Edward D. Wood Jr. who for some is the worst film-maker who has ever lived. I feel I should lay my cards out on the table up front in regards to this widely held view and say that Wood is not only categorically not the worst director ever, he isn't even close to being such. Anyone who has seen a selection of Wood's movies should be able to see that, while they may be full of silliness and mistakes, they are also utterly unique in approach and, best of all, highly entertaining. And, trust me, you can't say those two things about the output of the vast majority of directors in the history of cinema. No, Ed Wood is a treasured cult film-maker for a reason.Getting back to Burton's biopic, it's a fabulous tribute to the man with an excellent script, beautiful look and some amazing performances. It's definitely a case of hats off to Burton for immortalising Wood with a film that pulls off the very tricky thing of celebrating the ridiculous nature of his work, while paying respect to his singularity of vision. We are invited to laugh at the shoddy content of his films, while being actively encouraged to respect the man for his passion and optimism. Of great service here is Johnny Depp, who truly plays Wood to perfection, making us understand how his films ended up the way they did without ridiculing him. There is plenty of drama to work off, with Wood's cross-dressing compulsion and his friendship with horror icon Bela Lugosi, who is an aging, heroin-addicted and poverty stricken man by this time. He is played with uncanny brilliance by Martin Landau. The make-up is incredible and you truly forget it is not Lugosi himself on-screen so wonderful is the acting. Later in the movie there is a key scene where Wood encounters Orson Welles in a bar. Here we have the so-called worst director of all-time talking on the same level with the man who is for many the greatest. The point of the scene is that, no matter the perceived abilities of the men, they both suffered very similar problems with getting their films made as they wanted them; both were highly personal film-makers and such types never truly fit in to the Hollywood system.Stylistically, this is bang-on yet never over-does it. The brilliant opening credit sequence pays playful homage to the kinds of cardboard sets and terrible special effects Wood became synonymous with, while the very effective Howard Shore soundtrack is on the money. The decision to shoot is black and white was perfect as it mimics the world of Woods films. We are introduced to all manner of strange misfits who hung around Wood and appeared in his movies. The story covers the production of Wood's three most famous films, Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 from Outer Space. Pleasingly, there is plenty of time devoted to each film and we are able to enjoy loving scene reconstructions from all, including some choice, strange and ridiculous dialogue.Ed Wood is an equally hilarious and heart-felt film. It is about the love of movies. It's very inspiring, entertaining and poignant. A brilliant achievement from Tim Burton and a fabulous tribute to one of the ultimate cult film-makers of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

simply good,"'Ed Wood' is a film that is considered a good film for several reasons, and it is a film that I imagine most people would like if they would just give it a chance. But, don't let that spoil it or hype it up. You really have to watch the film to believe it yourself.'Ed Wood' is a semi-documentary film about a film director who produced some films that were considered pretty dreadful. This film introduces us to Ed Wood and his many friends, most of them actors and people in the movie business, and his love of dressing up in women's clothing. (This film's humor is often tongue-in-cheek and even witty in places, but it's also sad - and certainly not a comedy.) If you're bored of the typical current movie and want a little something to make you chuckle and think a little bit, then I suggest you watch 'Ed Wood'.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tim Burton's Lost Masterpiece,"Doubtlessly the most underrated and misunderstood movie in this brilliant director's career, Ed Wood is one of Tim Burton's best movies, right up there with his four timeless masterpieces - Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Batman. It's very different from anything else he's done before, though. Even the music is different - it was composed by Howard Shore ('The Lord Of The Rings') instead of Tim's regular partner since the beginning, the brilliant Danny Elfman. Few of Burton's beloved motifs are to be found here. I think the reason is that he meant for Ed Wood to look like an Ed Wood film rather than a Tim Burton film - and it works, down to the black & white and the cheesy dialogue. It's a camp masterpiece, and essential for Burton fans.Granted, Tim's choice of subject matter for this film - a biography of the worst director in history - may seem odd, but then again he was never the kind of director who repeats himself (except for the excellent Batman Returns, of course). And in his skilled hands, the rather messy storyline makes for a wonderful comedy that is absolutely hilarious - but also, at times, touching. The character of Edward Wood (played skillfully by the one and only Johnny Depp) is so absolutely pathetic that he can really get to you - his incredible ambition even at the face of repeating failure (""...The worst movie you ever saw? Well, my next one will be even better!""), his childish enthusiasm, his absolute assurance in his 'vision' (his wonderful dialogue with Orson Wells) and lack of patience to get it done with (he does one take for every shoot) and his fondness for women's clothing make him a unique and lovely character, and in Johnny's hands he is brought back to life.The rest of the cast is also wonderful, and a great deal effort was put into choosing actors as similar as possible to the real people they're portraying. Best of all is of course the wonderful Martin Landau who does fantastic job as horror superstar Bela Lugosi. Jeffery Jones as Criswell, Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge, pro-wrestler George 'The Animal' Steele as Tor Johnson and Sarah Jessica Parker as Dolores Fuller, as well as all the rest, are terrific. I recommend seeing at least one of Ed Wood's films (preferably 'Bride of the Monster' or 'Plan 9 from Outer Space') before watching Ed Wood, and that would give you a much better perspective at the film and the characters.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lovely little movie,"It is strange that director with the obvious talents of Tim Burton would chose to make a film about the worst filmmaker who ever lived.  However, in light of recent research about the inability of the incompetent to know they are incompetent, it seems to be a clear case study of just such a person.That being said, despite the fact the film didn't make any money (despite costing next to nothing to make), the film is well put together and compelling in its own way.  Moreover, considering the budget of Burton's previous movies (Batman, Batman Returns) and the weaknesses of the subsequent one (Mars Attacks), this one stands up with his better work. Burton seems to cast by random chance (Michael Keaton as Batman!), but instead he seems to know exactly what an actor is capable of.  Johnny Depp as Wood is allowed to be the only one who is allowed to be in on the joke, yet ironically he is the only character who can't see the folly of his ways. He brings a passion to Wood that isn't there in real life (check out Wood's own performance in Glen or Glenda), but his passion for his work brings us sympathy as he goes from botched production to botched production.Martin Landau also seems miscast as Bela Lugosi (the real Lugosi would have appeared to be a midget against the much taller Landau), but like Lugosi's stand-in in ""Plan 9"", he too manages to walk the fine line between passion and overacting.Thus while Wood fails as a director, he succeeds as a human being.  He may have made the world's worst films, but at least he made a modest living doing what he enjoyed doing and lived out his dream.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Is it me or are black and white films just cooler? (Raging Bull, Casablanca and  ED WOOD!)","Having sat through the disaster that is the remake of Planet of The Apes, I felt that Tim Burton, not Edward D. Wood Jr., deserved the accolade of 'worst movie director of all time'. However, it was only a minor blip in a career that really I much admire: Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow being two of the three films that particularly stand out. There is no surprise that these two movies include the wonderful Johnny Depp, whose career peaked in the 90s (Pirates of The Caribbean was NOT that good, in fact it's quite average if you watch it again - most likely due to Orlando Bloom) with the outrageous Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas and the magnificent Donnie Brasco. However, Depp's defining performance (I think we're seeing a trend here) is in the biographical film of the title character Ed Wood. His constant smiling and his optimism, despite the truly terrible films that he writes/produces/directs/acts etc, are quite lovable to such an extent that the audience let him get away with his angora sweater fetish. The film is so funny - not only Depp, but the supporting cast as well. Martin Landau won an Oscar for his performance which I find actually quite surprising because Oscars don't generally go to comedic characters (Sam Jackson in Pulp Fiction, anyone?) but I guess even the stiffs at Oscar would have had a hard time not laughing at Landau's 'Bela Lugosi' wrestling with a plastic, inanimate, giant octopus. I love the style of the film: it's nice to see that the people from Hollywood still have the time to laugh at their industry's past mistakes in between making movies like Armageddon, Pearl HarboUr and The Sum of All Fears (do we sense another trend here?!)- actually, while I'm on it, I'd just like to say Ben, what happened, man? You wrote, inconceivably, Good Will Hunting!. But the best part of the film is that it's all true (well most of it, anyway). Check out Edward D. Wood Jr.'s career - he did actually make a film called Glen or Glenda, about a heterosexual man with transvestite tendencies, starring none other than Bela Lugosi. Only in Hollywood. Anyway, I realise that I haven't really given you that much information about the film here, so all I'll say is that I loved it. If you haven't seen it yet I envy you, because this film has the unusual quality of being fantastic the first time round; thus, you are in for a treat.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
redemptive friendship,"There were two elements of this movie that I think made it uniquely enjoyable. One was the portrayal of the friendship between Ed Wood and Bela Lugosi; the other was Wood's unstoppable persistence, which made for some of the funnier scenes (such as the cast's creative after-hours requisitioning of needed props).His starstruck pursuit of Lugosi to play a part in Plan 9 From Outer Space turns into a friendship of the most devoted kind. Even after Lugosi had been reduced to a life of poverty, loneliness, and illness, a flawed and failing man, Wood revered him, feeling lucky to be in his presence while helping him in very basic ways.The angora sweater thing was not as important in the story as the promotional blurb makes it out to be.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A wonderful movie,but still a complete exaggeration of the truth.","Ed Wood is a very easy movie to enjoy,But the fact is that about 10% of it is true. I am sick and tired of watching movies about real people and there lives ,and then finding out that the facts were thrown out the window for more ""presentable"" situations. I mean let's face it,Ed Wood and Bela Lugosi were not pals by any stretch of the imagination. Lugosi only accepted work from Wood because he needed the money. It is truly sad that even after so many years have passed that Lugosi is still being  milked by the media for his ""Dope"" addiction. In real life Ed Wood was little more than an alchoholic and pornographer. If anyone out there thinks I am being too hard on Eddie that's too bad cause these are the facts. It should be a crime to take someones life and rewrite it for ""entertainment"" purposes.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sock Puppet,"If a life in film is a a relationship with a being, then this is the shoes. They're handy, and only seem necessary when not dreaming.But they're not what gets you anywhere.I consider this Tim Burton's best film. That stop animation thing was more successful, but its too artificially goofy. This is more real and the idea is to straddle the line between homage and distanced observation. Its the only one that I think works, though ""PeeWee"" comes close. But that's because that whole movie is in its tone. Here, the movie is centered in the beings involved and how they relate to the films they are making, which of course happens to be the same relationship the characters and actors have with the movie we are watching.Its because it is a real movie, with arcs, three acts, and an end that works. Burton isn't so picky about these things in his other projects and none has all three.I wonder why no one holds him to this value, of building a film from the inside out. He needs someone to guide him away from merely starting with tone, and Elfman honks.There are two folds here. The first is obvious, a self-described quirky filmmaker making a film with wit about an unintentionally quirky filmmaker making what he sees as serious films. The second is the ""Shadow of the Vampire"" bit about Landau's Lugosi. Its something of a wholly separate thread, handled with a different tone in all dimensions.Meaningful narrative needs tension, and I am increasingly convinced that in cinema that requires two different whole personalities. It seems better if those wholenesses have their own cinematic space, as it is here.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Biography
Every artist's professional nightmare,"Anyone who considers himself/herself to be a creator of any kind - inventor, musician, artist, writer - will consider this movie to be their worst professional nightmare. Imagine yourself dedicated to your craft, day after day and year after year putting out what you consider to be your best work in a field that you love only to find, at the end of your life, that you have failed in every way measurable and imaginable. This is essentially the story of director Edward D. Wood, Jr. 1924-1978, who was voted the worst director in the history of film in 1980, and as a result saw a renewed interest in his films that persists even today.Johnny Depp gives a great performance as Ed Wood as he was in the 1950's, starting with his friendship with Bela Lugosi and ending with the premiere of his best remembered film ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"" and his elopement with Kathy, who remained his wife for twenty years until his death. At this point in his life Ed's enthusiasm for his work is irrepressible. Fortunately the film ends before he descends into frustration, alcoholism, and a series of skin flicks in the 60's. The genuine friendship between Lugosi (Martin Landau) and Wood is one of the more touching parts of the film. The men settle into almost a father/son relationship with a real mutual professional admiration. Lugosi supplies Ed with a star with which he can attract investors in his films, and Wood supplies Lugosi with work and a reason to go on living. Landau's portrayal of Lugosi is phenomenal. At times you forget that you really are not watching Lugosi himself.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Failure And Success -- An Unlikely Masterpiece Pt. II,"Not only is this bittersweet story of a ""failed"" Hollywood dreamer by far the best movie of Tim Burton's career, it seems to have inspired more compelling commentary than any other film on IMDb. I would like to focus on the ""failure"" of Ed Wood as an artist -- as opposed to his success as a human being -- and explore the movie's definition of ""sucess.""A few years ago, a very insightful gentleman made a number of brilliant points about why this movie wasn't a hit. (Check the IMDb comment index for ""An Unlikely Masterpice."") Basically Ed Wood's failure shows that the American dream is a lie. Do your best, believe in yourself and never quit, and you can still end up with nothing. Unquestionably that is the message the mass audience got, and that is why the movie bombed in theaters. But is that all the movie really says? If Ed Wood's failure as an artist was the only point, this movie would be just another dreary tract of the socialist realist school -- like Rod Serling's ""Requiem For A Heavyweight."" Ed Wood is just another dreamer betrayed by the system -- he's Willy Loman gone to Hollywood.If you watch the movie closely there's another story going on. This is the story of Ed Wood's growth as a human being. Even as his movie dreams fail, the movie charts his successful -- I repeat, successful -- efforts to form meaningful relationships with people he cares about.Notice how the movie quietly records Ed's growth in relationships. At the beginning, he's living with Dolores. He doesn't tell her he likes to wear women's clothes. He's a gentle man, and he tries to be caring, but he lies to her and manipulates her in many ways. And their relationship suffers, not because of his lack of talent, but his inability to trust. (Note the superb performance by Sarah Jessica Parker, who makes the potentially grating character of the ""wife who doesn't understand"" into a completely compelling and sympathetic figure.) When Dolores leaves him, Ed has the opportunity to retreat, to become more bitter and manipulative. Instead he learns to be more open and honest. When he meets Cathy, (Patricia Arquette's character,) who is completely innocent and trusting, he knows he can lie to her and start another relationship like the one he had with Dolores. Instead he chooses to tell her the truth right away, literally ""on the first date."" This extraordinary act of courage is in many ways the most compelling moment in the film. And the sweetness of their relationship is a victory many great artists never attain.The same principle applies to Ed Wood's friendship with Bela Lugosi. On one level, this is indeed supreme pathos -- Lugosi who once made masterpieces is reduced to working for a talentless dreamer. But as men, as opposed to artists, Ed Wood and Bela Lugosi are both redeemed by their special friendship. It becomes very clear that, whatever is failings as an artist, Ed Wood is incapable of failure as a friend. He agonizes over Lugosi's decline and gives everything he has so that the great actor can spend his last days doing what he really loves. The fact that the movies they make together are not great works of art is recorded honestly -- but the emotional value of their friendship is also important. These are two men with nothing who choose to create a family bond, and this too is a great victory.Watch the scene where Ed Wood is at home with his adoring new girlfriend Cathy and a dying Lugosi calls for help on the phone. It would be so easy to ignore Bela now that Ed has someone new in his life. But Ed Wood is as incapable of cruelty as he is of artistic success. What he is capable of is growth as a person -- a careful study of the picture shows that he is actually a far better man at the end than he was at the beginning. Far from being pessimistic about life, in many ways ED WOOD is an uplifting movie about the values of friendship, trust, and intimacy.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

PeliculÃ³n: Round 3,"At these stakes it was four in the morning and energy was running out. Gian was falling asleep, one of the reasons why he wasn't paying that much attention; he had had some tough days. On the other hand, I was tired too, but with the disposition to watch Depp's magic.Quickly, Depp it's not the best element of the film, but achieves an uplifting performance, with smiles of his own and respect to his director, who directed him some time before in one of his career's best performances, as another Ed; in the fantastic ""Edward Scissorhands"".It is Martin Landau's show however, who studied his character to the end of the line, just to play it perfectly. It's hard that the movie gets laughs because of its fidelity with its characters' reality, but in short amount of time we understand that it was like that. We understand that Ed Wood was an awful director, writer, producer and actor, when he admired Orson Welles and wanted to be like him.Bela Lugosi was Wood's friend indeed, and worked as a star in the horrible films this movie shows. The people that worked with him (with Ed), a bunch of useless;the well known, the show business persons: they were all real. And Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski don't have to write about it, so it's like that how we can laugh.Tim Burton, at that moment of his career, known as Gotham City's ""creator"", and a gifted man with the camera, was surely the right man for this job. He brought the correct cast, the correct crew (without Danny Elfman, who was replaced by Howard Shore's unfamiliar score) and I can't imagine the film in other hands. It wouldn't even be that good.Although the opening credits showed the director's ego at that time, due to the exclusion (in the credits) of actors that were important because of their characters, replacing them for important name that appear less than a minute in the film. Beside all this, when you see a Tim Burton piece, you know you won't be disappointed visually. It's amazing; even in black and white.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Maybe Burton's Best,"Ed Wood is one of my all time favorite directors. Yes, he made bad films and generally had no idea what he was doing, but he was a very humble guy and he never let bad press get in the way of doing what he had a true passion for, making movies. The problem with the guys making bad horror movies today(Uwe Boll, Ulli Lommel, Eli Roth) is that they all seem arrogant and that is such a shame. Ed Wood is a hero of mine for sticking to what he loved and still keeping a good head on his shoulders. So it's no wonder why I loved this movie so much.I found a copy of this at the library and I was expecting it to be good but not nearly as good as it was. See, I was expecting a fairly depressing drama that left me feeling cold, but what I got was a quirky and fun comedy with some dramatic elements. I knew from the second that this one started that it was going to be a new favorite of mine.Johnny Depp and Tim Burton have come to be one of my favorite film duos. This film is no exception to their greatness. All of the actors are absolutely wonderful in their roles. The story is great because it mostly sticks to the true story and I really appreciated that. I also love that it was filmed in black and white to give it the whole ""Ed Wood"" feel. I had so much fun watching it.If you like Ed Wood's films and you're interested in the story of his life, this movie is certainly for you. I can't recommend it enough and I think you'll enjoy it as much as I have. Give a chance, please!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ends Lugosi,"A comedy drama about Bela Lugosi, whether intended or not, 'Ed Wood' is a flat and muddled bio of Ed Wood because it presents itself more as a take on the late life and late career of Bela Lugosi with an unlikely and oddball filmmaker. As such it ends up odd and unlikely too! I can see why it was a hit with film critics, an even bigger hit within the film industry, and a flop with film fans. It certainly isn't a surprising commercial bomb when viewed in retrospect.There are some strange artistic decisions all told; I have watched Ed Wood's most accomplished film, the making of which is the centre point of Tim Burton's 'Ed Wood': namely 'Bride of the Monster'. It is a watchable independently produced piece of 50's film trash, and seems to stand apart from everything else that Ed Wood made, because it's actually watchable trash. Not car crash trash. Bela Lugosi and 'Bride of the Monster' have deformed Tim Burton's film and left it completely unfocused, misaligned, and off balance. They consume it's focus and derail it's drive. Maybe not ""derail"", maybe ""switch"" is the term here. They switch it's tracks.What 'Ed Wood' ends up at is the end of Bela Lugosi, and his final foray into film acting, which leaves it as a sideways glance at a midpoint of Edward Wood's persistent messy career of persistently mangy failures.I appreciate the clean black and white photography, and the production design and art direction are excellent virtues which can't be ignored. The editing is subtle and sweet and rather neat.The writing and scene direction are negatives (although a couple of jokes do land, rather gently; and a couple of sequences work quite well in translation from page to screen.), the acting by contrast varies from good to great across the cast, this reflects well on all the actors, and on Tim Burton's actorly direction: he might have fluffed the interpretation of the script, and he maybe mishandles some scene construction, but he clearly nailed his cast.It's mainly for the efforts of the cast, all good to great, that I give my stars; I rate at 6/10 and I would also mention the work of the crew in photography, lighting, art design and production design.'Ed Wood' is a must watch film for Tim Burton fans, acting fans, ""Hollywood fans"" and fans of genre films and B films from the golden age of classic Hollywood. I recommend accordingly. However, as regards other film viewers, I will reiterate that I can see why this flopped.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

He did what not every actor could do to my mind. I also liked that movie is black and white. Thus, I could better feel the epoch which is shown in the film. I gave 7 because some scenes of the film seemed too long but it is not a big problem. The film is great and I definitely recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The charm and appeal of this film eludes me.,"I just don't get it. Why make a film which celebrates and nearly canonizes a bad filmmaker? I've heard some say that it captures his buoyant enthusiasm and never-say-die spirit. Commendable qualities, to be certain. But it doesn't change the fact that HE WAS A BAD FILMMAKER! And he wasn't bad because he was reaching for something greater than he could achieve, or because he deliberately reveled in camp and bad taste for its own sake (like, say, John Waters). Nor was it true that he was unfairly labeled and vilified by the Hollywood establishment because he flew in the face of their conventions (as such, the association that's made with Orsen Welles late in the movie is particularly laughable). No, the reason Ed Wood was bad was because he was just naturally inept. He had no idea how to appropriately construct a scene, how to direct actors, how to light a film set, how to. .. well, the list goes on and on. Basically, everything a director needs to know how to do - he didn't have the first clue about.What's odd is that the film makes this abundantly clear. There's no attempt to portray him as a closet genius or an ahead-of-his-time visionary. Indeed, the scenes of him directing on a movie set have a kind of 'Saturday Night Live' sketch quality about them, as we watch disaster breaking out all around, and Ed blissfully sitting in the center of it, thinking it's all great. If the movie was constructed as an elaborate joke - a parody of a ""serious"" biography by the use of a laughably inappropriate subject - it might have worked (although even then, it would be a cheap joke - making fun of Ed Wood is about as bold as making fun of Pia Zadora).That certainly seems to be the movie Johnny Depp thought they were making - his portrayal of Ed is so cartoonish and one-dimensional, with exaggerated snappy line deliveries straight out of a '40s B-flick, that it's a role Jon Lovitz - in full ""Yeh, That's the ticket!"" mode - could have done just as well. Director Tim Burton, though, as well as writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, want to find more here than just Ed's ludicrousness. I know this is their intention not because they've found it, but because the film is a leaden bore - so that tells me that it wants to be ""important."" First of all, it's filmed in black and white and we all know that represents high ""artistic"" aspirations. Personally, I think a movie glaring with bright and tacky colors would be the more appropriate way to commemorate Ed Wood's life. But then, I'm thinking of it as a comedy, and this film is serious, very very serious.What it's serious ABOUT, I have no idea. The cruel and unfortunate fate of the talentless? But shouldn't those lacking ability fall to the bottom of their respective fields? Certainly Burton is not bemoaning the fact that Ed was not more successful in Hollywood: that it is precisely Wood's enthusiasm and determination which are the qualities most in  need to counteract the jadedness of the industry? My god, maybe that IS his point! But certainly there exist - and have existed - directors and creators of actual skill and talent who have possessed the exuberance attributed to Ed here. Why commend him on his personal qualities when he was such a washout in the field where he chose to employ them?I don't know. Lots of people like this film. More power to them. Maybe someday someone will be able to explain to me its appeal in a way I can comprehend. All I know is that, at some point, I became impatient and frankly offended at having to sit through the exploits of a no-talent hack. Zeal and enthusiasm - yes, this movie convinced me that Ed Wood had them. But so, I'm told, does Charles Manson. And no one's suggesting we should make a celebratory biopic of HIM.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

Who else could pull off playing the cross-dressing Edward D. Wood Jr.? No one could have been more perfect for the part. Some people are thrown off by the fact that this movie is made in black and white, but that's part of what makes the movie great. Would it really be right to see Bela Lugosi in color? I believe that Ed Wood is one of the greatest cult classics. It's an excellent movie about a horrible movie-maker.",,Anonymous,Biography
A Genuine Classic Movie of the 90s,"Edward D. Wood, Jr. was hailed as the worst director of all time, and was famous for making horrible movies such as ""Glen or Glenda;"" ""Bride of the Monster;"" ""Plan 9 from Outer Space;"" and many other movies that he has made. He works so fast, and never gives up his dreams as he continues to make movies. There have been many fans who enjoy watching movies that are suppose to be bad they are really good. Of course, I enjoy some of Wood's movies and some of the other bad movies that are not directed by Ed Wood like ""Sharknado;"" ""Troll 2;"" and many others. Now, in the mid-90s, there was a movie about Ed Wood and it was famously directed by none other than Tim Burton. Burton was perfect for this biopic on the world's worst director, and he actually succeed it for what he had envisioned for this movie. Johnny Depp was wonderfully superb as Ed Wood, while Martin Landau was absolutely sensational for playing the star of ""Dracula,"" Bela Lugosi. The makeup design by Rick Baker was top notch perfect; the music by Howard Shore was well done, and the film's cinematography was brilliantly shot in black and white. It works so well because most of Wood's movies in the 50s were filmed in black and white. I understand that the movie is not really 100 percent well accurate, but it didn't bother me at all. I still enjoy the movie for what it is, and I wouldn't be upset about this movies if it is whether or not accurate. Nevertheless, it does have a great message when it comes to filmmaking because making movies is not really easy and it cannot always be about the big picture that it will always turn out to be a hit at the box-office, nor saying that it has something to do about the money. I, on the other hand, will never take that kind of route when I am making movies of my own. I make movies by showing the best of my efforts without trying to be a snob or just rushing my movies to get things done. We, as filmmakers, should always take our time and effort as we fully realized our visions for what movies that we want to make. Of course, there will be times that we do get a bunch of bad rep by critics, and we will always have to accept the responsibilities of criticism. We are not always that perfect, and we can't always say nasty things to the critics that our movies are perfect. I know I do enjoy working on some of the movies that I make during my years in junior high school and high school but I am always aware of some of the problems that I had when I am making movies. If they are not as perfect as I hope for, then there is no need to get upset about. We always make mistakes, but we can learned from them as we continue to make good movies and maybe there can be a possibility to make a movie that is perfect. Remember, whenever you are making a movie that you are making, there will always be times that your movies can come out being brilliant or just end up being a disaster. It does take quite a risk for making a movie and we always have to expected for being good; some times your movies can get good reviews and some times your movies can get bad reviews. Whether you have a hit or a flop, all you do is just try to keep up the good work and give out your very best. That is what it takes when it comes to filmmaking. This movie is very important to me because I always want to take notes from it so I can make my movies really good, and not having it to come out as a piece of garbage. Heck, this can be important to you too if you are into the filmmaking business. ""Ed Wood"" is a genuine classic movie of the 90s, and it shall always be one of my favorite movies. I give ""Ed Wood"" a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Biopic from the heart,"You can't imagine anyone else but Tim Burton making this heartfelt tribute to the man they call ""the worst director of all time"". It's a great film, deftly tying tragedy, romance, comedy and drama into what has to be one of the best biopics ever made. Burton successfully recreates what it may have been like to be Edward D. Wood, Jr. and also accurately portrays what the '50s may have been like for a low-budget movie maker. Many of the scenes are intentionally funny because of the things that happen to Wood and his pals and because of his sheer audacity as a film-maker, and it's not often that I get a genuine smile on my face while watching a film like this.The acting is of the highest order, especially from Johnny Depp with another character he makes his own. Martin Landau puts in a superb performance as Bela Lugosi, with the help of some realistic makeup effects from Rick Baker, and deservedly won a best supporting actor Oscar for his turn. Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette are the long-suffering girlfriends; Bill Murray excels as a camp friend who wants to have sex-change operation; Lisa Marie is the spitting image of Vampira; Jeffrey Jones is hilarious as Criswell and everybody else puts in a spirited turn.Of Wood's films, I've only seen PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE at the moment, yet Burton's portrayal of the making of the film comes very close to what actually happens in the film; I'm sure the same can be said for his on-set recreations of GLEN OR GLENDA and BRIDE OF THE MONSTER. Filming it in black and white was a touch of genius as well. ED WOOD is a film for Burton fans; Depp fans; Wood fans; fans of movie-making; '50s cinema; anybody with an interest in the movies and who knows who Wood was. A moving and amusing tale of blood, sweat and tears and one man's dream versus a harsh reality.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Little masterpiece, simple study of human character","First of all, this movie will never be regarded to as too big or influential. It's one of Johnny Depp's movies that just grows to your heart. Bunch of weird characters, portraying another weird characters, a bucket of irony, an inspiring historical figure (Mr. Wood) and a Del-Boy attitude towards the life. It works on so many levels. The simplicity and the laugh when you put your perspective to the whole situation really cheers you up and makes you simply love those people, enthusiasm, laughter... The whole world. I admire the connection between J. Depp and the characters he portrayed, because they give the heart and the sheer essence of little child's soul to each other. So innocent, yet so deep and composite.

"Truly Unique, Strangely Captivating,","Ed Wood is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. You will not find anything else like it, a very unconventional biography that tells a story of a man who never did anything exceptional. Ed Wood was a man who always wanted to make movies, but had absolutely no eye for it, here we get to see the making of some of his infamous classics, and while we will laugh at his work along the way, we also sympathise with this man who just wanted to create, who simply dreamed. It was a perfect vehicle for Burton and Depp, you can feel their manic creativity come to life as they tell this bizarre true life story in an energetic manner, there is no other duo that could have told it more brilliantly.While I did love and was fascinated with the making of his movies, I would have appreciated a deeper insight in to Wood's personal life. It skips over a lot of important elements, bringing them up but never scoping them fully, particularly in his two love lifes, it would have been interesting to receive more information there.The ensemble cast is absolutely tremendous and fit in to this weird world brilliantly. Johnny Depp is, of course, the highlight as Wood, he is absolutely mesmerising in the role, shining and completely believable as this person one could so easily have made a caricature out of. Depp is also joined by the likes of Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette and Bill Murray, who all manage to be truly convincing, despite the absurdness of their characters. Martin Landau also deserves huge credit, usually playing a straight man, he completely transforms himself as Bela Lugosi, doing something immensely different from what we came to expect from his as an actor. His physicality and transformation is so amazing, I did not even know it was him until I saw his name in the credits, a very well deserved Academy Award win.Beautifully frantic, never boring. Terrific performances and an immersing story, I would certainly recommend Ed Wood to anyone looking for an interesting true story.An ambitious film director struggles to make his visions a reality.Best Performance: Johnny Depp",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Typical Burton Oddity,"Edward D. Wood, Jr., best known for ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" was hailed as the worst director in Hollywood history. Yet, Tim Burton manages to compose a dark humored comical tale based on the life and career of this man. Johnny Depp brings his natural odd sense of humor to his performance as the title role. Depp's Ed Wood is composed of the director's odd taste in film direction and his harbored transvestism, but is well acted and brings out laughs at certain points in the film. Martin Landau's supporting role as the famed horror star Bela Lugosi is so brilliant highlighted by the fading stardom that hit Lugosi in his latter years in a changing film world (Landau won the 1994 Oscar for Supporting Actor in the role). Truly a film for any Burton fan and those familiar with Wood's films.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Ed Wood, a Hollywood joke","Johnny Depp is cashmere sweater-wearing Ed Wood in the film of the same name, a purported biopic of Hollywood's worse director.A note - apparently Tim Burton interviewed some of Wood's coworkers, many of whom were living in poverty, and did nothing to help them except buy them a hamburger at Bob's Big Boys. They were not compensated for the use of their names or credited/paid as consultants. Not a nice guy.The film focuses on Wood's transvestism during his most prolific period, the '50s, when he did Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster, or his masterpiece, Plan 9 from Outer Space.Depp is wonderful. Martin Landau steals the show as Wood's friend and collaborator, Bella Lugosi. Just a fabulous performance.Enjoy this film by a jerk of a director.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pointless film about a forgettable figure,"This picture is such a good example of the living end of the American sense of humour, it's astonishing that Jud Apatow did not produce it. The basic material is amusing enough: the story of a movie director so pathetically bad that he never even tried to make a good film. Amusing, that is, for about 10 minutes before the real feature begins. Sadly, director Tim Burton is not able to spin out the talentless Ed Wood's forgettable career into a proper movie because of sheer lack of story. The man managed to pull off one ghastly failure after another far into mid-life, when television mercifully put an end to his efforts. The only angle available is his failed attempt to resuscitate the career of Bela Lugosi (Landau), an ancient vampire ham from silent days. Anyone who remembered Landau's comic role in Woody Allen's Crimes & Misdemeanours would not be surprised by Landau's rich comic creation here. But it's wasted on Depp's Ed Wood, who only has two facial expressions: brazen self-confidence and perplexed frown. There must be about half a per cent of the movie-going public that is interested in the basement range of bad films produced in the 1950s, and for them this will be de rigueur, but for everyone else, forget it.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of Tim Burton's most enjoyable movies. An absolute hoot!,"'Ed Wood' is easily one of Tim Burton's most enjoyable movies. If you aren't familiar with the work of Ed Wood, specifically 'Glen Or Glenda', 'Bride Of The Monster' and 'Plan 9 From Outer Space', you may not get as much out of this brilliant movie as you should, but that's your problem - educate yourself! Johnny Depp's mannered performances can often become irritating, but this time he fits in perfectly with this stylized fun. In fact it's difficult to think of many other contemporary actors who could pull this off as well as he does. Depp is supported by a well chosen and effective cast, including another spot on bit of casting with Martin Landau as horror legend Bela Lugosi, and fine work from Sarah Jessica Parker, Mike Starr, Bill Murray, Patricia Arquette, and Burton semi-regular Jeffrey Jones. There's also a memorable cameo from Vincent D'Onofrio as Orson Welles in one of the movies stand out scenes. 'Ed Wood' is an absolute hoot, and one of the most entertaining movies of the 1990s. This is essential viewing for cult and horror buffs, and hopefully will encourage others to explore the weird and wonderful world of b-grade (and z-grade!) movies.",,Anonymous,Biography
Compassionate...and bloody good fun,"Director Tim Burton's comedy-drama about 1950s Grade-Z filmmaker Ed Wood is imbued with nostalgic heart and soul. Burton has always shown genuine feeling for outcasts and eccentrics: their passions make them outcasts--and the fact they don't realize it make them eccentrics. The pack of loonies following Edward D. Wood, Jr. around Hollywood aren't sycophants, they're his family. They're also a very funny, colorful bunch. The picture, shot in gloriously flat black-and-white (which matches the times, and mirrors the films of Ed Wood), has an episodic structure but wonderfully smart, canny dialogue from screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, adapting Rudolph Grey's book ""Nightmare of Ecstasy"". We clearly see what draws people to Ed Wood: he was a used car-salesman for the movies. Johnny Depp is excellent in the lead, most especially in his scenes with an unrecognizable Martin Landau in an Oscar-winning turn as a drug-addicted Bela Lugosi. When Ed is told Lugosi's health insurance has expired and he must leave the hospital, it's an extremely poignant moment that touches on a lot more than just a hack moviemaker struggling to keep his main ""star"" going. Burton is very effective at introducing us to a whole troupe of people we might normally recoil from, and he's sympathetic enough not to poke fun at anybody. There are weaknesses: some details are skimmed over and some sequences fail to take off. We see an awful lot on the making of ""Bride of the Atom"", but its raucous premiere is too easy a way to explain the public's reaction (was it given a general release? was Ed Wood able to make any money from it?). The large, perfectly-assembled cast seems right at home in these surroundings; if the performances are a little over-the-top, that's all right because Burton's perception of Ed Wood may be the same as ours: the man made silly movies, and he was a cross-dresser, but he was extremely passionate about both! Burton isn't afraid to get giddy over Ed's notoriously awful cinematic output. His film is a winner! ***1/2 from ****",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A film experience unlike any other, which makes it the ultimate nod towards Ed Wood and his films...","Edward D. Wood, Jr. is the man responsible for such films as ""Glen or Glenda,"" ""Bride of the Monster,"" and ""Plan 9 From Outer Space,"" to name a few of the films mentioned in ""Ed Wood"" (1994), Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's nod towards the man and his films, which garnered him the official title of the ""Worst Director of All Time.""Ed Wood was in love with every frame of every film he made, or so this film tells us. He's oblivious to any technical blunders--when his film ""Plan 9"" is being directed, a Baptist preacher mentions that one of the tombstones fell over during the shoot in a fake graveyard, and that the characters on screen arrived at day but now it's night. ""Ever heard of suspension of disbelief?"" Ed asks. He stresses that he's a director and he knows what's best.In one of the more ironic scenes of the movie, he meets his role model, Orson Welles (Vincent D'Onofrio), in a restaurant. Welles complains about his struggles in filmmaking, and Ed tells him how he relates--of course, Welles has no idea that Ed is a Z-movie director. On some strange level, they are briefly similar. Only in their struggles, however. Welles tells Ed to not give up, to take charge of his picture. It renews Ed's feelings towards his ""Plan 9"" project. He marches back to the set, shouting orders at crewmembers. It's reminiscent of the scenes in all movies where the characters are inspired and suddenly win the day. The sad--and utterly ironic--thing is, as the audience, we know no matter how inspired Ed feels his film is going to bomb. His effort is pointless.The movie starts with Ed (Depp) and his girlfriend, Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker), trying to get a movie made in Hollywood. Ed likes women's clothing. A lot. Dolores can't figure out where her angora sweaters keep getting to. Ed loves women--he says by dressing in their clothes it makes him feel closer to them. Err...yeah, right.Ed struggles to get a film made in Hollywood. He meets Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau) in a coffin shop and they become close friends; this helps Ed's position in Hollywood, too. The unfortunate problem, however, is that Lugosi is a washed-up druggie living by himself in a messy home. He's a wreck. Nobody wants him in a picture.Nothing stops Ed. He finally gets his big break when a movie producer who is unashamed to admit that he makes `crap' funds Ed's first full-length feature film, `Glen or Glenda."" It's an uncredited parallel of Ed's own life--a tale about a transvestite who is afraid to come out of the closet.The fact that Ed Wood has absolutely no directorial talent is established early on when he is rummaging through old stock footage of charging buffalo and octopus. ""Why if I had half a chance, I could make an entire movie using this stock footage. The story opens on these mysterious explosions. Nobody knows what's causing them, but it's upsetting all the buffalo. So, the military are called in to solve the mystery."" Sad.Ed does, indeed, use the footage of buffalo in the beginning of ""Glen or Glenda,"" for no apparent reason whatsoever. It just appears via a dissolve. Ed is practically thrown out of Hollywood--but yet he makes another film, this time ""Bride of the Atom,"" the title changed to ""Bride of the Monster"" before it is released to the public. It flops, needless to say.Wood remains the optimist. He cons a Baptist church into funding his newest feature, ""Plan 9 From Outerspace,"" which is often heralded as the pinnacle of really bad movies, along with ""'Manos': The Hands of Fate"" and ""Pod People."" He's a self-assured liar and a thief--he swears to the church that they'll get enough profit from his movie that they'll be able to make as many religious films about apostles as they want. Perhaps, in the end, he wasn't lying after all.Behind the laughs is a great piece of work. Filmed in a distinctly wacky black and white, and filmed with the same purposeful akwardness of an old Ed Wood movie, Tim Burton has done the unimaginable--he's managed to make a two hour + film about the life of the worst director of all time, and he's also managed to make it quite interesting.""Ed Wood"" is bizarre, delightful and strange. It's from another world. It's a unique film experience unlike any other. It's got the odd eccentricity of ""Edward Scissorhands"" and the joyful glee of ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure,"" while keeping the gothic look of ""Batman."" All in all, it's a nice little trip.And ""Ed Wood"" is packed with movie in-jokes. We, as an audience, know the future of Ed Wood's fate--which is why much of it is funny. There's also a great scene during that in which he meets Welles. Ed says, ""Do you know my movies have even been recut after they were finished?"" Welles replies, ""I hate it when that happens."" And that pretty much sums up the film's sense of humor.4.5/5 stars.John Ulmer",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A excellent film,"Tim Burton once again captured my heart! This movie is fantastic! The acting is absolutely fantastic! Martin Landau is incredible as Bela Lugosi and Johnny Depp is great as Edward D.

This was the first R-rated movie that I ever saw in the theater.,"And I'm proud that this was the one that I saw. This story of B-movie director Edward D. Wood, Jr. (the brains behind such camp as ""Glen or Glenda"" and ""Plan 9 from Outer Space""), was probably Tim Burton's best movie ever. In the title role, Johnny Depp makes you fall in love with Ed Wood, regardless of how you view transvestitism. What the movie shows is that even though Ed Wood and his cohorts had no talent, they all stuck by each other. Specifically, Wood gave the washed-up - and rather bitter - Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau) a job. If anything, I think that ""Ed Wood"" deserved a lot more recognition. At least Landau won an Oscar. Right after I saw this movie, I went out and rented ""Glen or Glenda"" and ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". They were lovably moronic.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A good film that should have great,"Ed Wood should have hit a home run but it didn't. It should have been so much better but it wasn't. That's not to say that ED Wood is a poor film, far from it but with a little better casting, it would have been near perfect. As it stands, the performances (and I use the term loosely) of Johnny Depp and Sarah Jessica Parker nearly ruin all that the film achieves. But let's look at the good. It was a very, very long time ago that someone who won an Oscar truly deserved it. Martin Landau deserved his Oscar for his incredible turn as Bela Lugosi. He was simply not playing a role in a film, he ""was"" Bela Lugosi. There are times that the makeup, cinematography and Landau's performance make you forget that that you are seeing Martin Landau. You are seeing him literally become the late horror star. Its one of the most remarkable feats in recent cinema history and truly deserving of the praise. It's an understatement to say Landau steals the film, he literally picks it up and carries it away with him. There is another stellar performance in the film, that of Patricia Arquete as Kathy. It's a warm, understated performance that was as deserving of an Oscar nomination as Landau's. Bill Murray is an always welcome presence and the casting of Jeffrey Jones as Criswell is pure brilliance. Those two always give their best no matter what film they appear in. Director Burton deserves much credit for his brave stance of filming the picture in Black and White, it simply would not have worked in color. Regretably, this descision is probably what killed the film at the box office but Burton truly showed he knew what he was doing. This is a movie that begged to shot that way and Burton delivered. Burton must also be given a major thumbs up for packing the movie with Ed Wood's real life hangers on in cameo roles as well as casting wrestling promoter Gene LaBell and exotic pianist Korla Pandit in small but noticeable parts. And lets' face it, who else could have played Tor Johnson but George Steele?All in all the film would rank a solid 10 if it wasn't for the participation of Depp and Parker. Why is Tim Burton so enamored with this Johnny Depp? He has proven time and time again that he simply cannot act and in Ed Wood, he cannot act with a vengeance. Watch for his scenes near the end, instead of projecting wide eyed wonder as was called for, he projects the image of a madman about to go on a killing spree. A truly poor performance that almost ruins the film. Nearly as bad is Sarah Jessica Parker. Some see her as a very talented actress. I see her as a scenery chewing hack who is a major eye sore. And we can't forget that Burton's girlfriend Lisa Marie plays Vampira. A note to perspective and veteran directors, do not, under any circumstance cast your girlfriends in your movies. Marie is laughably bad. Martin Landau's fetching daughter, Juliet (who plays Loretta King) would have been a far more inspired choice for the role.Make no mistake, Ed Wood is a good film but with some better casting in two of it's major roles, it could have been so much better. Still if you are a fan of the cross dressing director, you need to see this film. It certainly wasn't deserving of it's poor box office run Johnny Depp or not.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The one and only Time Machine,"There has been an Ed Wood DVD box on the French market for a few months now, including Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space. Why are these films considered as the worst ever made in Hollywood (or elsewhere) is beyond my understanding. They are very awkward ; the acting is stiff and mostly unprofessional ; and still they do convey Â— especially Glen or Glenda and Plan 9 Â— an eerie feeling of metaphysical dereliction Â— the dreadfully lonely scene with the old widower in Plan 9 is outstanding in an odd way.*** Spoilers*** I bought the box, and a few days ago I landed up with Tim Burton's Ed Wood. Ed Wood is an outstanding film, showing, of course, none of the awkwardness of Ed Wood's own creations. The cast is wonderful (Depp, Landau, Lisa Marie, Jeffrey Jones especially), the direction is so precise and subtle it lets you savor the taste of good bad cinema without a single sneer ; the music is grand (Theremin be thanked !). And there is more to it Â— a perfect reflection of the sad, bleached light that irradiates Ed Wood's own films, (if nothing else could). The scene of the old widower now gets a poignant explanation Â— Depp-Wood stages it without even having a film in his mind, just to reassure poor old dying Landau-Lugosi. Well, he might well have less altruistic motives, but what do we care ? Wood records the frail gait, the trembling hand, the white light reverberating on the shabby suburban home. That is the sequence that shimmers with such melancholy in Ed Wood's real own Plan 9. No wonder : death looms large. I love the fact that Burton includes this very same sequence in Ed Wood, with an ecstatic Depp lip-sync-hing the scene Â— who mirrors who now ? Isn't Ed Wood, the man, a Burton creation, after all ; or isn't Ed Wood the film time-teleported directly from the fifties to your screen ? Who knows ? It takes the slightly too familiar faces of Bill Murray and Sarah Jessica Parker to steal you from this ravishing time wrap (Landau's and Depp's should be as familiar : but they're far greater actors, aren't they ?). Alas, you are not lost in the black and white land of your wildest dreams and there's a way back home.*** An other spoiler, and a puzzle*** A word about Orson Welles' uncanny apparition. The smooth-skinned, handsome Welles you see here is a thing of wonder Â— so like Kane's Welles that the mind boggles ; but then : how can he be filming Touch of Evil ? And that, my friends, is one of Ed Wood's (the film, the man) greatest and most devastatingly naive ideas.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Overrated,"I can't believe the reviews I'm reading on here.  I'm seeing this film called ""brilliant"" and ""touching"" but personally, the best adjective I could use for it is ""decent"".  Like the recent Bowfinger, another movie about filming bad movies, this one gets so redundant you feel like you're getting hit over the head many times.  You keep on seeing the same scenes over and over and over again, and they lose their magic.And enough about Martin Landau!  If you read these reviews you would think he gave the best performance of the century.  He certainly did a great job, but please, how hard is it to imitate Bela Lugosi's accent and make a character you feel sympathy for?  That's pretty much all he did, but he did do it extraordinarily well, so I don't really object to his winning the Oscar.  Plus you can never forget the reason he made you think he was the real Bela Lugosi was the makeup..  As far as the other performances go, I thought they were all great.  Surprising coming from a review that has been so negative so far but I must give credit where credit is due.Another thing I liked about this movie was the cinematography.  Filming it in black-and-white was a great idea, and the film probably could have never worked without it.  It's got a nice little unique look going for it.I think the main reason I didn't like this film was the directing.  The aforementioned redundancy was a big problem, and I felt like this film could have easily been 30 minutes shorter.  Also, the film is presented in a manner that makes it get boring after awhile.  I think it could have been a lot funnier and more informative if they showed WHY the movies were so bad. You never really got to see that, except when it was blatantly(and quite humorously) showed in the octopus scene, which elicited a laugh from me. This film has a bit of an identity crisis.  It's not sure if it wants to be sympathetic to Wood, showing us the stupidity of his movies, letting us know what his friends were like, showing us how he actually got these movies made...it juggles through all and never really decides on one thing to focus on, making the film get muddled.So I give this movie a 5/10 because it disappointed me.  It could have been a lot better if it had another director, in my opinion.  The editing wasn't very good either.  Even though the script was redundant, there are a multitude of hilarious lines in it.  That's a wrap!",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

After watching this flick I find it hard to imagine any other movie director who is more deserving of such a fitting title as this. Ed Wood is almost in a class of his own.Ed Wood was the guy who, literally, made 'Z-Grade Movie History'. Now, there's certainly a claim that not many movie-directors could (or would) boast about on their resumes. But you can bet that Ed Wood most surely would.Had Ed Wood not been such a resourceful con-man he would've probably never achieved such an impressive niche in the world of lame movies.With such classic, but inept, offerings as Plan 9 From Outer Space it's obvious that Wood's resourcefulness as a con-man was only succeeded by his incompetence as a film director.Of course, without the eccentric directorial touches of Tim Burton, Ed Wood would never have been the unique gem that it is. The use of glossy, black and white film, rather than colour, gave Ed Wood the true feel of the 1950's.Ed Wood is Burton's loving tribute to a long-gone director who's time has come for some much-deserved recognition as the worst of them all.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Landau is OK as Bela Lugosi, but it's hardly a performance worthy of an Oscar. Burton operates under the premise that watching an idiot at work is so entertaining that no real plot is necessary.

Ed, being a closet transvestite, decided to do a movie about Jorgenso and secretly about himself. Going from studio to studio all Ed got was the run around and door slammed, or laugh at, in his face. It wasn't until he ran into washed up movie horror king Bela Lugosi ,Martin Laundau, fitting himself for a coffin at a L.A funeral home that things started to turn around for the young and hungry director.The movie ""Ed Wood"" centers around the friendship that was developed by Ed Wood and, at the time, the highly morphine addicted Bela Lugosi. Bela who hadn't made a movie in four years was now on his last legs and it was Ed who gave him the chance to revived his career which he did in three unforgettable films that Wood directed: 1.""Glen or Glenda"" 2. ""Bride of the Monster"" and 3. In a cameo role in what many people consider to be Wood's ""Citizan Kane"" the film that they broke the mold after he made it ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"".Were also introduced in ""Ed Wood"" to Ed's two wives Doloros Fuller, Sarah Jessica Parker, who left Ed when he gave her a supporting, not leading, role in his classic ""Bride of the Monster"" and also Kathy O'Hara, Patricia Arquette, who met Ed when he was at the hospital having his friend Bela dry out and kick his drug habit. Kathy turned out to be Ed's real and true love of his life who, unlike Dolores, stood by him through thick and thin and never left his side up until he suddenly collapsed and died from a heart-attack on the evening of December 10, 1978.Having his first big success with ""Glen and Glenda"" in 1953 Ed set out to do films that would give his friend Bela Lugosi, who was the puppet master in that film, something to really stick his teeth into and came up with ""Bride of the Monster"" in 1954. Getting together a number of aspiring actors and actresses, like Tony McCoy Loretta King & 400 pound ex professional wrestler Tor Johnson, to play in the movie it took almost a year until Ed could get the money to finally finish the project.""Bride of the Monster"" was not the smashing success, financially not artistically, that Ed hoped it would be but watching it now, like those who were lucky or brave enough to see it back then in 1955,it really stood the test of time after all these years. Seeing the great Bela Lugosi in what turned out to be his last speaking role and very possibly the signature performance of his career, as the insane and at the same time sympathetic Dr. Eric Vornoff, that's filled with so much tension electricity and passion that it completely blows away anyone who watches it. Bela delivering his unforgettable ""I Have'a no Home"" speech to his bitter rival in the movie Professor Strowski has to be seen, and heard, to be believed. Not to take anything away from actor Martin Landau, who received a Academy Award for his part as Bela Lugosi, you have to see Bela himself deliver he lines in the movie ""Bride of the Monster"" to really appreciate what a great actor he really was and, with Ed Wood's writing and directing, again became in the twilight of his magnificent film career. Even Marlon Brando at his absolute best couldn't come close to duplicate Bela's unbelievable performance in that movie!With no worlds left to conquer after classics like ""Bride of the Monster"" ""jailbate"" "" The Violent Years"" and ""Glen or Glenda"" already in the can Ed went out to make the movie that he would forever be identified with ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". Sadly enough he wouldn't have Bela Lugosi, who died just as the filming began, to star in it.Touching funny as well as heart-breaking story of the Great Ed Wood Jr who had to die, after being laughed snickered and scorned at while he was still alive, to be recognized and become the film and movie genius that he is today. The movie wisely ends just as Ed has his greatest success at the opening of his forgotten, and now rediscovered, anti-war and anti-nuclear testing sci-fi classic ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"".It was fitting to end the movie ""Ed Wood"" before we saw him, and his great talents, go downhill leaving him a broken and forgotten man who was left to sneaking out of one apartment and into another to prevent himself from being thrown out for not paying his rent. It's even sadder that Ed Wood didn't live long enough to get the appreciation that he so rightfully deserved to get from the movie going public. If there is a life beyond death I can see Ed there now looking down and basking in the love and critical acclaim, from both the public and critics, that he's getting now in death that eluded him all those years in Hollywood where he slaved and grabbed to get his movies made and distributed while he was still alive.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A fun and tender biopic of 'Hollywood's Worst Director',"This film tells the story of Edward D. Wood Jr; the man often described as the maker of the worst film in history. What Ed lacks in film making ability he makes up for with enthusiasm. When he can persuade anybody to let him make a film he works fast; never worrying about more than one take and shooting numerous scenes each day. As well as seeing his film making and attempts to get funding, we see insights into his relationships with two woman and his professional relationship with fading horror star Bela Lugosi.This film could easily have been very mocking of Wood but director Tim Burton treats him with respect. Wood might not have been a good film maker but he strived to be and thought he was. He was also a transvestite in an era that such behaviour was considered a perversion but even this is shown in a matter of fact way leaving those who don't approve, excluding the girlfriend whose clothes he borrowed, looking more laughable than him. There is also a tenderness about his friendship with Lugosi. The cast does a fine job; most notably Johnny Depp who is on great form as Wood and Martin Landau who picked up an Oscar for his performance as Lugosi. Burton's decision to film in black & white works as it fits in with the films Wood was making. Overall I'd say this is a must see for fans of Burton and Depp... it even left me wanting to watch 'worst film ever' 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' again!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ghoulishly funny...Depp and Landau are superb...,"Absolutely brilliant film on the bizarre and quirky cross-dressing filmmaker Ed Wood, played with boyish enthusiasm by JOHNNY DEPP in one of his most offbeat roles. He's the anchor who grounds the film in all its believable foolishness.Equally skillful are all the surrounding performances, including MARTIN LANDAU (who deservedly won a Supporting Role Oscar), BILL MURRAY, who does amazing things with an underwritten role as a man eager to change his gender, JEFFREY JONES as Criswell, the Magician, and VINCENT D'ONOFRIO as Orson Welles.But it's the caring relationship between Depp and Landau that defines the comic genius of the film and gives it heart. Both are extremely moving and adept at showing the respect and regard they had for each other when their world seemed to be falling apart. The story doesn't flinch in showing Lugosi's fall from grace with his addiction to morphine and other drugs that eventually took his life.A near perfect recreation of the '50s Hollywood scene with its low budget studio settings, wisely photographed in the B&W manner of most of the Lugosi thrillers. Entertaining and genuinely funny, moving and absorbing all the way through.Summing up: One of Tim Burton's best directing jobs. Highest recommendation.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
endearing celebration of Ed Wood,"Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) is an outwardly optimistic terrible stage director. His girlfriend Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker) is clueless to his cross-dressing. He is constantly trying to push his way into filmmaking with his band of misfits. He befriends legendary Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau) who hasn't worked in 4 years. Schlock producer George Weiss allows Ed to write and direct sex change movie ""Glen or Glenda"" with Lugosi.Tim Burton and Johnny Depp captures the unquenchable thirst to materialize one's dreams. This is some fun and a lot of joy of creation. They never make Wood into a joke. Rather he's celebrated for his unceasing drive. This is a great character study. Landau is just terrific.

Tim Burton's Most Personal Film,"""Ed Wood"" is a film, shot entirely in black and white, about the infamous film director who is frequently credited as being the worst director ever. Of course the film is quirky and funny, but also very serious and dramatic in some areas.  The film takes place in the 1950s when Wood is trying to make his name in Hollywood by comparing himself to Orson Welles (both being writers-producers-directors).  The fact that they have the same career is about the only real similarity.  Wood is trying to make it big and enlists the help of the aged, washed-up Bela Lugosi (played to the paramount by Oscar-winning Martin Landau).  In spite of the failures Lugosi stays behind Wood and they develop a very close friendship.  Wood's strangeness is depicted in the fact that he rarely takes more than one take on a scene, regardless of what happens during that scene.  He is also odd because he likes to dress in women's clothes.  In a funny yet sad scene near the end Wood declares that ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" will be the film that he is remembered for.  He is right.  However, it is an awful film from a man who may have been too ambitious to make it in Hollywood.  In many respects, ""Ed Wood"" is a modern day masterpiece, a poor man's ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Raging Bull"".  All deal with men who want to be great but always seem to miss the mark somehow.  Tim Burton's direction is gloomy and you can see how much he feels for this man who never accomplished his goals in the cinema.  The screenplay is sharp and Johnny Depp is unforgettable in the title role.  The supporting cast is also a real joy to behold.  Patricia Arquette, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jeffrey Jones, and Bill Murray all add great elements of comedy and drama to this fine motion picture.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Biography
A good movie about bad movies,"This is definitely a good movie about bad movies. I had seen every Tim Burton film except this and his remake of ""Planet of the Apes"" so, due to my interest in old movies and in Johnny Depp, I thought I would finally sit down and watch it. And I'm glad I did. Edward D. Wood Jr. was a bizarre filmmaker who movies are legendary for being awful. But he doesn't know. He is happy and optimistic about every penny he can get and every person he can meet. He is especially excited when he sees the no longer acting, Bela Lugosi, played by Martin Landau, winning him an Academy Award. The movie was shot entirely in black and white, primarily because no one knew how Bela Lugosi would look in color. And it looks incredible. From the promising start with the graves and the lighting, it really feels like an old horror movie. Now, the movie as a whole was good but it there are some questionable aspects of it such as the language, which was unnecessary, and the way Ed's crew disrespected the Baptist church. Other than those and a few other things, the film was a lot of fun to watch and was interesting to see an important piece of Hollywood history. Now, I''m gonna go watch some of Ed Wood's bad movies!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Eternal Optimism,"I just never got around to seeing this. It was worth the wait. Ed Wood was one of the most optimistic beings ever to set foot on this earth. He had a love for life and a spirit that, unfortunately, greatly outpaced his talent. One thing to remember is that money always influences art. Some of the shortcomings of his films had to do with extra takes costing money. Film has never been cheap. But this need to be efficient and timely, also led us to some of the most memorable (though bad) footage in film history. The fact is that he ""did"" get the films made. He did have a family of actors that stood by him. He did eventually find someone to accept his being a transvestite. I don't think ""worst director ever"" is quite fair because those guys never got a film made, let alone any for major release.Then there is his relationship with the morphine riddled Bela Lugosi who becomes dependent on him. Wood gave graciously, looked out for the sad old man, and brought him ""back to life."" Martin Landau's performance is outstanding as the classic horror star, living with regrets and what ifs.Tim Burton pulls this off beautifully, giving his film the cheap appearance of Wood's films. Depp is charming as the ever positive Wood, always making lemonade when life threw him a new lemon. Excellent film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A one-note and one-joke disappointment,"Terrific performances by the entire cast cannot hide the fact that this highly stylized movie has remarkably little to say. Once it makes its one joke about Ed Wood's incredible abilities to make bad movies and dress in women's clothes, it keeps re-hammering the same points with a sledgehammer as if heavy-handed repetition would make them funnier. It doesn't work for me.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"'I got no sleep, and I feel great!'","After having completed post-production on a documentary Tim directed interviewing Vincent Price on the set of Edward Scissorhands (I've tried so hard to find it; it's a lost document) he began production on a biopic of Edward D. Wood Jr., most fondly remembered as being at the helm of sci-fi cult b-movie classic Plan 9 From Outer Space (1959) and getting a reputation for being the 'worst filmmaker of all time'. It mainly focuses on the making of Ed's debut feature Glen Or Glenda (1953), Bride Of The Monster (1955), his friendship with legendary horror star Bela Lugosi and most entertainingly, his strong passion for filmmaking that wouldn't be diminished no matter what came his way. It was the perfect continuation of Depp and Burton's strong partnership, confirming them as one of the best double acts in cinema today. Martin Landau garnered much attention for his role as Lugosi and for very good reason; he is REALLY good! He captures the physical presence very well but also provides the melancholic backbone of the story along with Ed's desire to become a master. It features cool supporting performances from Sarah Jessica Parker and Bill Murray; also Patricia Arquette as Kathy who is great and accompanies Ed in his eternal optimism, the best and most inspiring quality of the story I think! It also marks Tim's first collaboration with Lisa Marie (here playing the sexy Vampira) and so began their relationship for 9 years! She was the inspiration for a lot of his artwork during this period including the look for Sally in The Nightmare Before Christmas. There are laugh out loud funny moments (my favourite when matey tries to get through a set door, completely missing it and scaring the hell out of Bela and the crew surrounding) and re-enactments of some 'so bad it's good' acting in Wood's films that is a real talent in itself for the cast here to make work. Ed Wood fittingly continues his legacy through a wonderful script by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski and dedicated performances",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"'Cut, perfect!'","'Ed Wood' is definitely Burtons most personal, and perhaps best film. A labour of love for him, as a huge fan of the real Ed Wood, Burton set out to make a film that acted as many things at once; a biopic, a romance (not in the most likely fashion and in more than one way), a comedy and a drama. He succeeded on all counts.'Ed Wood' tells the story of the man who was voted officially to be the 'worst director of all time'. Johnny Depp gives a career defining, painstakingly accurate and sympathetic performance in the title role, taking the audience with him as he goes from one film to another. Starting with 'Glenn or Glenda?' (Wood's first film), followed by horror 'Bride of the Atom', then through to the fantastically inept, most famous 'bad movie' ever; 'Plan 9 From Outer Space'. All the way through remaining enthusiastically optimistic, upbeat, and indefatigable.The film is technically efficient also, though the by far the best and most memorable aspect of the film is the performances. Depp's may be excellent, but it is the Oscar winning Martin Landau as the now down and out former horror star Bela Lugosi who steals the show; presenting a complex, yet accessible character study. Landau conveys both spirited humour and tragic regret perfectly. His friendship with Depp's Wood is both touching and also often depressingly dependant. Wood's documented transvestism is handled in a way that stops it being in the least bit odd or unusual, and simply deepens your relationship and sympathy for Wood, already an endearing character.The photography is superior also, and the choice to film in black and white was both commendable and extremely brave in relation to expected audience response. To question whether or not it would have been any different if in colour is both unnecessary and missing the point entirely.'Artistic license' is often used in films such as this to a great degree. 'Ed Wood', however, stays very faithful to the facts, altering only minor details, yet in doing so also forms a much better rounded and amiable story.Filled with many memorable scenes, not least of which being Wood's incidental meeting with Orson Welles in a bar (a brief but astonishingly accurate portrayal by Vincent D'Onofrio), a first class screenplay, and performances to which may be the standout's of both Depp and Landau's career.Ed Wood is perhaps the perfect example of a biopic, as well as a very accomplished drama/comedy/romance. If you have never seen it, see it now.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
To love and not be loved,"Edward D. Wood Jr., arguably the worst director of all time, was an optimistic man--he never filmed a shot he didn't like and that is something no other filmmaker can say. His will was nearly unbreakable, recovering from anything. His only perpetual shadow tormenting him was that, in the back of his head, he knew he is not made for movies.The lack of reciprocity of the love he gave to the art-form is something which director Tim Burton hasn't focused on too much, but it was still felt even among the amount of inevitable comedy that came from his struggles to do whatever it takes to get a movie underway. Johnny Depp gave an Oscar-worthy performance as a misunderstood and strangely flamboyant man--Ed Wood liking to dress in women's clothing, but he was straight. His artistic vision was pure and innocent like a child--you can see it in Depp's performance every time Wood lets his imagination run rampant. Indeed, Wood was a very childish person, but not in the bad, immature way. The movie world fascinated him, he would express his innocence and child simplicity with every piece of work he puts out, the atrocious reviews representing his coming of age. Yet while Hollywood encourages childish and over-ambitious, unrealistic dreaming, it also requires a man's touch to transfer those dreams to the big screen. Ed Wood lacked this transition.Wood went to great deals to execute the movies in his head. To look at the ridiculous lengths and compromises he did to ensure he can work is a thing of fascination. Looking at his career path, which involves getting finance from ridiculous places like a butchery or even a church makes it hard to believe that it was true--and voluptuously funny. More amazing is his circle of co-workers. It starts off pretty standard with his girlfriend, Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker), his second girlfriend after splitting up with Dolores, Kathy O'Hara (Patricia Arquette)--then it gets more interesting as he is joined by Vampira (Lisa Marie), a former talk-show host with a shtick for horror, The Amazing Criswell (Jeffery Jones), a fake psychic TV host, John ""Bunny"" Breckinridge (Bill Murray), Ed's close drag-queen friend, Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson (George ""The Animal"" Steele) and many others. What an unbelievable and awesome circus-like crowd.Yet among them was one more person. Retired horror movies veteran, Bela Lugosi. Ed Wood was fascinated with horror's mystery and mysticism and Bela Lugosi was an idol to him--despite everyone thinking he's dead. Martin Landau's performance of the late actor was a great tribute, Lugosi being a scene-stealer every time he would show up. Tim Burton portrayed his fall into loneliness, old age and Hollywood obsolete-ism better than it did its lead character's own struggles. Being the historical face of Dracula in Hollywood, Landau played Lugosi as a man who always stayed in character one way or another.Of course, Ed Wood had another hero, the great Orson Welles. He would often compare himself to him in wishful thinking and although there was a scene in which the two met at a bar, in reality that never happened. Even if most his dreams remained dreams, after finishing ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and seeing a full crowd at the premier, Wood exulted, perhaps for the first and only time, a sense of accomplishment and self-satisfaction--""this is the one I will be remembered for"".",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""This is the one. This is the one I'll be remembered for.""","A daring and nostalgic journey into one of the most recognized 'bad' filmmakers ever, Ed Wood is a compelling film and story of the iconic director with flair to spare. I have always been a fan of Tim Burton's work, but never have I thought that he was more meant to direct something than this film. Burton makes this film his own, with his black and white visuals, signature style, and usual witty banter. Johnny Depp is marvelous as the titular character, and my personal favorite standout of the stellar cast. He not only captures the directors persona incredibly well, but truly captures the energy and charisma he held at these times. Martin Landau also provides an excellent performance as Bela Lugosi, and is easily one of the most memorable performances you'll take from this experience. The film can be a bit dull at times, and even a bit repetitive, but for the most part, it proves to be an inspiring, daring, and complex biopic that isn't afraid to show the harshest of details. In the end, Ed Wood is not the best biopic, nor is it Burton's best film, but due to Depp's stellar performance and Burton's fantastic direction, this film excels, and prove to be at least one of the best of both of their careers.

How Ironic!,"Two hours and I didn't get up once. Of course, I've laughed along with thousands of others at Wood's totally inept productions, except I'd never gotten around to catching this flick. No doubt this is the best movie Wood's name has ever attached to. Depp's likable never-say-die buoyancy carries the benighted Wood from one fiasco to the next. If sheer drive converted into talent, Wood would replace his idol Orson Welles as cinema's top dog. But then reality is no problem if you just ignore it. I love that near riot scene at the premiere of Bride of the Gorilla. Does that dampen Wood's artistic confidenceâ€”not a whit. In my book, Depp deserved the Oscar, hands down.Speaking of Oscars, Landau too deserved one. His resemblance to the real Lugosi is uncanny. Plus, he manages the touching moments of a has-been monster in really poignant fashion. And get a load of Vampira (Lisa Marie). I wanted to snuggle up and run at the same time.What the movie does in spades is show the fringes of the Hollywood glamor factory, with its many colorful characters. I especially like Wood's run-ins with the tyrannical schlock-meister who insists he only does ""crap"". Sounds like real behind-the-scenes candor. At the same time, the movie doesn't include Wood's seamy battle with alcohol or the rat-traps he was reduced to living in. The narrative's really about his professional career rather than his personal life.Nonetheless, the two-hours remain a highly entertaining look at an amazing personality, who never took ""no"" for an answer. And, oh yes, there's the movie's big ironyâ€”Edward D. Wood Jr. did become famous, after all.",,Anonymous,Biography
Perfection from start to finish.,"What can you say about this movie? It's funny, it's serious, it's sad, it's uplifting, and every mood fits perfectly in every situation. I thought it was really cool to see all of these once celebrities like Bela Lugosi and Vampira portrayed, and portrayed by great actors. There are also many other celebrities of the 50's portrayed. The black and white also makes the film, it allows the audience to appreciate the masterpiece that is this movie, without allowing the audience to get distracted by vibrant colors and focus on other things, the black and white allows the audience to strictly view the picture, and not focus on anything else. Ed Wood is a hidden gem, seeing as not a lot of people know about it, and it was not a blockbuster when it came out. This is by far Tim Burton's best film by far.

His sheer optimism despite his circumstances is endearing and comical.Together with a good cast, the director brings out a believable portrayal of the campy movie director that was once tagged as the Worst Director of All Time. Martin Landau's likeness to Bela Lugosi was laudable. I have to say, the sound on this movie would take you right back to the black and white era of Hollywood.

Plan 9 misfire,"It's not unusual for great artists to have to wait many years after departing this life to achieve fame. But it's less common for such a fate to befall a really inept artist. Wood's enthusiasm far outstripped his abilities as a film-maker but sadly this attempt at telling his story doesn't do Wood the justice he probably doesn't deserve.The root of the problem is in Depp's portrayal of the central character. Wood comes across as a genial, caring optimist who loves movie-making despite his (in)abilities. Nothing wrong with that although there are some moments in the film when Depp almost verges on the Beetlejuice or Scissorhands characters from his earlier outings. But there must have been more to Wood than an eternal optimism. He loved movies - witness his brief conversation with Orson Welles - thus he must have known how excrutiatingly bad his productions were. There was a story to tell as to how Wood reconciled these opposing characteristics. Yet Depp, presumably at his director's command, gives us only a skin-deep portrayal and the opportunity was lost.Martin Landau's impressive performance of Bela Lugosi in his last agonising and desparate months overrides Depp but leaves us asking why the director chose to portray Lugosi with such sympathy and depth but leave his main character only at a surface level.In the end perhaps it doesn't matter too much. Do we really want to know what drove such an inadequate movie professional? Probably not, but if the attempt is made it should be made with some conviction and integrity.

A waste of 2 hours,"When I read the description of this film I thought it would be pretty good, being directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp and Bill Murray, and I admit that there are good parts about it, but I generally found it a bit of a bore. Johnny Depp plays Edward D. Wood Jr - the worst director ever and this movie follows his attempts to make good movies. He's a cross dresser who idolises Orson Welles. Unfortunately I thought that the plot was quite dull and pointless. It's shame because the direction and cinematography are great (it's all shot in black and white) and all the actors give good performances and there is a bit of good humour, but in general I found it a bit pointless and a waste of time watching. The plot wasn't that interesting and I only sat through the whole thing to see if would get ANY better, but it didn't.

One of the great movies of our time based on the life of one of the worst directors of all time.,"Have you heard of a film called ""plan 9 from outer space""? No? Okay, how about ""Bride of the monster""? Fine, what about ""Glen or Glenda"" perhaps? Unless you are some sort of a weirdo cinema fan who spends all his time watching every single movie under the sun, the chances are you have never heard of any of those movies. If you do know about any of them, I tip my imaginary hat to your awesomeness.All of the above movies have two things in common. They are terrible. So terrible that every year hipsters around the world gather to watch and pay tribute to them. And they were made by a guy named Ed Wood. You have never heard of him either. Ed Wood has the dishonor of being considered the worst director of all time. Why would anyone make a movie about him? I asked myself the same question until I watched Ed Wood. Johnny Depp gives a heartfelt and hilarious performance as wide eyed talent-less but passionate and endlessly optimistic young man who believes in himself and harbors great hopes of one day making it as big as his idol Orson Wells. Sarah Jessica Parker plays Dolores Fuller his long suffering girlfriend and star of most of his movies and Martin landau as the washed up drug addict real life actor Bella Lugosi, a roll which deservedly won him a best supporting actor Oscar.Other supporting cast includes the always wonderful Bill Murray, Patricia Arquette and Jeffery jones as his band of misfit cast and crew. The film follows the adventures of the titular character and his weird set of friends as the stumbles across Hollywood struggling to make some of his most famous movies. Tim Burton is the perfect choice of director for this movie. His own fascination with freaks and outsiders works wonderfully well here. Shot in black and white, the set designs are perfect. The movie looks and feels like a Hollywood B movie from the 50's. Every frame is lovingly crafted. Burtons love and fascination with his subject is shines through every frame of the movie. It feels like watching a really good Ed Wood movie. Genuinely hilarious at times, Ed wood is a very unhollywood film. It goes against the idea of try and try until you succeed. Perhaps that is why it has remained under the radar of general audience for so long. Tim Burton has made one of the great movies of our time based on the life of one of the worst directors of all time. That is pretty ironic.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ed Wood,"Tim Burton was two strikes deep on my cinematic experience with him. After seeing, and not caring for, Edward Scissorhands and Sweeney Todd, I was ready to give Burton one last chance before writing him off, completely. Good thing I used Ed Wood for his third strike. An engrossing, thoroughly engaging biopic, Ed Wood tells the story of the famously horrible, yet passionate, film director, Edward D. Wood Jr. Edward D. Wood Jr. has famously been named the worst director of all time, responsible for such films as Plan 9 From Outer Space. Somehow, Burton took a genre, known for its tedious approach and formulaic output, and made an interesting film about a largely unexplored figure. Ed Wood, made in 1994 stars Johnny Depp, as most Tim Burton films do, as well as Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette. Burton and Depp put in career best output in a film that was clearly close to Burton's heart.Edward D. Wood Jr (Johnny Depp) is a Hollywood eccentric who enjoys wearing women's clothing and has even admitted to wearing women's undergarments under his uniform when he served in the military. Ed has a passion for 'telling stories"" and wants to follow in the massive footsteps of his idol, Orson Welles. Through extreme passion, Wood is able to carve a place for himself in Hollywood, backed by a loyal crew and accompanied by a star who has dimmed, Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau). The problem with the story-telling of Ed Wood, is that his dreams are too great for what can reasonably be placed on celluloid, especially given the small budget Wood had to work with. Despite ever gaining any commercial or critical success, Wood held tight to his dream, creating film after film that few audiences ever saw. His personal relationships were important to Wood, always remaining loyal to his friends and loved ones, despite their troubles, as his friends and loved ones remained loyal to him. An interesting life, worthy of delving into for film fans, Ed Wood is a good vehicle with which to begin the journey into Ed Wood Jr.I love black and white films, I instantly enjoy a film more when I see that it is in black and white. When a film is in black and white that doesn't have to be, I appreciate it all the more. It only makes sense for Ed Wood to be shot in black and white, covering a man who began his work in filmmaking career in the 1950's, but the fact that Burton was able to pull it off in 1994, speaks volumes to his commitment to the project. Burton also used fantastic classic cinema film techniques with the great iris in/pit shots. Burton clearly wanted to make a film that was as period-accurate as he could, and I appreciate his adherence to classic cinema. Burton also used low angle shots to an effective degree, much as he did in Edward Scissorhands, which are always nice to see. After seeing four Johnny Depp films this month, I am nearly certain that I don't care for him as an actor, but he was at a career-best in this film. Burton was also at the top of his game, possibly due to his passion for the project, giving audiences an engaging look into an ignored director largely lost like the films in his career.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Motivatingly Good,"""Ed Wood"" (1994) is a comedic drama biography about Edward D. Wood and his dream and dedication of becoming a famous director. Ed, played by Johnny Depp, is ambitious, charming, lacking talent in his execution and possesses a quirk that threatens to ruin his relationship. This film is visually sound and fitting in black and white with a few quirks, though I do wonder how it would affect an audience in color. I enjoy an underdog storyline and this film delivered on several fronts. Most specifically the front of a person with a dream in an industry that I wish to see myself one day. I can't say that I was blown away by the film, especially with a two plus hour runtime, but I found it very satisfying.
 
 This film is full of name actors and I truly commend Tim Burton for pulling all their performances together so well. The direction he provided allowed me to forget that I was watching a biography and instead enjoy a story about a man and his journey. It may have been because of these name actors that I felt the acting was superb all the way through. However, I feel the film was a little long and it is difficult to determine where some of the fat could have been trimmed. Overall, I believe this film to be really good even though it is not my ""cup of tea."" I recommend this film to anyone who aspires to make it in Hollywood, especially as a director or producer.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Interesting film about the Worst Director,"This film is about Ed D Wood Jr, a film director that was voted to be the worst director of all time.I find the film quite entertaining. Despite Ed having no idea how to make a movie, he uses his remarkable eloquence to persuade others to finance and star in his movies. He is clever and talented in this aspect. I am also impressed by his endless enthusiasm. Despite his repeated spectacular failures, he is unrelenting and make movie after another.I am impressed by Johnny Depp's portrayal as Ed Wood. He is lively, enthusiastic and convincingly human. This film is interesting, fun and successfully recreates the ""Worst Director"" of all time.",,Anonymous,Biography
"""It's all about razzle-dazzle""","The mighty epics and incisive dramas of the 1950s should be well-known to anyone with a cursory interest in classic cinema, but now less familiar are the numerous B-movies that formed a teaming if slightly seedy underbelly to Hollywood's grandiosity. The movies may have been cheap and shoddy affairs, but that doesn't mean there weren't behind-the-scenes stories that were just as fascinating as the juiciest tidbits of A-list gossip. Here we see a celebration of one of the B-flick's unsung heroes, the great Edward D. Wood Junior.The project was given, very appropriately, to that champion of B-movie chic Tim Burton. As a film director, Tim Burton is far from the best, but he had a certain kind of genius that could shine through in the right project. For Ed Wood, he seeks very much to immerse us in the eponymous filmmaker's world. When, for example, Dolores notes that her sweaters are always stretched and Eddie turns over with a guilty look, we are suddenly sharing that private space between him and the camera. Many scenes are shot from a low angle, such as when Wood first meets Lugosi, which reduces the image to the actors' heads, the sky and the odd signpost. It creates a very surreal image, with very little to tie it into the real world. Nothing normal is allowed to steal into the frame. Burton also stages a lot of the scenes with a certain sense of occasion, as in Lugosi's final speech or Wood's entrance in women's clothing â€“ these events are given an air of grand theatricality. This is Wood's world â€“ only seeing the glamour.Actors don't often get the chance to ham it up in modern cinema, but even though Ed Wood is about real historical personages, these individuals â€“ Bela Lugosi, Criswell, Bunny Breckinridge and of course Mr Wood himself â€“ were hugely flamboyant figures, and besides, the world in which Ed Wood takes place is somewhat hyper-real. Johnny Depp demonstrates his magnificent ability to walk the line between drama and comedy, giving the title character a boyish charm that makes us forget how atypical he is for a lead. Martin Landau plays Bela Lugosi as a ham who hammed even when he wasn't in front of the camera, showing the old horror legend as larger-than-life but also painstakingly human. Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones play similarly oddball characters, and just have fun with the opportunity to chew up the scenery and still remain faithful to the actual people they are portraying.In Ed Wood Burton, along with writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski make Wood's movies look better than they actually were. And Landau makes Lugosi seem like a better actor than he really was (at least, as he was at that forlorn stage in his career). While little that appears here is outright fabrication, the facts have been dressed up, exaggerated, just as Wood might have done himself. And this is all fair enough in the spirit of the thing. After all, Ed Wood doesn't seem to be a document of how things actually were, but of how we should like to remember them.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
He was the man.,"ItÂ´s fantastic to get involved into a world where the only thing that matters is cinema. Ed Wood, the man, made his big contribution to the movies, not with his work, but with his amazing and true passion. Ed Wood, the movie, is a portrait of a man who fought for his dreams, no matter how hard they were.Well, all thatÂ´s left for me is to thank both of them: Ed Wood, for what he did for the movies, and Tim Burton, for the movie he did.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fairly good,"Not a bad film. It probably over emphasised the point slightly by the end, but was still enjoyable. It was an interesting film without ever being fascinating or at all exciting, but I certainly feel better & a little more knowledgeable for having watched it. I knew nothing of Ed Wood before I watched it and although I will certainly keep an eye out for his films now, I'll keep an open mind on how realistic a portrayal this was, as I've no idea. There were times this seemed more like a documentary or a programme on the History Channel, than a film, not necessarily a bad thing.Whilst a completely different type of film from Citizen Kane there were still similarities and I thought this was 10 times the film CK was. It was likeable in plot & character, not to any great extent, but still more than Kane.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tim Burton's Otto e Mezzo,"Tim Burton's movies are colorful, visually and spiritually both. His movies are art and entertainment, a mixture of both. May be he tells the best tales. He is one of my all time favorite directors, even if he made a few disappointing movies to me like Charlie and The Chocolate Factory. One more thing about Charlie, it was disappointing, but Johnny Depp saved it. As for Johnny Depp, he is a ""colorful"" actor you know, almost all the characters he played were colorful and eccentric. As you know, Tim Burton worked with him a few times and people call this Burton-Depp corporation. Ed Wood is a black and white film. In any case, it does not matter at all, but a black and white Tim Burton film doesn't work at all. There is nothing interesting or dramatic in Ed Wood and the movie was lack of real entertainment and art so it is tasteless like Fellini's Otto e Mezzo. The plot, if there is a plot, it is uninteresting. Ed Wood is not that bad like Otto e Mezzo, but I hardly finished it. Johnny Depp was unbelievably not interesting and his performance was amateurish, he was like an amateur who tries to be Ed Wood or imitates Ed Wood. I disappointed. The other actors are between existence and non existence except Martin Landau. Especially, for Bill Murray, if you saw him in Broken Flowers or Lost in Translation, probably you will say that No, this is not Bill Murray or he is not in his mood.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Fun! A thrill ride to watch, like riding on the Spook Train :)","I could nitpick about certain things in this film if I really wanted to and maybe it's not a ""masterpiece"".
But honestly it's just so fun! Especially if you're a fan of Ed Wood and his work like I am. It feels like a respectful homage.
I just watched it last night and I could easily go for a second viewing already. I plan to rewatch soon enough.
Johnny Depp is so adorable in this role and it's great to revisit the time (that sweet nostalgic time) before the awful Burton/Depp combinations started flowing out.
I don't love SJP usually, but I have no problem with her in this. She suits the role and plays it well with the right balance of levity and silly drama.
All the actors play their parts well & Landau as we know is Oscar worthy as Lugosi. I LOVED the octopus scene it made me laugh out loud.
In terms of the film not being historically accurate I can't fault it on this point because it so clearly telegraphs to the audience that this is NOT intended to be an accurate portrayal of the events but a sensationalised and campy take on the events. What could have happened is likely more Interesting than what did happen. Save that for a proper documentary (which would also be great to see).
Well done Mr Burton and Mr Depp. I can only hope you're remembered fondly for these films & that history forgets the later dross and doesn't let it tarnish the fine work that came beforehand. Bravo boys.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
You Can't Help but Root for the Underdog,"When Tim Burton makes a movie about Ed Wood, one assumes it would be some sort of an ostentatious lampoon, as in Mars Attacks for instance. Wrong. Ed Wood is either a stroke of luck for Tim Burton in regards to acquiring great material it's kismet for him to helm, or what I truly suspect, which is that it's a deeply personal and knowing labor of true, joyous passionate love and mature, careful craftsmanship.Whether or not the movie is totally accurate as a biopic doesn't matter. It's about more than just an account of Ed Wood's life. It's about a passionate young storyteller breaks down doors, bares his soul, deals with merciless criticism, estranges relationships and fights the system only to prove himself an infamous hack and laughing stock. He was eccentric, relentless, even a little delusional maybe, but he could've been anyone.This is the film I would argue proved Johnny Depp as an established, certified great actor. He captures all the can-do optimism that kept Ed Wood surviving, owing to a hilarious capacity for seeing the silver lining in the blackest cloud. The script imagines him as a model American dreamer, an idealistic underdog with little to be so hopeful about, since he was also a model American failure.Something people forget is that Sarah Jessica Parker is a good actress. Something people take for granted, though, after the millennial works of Wes Anderson, Sofia Coppola and Jim Jarmusch, is this early example of colorful departure casting by Bill Murray. But the stand-out is the landslide hallmark of Martin Landau's long career, totally disappearing into a darkly hilarious rendition of Bela Lugosi.It's not just Landau's amazing performance that makes him stand out though. Really, at the core of the movie is Wood's friendship with Lugosi, who he genuinely loves, and who comes to depend on him. We see Lugosi alone and withdrawn in a tacky little house, settled in the hollow melancholy of his faded glory and addiction. His first scene is an exquisitely crafted gag showing him trying on a coffin for size. And Wood is able to relieve the despair, if just fleetingly, in a last-minute streak of roles which gave him amplified renown, as the star of some of the most legendary and respected horror classics ever made, and then of some of the most infamous and derided.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Pull the strings! Pull the strings!,"There isn't much I can say about this movie that hasn't already been said. But just to reiterate - this is a magnificent film. The symbiotic relationship between the delusional young film-maker and the burned-out former horror star is both sublimely hilarious and deeply moving. Johnny Depp once again demonstrates just how versatile an actor he is, and Martin Landau's Oscar award is one of those rare happy occasions when the Academy rewards talent rather than lobbying prowess. Anyone who has ever made their own crappy B-movies for fun (as I have) will appreciate this. In fact, anyone who's a human being should love this film. It's so lovingly made - Tim Burton obviously has a deep affinity with his characters. To paraphrase Ed himself, this will be the one they remember him for.",,Anonymous,Biography
My rating: 6,"Despite the good play of Johnny Depp and even the better of the older actor, the film is quite slow. And on top - black and white. The story takes us to the early years of the last century in Hollywood. Young director looking for a way to break into show business using every opportunity to do it. Accidentally introduced to adult actor, former celebrity but current addict. (although nice image). After many difficulties which they experience together - several unsuccessful films, the separation of the young director with his girlfriend and finding new one, the young director manages to make a film about the lives of everyone around him and the process of filming movies. So he became director of the protagonist in the film.This movie shows how important it is to not give up on what you want to do, regardless of how old you are. The road is not all easy, but you always can find collaborators who will help you and who will believe in you. The movie hints the moment in which everyone has an oddity that must simply be accepted, because it makes him exactly the way he is. Ultimately all ranks well.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Making a film about the worst director ever is remarkable. Not ridiculing him and treating him with respect is great.,"It is possible to look at ""Ed Wood"" as a sort of ""Sunset boulevard"" (1950, Billy Wilder). In this case not Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) is the actress in her final days but we are witnessing the end of the career of Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau). Indeed, Martin Landau is one of the gems of ""Ed Wood"" and rightly received an Oscar.It is also possible to look at ""Ed Wood"" as a sort of ""Freaks"" (1932, Tod Browning). It is hard to believe that the collection of eccentrics in ""Ed Wood"" really were the casts of films such as ""Bride of the monster"" (1955, Ed Wood) and ""Plan 9 from outer space"" (1959, Ed Wood).Possibly the best films to compare ""Ed Wood"" with are films such as ""Being there"" (1979, Hal Ashby) and ""The hudsucker proxy"" (1994, Ethan and Joel Coen). In all these films a man whose naivity is only surpassed by his enthusiasm is the main character. In ""Being there"" this man rises to a responsible position by accident. In ""The hudsucker proxy"" this man is (unsuccesfully) used as a strawman. In ""Ed Wood"" the main character doesn't reach a responsible position at all. Instead Ed Wood has the dubious honor to be elected as the worst film director ever.The strongest point of the film is that it never ridicules its main character. Director Tim Burton treats Ed Wood really respectfully. He does so by emphasizing his enthusiasm above his incompetence. The film is also an ode to films of the 50's. Look at all the posters on the wall that come by during the film.In ""Ed Wood"" Tim Burton proofs that a respectful treatment can be funny too. Look at the body language of Ed Wood and the ""no shaking"" gradually morphing into a ""yes nodding"" if a financier ones again makes impossible demands (such as asking the main role for his son or insisting that the film ends with an explosion). Look also at the meeting of Orson Welles (standing for the best director ever) and Ed Wood, both complaining about the way the Hollywood system treats them.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Different,"This movie was unlike many others that I've seen which is usually a very good thing. However it is weird but you really can't expect much else from Tim Burton so if you like his movies then it goes without saying that you'll love this one as it is one of his better helms in the director's chair. It was kind of sad seeing the actual Ed Wood struggling so much and nothing going right for him ever. Johnny Depp did an excellent turn as this happy-go-luck fellow that was always down on his luck. Bill Murray was only in a short part but he was actually pretty funny as a man in dire need of a sex change. Sarah Jessica Parker played a very good bitch since that's what she is in real life and Patricia Arquette was great in her expected nice girl role. As for Martin Landau it is without question that he deserved the Oscar here. Everything he did or said was just carried out with such perfection it was uncanny. I can't figure out why he's never as good in his other roles as he is here because it can evidently be seen that he is a absolute genius when he wants to be. This movie could be boring at times but I still liked it a lot and the wait for it to be released on DVD was well worth it.Final Hatch:Theaters: Glad I missed it here.DVD Purchase: No, but I can certainly see myself renting it again in the not-so-distant future.Rental: I love it this way!",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A well-made dive through the eccentric world of Ed Wood,"It's the story of Ed Wood, an admiral director who fought for his visions. Some see Wood as the worst director of all time, while others admire him for the effort he put into his films (even if the acting and special effects weren't top-notch).Tim Burton's film, while not perfect, is probably as good as comic biopics get. It's entertaining and interesting, even to those who have not heard of Wood. People who have seen the director's films will probably enjoy the recreations of classic scenes (including the fantastic ""pull the string"" segment).All in all, it's a charming and often very funny biopic, with a suitably campy performance from Johnny Depp and an excellent performance from Martin Landau as the ageing Bela Lugosi.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Good movie about a bad movie director.,"'Ed Wood' is a good film about a bad filmmaker. It tells the story of writer-director-producer Edward Davis Wood Jr., as well as Bela Lugosi's final moments.Ed Wood didn't have talent as a film maker, but one has to admire his determination. 'Ed Wood' is a lighthearted telling of the infamous cross-dressing director, and well portrayed by Johnny Depp. Ed even risked his marriage for the sake of his movies.The film mainly revolves around Ed filming 'Glen or Glenda' and 'Plan 9 From Outer Space'. Ed was a huge fan of Bela Lugosi and he met him when the film offers stopped coming in, and Bela was reduced to a penniless addict. Ed, however, firmly believed he could revitalize Bela's career. Martin Landau delivers a fantastic performance as screen horror legend Bela Lugosi. I also really liked Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge, a drag queen and friend to Ed, who starred in 'Plan 9 from Outer Space'.'Ed Wood' is shot in black and white to give it a more authentic feel, and it works very well. Interestingly, we also get an insight into yesteryear's (bad) special effects. Tim Burton did a wonderful job bringing Ed Wood's incompetence as a film maker/producer to the screen.Unfortunately, despite Tim Burton being a good and respected director, the film didn't manage to recuperate its production budget, only earning $13.8 million on a budget of $18 million.

The Worst Filmmaker Ever,"If you've spent some time in Hollywood or around the movie business you will run into a gazillion Ed Woods. They are hopefully, listlessly optimistic bottom feeders who continue to pursue a dream to their sad ending. I, in fact, know two people where one lives in the attic of a house whilst the other lives in a van. This has been going on for years...all for the pursuit of working in the pictures.Though tragic as seen through the bourgeoise set, this type of living functions for someone like director Tim Burton. A man who also surrounds himself with misfits of the industry. They are not studio people. They are hustlers and swindlers who are so sociopathic in their pursuit of Hollywood they often don't think they're lying. As long as the result is he gets to pretend he's a director. That is the key to this film. Ed Wood loved to pretend to do work but not actually work. He is so myopic in his idolotry of Orson Welles, he forgets it actually takes work. While Ed goes to bars to drown his defeats, Orson is depicted here as using the bar to duck suspicious eyes from his next project. Clearly Welles's critical success was his quiet pursuits. Conversely, Wood danced to whomever would pay him.Sadly, Wood is probably more indicative of the movie business than is Welles. These are the stories not told. And if there is any value in telling his story, it is that hard work never got in the way of Wood's dreams. An entire community is built on this.Most who come to Hollywood would rather pretend to do what they want to do than to actually do it. The reality is harsh. And though this film is buffered through the eyes of silly behavior and eccentric characters, it may truly depress a lot if they want to work in the movie business. To others, it will definitely inspire. Being stupidly positive is a good trait, if you actually learn from your mistakes.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Possibly Tim Burton's best film,"Edward D. Wood Jr. was revered as the worst director of all time. Tim Burton's Ed Wood is the tragic yet hilarious story of his attempt to make movies and just how unsuccessful he was at doing so. Johnny Depp portrays the strange and eccentric director in one of the best performances of his career. It is a very unique film with a very unique style, especially since it is all shot in black and white. Tim Burton's vision for this film stays very prevalent and obvious throughout the movie. It is very focused in its goal of simply portraying the life and eccentricities of Edward Wood Jr. The movie isn't cruel or mean spirited to him or his strange group of friends who help him make his movies. It simply tells the true accounts of how this man went about making his movies and all the little speed bumps along the way.What makes a film about the life of Ed Wood work so well is how much of a character the man actually was. He was so impassioned about making movies and had such big ideas for his films. He idolized Orson Welles and other huge stars of his time. The man wanted nothing more than to make films. He just had no earthly idea how. In the grand scheme of things the story of Ed Wood is quite the tragedy since he never got the recognition he longed for until after his death, but the movie Ed Wood focuses on his determined filmmaking stretch where he remained strangely optimistic and was determined to get every film he worked on completed. And thats something he actually did, they were just all awful. The story this film tells is incredibly entertaining and is a very fascinating study of the over zealous man that was Ed Wood.Johnny Depp is incredible as Ed Wood but the film also offers a great lineup of supporting cast members. The best is definitely Martin Landau as the discouraged and washed up old Bela Lugosi. His story is even more tragic and depressing than Wood's, but Landau's portrayal is exquisite. So much so that he won an Oscar for it. I get the feeling Lugosi was an odd character because Landau portrays him with so many funny little nuances and quirks, making him such a fun character. The other cast members do a great job as well. The two love interests Wood has during the movie are hilarious contrasts of one another and Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette do a great job in those roles. Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones step in for some bit parts that are hilarious in their own ways. Vincent D'Onofrio steps in for about two minutes of screen time in a cameo as Orson Welles in one of the best scenes of the whole film. The whole cast of the film is full of odd personalities and strange habits and it makes the film a consistently fun ride.Tim Burton's auteur style is another of the shining aspects in this film. It is very different and unconventional, but it works extremely well throughout the film. First off he directs it all in black and white which makes it stand out anyways. But there are times when it actually feels like a film directed during Ed Wood's time period, obviously a lot better than Ed Wood himself would have directed it. This style stays consistent but never so much that the film loses its appeal. It has a great flow to it and keeps your attention from start to finish. I was never bored of the film and no aspect ever grew tired or overdone. It is an incredibly well made film.Ed Wood is one of the most entertaining biopics I've ever seen. Ed Wood and the quirky people who surrounded him make for some of the most unique and fascinating stories imaginable. And of course it helps when these characters are so excellently portrayed by the A-list stars that drive this film. The 90s were Tim Burton's golden age of filmmaking and Ed Wood proves it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Good Movie About The Man Who Gaved Us The Wores Movies.,"If you don't know who Ed Wood is, he is only a true Hollywood legend! He gave us such films like Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space. Such great classics and other all rightfully gave him the tittle of the world's worst dirctor of all time. He was not only the worst but also the weirdest. He even makes director Tim Burton, the master mind behind this film, look rather sane. With his bizarre cross-dressing life style and collection of odd friends one could easily mistake him as a fictional character made by Burton him self. But no! Ed Wood really did make some of the most painfully bad movies of all time and haunted movie goers through out his life.Unlike Ed woods Films this movie is actually really good. I think it's my favorite Burton film. Once again Tim Burton cast his good friend Jonny Depp as the lead. Depp performance as Ed wood is really entertaining. In spite of the fact Wood is screwed up in the head, has no talent and is destined to fail one cant help but find him self liking this weirdo. Depp is not the only the great performance in this movie. Martin Landua dose a really great job as the has been Bela Lougsi. For those of you not familiar with Lougsi he only played Dracula and his performance has made him a horror icon to this day. However in this film we see him after his fame has ran its course. Now he is a grumpy drug addicted has been in his old age that no one will heir. No one but his number one fan Ed Wood. Bill Murry plays one of Ed's most bizarre friends. An overly depressed man who keeps moping about how much he wants to become a Women. Sara Jessica Parker also appears as Ed Woods's girl friend who he is keeping in the dark about his wardrobe. Not my favorit actress but it worked out. So we have an interesting cast of people playing a very strange cast of characters.The first thing to be noted about the film is that it is filmed completely in black and white. In fact the film is made to look similar to what Ed Woods's movies were like. The only difference is that this one is decent. So we are not just seeing a retelling of Woods life, we are also seeing how he may have seen the world and the people in it. So thought out the movie we get a few moments that are much like the things you find in Ed's films but its place in just right. The movie is quite humors to. The things Wood would do to get his horrible film together, the dialogue and Woods ""film making"" had me chuckling. There is also some emotion found in the film, most notably in Woods friendship With Bela. This on screen drama earn actor Martin Landua an Oscar for his performance. To bad the real Ed Wood never got one of these. His movie probably could not earn a razy award in any age.Tim Burton's odd Gothic style of filming some how works really well in the retelling of the life of such an odd man. Pluse he catchs that feeling of b-rated 50 scifi movies. After watching this I can safely say this is his most underrated movie. The only real thing that bothers me about this movie was when it neared the end. It's not much but I was hopping we could of seen a little more of what happen after the release of the last movie. Plus unlike everyone ells in Woods little club we were never told what happen to the Actress who stared in Bride of The Monster. I know its not much but for some reason that bothered me. These are very minor flaws and it was not enoughf to lower my ratting. In the end this is a good film about worst film maker.That why Ed Wood gets a 10 out of 10",,Anonymous,Biography

As for Bela's role, I don't necessarily consider a Oscar worthy one, of course, I haven't seen the other nominees, but still, I considered that character acting as a natural, nothing more, as for the make-up, not sure. It's '94, I can't tell yet. Loved the messages, we need more movies loke these. Thank you Mr. Burton! Peace & Love!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
My favorite Tim Burton movie,"If you want to get into film making I would suggest watching this movie, or if you are interested in it in any capacity. I used to want to make movies and this movie is probably one of the main reasons. The whole cast is great, Johnny Depp is fantastic, but the star of this film is hands down Bela Lugosi, the guy that plays him is spot on, and the scene where Ed is watching the last thing he shot with Bela makes me almost cry every time. This movie is funny, informative, and beautiful in black and white. If you haven't seen it you need to.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Visions are worth fighting for,"Even if you're bad artist you still want to create stuff and maybe what you make will not reach the people at the time but in the future. It will be appreciated. That's what I got out of the movie.Epic this is my favorite Johnny Depp performance. He's entirely positive personality just. It's terrible, well my next one will be better. It's just so well within for him. This is just such a funny performance and all the actors amazing jobs.I think the heart of the movie really is Ed wood and the Dracula guy just finding Solace and support in each other and the vampire having some good days left in his life. I think it's a very well written story and it looks really good in black and white just all the funny characters and just always the sadness and the darkness because it is not profitable movies.And it really shows Tim Burton's love for these weird outside characters in the 50s. It's just such a love letter to the time. It really feels like he watched this as a child and was like I want to make this maybe it's not true. Maybe he never watched any of these movies but the movie give me the feeling that he did.I think Ed wool is one of those characters that many film directors can see themself in. Trying so hard to connect but maybe just not having the skills or maybe just not have the audience.A movie full of love maybe it's not the most entertaining movie in the world. I think it was fine even if I think some of the parts are slow but kind of doesn't matter when it's so much love behind it that I could not stop watching it.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Weirdest cinema at its best,"I had become a Johnny Depp fan after having appreciated his previous work in 'Edward Scissorhands'.He is truly the weirdest actor on screen and he is no less weird in 'Ed Wood'.'Ed Wood' belongs to Johnny Depp who plays the central character with humor and precision and Martin Landau who plays Bela Lugosi as if the role was tailor made for him.He undoubtedly deserved the Oscar he received for his supporting role.This film was a box office bomb in terms of gross revenue but believe me, you won't regret watching this film because if you are up for weird films,then there is no looking beyond this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A mediocre movie on a crappy one,"I must admit I was a tad disappointed with this film. This not being the first Tim Burton film that I have watched, from the quirkiness of Beetlejuice, to the incredible love story that is Edwardscissorhands, I expected something that would blow my mind, or perhaps just something of above average quality. But nope, this is as mediocre as they come. The only redeeming factor being that it was based on a true story such that I guess it helped me partially understand why Ed Wood films have become a cult classic for how bad it is? To be fair, I'd say that it's the combination of factors that made the film very meh. The acting from Johnny Depp was subpar and the script monotonous. Only thing commendable was the cinematography.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
127 wasted minutes,"I actually wasted just over two hours of my time watching this movie and I want my two hours back. I think the people that rated this movie any higher than a 5 should all send me $1 to compensate for the time I wasted sitting through this tedious garbage. The only reason I sat through the entire film was because Johnny Depp is usually pretty good. This movie definitely proves that even a good actor can't save a bad movie. I don't know how this movie made it into the top 250, 20,000 people rated this movie a 6 or higher, I want some of what they were on when they watched this waste of perfectly good actors and film. I only hope I can save someone else the pain of having to sit through two hours of complete crap. Please don't waste your time! You've been warned!",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A heartfelt ode to the flawed and the broken, whose kindness and beauty are often buried by the trials of society.","Tim Burton struggles with tone and consistency. The film tapers off in the last 30 minutes, where a noticable tone shift and thematic repetition hampers the overall experience. Nevertheless, Ed Wood is easily one of Tim Burton's most personal films, drawing parallels between its autobiographical events and Burton's own career - almost to a point that it becomes a dissection of his life philosophy and vision. The titular character is one of the best Burton has created in his career, which is saying a lot considering how memorable many of his characters are, whose charm, quirks, and kind heart are presented with incredible alacrity and warmth. The script, acting and direction are rock solid. One of the core messages of the theme revolves around the beauty of filmmaking, all its idiosyncratic ideas, its boundless creativity, its immediate appeal, and the people who strive to enlighten others around them with this medium. There's also the commentary on the woes of film industry, how it strangles the arduous artists whose well intended ventures fail to meet those arbitrary thresholds and standards. Lastly, there's the homily to the weak and the underappreciated, an almost ubiquitous theme across Tim Burton movies. Burton's eye for the weird and the macabre shines in everything he does. Compared to other films in his oeuvre, Ed Wood feels much more mature and grounded. It seeks to tell real life events and the real people that are involved in it, and it is probably why I think the character study in this film bests most of other Tim Burton works, such as Beetlejuice.I along with movie fans around the world wish Tim Burton would rediscover remnants of his past self, one who deftly blends dark gothic settings with incredibly human stories and delivers on both facile entertainment and profound emotional resonance. I highly recommend Tim Burton fans to check out Big Fish, which I think is even more personal and heartfelt than the already great Ed Wood.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wish more people could see this film,"Gene Siskel said in his highly positive review of Tim Burton's Ed Wood that ""this is a film that loves movies and loves movie making."" I really can't improve on that. You feel an undercurrent of happiness all throughout, even when sadder moments creep in. The cast all seem to be having the time of their lives on screen, and Johnny Depp and Martin Landau simply steal the show. You root for these low-lifes and their struggles to make a film. You want to be there with them, enjoying their struggles and joys. And to portray Ed Wood as such an enthusiast may not be 100% accurate, but it is very very fun to watch! Ed Wood is a great picture for teens on up. It is a must see for film students. And it reminds me happily of a time where Hollywood didn't call all the shots (and thankfully that is coming back into play), where low budget films ruled, and where any Joe Shmoe with a couple of nickles and some imagination could make a motion picture and get it shown on the big screen. A true delight!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
An odd but touching couple,"I'm usually not a fan of films that celebrate incompetence and I don't think I'd like Ed Wood's actual films, but this movie about him was very well made and quite entertaining. Johnny Depp is brilliant as the ""worst director of all time,"" and Martin Landau gives us a very touching portrait of Bela Lugosi in his final years, relegated to bad movies and addicted to drugs. This odd couple's chemistry together is special, and there is a charm to Wood assembling a cast out of other misfits and people he happens upon. The fact that he was openly a transvestite and explains that this doesn't equate to homosexuality was a great thing for 1994.Burton made a great decision by using black and white, and he keeps this thing moving along with a pace that matches Wood's frenetic style. I think he probably glamorizes Wood a little bit, maybe because he was a fan and saw a parallel to himself, but it's not overdone. Contrast Wood's enthusiasm with one of the low-budget producers he runs across early on, who says ""I make crap"" and simply wants to make money - there are real comments about the motion picture business in all the fun and celebration of cult films. That rises to a crescendo when Orson Welles (Vincent D'Onofrio) improbably tells Wood ""Visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?"" I would be more inspired if it was the story of someone with more talent, but I was touched by the man's optimism and spirit nonetheless.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Most Important Message In All Film,"I already knew much about the man, having seen Plan 9 from Outer Space, and Bride of the Monster, albeit on MST3K. Back then, I was fascinated by these terrible movies, which seemed to have a lot more fun in them than the ""good ones"" of the time period, some of which, however acclaimed, I do not care about. I didn't know about Wood's passions, his history, his relationships, and I could think of no better vassal than this film.Criminally ignored at the Box Office, despite the consolation of Critical Acclaim, and the first Oscar ever given to someone portraying a real life movie star, this is one of the films that runs the full kaleidoscope of human emotion, not the least of which is heart. Ed Wood lived to be a joke, and his inept films are a demonstration for that, though it is never cruel in the slightest towards him. Depp, in a performance that eats Jack Sparrow for breakfast, radiates a passion for his work that anyone who likes films can grasp instantly. He idolises his film stars, has posters in his ramshackle apartment, and talks about them all the time at worm. Added to this is Wood's battles with the studio system, wherein we now have an actual reason to root for him, whereas other movies would throw an obstacle at the protagonist without the audience given time or reason to like him. It may be clichÃ©, but look at Anakin Skywalker in the Star Wars Prequels. We don't care about him, so why should we care about his situation. Wood is the underdog, screwed over by the Hollywood system. Yet they have a point. He is fantastically terrible. And that is the main victory of the film. Despite knowing that he's crap, we still want to see the producers hand him money to make his dreams come true, despite it being a Box Office bomb in the making. Most other pictures would have had us rooting for the producers in that case, but here we root for the doomed path. His Reaganite optimism is a breath of fresh air in an industry dominated by the bottom line. You'd wish you could be friends with this guy, talking about your favourite movies together, going to the bar, and of course, the cinema.I can go no further but talk about Landau's Lugosi, which thankfully was fully rewarded with an Oscar. Lugosi is the number 2 character in the film. Once top of the world, in Dracula, The Black Cat, The Raven, he's a morphine addict waiting for death. Wood is the precursor of Lugosi's arc, who gives meaning to his life, racked by debt, divorce, and addiction. While this could be the recipe for sentimentalism, we are thankfully spared that, and given a tour-de-force in comedy. Swearing is so much funnier with his Hungarian accent, especially when he gets perverted. ""If you want to make out with a young lady, take her to see Dracula heh heh."" A recurring joke has that no one realises Lugosi is even alive, and certainly that Karloff is his superior, whom Lugosi doesn't seem at all bitter to. ""**** YOU!!! KARLOFF DOESN'T DESERVE TO SMELL MY ****!!!"" His relationship with Wood is the core of the film. Lugosi is given a reason for life in his dying days, and this gives his character meaning. It was based on Burton's own relationship with the sickly Vincent Price.Then there is the humour, which was inevitable given Wood's ineptness, and it shows:A Monster Octopus has no motor, and the actors have to move the legs themselvesAn actor in a police get-up scratches his face with the business end of a revolver while his finger is on the trigger, before falling over and knocking down a wooden gravestone.Lugosi reads incomprehensible dialogue on the set of Glen or Glenda: ""Bevare ze BIG GREEN DRAGON, who sitz on yor DOORstep.""Many others follow, but the best is when Lugosi goes on live television for a skit. I won't dare spoil it.Wood made decisions that no sane man could have made, but in a Producer's-style twist, he ironically ensured that his films would be remembered forever. Some say Plan 9 is the worst film ever made. This is evidence that they've never watched many films. I could literally name 100 worse films right now. The reason? Wood had a passion that could not be tamed, and that life and energy still translates across the reel.The main message of the movie is a brilliant, but important one: It doesn't matter how good you are at something. You're not wasting your time if it is what you love.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Cult of Wood,"I was so excited when I first read that Tim Burton would be making a film about the legendary Ed Wood. When I saw the film for the first of many times, I was beyond delighted. This movie is perfect. Even if you have never heard of Wood, you will find plenty to enjoy in this film ;however, if you are already a Wood devotee, you are going to be in heaven. This film wonderfully chronicles Wood's attempts to make memorable motion pictures. Not only did Ed Wood succeed, Tim Burton succeeds. The cast is marvelous. Johnny Depp is wonderful as Wood. Sarah Jessica Parker is perfect as Dolores Fuller. But surpassing them all is Martin Landau as my childhood favorite Bela Lugosi. I was so afraid when I first went to see the film that Landau would merely impersonate Bela or worse, kid the character. He does neither. Landau turns in a performance of beauty.

movie. I don't like the ""sex change"" bit of the story,, and while I found the cross-dressing part humorous, I didn't care for it, or anything promoting it.

Ed-venturous,"Tim Burton is mostly known for his whimsical arose animated films starring Jonny Depp. This film has all of these elements but in a far different context. An idealistic and pasty protagonist, a jaded or revolving door of love interests, and some high concept quest as the goal. Ed Wood desires nothing more than to be a successful film producer, director, and actor (and to wear women's clothing on his time off). He is met with failure after failure, between a complete lack of patronage and his relationship issues, but keeps on running. His haphazard dash toward whatever he sees as the finish line brings him into contact and friendship ( a loose term) with old film star Bella Legosi, famed for his role as Dracula. Ads complete lack of awareness of when it is an appropriate time to quit is refreshing, and the clean-cut nature of the roles everyone in his life plays keep an otherwise almost sad to watch series of failures moving at a happy and fun place. Tim Burton certainly knows how to deliver a movie that walks the line between obtuse and obscene and lightheartedly comedic.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ed Who?,"Ed Wood was an eccentric aspiring Hollywood mogul. He desired to write, produce, and direct his own films. He had the talent to do it all (I suppose), he only lacked the resources. With charismatic flare he went about getting the money and the people needed to make movies--bad movies, but they were his... kinda.I had to look up who Ed Wood was to know if he was even real. Apparently he was. The movie about Ed Wood was mildly entertaining and humorous. It was nothing I'd rush to the theater to see, but it's OK to kill time on lazy, heatwave of a day like today.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
No way!,"Compared to the rating on IMDb, this movie was a big disappointment. How it can rank in the top-250 completely eludes me. I appreciate many of Tim Burton's other works, but this one is going nowhere for the most part. First and foremost, it is too long for the little bit of story it has to tell. Most of the problems are with incoherencies of the script and bad timing of those scenes intended to be funny. The acting is also less than stellar (with one noteworthy exception). Depp is portraying Wood as a retarded moron all the way through the movie and Patricia Arquette's acting is more wooden than Pinocchio's would ever be. Why would anyone care for the fate of such characters? Martin Landau, of course, shines and saves the movie single-handedly. His performance of Bela Lugosi is well worth the Academy Award it earned him.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Fine Piece of Work,"For some reason, I never got around to watching Ed Wood (the 1994 film) until a few days ago. I had heard nothing but good things about it and I think I wanted to wait until the hype died down sufficiently. Late in 2020, I thought it was about time :) Also, I saw that Bill Murray is in the film, and I think he's a good actor and I fondly remember Groundhog Day (1993). The last film I watched wherein he starred was Lost in Translation and I just read that film is from 2003. Time sure flies, as they say. Lost in Translation is a must-watch, too.Bill Murray is a supporting actor in here. Johnny Depp stars as Ed Wood, and there's Martin Landau (Bela Lugosi), Sarah Jessica Parker (Dolores Fuller), and Patricia Arquette (Kathy O'Hara), Jeffrey Jones (The Amazing Criswell), Lisa Marie (as Vampira).The film is both funny and sad. The comical side of it is at the forefront, but it's not a typical comedy in that it wants you to laugh and tries hard doing so. No, this is an excellent drama and it so happens to be what you yourself bring to the table. That's my two cents. In the end, I think it's more sad than anything else in the film. A really good performance by Johnny Depp, but we all know he can act. His most amazing role I consider to be Edward Scissorhands (1990).I have no interest in watching the real Ed-Wood films. Well, they are so bad, they might be comical, so I might consider it when I'm in the right mood.Recommended. The black-and-white is an artistic choice that fits like a glove. It even made for a fun joke about a 'red' dress.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ed Wood if He Could....and He Did,"As someone who has watched movies ever since he was a little kid, I've seen my fair share of good ones, bad ones, and mediocre ones. However, no matter how the movie turns out, I never forget that at the end of the day, almost if not all film directors put their best foot forward on movies trying to make ends meet with art. The exact same thing can be said about Edward D. Wood Jr., the man infamously known as the Worst Director in history, as he made movies cheap and fast resulting in films in laughably dubious quality like Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster, and of course, Plan 9 from Outer Space...but as incompetent as he was, he made these films out of earnest intention because he had such a passion for filmmaking, and who better to tackle the project of an eccentric weirdo who had such a passion for film than another eccentric weirdo who made his own weird albeit earnest and passionate films than Tim Burton.What could have easily been a straight up mockery of the filmmaker ends up being a love letter to the man, as Burton clearly understands how hard it is to get a film made, thus sympathizing with the director through trial and error. What gives Wood a spark of light in the feature is that he is so optimistic and positive about the filmmaking experience and his own movies that he did whatever it took, from hiring his friends as actors, to getting washed up star Bela Lugosi in his films, to stealing props, to getting funding from a Baptist church. Sure a lot of this seems nuts, but keep in mind many other filmmakers have done crazy things to get their films made too (look up how Apocalypse Now and Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs were made), and while Wood may have been in the wrong, his unbelievably passionate drive to making the greatest films ever made really is worth the price of viewing.As for other technicalities, the acting is phenomenal, from Johnny Depp capturing Mr. Wood's upbeat and eccentric mannerisms, to Sarah Jessica Parker presenting his former girlfriend Dolores Fuller as motivating at first and then embarrassed by Ed's transvestism (the inspiration for Glen or Glenda), to Patricia Arquette as Ed's second girlfriend Kathy O'Hara presenting as sweet and accepting to Wood's transvestism, to Jeffrey Jones bringing the weird albeit earnest psychic Criswell to life, to Lisa Marie as the stern fatale Vampire, and even George Steele as the bulky unintelligible albeit sweet wrestler Tor Johnson. But the real scene stealer is Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, who rightfully earned his Oscar for bringing to life this iconic horror movie actor to screen with his erratic behavior, heartbroken nature, and gentleness to Ed Wood that gives him a soft spot making one sympathize with the poor old man. Oh, and Bill Murray as the lovable homosexual Bunny Breckinridge? GENIUS!The film made the right decision in not only shooting it in black & white, but by also on occasion using real stock music to create the right mood for the 1950s, almost like a time capsule. Admittedly, the movie is not 100% accurate to Ed Wood's life, but it still elevates Wood's goal to keep pushing forward through all hardships. Tim Burton even explained, ""In doing a biopic you can't help but get inside the person's spirit a little bit, so for me, some of the film is trying to be through Ed a little bit. So it's got an overly optimistic quality to it."" Besides, its a movie first, and a biopic second (like Amadeus), don't except everything to click authentically.In conclusion, Ed Wood is not only my favorite film from Tim Burton, but one of my all time favorites for its wonderful intent that filmmakers always try to make the greatest films ever (even if studios may disagree with their visions), the fantastic cinematography and editing, the marvelous acting, the witty humor, and just about everything else. There is a reason I never judge a movie until I see it, and that's because I don't know something unless I actually view it. Sure I may assume it could be bad, but I don't know it is until I give it the time of day to fully analyze it. If I didn't, then I would not have seen movies I love with all my heart like La La Land, The Lego Movie, Zootopia, and especially this film. That, and even if their films end up poor, filmmakers will always put their best foot forward and I respect them for that every time they try to make a motion picture. As Orson Welles in this film said it best, ""Visions are worth fighting for, why spend your life making someone else's dreams?""",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Tribute that Edward D. Wood Jr. Deserves.,"For all his many personal and professional faults Ed Wood was-bless him-a true auteur. You will never confuse an Ed Wood film for anything but an Ed Wood film. Even his less distinctive films-i.e. Jail Bait-still express his manic personality. They are so singularly and vividly the product of Wood's mind. That is a lot more than you can say for a lot of films. Wood's films, like most psychotronic films, are beyond good and bad as categories. They are sublime because they are so awful. Burton's film focuses on the sublimity of Wood's life and work.That is the key decision that deserves praise. Ed Wood (the film) could have been a really sour mean spirited film focused on mocking Ed Wood (the man) as a z-grade talentless hack. But the film-to its great credit-gets that no Ed Wood did have a talent for expressing his personality through the language of cinema-in all his complex and chaotic ways. This film is a love letter from one weirdo who has had mainstream success to the another weirdo that hasn't. It may be Burton's best film.Formally the film is quite good. It moves at a great clip. Its disjointed story manages to feel just perfect for the man at the film's center. The production values-especially the moody black and white-nail the tragicomic mood the film is aiming at. And of course Depp and Landau are perfect in their roles.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Hearty, Touching and Hilarious, One of Burton's Most Overlooked Wins","A big hearted, quick-tempo biopic with as many personality quirks and oddly-charming eccentricities as the subject himself. Ed Wood, widely regarded as the king of the pointless, meaningless, hacked-together nonsense picture (aka the worst director who ever lived), is both blessed and cursed to not comprehend the depths of his own awfulness. Forward he endlessly marches, procuring has-been celebrities and clueless investors through sheer force of will and personality, all in the quest to become the next Orson Welles. Which, of course, is like buying a can of bug spray and expecting it to serve as a dessert topping.Johnny Depp is a great, big, overinflated bag of optimistic energy in the title role, half carnival barker and half renaissance man, but he's overshadowed by a heartbreaking turn from Martin Landau as a struggling, drug-addicted, late-life Bela Lugosi who somehow gets wrapped up in Wood's little world. Landau won a surprising Best Supporting Actor award for this take, well-deserved as he projects all manner of emotion to an unsuspecting audience and towers over every scene in which he appears. Bill Murray is also fabulous in a very small, nearly-pointless role, which surely deserved further exploration. Alas, at just over two hours, there wasn't time to get to everything.One of Tim Burton's best, most restrained films, bubbling and churning with his own brand of black, twisted humor, but also much more controlled and traditional than his more definitive films (say, Beetlejuice or The Nightmare Before Christmas). Energetic, entertaining, funny and poignant and tolerant, it touches a whole lot of emotions with impressive delicacy, and its deep ruminations on acceptance remain particularly relevant in a modern setting.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A fascinating tale of one of the worst directors of all time,"This is probably one of my favourite Tim Burton movies alongside other classics like the first two Batman movies, Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuce. Not to mention it has Johnny Depp in one of his finest performances. This kind of movie always puts me in a creative medium, especially film. I like how Burton directs and Johnny Depp portrays how passionate and driven Ed Wood is about movie-making even though he wastes people's money and people think his movies are terrible and most people hate his style of directing and don't approve of his lifestyle like his transvestism. But I like how they focus on the story of how he made movies like ""Glen or Glenda"", ""Bride of the Monster"" and ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"".

One of the best movies about making movies,"There's quite a lot to say about Ed Wood. But I guess I'll start by saying that I find it to be one of the most overlooked film in history. Why is it so overlooked? Well, no one really knows why it failed at the box office at the time even though it was a critical success. But thankfully, it has gained more fame and recognition over time, yet I still believe it's overlooked. The film is about a young movie director who has a passion for making movies even though he downright sucks at doing it. That's all I'll tell you people because the rest of the plot is really hard to explain in one review, and is super long so I really don't wanna do it. Anyways,the film is just a masterpiece. It's funny, inspiring, emotional at times, but it still gives you that warm feel-good feeling in the end. It gives viewers the message of never giving up and to do what you love no matter what others say. But what really made this movie so good are the characters that it has. Every single character in this movie has a different yet unique and memorable character trait. They were so fun to watch and you couldn't get enough of them. Of course that's do to the wonderful performances from he cast which includes Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, and best of all, Martin Landau in the role of Bela Lugosi, which I believe, is the best performance of his career. The film was directed by Tim Burton and it really showed. You could see a lot of his elements in this movie. You have that dark eerie atmosphere, and you have the characters who are different from other and are rejected by society, yet they swallow all the opinions from others and try to achieve great things. Unfortunately in real life Ed Wood never became a critically acclaimed director.... but that doesn't kill the message of the film. Sometimes you gotta face reality. Many people try to achieve great things but unfortunately, not all will succeed. And I know that whoever is reading this review might be a bit upset from what I just wrote like 2 lines ago and considering there's like a hundred more reviews on this film i'm sure not many will read it but remember this: Ed Wood may not have succeeded in making movies but he is still famous today. Why? Well for one thing his movies are so bad that people enjoy watching it because they're amusing, and also because he never gave up. He was called the worst director ever but he still made movies. Even though he didn't achieve what he hoped to achieve, he still kept trying because he loved what he did and he wanted to be remembered from it and chased his dream till the day he died. Not everyone will succeed in their goals, but if you tried and had the courage to give it your best, you will still gain a positive outcome for your attempts. You should always try to do something that you love even though it may sound improbable. But make sure it's not impossible because if you try to like jump of a building and fly or something then well, i don't know what to say. Because if you don't try, how will you know if you will succeed? And if you don't succeed, always have a back up plan. Just saying. Well anyways I highly recommend you see this movie if you haven't. It's really funny, and really inspiring, go check it out. I give it.... 5/5 stars",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A terrific Burton film, which is why his latest flicks have been somewhat disappointing","Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) is an underling at a Hollywood studio in the fifties. But, of course, he wants to direct his own films when he can get his hands on the money. One day, Ed is passing a coffin shop when he actually meets Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), whose prime has vanished, due in part to the former vampire's drug use. Nevertheless, Mr. Wood is thrilled and arranges to meet with Lugosi again. Ed's live-in gal, Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker) is not impressed, she would rather he have met Robert Taylor. Not long after this, Mr. Wood, who presents himself well in interviews, does secure funding from a D-list movie producer. While before its time, Glen or Glenda turns out to be a giant bomb. One reason is Ed's too rapid and careless direction and another is its subject matter, cross-dressing. But, even after a severe tongue lashing from the producer, Ed is not discouraged. He finds the money for his new production, Bride of the Atom, from a naive starlet who wants a starring role. This sets Dolores off, for she was promised the role, and she breaks off their relationship. Since Lugosi is the star, the film has more merit than G or G but not much. Lugosi, too, checks into a detox center where he manages to get off the needles. Mr. Wood meets a lovely lady there, Kathy (Patricia Arquette) who becomes his new love. Still, Ed goes on talking his talk, convincing a group of Baptists to fund another science fiction film, which will provide money for their future religious endeavors. Suddenly, Lugosi passes away. There are other huge production problems. Will Ed complete his masterpiece, Plan 9 from Outer Space? This summary of mine does not sufficiently portray this fantastic film about the real director, Ed Wood. It is rip-roaring funny and the cast is superlative. Depp, yes, is great as the title character but Landau is terrific and won an Academy Award. Parker, Arquette, Bill Murray, J.D. Spradlin, Jeffrey Jones, Tina Marie and all of the others are very fine, too. Shot in black and white, as Wood's films were, its presentation is likewise wonderful, with great art direction, sets, and costumes. One must also applaud Burton's visionary direction. Don't settle for tame entertainment tonight. Get Ed Wood and walk on the wild and wacky side!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent!!!!,"I have been a big fan of Tim Burton ever since Edward Scissorhands. Moreover, the pairing of Johnny Depp and Tim Burton has proved to be commercially as well as professionally sound.This particular outing is no exception. Depp simply shines as Ed Wood, arguably the tiredest director of all time.While the movie itself is a fun homage to the horrible director, Tim Burton elevates the project by presenting a very touching relationship between the director and actor, Bela Lugosi, brilliantly realized by Martin Landau who more than deserved his supporting actor Oscar for his performance here.The supporting cast of characters are all superb and this will be a movie that ranks right up there with Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow as shining examples of the pairing of Depp and Burton.I highly recommend!!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tim Burton and Johnny Depp at Their Best,"There have plenty of director/actor partnerships throughout the years. John Ford had John Wayne whom called him Pappy; Martin Scorsese had Robert De Niro to help define his artistic talents and the obsessive Werner Herzog had the equally unbalanced Klaus Kinski. But if any partnership typifies the dynamic in today's modern Hollywood it'd be the peculiar Tim Burton and heartthrob Johnny Depp. Over a twenty year association the two have made eight films together from the much celebrated Edward Scissorhands (1990) to the much maligned Dark Shadows (2012) with seizures of creativity in between.Arguably the best film the two have ever made together was the little seen early ninties film Ed Wood (1994). The film depicts the life and times of Edward D. Wood Jr., a film director commonly dubbed the worst auteur who ever lived. Since his passing, his paltry eight full feature films have become the stuff of legend, finding fandom among schlock-horror fans and sci-fi film buffs who laugh at their cheapness and incompetence. His opus, Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959) includes ineptitudes from switching daylight to night in seconds, plainly visible film equipment and priceless lines like ""Inspector Clay is dead, murdered and somebody's responsible."" Ed Wood's script is written by oft writing collaborators Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski who subsequently wrote The People Vs. Larry Flynt (1996) and Man on the Moon (1999). Clearly they have a talent and enthusiasm for writing about oddballs. Their script lays the foundation for an intimate portrayal of Wood and his loyal band of misfits. It's solemn yet offbeat and quirky leading to some inspiring moments, many of which involving Johnny Depp and Martin Landau's infamous Bela Lugosi. There is one scene where the heroin addicted former horror star contemplates suicide aiming a pistol first at himself then at his good friend Ed. ""Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea"" says Wood. ""If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink. What are you drinking?"" ""Formaldehyde,"" says Lugosi. ""Straight up or on the rocks?"" Johnny Depp once described his characterization of Ed Wood as a mix between Ronald Reagan and the Tin Man from The Wizard of Oz (1939). The man's optimism in the face of rejection drives the film with the quickened pace of an energizer bunny. His wits are matched by the supporting players which include Bill Murray, Jeffrey Jones, George 'The Animal' Steele, Patricia Arquette and Sarah Jessica Parker who can only swallow the fact Wood is a hack for so long.The real draw of course is Martin Landau whose interpretation of Bela Lugosi, the original Dracula (1931) is astounding. It isn't mere impersonation which, lets face it, everyone has an impression of Dracula; no its pure stagecraft. His stellar performance ranks in this writer's mind as possibly the best and most accurate depiction of a real personality ever put to film. Landau would go on to win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and God bless him for that.The movie is shot in black and white which might deter some viewers. Yet for those who ever wanted to reward themselves with a gratifying story about the foibles of filmmaking, or amerce themselves in Z-Movie lunacy watch Ed Wood. It exhibits shrewd writing by seasoned professionals and features some top-notch performances including one of the best Depp has ever committed to celluloid.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Truly Awful,"If Burton was paying homage to Wood by making a truly horrible film than he hit it right on the nose. But just likes Wood's films, this movie should only be watched by those dire fans or as a joke. The character with any depth was Wood and that seemed forced beyond belief. Why would anyone think that a film about the worst director of all and his terrible movies would make for a good movie. This is not a mainstream film but meant for those obsessive weirdos that like to watch Burton films by themselves at 3:30 in the morning. This film only shows how bad Hollywood films really can be, with its subject matter and with itself. This film should never have been allowed to be a big budget film with any real actors but if he truly wanted to capture the tone of Wood's life, he should have used a handful of bad B list actors that never made it big.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

The most uplifting movie ever made (In my opinion),"Ed Wood is based off the worst filmmaker ever. Edward D. Wood Jr. Who has made some of the worst movies ever made. Ed Wood is played by Johnny Deep and it's my personal favorite performance from him. Martin Landau does great job portraying actor Bela Lugosi. I love his performance. All the actors were all great. The movie has really good visuals and look a lot like the style of Ed Woods work. The movie goes through the making of three of his films. Glen Or Glenda. Bride Of The Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space. The movie gets really good at the end and is the most uplifting ending I have ever seen and the movie has really good message for a 15 year old filmmaker like me. It Tells you, even if people call your work crap, you can ignore and move on with your work. Kinda like Rocky in a sense. Except, this is about film making, not boxing. This is now one of my favorite movies of all time. Because it motivates me to continue my work and future projects for YouTube and my film making career in the future. I love everything about this movie, its perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
As sweet as a pound of sugar,"There's many words I could use to describe this film that may seem contradictory to each other: it was strange, it was cute, it was funny, it was like Mank and The Disaster Artist mixed together but far superior to either of them, but above all, it's sweet. It's so goddamn annoyingly sweet.It should also definitely be considered one of those ""filmmakers' films"", because pretty soon, I'm going to have to start thinking about what I'm going to do for my student film, and frankly, I am bricking it. And that's why this film is just so bloody sweet to me, because even though it's about a legendarily awful director, not once does it feel like it's making fun of him. Honestly, after watching this, I'd be surprised if I didn't find The Disaster Artist too mean if I ever watch it again.And to think that in the first few minutes I thought it was going to be massively transphobic...trust me, this is anything but. I don't want to say more than that, but I think this would be best experienced knowing nothing about Ed Wood, because while the narrative is kind of cliche ""trying to make it in Hollywood"" stuff, he as a character and as a person is so interesting that it will certainly make the film better if it's the first time you're learning about him.The narrative being a little cliche is my only real issue with this though. The acting across the board is fantastic, featuring what's easily the best performance I've ever seen from Johnny Depp, one of the best portrayals of a real person in cinematic history from Martin Landau, and even though they're the focus of the film, somehow they don't overshadow anyone else's performances, because they're all so damn good.Much like Mank, the decision to film this in black and white adds so much to this, and I think there was a conscious effort to not stop there, and they also filmed it in a way very reminiscent of cinematography and editing tropes of the time period. Normally, this would be a bit of a red flag for me, because I really don't find many American films from before the 60s to be all that creatively shot, but there's so many gorgeous shots in every scene of this film. And yet it still looks like it could have come right out of the 50s to me somehow.There's so many quotable lines, so many inspiring moments, and holy crap Tim Burton directed the crap out of this. I haven't seen all that many of his films, but this is without question the best of them to me.And I can't stress enough just how disgustingly sweet this bloody thing is. So much that in any other film, I would probably find myself annoyed by it, but here...everything just works together so well. And I really do feel a little better about my student film having watched this.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Get's an ""A"" in my book","Tim Burton put together an ensemble cast on one of Hollywood's enigma directors, Edward D. Wood Jr. Burton was daring enough to film this biopic in B&W. Normally, I would avoid such things. But, this was awesome. The tones, the textures, the lighting, the scenes are fabulous. All shot in a most excellent manner. And to add the superb acting of Johnny Depp, Martin Landau, Jeffrey Jones, Bill Murray, and Sarah Jessica Parker; you have the makings of a classic film. It's ironic because the story revolves around a writer/director/producer and some of the worst films every put to a theater screen.Although parts of the story can be dreadful, like watching Bela descend into his addition to heroin, there are some very subtle moments which are just hilarious. Landau acts out a tour-de-force performance. It is simply uncanny how well he portrays Lugosi. It is no wonder he won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.In conclusion, even if you do not like Ed Wood or have never seen any of his films, I would still think you could enjoy this movie. However, it is soooo much better if you have some background knowledge of what you're getting yourself into. This is, by far, one of Tim Burton's greatest achievements in directing. A bold step which most would not dare take.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hooray For Hollywood,"""Ed Wood"" is about as good as Hollywood gets while perversely celebrating the worst Hollywood has ever offered. Forsaking grim reality for the Hollywood kind, it tells an involving story with a deft mix of humor and heart.Wood (Johnny Depp) is a struggling writer of bad dinner-theater drama who dreams of finding success on the big screen. One day he spots boyhood idol Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau) inside a coffin he's testing out for a road-tour production of ""Dracula."" Lugosi, who has seen better days, takes up Ed's offer of a ride home. Soon, he is signed to be in Wood's movie about a cross-dresser. The movie predictably fails, but Wood and Lugosi become unlikely friends in the face of uncaring Hollywood.Wood at least can handle criticism, having practice: ""Worst film you ever saw? Well, my next one will be better!""There is a lot of room for pathos here, and even more if ""Ed Wood"" stuck more closely to the facts. The film is a triumph precisely because it plays with the truth in such a genial, gonzo way. Wood in the film is not the dysfunctional alcoholic he was in life but a highly motivated young man bursting with energy. He has a gift for making friends, strange friends but good ones, like TV psychic Criswell (Jeffrey Jones), horror-movie MC Vampira (Lisa Marie), and out-of-work-and-out-of-the-closet actor Bunny Breckinridge (Bill Murray).Murray alone has so many funny lines in this film I could fill the rest of this review with them and be done. There are a lot of funny lines in this film, some buried so deep you have to watch it more than once. I just caught one, where the owner of the coffin shop responds to Lugosi's complaint (""Too constricting!"") by earnestly saying no one has ever mentioned it before.Because the film is in black-and-white, it seems to go by people, which is unfortunate. Director Tim Burton and co-writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski present us with a very accessible story that includes clever shout-outs to bad-movie buffs, not just hilarious re- enactments of terrible scenes from Ed Wood's own movies but left-field moments where Ed is inspired to write lines that will become famous in his movies (""Pull the strings...wait a minute!"")I'm not a fan of the cast, with the exception of Murray and Landau, but all do great work here. Depp's artificiality in the title performance initially put me off; then I realized he was playing off the conventions of the 1950s in a way that sets the tone for the whole movie. Sarah Jessica Parker is an actress I can't stand, but she's fantastic here as Wood's girlfriend Delores, the one person who sees how bad his movies are and can't stand it. Her facial reactions when listening to two of Wood's disciples sing his praises are priceless.Watching ""Ed Wood"" may be tough for five minutes if you aren't used to black-and-white movies, but that will disappear once Landau makes his entrance. The film just builds from there; it's structurally as strong as it is quotable. The humor makes it enjoyable; the compassion makes it memorable. ""Ed Wood"" is a rare movie that can be treasured as easily as it can be enjoyed.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tim Burton should be ashamed!,"As a Bela Lugosi film collector, I HAD to see this film...... and what I saw angered me to NO END!!!!!  I have every Lugosi film except for 5 (the rarest of the rare!) and know quite a LOT about his life.Tim Burton depicted him as a bumbling simpleton, which really got me angry!  Lugosi's latter years were NOTHING like Burton depicts them, and he should be ashamed for his treatment of this Great Actor!I'm told that Bela Lugosi, Jr. didn't like it very much, either, and attempted to sue Burton.....it's a shame he didn't win his lawsuit.Mr. Burton,  you will be forgotten in 5-10 years from now -- but Bela Lugosi will Live FOREVER!!!!!",2.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Bela Lugosi's Sad (He's Sad, he's Sad, he's Sad)","Burton's most lauded film is tellingly one of his most understated - a linear but heartfelt and stylistically authentic biopic of the world's worst director. By eschewing a lot of cynicism and the painful messiness of reality Ed Wood hits on something deeper about creative expression and authenticity - it's not at all perfect (the clunky Orson dubbing is a shock) but it is beautifully performed and consistently witty. To hinge a lot on the amazing performance of Martin Landau was a wise choice, and it's his volcanic Lugosi, not Depp's misguided Wood, that ends up being the heart of the film for me.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Beautiful Ode to Filmmaking,"This is really one of the best films about filmmaking. It shows the highs and the lows of a life in film. Ed (played by Johnny Depp, in my favorite performance of his) has an passion for film that knows no bounds and dreams of becoming a legend like his hero Orson Welles, but his talent is lacking. While Burton definitely took liberties in telling the story of Ed Wood (why let facts get in the way of a good story?), you walk away from the film feeling like you really knew these people. They become your friends over the course of the film. You'll also be asking yourself, would you rather be a nobody, or an universally mocked filmmaker who gets played by Johnny Depp. Check out my full review on my blog http://amandalovesmovies.com/2012/03/01/ed-wood",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

This movie originally had horrible reviews, and believe me, I wasn't too thrilled to watch it. I gave it a shot and that shot paid off. Don't underestimate this movie. This has one of the strongest cast lists that I can think of, and they all mesh so well together. The parts were perfected. Add this to your watch list and fall in love!

"Strongly acted, but too long to really enjoy it.","Ed Wood impresses with a good cast (though it can get confusing with the many speaking parts it exhibits) but is a film that leads into nowhere. Obviously, Burton reveres Wood in some strange way, but he can't (or just doesn't) stop this biography of drifting off into a boring tale of a strange transvestite. A 80 minute flick would've told everything that needed to be told. But besides the protracting, Ed Wood is an interesting as well as odd story and you can have a nice time with it. I'll give it an extra point because of the acting of Martin Landau who rightly got the Oscar, Bill Murray who is responsible for the comical parts, and Johnny Depp who portrays Ed Wood as authentic as possible.",,Anonymous,Biography

One of Tim Burton's achievements,"Tim Burton has always done strange, in a good way kind of movies. He has directed Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Sweeney Todd, and The Corpse Bride. What do they have in common? They have Johnny Depp as the main character. Johnny Depp brought great character to the Burton movies. ""Ed Wood"" is one of them. This movie is Burton's vision on the life of, what people said to be, the worst director of all time. Ed Wood made some of the strangest films of the 1950's. These include ""Glen or Glenda"", ""Bride of the Monster"", and the one movie he was known for, ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". The cinematic shots in the film make one feel as if it is an old film. The movie is shown in black and white, so it really sets the mood in the time period. The casting in this film, aside from Johnny Depp, is superbly picked. Martin Landau as Bella Lugosi brings the character to life with his elderly enthusiasm. Half the time one forgets that he is not Bella Lugosi. Landau's performance as Bella Lugosi won him an academy award for best supporting actor. And he defiantly deserved it. The music in this movie is phenomenal. Some of the music was from some of the Ed Wood movies, and it replicates the quirkiness of an Ed Wood film. Jeffery Jones makes an appearance as Criswell, presenting the film in a host-like presence introducing the life of Edward D. Wood Jr. This movie raps around the beginning of how Ed Wood became a director. Even when one knows that he was the worst director of all time, one feels a sense of importance in Johnny Depp's character. He is eccentric but sympathetic. He felt his work was important, even though others did not. Whenever Ed Wood finished one of his movies, he felt that he was a true success. The relationship with Ed Wood and Bella Lugosi starts out with a meeting of two strangers, then their relationship grows as Ed Wood gives Lugosi a second chance at stardom. Ed Wood builds strong relationships with his fellow actors, a girlfriend respects his transvestitism, and his fetish for angora sweaters. The movie makes the characters human, that's why one feels great sympathy towards them. The editing in this film is fantastic. It brings all of Ed Wood's creations in one opening scene, and brings the origins of his films into a mostly true story. We now know who Edward D. Wood Jr. is because of Tim Burton. Ed Wood films may have been said to be the worst, but Tim Burton's ""Ed Wood"" turns everything around.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ed Wood is made for anyone who wants to make film,"Ed Wood is by far Tim Burton's greatest achievement. The person Ed Wood was dedicated to film and wanted to entertain people with his films. Despite his love of film his films are excepted as some of the worst of all time. I personally like Ed Wood's films, but that's besides the point. This film shows a filmmaker's want to make movies. Ed Wood despite being told by people that he has no talent works for his dream, and tries his hardest. That is a message for anyone wanting to make films. Try for your dream despite it looking impossible. Not everything in the film is truth. They do make a few lies here and there, but a lot of this movie is real events. In the end Ed Wood is a great biography on an extremely interesting person.4 stars out of 4",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A great film about a poor director.,"A masterpiece of weird cinema, Tim Burton has made his own masterpiece that I don't believe will ever be topped. Taking the true story about a man who was considered the worst of his field, Burton creates a creepy, bizarre, almost disturbing world of the underbelly of Hollywood in the 1950s. This was the part most people don't remember but it was there. The story is incredible as we watch this enthusiastic, positive man try to get his dreams accomplished at any cost.All elements work perfectly together here. The acting is top-notch with Johnny Depp giving maybe his best performance ever, Martin Landau stealing the show in an Oscar-winning performance as the legendary vampire actor Bela Lugosi, along with Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette, Bill Murray and many others giving real, believable performances in bringing this strange group of people to life. What may be the most amazing part about this movie is how well Burton is able to create the remaking of Wood shooting his movies. Every scene feels real, vivid, and completely accurate.In short, this is the best Burton movie as well as the best Burton/Depp collaboration. In a way this is so different from anything Burton did before or has done since. This is the most sincere, realistic movie he has done and while I admire his off-beat brand of film-making, I think this is one of the best films of the 1990s. See it for Burton, Depp, or Landau. But also see it because it is a great film about a poor director.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Imperfect Ambitious Visionary,"Out of all the movie's from one of my favorite directors strangely this turned out to be my favorite one but most importantly one of my favorite films in general. This is strange to me because normally I'm not really into biopics, but this is probably one of the only ones I really like because not just was the guy in my favorite field of expertize but his story was actually interesting.The cinematography was excellent, I'm glad it was all done in black and white it really helped capture the time when Hollywood was still young and it's sub culture was on the rise. I even like the music score by Howard Shore which also fits with the movie.But most importantly I like how the real life characters were portrayed and performed. Ed Wood is my favorite role from one of my favorite actors Johnny Depp. Johnny really captured his spirit at least before the time things for Ed went down south. But what I really like about Ed is that you are on his side from beginning to end because you can easily emphasize. The guy was an underdog he was really down on his luck and constantly struggling to make his dreams come true. Most of the people that try to bring him down or discourage him are all rational people, and you don't like them because their total blow holes; I remember always thinking ""Cmon just let him do his own thing."" And that was a good feeling, a feeling I don't get much for character real or unreal.Yes, it true that Ed is a hack and a flaw person, from writing scripts that have some really bad dialog down to being delusional and eccentric, but he was actually honest about it you actually see him putting it out there, like in one scene he wears a dress while directing a scene for ""Plan 9"" as a way to feel good, in a way it sort of reminds me of the common idocricies we would do to help ourselves think or feel something like I've seen some girls in my collage classes that would draw or write some things on the sides before taking notes, not kidding.And he saw let alone worked on his films and there were lots of mistakes from bad production quality, bad context, acting, and other things. But it never discouraged him, he had a vision and was relentlessly determined to keep on building it and after it was done in his eyes the final product was perfect even though reality said something else.But of course it was also Martin Landau's performance as Bela Lagosi that also carried out the film, this is my favorite role from that actor because you really believe your seeing and hearing Bela. Seeing the twilight times of this actor I'll admit is really sad and made me wonder about a lot of others actors and actresses out there whom are now out of the limelight. You really felt for the guy from beginning to end, from his desire to continue acting which is one think I admired despite how old he is he could still do it let alone acting is what made sense to his life. Down to the time in the film he passed away which made me shed tears, I know this was something that happen long ago but they way they build it up gripped at emotions.The real life supporting characters are great, my favorite one is Bunny Beckaridge by one of my favorite comedian actors Bill Murray, what he says at the Babtism always cracked me up.I really like the humor in the film, it's true this film is a biopic drama but it's not oh so serious which I feel is a tone that fits perfectly and makes the characters feel more human. My favorite humorous moment is when Ed and the gang go to the movie premiere of ""Bride of the Monster"" and everyone is booing, throwing popcorn, it's crazy though the strangest thing about that scene is their doing this when the movie is just starting. I have only two conclusions about this, one this could of been a simple technical mistake or the theater is just reshowing the movie, though if that was the case why the heck would anyone stay).I really love this film because it really is an inspiring movie because it really has a good lesson on simply fighting for your dream. Ed didn't do it for money or glory (theoretically anyway) which I never found good reasons to do filmmaking for; he did it really just to be and do what he wanted to do because it made sense for his life. That the same for all of us for whatever we do or desire.Visions really are worth fighting for.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tim Burton's best,"If you like outrageous comedies like Dr. Strangelove and The Loved One try Ed Wood.It's based loosely on the life of Ed Wood, the crummy director of Plan Nine From Outer Space and other bombs. Wood was not only a lousy director he was a transvestite and the movie touches on that aspect of his life. He befriended Bela Lugosi when he was a has-been drug addict.Despite the pathetic condition of Lugosi and the transvestitism of Wood, this movie manages to be touching and hysterically funny at the same time. It's a great character study.This movie is loaded with terrific performances one after another from the major characters to the minor ones. Martin Landau won an Oscar for his portrayal of the aged Bela Lugosi. Johnny Depp does the best job of his career as Ed Wood. Bill Murray is hysterical as Bunny Breckinridge who wants a sex change. Sarah Jessica Parker as Delores Fuller, Ed's first wife and Patricia Arquette as Kathy his second wife are both great. Jeffrey Jones as Criswell is a hoot. Mike Starr as the foul mouthed producer Georgie Wiess is a riot. Lisa Marie as Vampira and George 'The Animal' Steele as Tor Johnson have to be seen to be believed. The script is just full of great one liners and the visual gags keep coming. You'll get to see the justly famous scene where Bela Lugosi fights a rubber octopus in a pond -- this scene alone is worth the price of admission.Filmed in black and white with a terrific score by Howard Shore. Not many people have seen Ed Wood and it was a box office flop but it's Tim Burton's best film and one of the best ever. From the opening credits to the end, this film is flawless.",,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant homage,"I've seen the train wreck that is ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", which makes ""Ed Wood"" feel like an eye-opener. Is this true to life? Clearly not, but it's all shot up with so much whimsy and biting dialogue that you honestly don't care. Johnny Depp plays Wood with a cock-eyed optimism, and that positive spirit is what brings out the humor in his many failures. That, and a zest for angora sweaters.It's a modest movie, even with such a strong cast (particularly Martin Landau) and I love that it's uncharacteristic of Tim Burton. But of his collaborations with Depp, this is easily my favorite and never fails to leave me with a smile.A fine movie indeed.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A good movie that's about bad movies.,"Is it just me or are Johnny Depp and Tim Burton an unstoppable force? Why is it that every movie they make is so good? As always, B & D don't disappoint in Burton's take on the life of Edward D. Wood Jr., the worst movie director of all time (well whoever did Pumpkinhead 2 took the the cake from Ed Wood, but I'm guessing that guy will never work on movies again). The acting is done well as always, especially the intentional bad acting, which is harder than it looks. I liked the fact that it was done in black and white, it gave the movie an aged look which is exactly what it needed. Depp in drag was definitely one of the movies high points. Bill Murry played, as always, an unusual part which was very suited for him (if you get the Special Edition DVD you can hear him sing Que Sera Sera in a slaughter house). The guy who played Bela Lugousi looked a lot like Bela Lugousi. It was a frightening resemblance. The overall movie is really weird, and those who have seen Charlie and the Chocolate Factory will realize that Depp's acting in Ed Wood is very similar to that in Charile. Very smiley, very happy. I recommend it to everyone, especially those who like Plan 9 From Outerspace, and Tim Burton movies. It won't disappoint.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Awesome Portrayal of a Misunderstood Man!,"Ed Wood, which is not totally a non-fiction film, is a wonderful portrayal of man who has multiple personalities, found it hard to get money, and is a guy who was voted ""Worst Director of All Time."" This film is often funny and amusing, but is not devoid of Tim Burton's trademark strangeness. This film captures the decade of the 1950's very well thanks to the use of black and white. If I didn't know better, I would have thought this film was produced back in the 1950's.Burton's film is about the director Ed Wood as he enters the most productive years of his life. Wood happens to be a man who is fond of wearing women's clothing and deeply idolizes Bela Lugosi, the star of the original Dracula film. Wood, with the help of Lugosi, goes on to make some monumental films.The acting is very good in the film. Even though Johnny Depp pairs up with Burton way too much, he delivers a surprisingly comical performance that seems straight from the heart. Martin Landau is brilliant as Bela and delivers one heck of a performance. There are some other great characters especially the humorous performances by Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones.Overall, this is a great film that works very well with the black and white coloring. This film has a heart and I loved the way it explains the relationship between Ed and Bela. This film has gotten me interested in Ed Wood, and I may have to check out his ""bad"" films to form my own opinions. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your typical Tim Burton film. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tim Burton's Best,"Edward D. Wood Junior is hailed as being ""the worst director of all time."" And from what I saw in this film, rightfully so. I was familiar with his films but had never watched them before and after seeing this, I plan on watching them.Ed Wood follows Edward D. Wood Junior's attempts to make it big in Hollywood, but he can't seem to face the fact that he doesn't have what it takes. As he casts washed up movie stars such as Bela Lugosi. This film is enjoyable to watch and laugh out loud funny, but also, at times, surprisingly moving.This film got snubbed at the Oscars in my opinion. It should have been up for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Screenplay, Supporting Actor and Makeup. It did get wins for Supporting Actor and Makeup but how about nominations for the other deserving cast and crew members.Tim Burton gets the best possible result from the screenplay, which is the best a director can do. His decision to film in black and white really worked well on the screen and isn't something you see very much of nowadays. He also controls the emotions you feel when watching a particular scene, as there can be a fluid transition from comically funny to sad.Johnny Depp gives a great performance, as the cross dressing, bumbling and clumsy Edward D. Wood Junior. Martin Landau was awarded an Oscar for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi, and rightfully so. Bill Murray as always gives a great performance as well as Martin Landau's daughter, Juliet Landau, in the role of Loretta King. All the other performances are top notch as well. The screenplay also has to be acknowledged, as it is snappy and full of wit, with some classic quotes.If you haven't seen this, I highly recommend it, especially if you're a Tim Burton fan, as this is his greatest film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A fascinating look at a fascinating story behind a rather fascinating director; could in fact be called 'Plan 9: The Making Of'.,"'Ed Wood' is one of those films that comes really close to making fun out of itself. Its Hollywood, behind closed doors setting is something that has worked really well when exploited by certain films in the past, namely 'Singin' in the Rain' and 'The Player' and it works just as well here, setting up a big, intimidating world in which the characters try to live in and break through in. One person unfazed yet totally oblivious to the fact he's living under these conditions is our hero; Edward Wood which gives the film a comic touch straight away.If you're familiar with Edward Wood or if you've seen any of his films then it helps Â– big time. Although it's probably not necessary to have seen them all; the focus here is one what professional critics and analysers have dubbed 'the worst film ever made' that film being 'Plan 9 from Outer Space'. I, myself, have seen the said movie and rated it 4/10, yes, it was bad what with the awful camera work, fake sets and props and woeful dialogue but to be honest; I've seen worse (Batman and Robin, anyone?).As I mentioned, the film gives off a fantastic look at Hollywood itself. The sets, the extras, the studios Â– they all combine to create an interesting utopia or dystopia for some. The references to Boris Karloff and the actual inclusion of Bela Lugosi and his problems is a wonderful sub-plot that really hammers home the authenticity of the film. Another interesting reference is when Wood (Fantastically acted by Depp) is talking to Lugosi (Again, brilliant acted by Landau) about the horror genre and Universal horror in general. They mention 'traditional horror' which utilises buildings, shapes and the like to create an atmosphere; something that 'Ed Wood' director Tim Burton actually does and can be seen in films such as 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' and 'Batman Returns'.Because Edward Wood is supposedly the worst director of all time, we see film producers laugh at some of his work he presents them early on; not sure whether to laugh or not. This is an interesting, subtle hint at our own reaction. If we've seen any of Wood's work in real life (especially 'Plan 9') then we know how they feel; do we laugh or not. Is this meant to be serious film-making? This draws us in to the film and helps us relate to the producers.The films is packed full of references to previous Edward Wood films and we really can see his masterpiece 'Plan 9' forming as the film progresses. Each thing he picks up on, from the first sight of Vampira to the fact a random guy happens to look like Lugosi with half his face covered up. It's really engrossing cinema and it's interesting trying to figure out what's true to life and what isn't. In addition, if you've seen 'Plan 9', then the shooting of it on set is just fascinating.With some strong acting from everyone, even the supporting cast and some great content; 'Ed Wood' is, so far, my favourite biopic and is genuinely funny and entertaining. Although I hate to go away thinking this was merely exploiting the worst director of all time, I shall just suggest it's more of a warning of what not to do than anything else.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Why I recommend seeing Ed Wood,"Having seen Ed Wood on VHS last night, and Orgy of the Dead last week, I feel like I came to understand Ed Wood, Jr. Well, somewhat, anyway. Wood might be categorized, if that is the proper term, under ""American Originals."" To me, Johnny Depp's portrayal was especially interesting also because everyone has a biography, his story, or history. Or, if you will, her-story. I very much liked this movie.I remember seeing both Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre in 1964 when they were publicizing The Comedy of Terrors. More or less AWOL from my job at the US Post Office that day, I've mostly forgotten about that job but who could ever forget Karloff and Lorre???The 1968 movie Targets, directed by Peter Bogdonovich and one of Karloff's last films, reminded me a little of Ed Wood.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
disinformation,"This film has so many factual errors in it that it is hard to list them. The general drift of the film is correct but one can't take it for fact. In the film commentary burton admits it is not a documentary but an impression of ed wood's life. That is all well and good. However if a viewer did no hear this they might come away with a misconception about wood and more importantly bela lugosi. Burton kind of admits he played fast and loose with some details to spice things up, but most viewers may not realize this. You must get the dvd with the commentary and do some research into ed wood and bela lugosi to get the accurate picture. Also watch some of ed wood's movies to see how some of wood's associates behaved. Maybe this doesn't bother some people but to me, being a history nut, inaccuracy of fact rubs me the wrong way.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Oooh, I did love this film...",I am a great fan of Tim Burton and this is one of his best works so far. The movie hooks you from the start and keeps you there until it finishes. Johnny Depp delivers a spectacular performance as Ed Wood as he has done in Edward S. The fact that it is B/W makes it extra special as many of the best movies made are B/W: Raging Bull and Casablanca for example. I do hope that Buton carries on making movies well into the millennium!,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
one of the greatest movies ever made,"It's unusual. The critical consensus on the films of Tim Burton seems to always reach a level of love-it-or-hate-it polarization, and with a few exceptions, I don't necessarily consider myself a fan of his work (his films are artistically brilliant, but usually in service to half-baked screenplays), but ""Ed Wood"" is a film so unlike any other in his creepy-crawly back-catalog that it performs one feat of brilliance after another, fearlessly and joyfully, extremely and tragically. By taking some welcome liberties with the actual story of notoriously inept filmmaker Edward D. Wood, Jr., Burton transforms this film (photographed in black and white, with makeup and production design that echoes the 1950s perfectly) into a documentary that exists in the alternate universe of one man's mind, while simultaneously being the most down-to-earth film he's made, with moments of staggering hilarity, tenderness, and imagination. In ""Ed Wood,"" Burton finally has the balance of his creative, offbeat vision in conjunction with a strong script that matches it well. The polarization that marks his films makes the subject matter an ironic choice to tackle--author of ""Plan 9 from Outer Space,"" reviled by many as the worst movie ever made, and with a penchant for dressing in drag to ""feel closer"" to women, Ed Wood is a character with a demeanor as unusual as Burton's, and maybe the ultimate posthumous tribute of this film is the manner in which it displays Wood's spirit, sincerity, and vision in spite of his poverty-stricken projects. Johnny Depp's performance as the never-discouraged (except when dealing with Baptist financial backers) director is carried out in a way that should render it a flaming caricature, but instead becomes something of genius; his Wood conveys a vibrancy and life that sees him through the difficult times of his relationship with aging Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau, who won a well-deserved Oscar for his performance) and girlfriend Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker); when crew members complain about getting only one-hour's sleep during a grueling night shoot, Wood counters: ""I got no sleep, and I feel great!"" Such a mantra could be applied to Burton's execution of the film--despite its deliriously light fantasy, fiction, and occasional lapses into the surreal (even incorporating a scene where Wood has a chance encounter with his idol, Orson Welles), ""Ed Wood"" is driven more by character than style; it would be fair to say the two mix harmoniously to create a work of sheer brilliance and total entertainment. Though I first watched this film 10 years ago, each subsequent viewing has played as consistently as the first, and if that isn't a sign of quality in a world of paper-plate flying saucers, I don't know what is.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Sarcastic, inteligent and moving view on Ed Wood","MY RATING- 8.0To begin, it's a well-aclaimed mov here in Portugal and we have some Ed Wood moviegoers (thank god there isn't a lot!)It's a damn well made mov, created when Burton had finished his personal Batman Returns, this one on the life of Edward Wood Junior, the worst director ever. Well I never watched a mov from Ed, and to be honnest, I don't intend to spend my money doing so. This mov spare us the torture of it, and Burton uses again his strange sense of humour to tell the story of a guy who was convinced that his movs were excellent. In a way, the message is given by Vincent D'Onofrio in a delicious cameo as Orson Welles- we must go through with things, even if they're bad as Ed's movs. As Ed, Johny Depp goes quite well, as well as Sarah Jessica Parker as the girlfriend who leaves him, Bill Murray (ultrafunny!), Patricia Arquette (very sweet), Lisa Marie Juliet Landau and Jeffrey Jones as the omnipresent Criswell. But the real surprise is Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, the horror star from 30's Dracula. Under his heavy makeup, we really forget we're seeing an actor, he truly looks like Bela! What a performance! Impossible not to sympathise with him, he even won the Oscar (which is quite rare in a Tim Burton mov).Overall, this is a quite entertaining doc mov, and a interesting change on the director's career, that will please fans and nonfans.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Great Film,"A great flick, a must see for any Tim Burton or Ed Wood fan. Johnny Depp gives an Oscar worthy performance as the eccentric Ed Wood (he is the most underrated and talented actor in Hollywood today).

Burton's masterpiece,"i watched every Burton film so i think i know what i'm talking about when i say this gem is his finest work because unlike his other films there are no exaggerated over the top makeup and costumes and the characters although so weird feel so real and close to the audience, the cast is perfect portraying characters different from what they're used to especially the old brilliant actor playing bella lagusi, and johny Depp once again proves he's a winning horse, he held such an iconic, heavy, crazy but normal character and he convinced me he's Mr wood coming back to life, the depiction of Hollywood life and L.A at that time is perfectly done but the only draw back for me which didn't take away from the film is the white and black color i know it was important for the movie and maybe helped convince us but i didn't like it that much. finally i think this film really proves what a great authentic and smart director Tim Burton is",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
1994 movie in BLACK AND WHITE ? It works well for this film,"Ed wood the movie starring Johnny Depp , Martin Landau , Sarah Jessica Parker , Jeffrey Jones and Bill Murray was a very different film( just to tell you if you do not know its in black and white) but I like it for multiple reasons. One of the biggest reasons is the odd characters through out the whole film . Johnny Depp was great - as Ed wood a bizarre filmmaker who is constantly gathering unique actors / people to be in his movies. He is in love with movies and his passion is clearly shown through out the film as he struggles to make his movies.Eddie and Bela Lugosi had this crazy friendship going on through out the film. Both of them had an intense interest in film , had unique attitudes , awkward traits and a tough life for various reasons. They both laugh together yet cry together as they are struggling artists but determined. Anyone with eyes can see it , also there chemistry / bond. Other then me praising Depp / Landau is also brilliant as Lugosi ! The trivia on here said Landau watched a bunch of his movies and listened to him - Landau gets an A+ for doing his homework.Overall Tim Burton did an amazing job like he usually does. Depp was so into the whole thing. There effort together is mind blowing. Its only obvious for them to have had so many wonderful films in the past and will have in the future with there wild yet relatable characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Meh,"This is not a film about Ed Wood. This is Tim Burton's standard script, which happens to have a guy named Ed Wood in it. How accurate is this account of the man and his career? Who the hell knows. But my impression is that Burton was telling the story he wanted to tell, in his characteristic style. It was amusing to watch, but did it do these real personalities justice? Or did Ed Wood shield himself from not doing them justice by adopting this slightly surrealistic approach, which I presume echoed the feel of an Ed Wood film? At the end of the day, I was entertained. But there was no emotional payoff in the end. And that is a big problem. And, as I said. I don't feel wiser about the real Ed Wood.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

I would highly recommend this film not only to learn how someone fails in his profession but also because film is excellent to watch.Poor Ed Wood. He so much wanted to succeed in the real film industry but ended up in the film industry which everyone watch:porn. That is it. We all want to watch the regular films, but ALL men and a lot of women watch porn. I wonder how Ed Wood be as a porn director? He probably would be very successful.

It's All About the Big Picture,"Leave it to Tim Burton to direct a film about the ""wackiest"" filmmaker of all time. But in all seriousness, Ed Wood may very well be the best directing job of Burton's career. It's funny, strange, and rapidly paced. Burton deserves credit.I really love when movies take place within the world of filmmaking, especially during the 1950's. It was just an interesting time to be involved in the film business. Perhaps nobody more interesting than Edward D. Wood Jr. Although apparently much of the film's details were made up for the movie itself, it's hard not to get a kick out of Wood's story. A man stumbles himself into Hollywood with little to no experience, and manages to garner decent budgets to make multiple films, that's Hollywood 101.One of Burton's greatest qualities is the ability to develop a great journey for the characters. Ed Wood has a clear beginning, middle, and end, but it's the stuff along the way that makes for the most entertainment. The sheer absurdity of Wood's story is really where Burton tends to bring out his best work. Watching a man without any real talent as a filmmaker plow his way through studio executives and convince actors to join him in his quest makes it all the more amazing. I mean come on, this guy compares himself to Citizen Kane on multiple occasions.As for the performances, there's almost too many good ones to mention. Johnny Depp, in his second Burton feature, begins to show exactly why he's one of this generation's greatest talents. He easily could have been nominated for an Oscar here. It's also the first real time he played such a uniquely strange character, something he's got himself stuck into doing these days. Martin Landau, who did win an Oscar for his turn as Bela Lugosi, is what makes this film work so well. It can get tiresome watching Wood's undeserved success, but Landau works so impeccably well as a drugged up Lugosi. I couldn't have imagined someone better in that role.The rest of the cast and crew also deserve credit, mostly for succeeding in making such a strangely delicious film. After a while, you begin to go along with the joke of Wood's career. And to look up and see that there's still plenty that isn't falsified makes it all the better.+Unique characters and story+Movie about movies+Burton's tight directing8.0/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Burton is Freak. His Movies Suck.,"I tried watching this, and was willing to give it my customary 20 minute sniff test. I couldn't finish ...Weird.Johnny Depp is one of the best contemporary actors period. I have watched him in so many roles,
and his depth and range are practically unrivaled (among contemporaries). It is an apostasy that
his talent is wasted here on Burton's usual freak-show style stories. Depp likes dark stuff because
it expresses his personality; so while he might have thought this film congruent with that, no -
this film is way beneath his skill level.Creepy.Tim Burton, on the other hand, has little talent other than create weird, perverted, and dark story.Like his perverted cousin Tarantino, he is just really weird. Burton has never made a film, or had
anything to do with a film that I didn't think was tipping on perverse. ""Coraline"" squeezed by as
OK, but aside from his sicko half-brother Tarantino, he is a twisted, narcissist.Self-indulgent.Sarah Jessica Parker cannot act. She's never been able to act. She has an On / Off switch

inflates to Burton's psychological distortions on reality and common sense.This is Hollowood at its self-aggrandizing, self-indulgent best: weird, sick, dark, boring.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
offbeat gem likely to become a classic,"'Ed Wood' is one of the most unusual and entertaining movies I've seen in a long time. Wood was director in the 50's of the notoriously wretched 'Plan Nine from Outer Space', which has achieved a reputation as possibly the worst movie ever made. This off-the-wall quasi-docudrama - appropriately shot in black & white - relates Ed's travails in the movie business producing these masterpieces of schlock, as well as chronicling his friendship with Bela Lugosi, with whom he became friends long after Lugosi had become an aging, ailing, drug-addicted Hollywood has-been.One would expect the tone of such a movie to be one of ridicule, but there is a kind of zany respect here for Wood's sincerity. He may have had lousy taste, limited imagination and non-existent talent, but he never stopped believing in what he was doing. Watching his career unfold is fascinating; like a train wreck, you can't stop watching.Martin Landau is absolutely brilliant as Lugosi. Aside from the masterful makeup job, his performance as the ravaged actor is by turns hilarious, touching, and tragic (I believe he got an Oscar for best supporting actor for this). Landau is truly one of the best actors around.This is a must-see movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tim Burton At The Top Of His Game,"Ed Wood is Tim Burton's second best film in my mind. For me, Edward Scissorhands would still take the cake for first place-you just can't beat mystical and magical- but despite that being the case, Ed Wood I'd arguably say, is Burton's most masterfully directed and written film yet.This is the original Disaster Artist, just with more heart and gusto-not tryna' diss on The Disaster Artist, I'm just trying to make a comparison cause I'm too lethargic to explain the overarching synopsis of Ed Wood. This film, even from scene 1, is down-right engaging, enticing you into defensibly the most allusive true story about a Hollywood star.Johnny Depp is at his absolute prime when portraying Ed Wood. Sitting on it, this might be his most gifted performance of his entire career-it's a very underrated one indeed. It may not necessarily be Depp's most iconic role-I'm sure all you Pirates fans would reward that trophy to Jack Sparrow-but it's certainly his most driving. All the minor gestures and gimmicks he squeezes into this character makes his believability all the better. And when you mix Wood's character with Martin Landau's Oscar-Winning and furthermore, calamitously tragic performance as Bela Lugosi-which was in fact, 100% well-deseved of that Academy Award-you have yourselves one of the most compelling duo themes present in a based-on-a-true-story film.Ed Wood may be Tim Burton's least Tim Burtony film, but it's at the cost of creating one of his most prolific and momentous masterpieces. Ed Wood is the utmost curious retelling of a man in seek of his aspirations and obsessions. You know you've accomplished something ravishing when your viewer-that being this dork, me-doesn't want it to end even after its over 2-hour runtime. I could fancy a couple more additional hours of this cinematic treasure any day. (Verdict: A)",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
I love this film and you will too!,"You don't have to be a Johnny Depp fan to love this movie.He is excellent but so is everyone else who appears in this great movie.Tim Burton directed and the love he has for his subject shines through very clear.This movie tells the story of real life movie director Ed Wood and his loyal pack of misfits as they tried to help Wood fulfill his vision of making movies ,even though he had no talent at all for it.Many of his movies are considered the worst ever made.And his ""Plan 9 from Outer Place"" is usually considered the very worst film ever.Wood ended up making soft-core porn and drinking himself to death.But with this movie he will forever be remembered and loved.This movie,shot in black and white,will appeal to anyone who is a horror movie fan or a movie fan in general. Johnny Depp is wonderful in the title role.He plays the cross-dressing Wood with every bit of his fiber.Martin Landau,as Bela Lugosi,is as good as anyone I've ever see in any role.He becomes Lugosi so much you forget that it isn't Lugosi himself on screen.Watch this movie to see Landau if for no other reason.The humanity that Landau brings to his portrayal of the aging ,ailing, dope addicted Lugosi is so much more than you would ever expect from him.There are other familiar faces throughout this movie and everyone is superb.The writing is funny and dead on and the direction is perfect.This is one of those movies you will want to buy so you can watch it again and again.

True dedication to real stars..,"Hollywood visionary Tim Burton pays homage to another Hollywood visionary, albeit a less successful one, in this unusual fictionalized biography. The film follows Wood (Johnny Depp) in his quest for film greatness as he writes and directs turkey after turkey, cross- dresses, and surrounds himself with a motley crew of Hollywood misfits, outcasts, has-beens. The real story, however, is his friendship with aging, morphine-addicted Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), whom he tries to help stage a comeback. Landau's unforgettable Oscar-winning performance must be seen to be believed, as must Rick Baker's Oscar-winning makeup. While it would have been easy to make a film simply ridiculing the bumbling director, Burton instead focuses on his driving passion for filmmaking and his unwavering persistence in the face of ridicule and failure. Possibly the most surprising aspect of the film is the genuine sentiment with which Burton treats the relationship between Wood and Lugosi; his devotion to Lugosi is touching, as is Lugosi's final soliloquy -- an inane bit of dialogs from the hilariously bad Bride of the Monster that grows into a poignant metaphor for the actor's life and ultimate triumph of his spirit. Even the look of the film is right; it manages to preserve the air of one of Wood's own films while retaining a sense of artistry in much of the composition on screen (note the scene at the drug rehab where Lugosi endures a horrifying night of detox). In all, Ed Wood is a unique film -- at times side-split-tingly funny; at others, tragic or even frightening -- and a heartfelt tribute to the love of movies, good and bad alike",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Depp's Acting Was Worse Than Any Ed Wood Movie,"Johnny Depp thought he was such a great actor that he could suck wonderfully, but his performance... which is the epitome of a performance... is so over-the-top and outright outrageously silly and cartoonish, the otherwise good surrounding actors, especially Oscar winner Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, are all but wasted in a pretentiously bizarre party-trick of a movie by Depp's multi-collaborator Tim Burton, in dire need of a leading man who could actually play a human being, which, unlike their other creature-laden ventures before and after, was very much needed.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography

Entertaining and thought-provoking,"It is a sad fact (well known, but generally ignored by the authors of the self-help books) that some people get the breaks and others don't. Those who don't seldom travel very far or rise very high, no matter how hard they work at it; and this is partly due to the even sadder fact that those who have gotten the breaks all too often take malicious delight in ridiculing and disparaging the efforts of those who have not. As a number of other reviewers have pointed out, Ed Wood was definitely a have-not; and while this film is not an entirely faithful recreation of his life, it does present a fairly accurate account of the general conditions under which the man was forced to work. How many of the supposedly great Hollywood directors (or the critics who lionize them) could have done any better in such circumstances? To compare Ed Wood's films to the multi-million dollar studio productions of the day is comparing apples to oranges, but how many critics have ever bothered to note the distinction?Ed Wood has been accused of having no talent. A fairer assessment would be that whatever talent he might have had was never nurtured, developed or given one iota of direction by any of the people who could have helped him. If some established Hollywood icon had chosen to take the young Ed Wood under his wing and open a few doors for him, what sort of talent might have emerged? That we can never know. One thing, however, is certain: for all their faults, Ed Wood's films have been entertaining people (one way or another) for the past fifty-odd years, while many of the more expensive and polished films of his day are all but forgotten.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Film About a man Who Did Things His Way by a Man Who Did Things His Way,"First things first: this might be short thanks to the computer problems that I'm having.

Some of you might think this has something to do with my not liking his style, but in fact that is my favorite thing about him. I like Batman Returns over Batman for specifically that reason; they gave him freer rain in the former, and he used it to carve out his own unique style. The closest thing he has to a great film in my book, Edward Scissorhands, is also the most flush with his handiwork.If you are like me, and you love his style, make sure to check out this one. Despite being an ostensibly 'real world' movie, no one else could have made this movie. Perhaps no one else could have even made an Ed Wood film, or at least a good one; Burton, for whatever he may lack in pure cinematic skill, he more than makes up for in his ability to portray the complexities of dark and twisted, but well-meaning men.This film flopped at the box office, and predictably so; people are used to the creepy reveries of Burton, but this is a whole different sort of weird and bizarre: a realer, more disturbing sort. And from a pure financial sense, who on the planet wants to see the guy who made Beetlejuice and Batman direct a film about an infamously bad director? Seriously; no one, kid or adult, male or female, who is not a serious film-goer or Burtonite, would ever go see this on their free time. Thankfully, it spread over time and now has gotten the cult love it deserves, the cult love it was perhaps always destined for.I am perhaps more intrigued by this film than I am a fan of it. I feel more down-the-rabbit-hole here than I ever did watching Burton's mediocre adaptation of Alice in Wonderland. Ed Wood seems like the sort of man who I would eavesdrop on while pretending to listen to music, so interesting is his weird life. Despite the face that his flaws are evident, you can't help but like him. Depp (not yet a frequent Burton collaborator) portrays him as a man with no talent but a lot of heart, who kept going towards his vision no matter what the system or the world or reality seemed to shove in his face. As a writer, I can't say that this didn't have an impact on me, this dedication towards your dreams for as long as you may live. He is by no means a figure to be looked up to, but he is a figure to be respected.The intro, where you are introduced to the film by a B-movie monster, is campily spectacular and sets the tone for the film. Now, if only it had done more to live up to that tone in the first third, which is slow and a bit limp. The other two thirds are better, but the film does fade sometimes, specifically during the filming sections. Ed is more of an interesting person than he ever was as a lousy filmmaker. And there are parts that are a little mish-mashed: some of the sections have too much dialogue, others too little.But through these flaws, it keeps you intrigued. I picture a younger version of myself turning the pages in a giant Gothic storybook, wanting to know what's next. The performances are stellar. Howard Shore's score is not LOTR-caliber, but it is sneakily ambient. And Burton, like Ed, made sure to do it his way.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"well-acted and inspirational, ""Ed Wood"" should be seen by anybody who dreams of becoming a filmmaker someday","Edward D. Wood, Jr. was posthumously labeled the Worst Director of All Time. And when one looks upon his motion pictures, such as the infamous Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959), even if you find yourself enjoying the movie as a guilty pleasure, you can easily see why. That's really the only reason why he's famous today and why this Tim Burton biopic was even made. Ed Wood cost more to make than all of the real man's movies put together, but it does do the story justice if it is slightly fictionalized.For those not familiar with the story, Edward D. Wood, Jr. (played by Johnny Depp) was a young transvestite filmmaker during the 50s who was marked by his laughable production values and even more so, his ambition. He stopped at nothing to gain money to make his flicks and also during that time, befriended Dracula (1931) star Bela Lugosi, played here by Martin Landau in a hands-down brilliant performance that won him an Academy Award.There was only one thing I admired about the real Ed Wood and that was his ambition. It was most certainly not his movies. Burton's biopic wonderfully reenacts Wood's passion for movie-making in an inspiring method. Film critic Gene Siskel called Ed Wood ""one of the year's very best"" and hoped that it would inspire ambitious filmmakers to ""follow their dreams"". And I could not agree more with him on that regard. I did not like Ed Wood as much as him, but I agree that it is one of the great movies about movie-making.Appropriately, Ed Wood is shot in black-and-white; a brilliant decision since it captured the atmosphere of Wood's scenario and also because it's hard to imagine what Bela Lugosi would have looked like in color seeing as how he passed away before even appearing in one. It gives the movie a documentary-like style, which is also truly effective seeing as how it reflects upon the past. Performances all around are very good, especially Martin Landau. I was truly amazed at how well he mimicked the real Bela Lugosi's accent and mannerisms without becoming unintentionally comical. Johnny Depp was also very good as the optimistic Ed Wood. There are many other famous names in the film such as Bill Murray, but because they play characters exactly opposite of their mainstream course, we buy them for people, which is what any movie should do.Bottom line, Ed Wood is a very good film by Tim Burton. There were some parts, mostly emotional scenes, that I felt were not carried long enough into the running time, but other than that, it is a pretty much flawless and solid Tim Burton movie effectively blending drama and comedy together along with inspiring a new generation of people to take the challenge and follow their dreams of becoming filmmakers.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Nothing very special,"I just saw Ed Wood yesterday on the television and to be frank, it was just okay. The movie pays a homage to the 'worst director of all time', Ed Wood Jr as it journeys through his life, his films and his women.Ed Wood Jr is portrayed by Johnny Depp who plays it well but does not get into his character. The main problem with the movie was that it looked as if it was mocking Ed Wood all the time. His acting suffered in some scenes where his lost his cool in the film. The trouble with the movie was that rather that showing his passion and determination, it showed how stupid Ed Wood was. In short, I did not feel much conviction in his character.The one who does a fantastic job is Martin Landau. He is humorous yet he it totally into his character.He plays a vampire in almost all his films and gets deep into his role and won a well-deserved Oscar. Sarah Jessica Parker too does a good job playing Ed Wood's wife. The other characters are all right in the film, perfect for their roles.The problem with the film was the repetition which got on my nerves. Again and again, it showed him doing the same things in movies. There were some scenes though that were really good- the making of Plan 9 for example. Another problem was the language. It could have got a PG-13 rating easily but it decided to use profanity which is the only reason why it got an R. They could have just cut out small bit of language and lowered the ratings.Overall, I found it to be a moderate film. 5 out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Must See,"This movie was so good.  I was impressed with the look.  After all was said and done, Criswell looked much as he did in the movie.  Tor Johnson was played well(or real badly as was needed).  Overall Tim Burton builds a world that really existed, but cuddo's could not be held back from Johnny Depp and Richard Dryfus.  Richard filled out the story with his rendition of Bela LaGusse.  Bela was real, and unfortunately tragic.What the movie really pulls off is to make the Ed Wood story plausible. One watches Glen or Glenda, Plan 9, or Orgy of the Dead and say 'movies this bad can't be made by accident.' But Depp makes the movie, with his enthusiasm, ignoring the obvious and simply his ability to sell an object that stinks.  This movie is worth your time because it is funny, sad, victorious and scandalous all at the same time.  What a hoot.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A loving look at awful movies,"(76%) If ""the Artist"" was a loving nod to the best of silent Hollywood cinema, then this is one to some of the very worst of Hollywood cinema, yet with the same exact sentiment running through. It's a tragic comedic portrait of a man more ambitious than talented, as he becomes through the length of the movie almost impossible to dislike and/or not root for because he tries so hard and really does want to make a good picture. The whole cast is great, particularly Depp and Landau, and Burton movies always look at the very least good and this really is no exception. As drama comedies based around very bad movies go this is likely to be the very best, and comes highly recommended for those interested in the other side of Hollywood history.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Best Movie You've Never Seen,"Ed Wood (1924-1978) is generally regarded as the single worst film maker to emerge from Hollywood. This is not really true, for there were and are aplenty worse. But one thing has always set Wood above the pack, and that was his own unshakable faith in his talent. Unfortunately, the faith was misplaced and the talent was nonexistent--and although this Tim Burton film takes a slew of liberties with the facts of Wood's life and career, it does a remarkable job of capturing them as Wood likely saw them through the filter of his own outrageous ego. The film has two tremendous assets: the performers and its visual style. Johnny Depp leads the cast in the title role, and it is a virtuoso performance, for he entices us to like a man whose self-blindness would normally lead an audience to reject him out of hand; the performance is incredibly witty, wildly over the top, and yet it contains just enough pathos to allow us to relate to Wood on a human level. But the real stunner in the cast is Martin Landau, who picked up a Best Supporting Academy Award for his performance as Bela Lugosi, a legendary actor who was very much a forgotten star (not to mention morphine addict) by the time Wood befriended him in the early 1950s.As with Wood himself, the film plays fast and loose with the facts of Lugosi's life, but it nonetheless captures something very essential about both Lugosi and the Hollywood that destroyed him, something very elemental that transcends the weird comedy of the piece. And Landau gives the performance of his career; you truly believe that this is Lugosi before you, a strange but appealing mixture of faltering humanity and arrogance desperate for an audience now lost to him. Other memorable performances include Bill Murray as the inept and very la-dee-dah actor Bunny Breckinridge; Jeffrey Jones as The Amazing Criswell, popular ""psychic"" and occasional Wood actor; Lisa Marie as television's ""Vampira;"" and Sarah Jessica Parker as Wood's fast wife and occasional actress Dolores Fuller. Indeed, there isn't a false note in the entire cast right down to the bit players and extras.In terms of visual style, Tim Burton nails the very look of an Ed Wood film in glittering black and white--but working with a budget that Wood never dreamed of he merges it with a series of classic Hollywood idioms that lift the style out of Wood's unfortunately flat style and into the realm of high art. In both look and direction, I strongly feel that this is Burton's single finest film to date.If the film has a flaw, it is that at times it recreates the flatness of an Ed Wood film a bit too precisely over too long a period--and the result can feel slightly dragged. And it is also a film that will register most clearly with those who have actually seen the films on which the movie focuses, so it may not appeal to the uninitiated. But for those who have the right eye, it is a remarkable film. Wickedly funny, unexpectedly touching, extremely memorable... and strongly recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Spooky and wicked true Barton classic 8/10,"""Ed Wood"" is a perfect classic movie. One of the best collaborations between Barton and Depp. It's based upon the life of director Edward D. Wood Jr. and his ambition to become a great director. His relationship with Bela lugosi (Martin Landau), and the ups and downs in his career, mostly the downs. The movie is clearly from the start a Tim Barton film - spooky, weird and full of tension. No monsters in it but a lot of weirdness. In general Barton is a director that in each of his films he focuses and ""investigates"" the odd and unknown. Ed Wood isn't a creature but he is an interesting director that his life is worth knowing and telling. Depp nailes it again with his fantastic acting. Martin Landau impressed and his oscar for best supporting actor is definitely justified. A pure copy of the real Bela Lugosi. Overall this is a fun and amusing film, great cinematography and genius directing. Spooky as hell and a perfect example of Barton Style filmmaking.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
How did this win Oscars?,"How in God's name did this movie win ANYTHING? And how did it get a high rating on IMDb? I struggled to finish this film and couldnt wait for it to end. The story line of a fool who thinks he can make movies and fails every time? Yea, that's 2 hours of ""interest"" that I want to wast my time on. Seriously, a 15 year old could have made this movie, and it looks like that's exactly who made it. I have loved everything that Burton has directed, until now. Yes, I'm about 35 years late in seeing this film, and now I wish I hadnt. As far as Johnny Depp, WOW! The exact same acting in every scene? He was so over the top that I was embarrassed for him. The entire film seemed rushed, even though it took forever to finish. Anyway, everyone who saw this movie and gave it high marks MUST have been on drugs.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Angora Sweaters Rule,"As of this writing, this movie is ranked the 192nd greatest movie of all time on the Internet Movie Database. The important thing is that out of millions of movies, this one is considered in the top one percent. And I tend to agree that it is much better than the average film, and probably better than the average Tim Burton film.What we have is a biopic of Ed Wood, the B-movie director. And like the man himself, it sure is odd! The closest thing to this film I've ever seen is ""Shadow of the Vampire"", but as this film came first I think I have a hunch where they got their inspiration.Johnny Depp shines in this film, one of his better films and probably his best with Tim Burton. Jeffrey Jones is well-cast. Sarah Jessica Parker, whom I usually despise, is even pleasant... better than her ""Mars Attacks!"" role. That Vinnie guy from Doogie Howser is alright. But the two best roles? Martin Landau and Bill Murray.Bill Murray is very hit and miss with me. Some films, like Ghostbusters and Rushmore, he shines. Other times he is just too bland. But this movie? Perfect. Who knew that the best actor to play a flamboyant grandson of a former vice president was Bill Murray? I really enjoyed the sexual tension between Murray and the mariachi band.Martin Landau is Bela Lugosi, best known for his role of Dracula. But although we already knew the horror movie actor, did we know the alcoholic Lugosi? The potty-mouthed Lugosi? The Lugosi who danced with cross-dressers and wished death upon Boris Karloff? Landau makes us believe this man was real, and even Lugosi's son says the portrayal is accurate. So, that's good enough for me.I didn't even mention Vincent D'Onorfrio as Orson Welles... This film is highly recommended!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"""Really? Worst movie you ever saw? Well, my next one'll be better. Hello...?""","Edward D. Wood Jr. had everything needed to be a success Â– he had the passion, the motivation, an undying belief in himself and a mindless optimism that drove him forward to show the world what he believed were masterpieces of film-making. Unfortunately, the world didn't agree with him.Burton lovingly chronicles Wood's first major exploits as a filmmaker, his naively positive outlook leading him to pour his heart and soul into movies that were, in a word, dire, and how he sort out encouragement and acceptance among the few people who genuinely wanted to see his next film get made. Thankfully, the film about him shares no aspects of the ones he made, and 'Ed Wood' is an absolute joy to watch.Aside from the outstanding performances from the principles and supporting cast and the stunning black and white visuals, the enjoyment of this movie stems from how oddly upbeat it is, considering it tells the story of one who failed dismally at something he truly cared about. This positiveness stems from the fact that it seems to neatly overlook the failure of Ed's movies Â– we see his satisfaction with them and childish love for them, and there is little mention of their failure at the box office and their labelling as the worst movies of all time is hardly mentioned. But that's because the audience doesn't need it spelt out for them; flying saucers on a string, strands of appalling dialogue and constant shots of Ed yelling ""Cut! Perfect!"" are all we need to tell us that Ed had no idea had to shoot a decent film. But never puts a glitch the perpetual optimism that endures until the last frame, bought to life by Depp's terrific performance (though we know, or are told by the ending captions, that Ed's life from then on could only go spectacularly downhill).If there's tragedy in the film, it belongs to Landau as Lugosi, whose moments of cynicism triumphantly undercut Depp's energy. Lugosi is a truly wretched figure, a shell of his old self given new life by a man that only the audience knows as a failure. Despite his cursing, arrogant, explosive persona being played to the full, it's the quiet moments of poignancy that make his performance really worth watching, as he stands up to his knees in water and admits that he turned down the iconic role of Frankenstein's Monster for being too degrading, then proceeds to flail around screaming, pretending to be attacked by a giant octopus.Burton ensures that every frame is worth looking at, as well as striking an exceptionally good balance between comedy and tragedy; though we laugh at the characters and their faults, we're behind them all the way which makes the horrible knowledge that they failed so dismally all the more affecting.'Ed Wood' is a wonderful antidote to the biographies of successes - it reads like a story of one who accomplished great things as we see his ideas coming together, his overcoming of pitfalls and final triumph...the only comedown being our own knowledge that he wasn't a seccess in any sense of the word. See it--then see Ed's movies, and try to see the passion and effort that went into them, rather than the wobbly tombstones or spaceships that cast shadows on the sky.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Now here's a guy with ambition!,"You have to admire a guy like Ed Wood, full of vim and vigor, with plenty of ideas and a sheer yes attitude. I love this movie for that reason. Tim Burton seems to love the guy too, as this movie hardly makes Wood the fool that we all make him out to be now, what with Plan 9 and Glen or Glenda? Johnny Depp is awesome here, taking this character to one whole new dimension. And while I look at Martin Landeau's Bela Lugosi now as being just a tad overrated, he's good here. Actually, everyone is great here, from Bill Murray to George Steele.One of my all time favs.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"You don't need to make great films, to be a great director ...","In the cinematic universe, among the shining stars, Bogart, Hepburn, Chaplin, Hitchcock, there is a mysterious wobbly flying saucer, hanging on a visible string pulled by a God-like Bela Lugosi. This IFO, it's not unidentified since it's pretty obvious this is a plate, is Edward D. Wood Jr., and ""Ed Wood"" one of the most surprisingly pleasant films of the last 20 years and probably, but that's my personal opinion, Tim Burton's masterpiece.The film works on the primary level of a well-directed biographical comedy. I expected some good laughs: I laughed. I expected to know more about the ""Worst Director of All-Time"": I can say now, that the film grabbed my curiosity enough to make me check about Ed Wood, and his legacy has no secret for me anymore. And I expected a dazzling black and white cinematography handled by Tim Burton's magic direction, and well, my eyes were pleased too. ""Ed Wood"" is a visual, self-reflexive, homage to the Golden Age of B-movies, where cinema was still a creative laboratory with no providential help from technology and 3D effects, a time when visual effects could be disastrous, or unintentionally hilarious.Now, what I didn't expect was how I would be moved by the story. ""Ed Wood"" is more than a comedy or a biopic, it's an inspirational tribute to the devotion one can have for his work. It's about loving what we do, and enjoying it so intensely that any sensation your passion procures is thrilling. This 'living one's passion' aspect, incarnated by Johnny Depp's childish expression and constantly sparkling eyes, drew a big smile on my face encouraging me to approach my life differently. But the more touching facet driving the movie is the heart-breaking friendship between Ed Wood and the horror icon Bela Lugosi, at the nadir of his career. It's a somewhat sad running gag that many people think Lugosi's dead, as to highlight how Ed Wood literally resurrected him. This friendship is the heart of the film.And both Wood's dedication to his work, his profound respect and admiration to Lugosi incarnate the simple, but so overlooked, idea that love is what drives our lives. Ed Wood did films, managed to get people motivated and convinced they were doing something good, because his passion was communicative. When his pals were complaining about the harshness of a critic, he reassures them like a good and gentle man, in fact, he never talks negatively except during these moments of doubt he shares with his girlfriend, like some flashes of realization that desert him as soon as he remembers his personal dream : to be the next Orson Welles. And this positive mindset is the rainbow lighting Lugosi's bitter heart after years of stormy lows and a painful drug-addiction. I was blown away by Landau's performance: Martin Landau was the legendary Dracula's player even in the most unnoticeable mimics, looks, and majestic explosions of anger when the taboo 'Karloff' word was mentioned ... one of the most powerful supporting performances of the 90's, well deserving its Oscar. And the story's sad undertones were the perfect balance with the movie's wackiness.And there's something particularly fascinating in the way Burton presents it. In fact we never laugh at Ed Wood and his crew, but at the situations. Wood's troop is so touching and funny that we'd love to share their mood. The family is getting bigger from Bela Lugosi and Bill Murray as the caustic Bunny Breckinridge, to the iconic wrestler Tor Johnson, the delicious Vampira, and the distinguished hoax Crimswell whose predictions are as priceless as worthless, not to mention the chiropractor who'll replace Bela Lugosi after his death, notably in ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" : Woody's ""pride and joy"", literally, ""The Godfather"" of bad movies. We have a charming gallery of colorful characters so 'cartoonesque' it's like reality plagiarized fiction. Burton didn't need to make films about films, Wood's life is strange enough, marked with nonsensical signs of weirdness from the beginning. God, he wears wigs, angora sweaters and panties, and deals with it in the most serious manner. Is he a homo? No, he just likes to wear that, no big deal.And again, this is the touching aspect of the film: it shows a gentle face of Ed Wood, a director whose famous career is mostly preceded by the prefix 'in'. But that's because the point is to insist on his nerve, his insistence and his passion. His personal idol was Orson Welles, who inspired him to be an actor, director and writer. He doesn't have the talent, but he's got the guts, and despite the adversity, he still made films with the same passion and sincerity. As Welles told him in a great scene ""Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?"" Wood fulfilled his dreams, his movies are cult, and his genius talent at making bad movies is a reference, when more talented directors sunk into oblivion. He loved the scenes as soon as they were shot, no retakes, when one scene could take a day, Ed Wood was making 20 or 30, due to the rush. This is less an alibi for Wood than a confirmation that he was born to make films. A very interesting scene is when the producer, watching the (in)famous ""Glen or Glenda"" takes it at a joke and then genuinely laughs at the ridiculousness of the film. So bad it's good ...And this is what ""Glen or Glenda"", ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" or any of Ed Wood's films are about, providing enjoyment, even unintentional. And if Wood managed to do that for many movie lovers after his death, that's enough. And it takes a certain genius to be an artist whose name is most remembered than his creations. And if he's remembered as the best from the worst, I guess it's probably more prestigious than being the worst of the best.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Tim Burton's best film may be his most subtle film,"Ed Wood, Tim Burton's biopic of the `worst film director ever' is a masterpiece.  Not only does it feature an amazing cast, headed by Johnny Depp (doing a dead-on impersonation of Wood), but it more importantly does not mock the filmmaker himself.  Burton obviously has a deep respect for Wood, because he is portrayed as what I personally have concluded him to be after much research about the man Â– an earnest filmmaker who would do whatever he needed to in order to have his films made.  No, he was not a technically proficient director, but he had more heart than a lot of directors who are much more commercially successful and reputable than he.Burton's stylish direction and gorgeous black and white cinematography perfectly compliment the subject matter.  Minor touches, from Elfman's Theremin-laced score to his end credits (`Filmed in Hollywood, U.S.A.' Â– something that Ed Wood added to every one of his pictures) make this film a true tribute to its subject.Having seen this film a minimum of 45-50 times, there is one scene in particular that is directed so beautifully by Burton that it bears mentioning.  After a particularly stressful day of filming, Wood suddenly stomps off the set and goes to a local bar.  What makes this scenario different from most is that he is also wearing an angora sweater, skirt, heels and a wig.  Wood then runs into his film idol, Orson Welles who proceeds to actually give him a pep talk and essentially say that in a basic sense, there are not that many differences between the two men.  This scene could have been humorous, getting a laugh at Wood's expense, but Burton makes it so touching that it affects me every time I see it.The supporting cast is nothing short of brilliant, especially Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge.  It was this film that really opened my eyes to what he could do, before he was awarded accolades for his roles in Rushmore and The Royal Tennenbaums.  But the real jaw-dropping character was the much-deserved Oscar winning performance by Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Barely recognizable under the makeup, he is both humorous and heartbreaking as the washed-up, heroin-addicted horror film icon that everyone assumes is already dead, or they mistake him for Boris Karloff.  His friendship with Wood is absolutely touching and very and sincerely portrayed.Ed Wood is by far my personal favorite among Burton's repertoire, which is relevant since I am a fan of most of his films.  It is a technical masterpiece and a masterfully told story of one of the most bizarre and earnest filmmakers of the last five decades.--Shelly",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Superb biopic,"Ed Wood is widely regarded as the maker of some of the worst movies of all time. Plan 9 From Outer Space is a frequent contender for THE Worst Movie of all Time.

My most accounts Wood was an eccentric character and who better to direct a movie on such a man than Tim Burton and who better to play him than Johnny Depp.The finished product is quite wonderful in its portrayal of Wood.

Burton's best film,"Ed Wood, however, is a brilliant idea for a biopic and it's a celebration of film making and a justification for it, even if the results are less than stellar. The subject of the film is a moderately eccentric man (played by Johnny Depp) who has attracted a cult following after his death by virtue of being considered the world's worst director. I know that's a hard title to place when you have guys like Michael Bay and Raja Gosnell still floating around along with countless film school graduates who have never even made it out of small-town film festivals. What separated Wood from the directors who spew out commercialized crap, however, was that Wood aspired to be Orson Welles and (in the film's portrayal of him, at least) he was so optimistic and upbeat about it that he thought he was well on his way to becoming him. That's what the film's about. It's that life isn't about success or failure but rather by creativity and how much you love what you do. Wood is portrayed as a winner because he dared to direct films and there's no better way to celebrate film-making than finding merit in the worst filmmaker.I think it was also interesting that with the exception of his first girlfriend, Wood had a creative team (i.e. Bill Murray's character, the wrestler) that followed him through all of his creative pursuits and acted as a quasi-support system. If this story weren't based on fact, I would be left to wonder why these people would keep working with him despite the fact that he failed so often and I think that's another way that the film highlights Wood's optimism. Perhaps, this is a parallel to Orson Welles' consistent use of the same people and his famous repertory company called ""The Mercury Players. Of course, Wood's relationship is closest to Boris Karloff, his idol as a kid, who he later befriended and had the privilege of directing him in film after film. The relationship between the two and the chemistry between Depp and Martin Landau is at the heart of the film. Landau, by the way, is stellar and very deserving of his award.As for the question of what separated Wood from the many people who never made it far past film school, there was surprisingly little. Wood's films were mostly independently produced and he was largely an unknown commodity when he died. He gained fame when his film ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"" won a book-sponsored contest in 1981 of the worst films of all time. It's a film that was shown in the first week of my first film class and it's high number of inconsistencies and bloopers are very easy to spot. The movie answered questions for anyone whose watched this film about why it was made so haphazardly: Apparently, it was simply made as a way for Wood to appease his landlord and Burton's film has this great sense of dramatic irony as Jonny Depp's character says, ""I know this is the film I'll be remembered for,"" but not in the way he wanted.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fun Flick about the king of campy classic C movies,"How do you make a good movie about a guy who specialized in making bad movies or better yet why would you want to make a movie about Ed Wood? Well, Tim Burton wanted to and he ended up with an Oscar winning film shot in black and white. Based on the book Nightmare of Ectasy by Rudolf Grey it's the cult-like story of the odd and eccentric 1950's movie maker Ed Wood who's forgettable films became unforgettable for how bad and cheaply made they were and were rediscovered by later generations as campy cult classics. Director Burton assembled a fine cast here in Johnny Depp as Wood, Martin Landau in his Academy Award wi8nning role as Bella Lagosi, Sara Jessica Parker, Patrcia Arquette and Bill Murray. Landau in his Best Supporting Actor beat out some fine performances by Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction, Gary Sinese in Forrest Gump, Chazz Palnteri in Bullets over Broadway and Paul Scofield in Quiz Show. The film's other Oscar went for Best Makeup. Stefan Czapsky, who worked with Burton on Edward Sissorhands does a great job of cinematography here and Tom Duffield who also worked with Burton on Scissorhands and Beetlejuice is the Art Director for which he should have been nominated for an Oscar. Another veteran of Burton films Chris Lebezon who worked on Batman Returns is the film's editor. This film has some great humor and is a little slow with not that much of a compelling plot to work with but it is a fascinating watch. I've seen a couple of Ed Wood's movies myself and Buron really did his homework in recreating the world of Ed Wood and great casting too. I would give it an 8.0 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Is going to became one of my favorites,"I don't know anything about Bela Lugosi and Ed Wood before i saw this movie. I have seen that many people are angered because the truth was little i this movie. Well i don't know is that for a fact but i don't care, it was an incredible movie i was fascinated and watched it two times in a row. I am kind of disappointed that it had end in such way and that's why i give it 9.But everything in this movie was almost perfect. Of cource Johny and Martin Lanadau are incredible. I'm sure though that i will never watch the films of the real Ed Wood. He doesn't know what he is doing at all. Overral is a great movie and i loved it. It has everything.

Ed Wood the worst? Think again.,"Ed Wood was not the worst director by far, or the weirdest. He saw action as a marine in Tarawa, the most savage battle of WW2 for all you D-DAY afficianodos, doing something that had not been done since 1066: taking a technologically equal stronghold that knew the enemy was coming, fortified it, and still had it taken from them by amphibious assault and landing. Marines paid dearly with their lives to teach the American military valuable lessons in amphibious warfare. And. Ed. Wood was there, doing what draft dodger John Wayne should have been doing. And Wood was no Kazan or Bogart about his personal life. He'd gladly tell anybody anything he knew about his private life, unlike j Edgar or nearly anyone in Hollywood, including Spencer Tracy, K Hepburn, Walter Pigeon, or Greer Carson (she dug young men and more power to her), and was closer in spirit to Errol Flynn and Robert Mitchum and Don Rickles and Lenny Bruce, none of whom gave a rat's ass what anyone thought of them.And as a director ""bad"" should be redefined to include competent hacks like r.g. Springsteen and Richard Bare and Richard Donner and William Wyler and DeMille and Spielberg and Lucas, the latter two elevating competent hackery to an aspirational level - movies made by a committee of bean counters. And then we come to the REALLY bad directors, DW Griffith, Leni Riefenstahl, Victor Fleming, and William Wyler, the first two making extremely well done Klan Nazi movies (Birth Of A Nation & Triumph of the Will and Olympiad, while the latter two made pro-slavery movies like Jezebel, Gone With The Wind, and Ben-Hur...yes, Ben-Hur owned slaves). THAT should be our criterion: what are these competent hacks selling? What studios are pushing their films? Do these directors care about what they're making? Or is it just another paycheck to them? Regardless it's competence in service to evil, to white supremacy, to fascism. If I remember right, didn't we fight a war against this crap?Ex Wood: his heart was in the right place.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Delightful and hilarious comedy,"After being entertained by Plan 9 From Outer Space, I was pretty excited to check this out. I found the copy we own and put it in the tape player. I can say only one thing: I absolutely love this movie!!!!! I had so much fun watching it. I even clapped when it was over! Tim Burton's charming, witty, and flawless comedy is a major contender for the most unique movie of all time. Other than that it's entertaining from beginning to end. Johnny Depp captures the hilarity and ineptitude of Edward D. Wood Jr., a name synonymous with many people and one of the first thoughts that will come to mind when the term ""bad movie"" is brought up. Depp will crack you up as he takes you through the many ups and not too distant downs of Wood's career. Watching this movie has left me under the impression that Depp is a fabulous actor (which I'm sure he is), and I really want to check out more of his movies. In fact, Depp's portrayal was so great, it's one of the best performances I have ever seen.The movie begins with Wood attending his own play at an old shack on a rainy night, and the audience members are either asleep or talking with one another. Despite being slated in the papers, Wood still focuses on the rare positive comments such as `The soldiers' clothes looked realistic' rather than face the fact that his production stunk. Later that night, Wood tells his wife about his worries of making it in Hollywood, and she assures him that things will get better. After being rejected for the directing job of `I Changed My Sex', Wood meets Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), who is now old, washed up, and out of a job. Plus, very few people know he's still alive. But Wood is thrilled and wants to cast him in a movie. Ed convinces the creator of `I Changed My Sex' to let him direct it and gets the job. He writes the script, changing the title to `Glen or Glenda'. It is after his wife's reading of the script that she finds Wood in female clothing, revealing his passion for wearing it. `Glen or Glenda' proves to be so bad that it only premieres in Alabama, Missouri, and Indiana. He later slews together several misfits such as wrestler Tor Johnson (George Steele), future-predicting Criswell (Jeffrey Jones), and Lugosi for his next movie called `Bride of The Atom', which is renamed `Bride of The Monster'. Despite being kicked out of the perfect studio for not paying, he still goes on without any doubt. He gets the owner of a meat butchering company to pay for the film after two unsuccessful donation parties. And for the exciting climax, he has Bela Lugosi fight a giant rubber octopus. At the premiere, the cast is pelted with concessions and garbage, and they make it out just in time to catch a taxi, missing the entire movie. Later on, Ed learns that Lugosi, who had admitted earlier that he was addicted to drugs, has just died. He is heartbroken, and as a tribute, his movie, `Grave Robbers From Outer Space', is billed as the final film of Bela Lugosi. Since Wood is in a tight spot financially, he seals a deal with his apartment landlord to help him make the film. His associates provide ideas that he doesn't like, making him disgruntled. But when he gets an inspirational speech from his lifelong hero Orson Welles (Vincent D'Onofrio), he is once again motivated to finish the movie, renamed `Plan 9 From Outer Space'. After finishing the film, Wood claims that it will be the film that they remember him by. And he receives a standing ovation at the premiere.This is a one-of-a-kind film. What's so funny about the ending is that it takes the common `character gets discouraged, character gets inspirational speech and advice, character gets back in and wins' element and adds a funny and different kind of twist to it. The same can be said about the story in general, which tells the story of one of the worst directors of all time rather than show you the times of a successful figure. It's hard to pick the best scene, but I especially loved when the three men were previewing Glen or Glenda (`Pull the string! Pull the string!'). I also liked the scene where the guy couldn't tell the difference between the red and green dresses that Loretta King had to pick since he was colorblind, which is funny since the entire film is in black and white. The performances of Wood's common associates and cast members are inspiring and fun to watch, and I also have to give plenty of credit to Juliet Landau for being really hot. All of the famous moments of his career are captured perfectly, and there's even a touching subplot that shows how much Wood loved Lugosi. Landau definitely deserved the Academy Award he received, for he too does a great job playing his part. He even delivered some of the movie's best lines. Bill Murray also has a fun to watch performance during the show. 	 Even if you're not into Ed Wood's movies or his career, you'll still be greatly entertained by Burton's out-of-this-world movie. A big recommendation, especially if you need a different kind of movie to crack you up. So sit back and enjoy, because you won't see another movie like this for a long, long time.***** out of *****",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
'A' masterpiece of 'B' genius,"In the hands of Tim Burton the story of Edward D. Wood Jr Â– widely hailed as the worst filmmaker of all time Â– becomes a magnificently bizarre comic-tragic tale of a unique Â‘artist' and his struggle to make incredibly bad movies. Set during the Halcyon days of Â‘B' movies in the 1950's, Â‘Ed Wood' examines in great sympathetic detail the life, loves, film directing and cross-dressing habits of a man who has symbolised everything that is bad about motion pictures. Wood was a native of small town America who came to Hollywood to achieve fame and stardom just like so many others, and in the process he achieved just that but for all the wrong reasons. Artistically inept in every way, each of his theatrical and cinematic features was always greeted with groans of horror and disbelief on the part of critics and producers alike. Yet with this film the tragedy of Wood's abysmal work was introduced to another generation of moviegoers who were prepared to fondly recognise the eponymous hero as the King of bad movies Â– a title he truly deserves.Depp in the role of Wood provides another characteristically quirky performance, brimming with exuberance, passion and a little self deprecating irony. Burton's film Â– beautifully shot in black and white Â– paints a loving portrait of the artist as a young battler, determined to realise his vision in its entirety and yet completely oblivious to the fact that he just had no ability whatsoever. A film that could so easily have been a cruel parody about a talentless no-hoper has under the masterful and subtle direction of Hollywood's later day Ed Wood become a wistful homage to a man with a vision that no one wanted to see.Central to this movie is Wood's friendship with the ailing washed up Bela Lugosi Â– a major motion picture star who achieved international fame as the lead in the 1931 version of Â‘Dracula' and then gradually plummeted into obscurity and drug addiction. Lugosi stared in many of Wood's most famous films including Â‘Night of the Ghoul', the unforgettable Â‘Glen or Glenda' and the one widely regarded as the worst ever committed to celluloid, Â‘Plan 9 from Outer Space'. Martin Landau both looks and sounds like the downtrodden movie star who is desperately trying to recapture glimpses of his former glory, and deservedly won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for the role. Ed Wood's reverential treatment and acceptance of the man everyone else forgot is the touching heartbeat of the film that sketches its characters as so inherently likeable despite being outcasts of society.With its inspired casting and evenly paced direction that blends a mixture of horror, comedy and tragedy, Â‘Ed Wood' is perhaps the finest film in Burton's distinguished yet highly unusual career. In some respects it works well as a later day Â‘Sunset Boulevard', a damning indictment of Hollywood's shunning of the little guy and burying the stars that have lost their appeal, yet on the other hand it is reverential biopic of a man who followed his dreams and visions as diligently as his mentor Orson Welles Â– although without the same degree of success. The principle strength of the film lies in the outstanding performances of Depp and Landau, with a supporting cast including Sarah Jessica Parker as his demented girlfriend, Patricia Arquette as his one true love, and Bill Murray as camp would be transsexual providing excellent support.Wood may well have been the worst film maker of all time, yet as Tim Burton himself said `It takes talent to make a really good movie, but it also takes talent to make a really bad movie.' Wood never compromised what little artistic integrity he had, and in the process he has given us some rare atrocious gems to savour. These in turn have provided Burton with enough material to make a Grade Â‘A' film that celebrates the life of Wood and shows him as a man with a vision who was prepared to realise it at any cost. Finally we get to see that vision as it was originally intended. Quite simply this film is a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A good combination of drama, comedy and the charisma of Johnny Depp","Good production, good script, good performances, eccentric score by the composer Howard Shore, good costumes, among other things, this film portrays well the cinematographic beginnings of Ed Wood in his goal to achieve fame and that it took him a long time to gain it after his death . My rating for this film is a 10 and the good thing about learning about this director's life is that he teaches us an important lesson, which is if you make films that are pelted by critics or the public, never pay attention to them. After all, movies that are rubbish today are going to be treasures for future generations tomorrow.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing movie about something so mediocre.,"One of Tim Burton's best movies, if not the best.The movie can almost be considered a documentary, since it is showing aspects of the life of director/producer/actor/writer Edward Wood Jr in a believable and authentic way. Maybe a better term would be ""reenactment"".Ed Wood is famous, or rather infamous, for directing some of the worst movies in history.Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood. I would venture to say to perfection, however, I did not know or have ever met Ed Wood. All I can say is if I imagined meeting Ed Wood he would have Johnny's characterizations. I can say the same thing about Martin Landau, who plays an old, morphine addicted Bela Lugosi. They are both amazing and have an obvious screen chemistry that is intoxicating. You just want to keep watching Bela and Ed interacting.The movie is filmed in black and white. I think this is important to portraying Ed Wood since his most famous(in) movies are in black and white. For those that have never seen an Ed Wood movie, Tim Burton's homage/reenactment story gives the viewer an insight into the man. For those of us that have experienced Ed Wood, it is quite enjoyable to see scenes recreated shot for shot with different actors, yet maintaining the same campiness.The movie, for the most part, is a humorous look at Ed Wood. There is more however. There are instances where one genuinely feels for Ed Wood, where you share his pain and anguish. There are moments when we are captivated by the sheer positivity and will of Ed Wood. In the end, this movie is enjoyable as a comedy and as a positive look at one of the most criticized and least successful directors. I highly recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Just a man, and his love for movie-making","As a B-movie lover, I was attracted to Plan 9 from Outer Space because of it being called the worst movie of all time, and Ed Wood as the worst director of all time. If I remember correctly.This approach to Ed Wood was wrong, apparently. This movie sure made me reconsider a lot of things about the man and his artistic vision.Surely enough - he was a pretty incompetent director. His movies are proof of that. Yet - once I watched Glen or Glenda, I began wondering whether I had misjudged the man and his output. Mainly because the love for his craft was perfectly obvious, in spite of all of his technical mistakes.Leave it to Tim Burton to tell the story about a misfit, surrounded by misfits, who is trying to make a sense of a world that can't understand him at all. Burton's love for movie-making is reflected on Ed Wood's love for movie-making - and it results in an extremely uplifting movie, which makes anyone reconsider their previous stance on Wood. No longer is he the laughingstock of Hollywood - he is, thanks to Johnny Depp, a real human being, with real feelings, fighting for a chance to make his dreams come true.I never saw Ed Wood the same way after this movie - now, whenever I watch Plan 9 or Glen or Glenda I enjoy it in a different way. No longer do I believe they are the worst movies ever made; far from it. I'm willing to believe many other Hollywood ""blockbusters"" hold this distinction, if only because the people who made them lost their respect and love for the movie-making art.Thanks, Mr. Burton, for setting the record straight.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A ""10"" the first time","I remember when I first saw ""Plan Nine from Outer Space,"" when I was a kid. My best buddy and I had our baseball game rained-out, so we went to the matinÃ©e at our local theater in our suburb. We knew nothing of the film or Ed Wood, so we assumed it would be a ""B"" matinÃ©e flick (at that age we didn't really know or use that designation, but we knew what these kinds of movies, shown on Saturday afternoons, were). We also understood that the quality of work - acting, camera shots, and even story line, would not be the equivalent of the first-run films in the major theaters, or which could be viewed later at this same theater during nighttime presentations. However, we didn't feel cheated by this film. Even in our adolescent way, we enjoyed its bizarre characters, dialogue, acting, scenery - appreciating in amateurishness and the fact that it was so awful it was funny and enjoyable. That film, and Wood's others, are in the category that for quality you would rate them a ""1"" on the proverbial ""1 - to - 10 ""dial"" -- then decide to move it one notch farther to a ""10,"" in recognition that in its awfulness it was so fascinating and funny it actually provided a thoroughly-enjoyable experience. This biopic captures this essence of what the untalented, yet also undaunted, Ed Wood was all about. Johnny Depp is one of the outstanding talents today, and this talent is displayed here. Martin Landau certainly deserved the acclaim for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi. All the supporting cast, without exception, were also outstanding. Finally, the depiction of this movie genre, and the feel for the mid-1950's Hollywood, are superb. Give this one a ""10"" on the dial the first time.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tim Burton at his BEST,"I'd always wanted to see this movie, but I'm kind of a cheapskate and I always wait for movies to be on cable. Well, they just showed it and I felt compelled to write this review because of how good it was. The movie is of course about who's considered yo be the worst director of all time: Ed Wood. And believe me, the guy sucked . They showed his movie ""Glen or Glenda"" the other day and I started watching, but after 15 minutes I changed the channel.Right off the bat you must be thinking: ""Why would anyone make a movie about this guy, and why would anyone wanna see it? The answer is that Tim Burton made this film, and the guy has made an art of making good, enjoyable films about weird subjects.The genius of Tim Burton is that he can take something, or someone, ugly or unattractive, and shift your perspective, so that you can appreciate that very same thing from another angle and say: ""I'd never looked at it that way, it's not so bad after all"" When I finished watching this movie I thought: ""Well this guy was really a big loooser. He was a fool with not an iota of talent in his whole body, BUT at least he was passionate about what he was doing, and he refused to quit his dreams at the first sign of trouble"" Tha's more than you can say for many people out thereThis is NOT to say that he idealizes Ed Wood throughout the movie, or that this is just a silly comedy about a dumb guy. This is Burton's labor of love. You can see how much he cares about the Ed Wood character. You might even say that he ALMOST looks up to the guy. But at the same time, he makes sure not to make the movie sappy or cartoonish, which is what a less skilled director might have done. Critics talk about ""restrained performances"" I'd say this is an example of ""restrained directing""The movie is perfectly casted, down to the smallest roles. Johnny Depp, who has also made an art of playing far-out characters and making them very watchable and endearing, is almost flawless as Ed Wood. Martin Landau s also good as Bela Lugosi. Probably scenery-chewing a couple of times in the movie, but still a good enough performance to win an Oscar. I also liked the chemistry (and the whole mentor-father thing) he had with Depp. There's also Sarah Jessica Parker as Woods first wife, Sarah Jessica Parker as his second wife, Bill Murray as a close friend. and a bunch of other actors who did terrific work.I also liked the fact hat the movie doesn't dwell on any of the heavy stuff of Ed Wood's life, like the fact that he was a cross dresser (when asked why he does that, he just replies: ""makes me feel good""). By the way, I believe that one of the reasons many people did not go see this movie was because of the TV promos, which showed Jonnhy Depp in a dress. I bet folks saw this and thought: ""Oh darn, this is a movie about a transveti or something"" Having said that, this is not a movie I'd take children to. There's no sex, but I just don't think kids would enjoy this movie.To sum up, I'd say this is probably Tim Burton's best movie to date. And if you know anything about director's, you know that's saying a lot.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Shouldn't have passed on it for so long,"I finally finished the movie Ed Wood after it sat sadly in its Netflix sleeve for over a week on my dresser. I don't know what my hesitation was, but after three attempted viewing sessions I finally got to it. I think initially it was the fact that it was a movie made in 1994. I have been finding movies made in the 90's and especially early 90's to have a trait about them that I find very cheesy. It may be the score, the transitional shotsÂ…I'm not sure. A good example, although it is from one of my favorite movies, is when at the end of ""A Few Good Men"" a big cursive ""The End"" is written across the screenÂ…lame! Anyways, Ed Wood is also shot in Black and White which initially doesn't either delight my eye or excite me. This movie on the other hand, as a whole, did those things very quickly! I thought Johnny Depp's portrayal of Ed Wood was very engaging. I didn't know anything about Ed Wood but whether he was as unique as a character in life as Depps portrayal or not, his life certainly made for a great bio pic. Everything is bizarre and I believe that Ed Wood would love this movie. As I watched with my computer by my side, I would pause to learn a little about the real life movie makers. It's interesting that Ed Wood never really reached critical fame with any mainstream movies of success. I guess the way that he made movies didn't lend to that kind of stardom.The question is then, why do we know about him? Why was this movie made? Why do we care? The answer is that he was so passionate, entertaining and peculiar once people did find out about him, that I'm sure they wanted to know more and more and talk about him and his story to everyone.The other performance in the movie that can't go unmentioned is the Martin Landau's performance of Bela Lugosi. Lugosi is the actor of Count Dracula fame that according to this movie met Ed Wood in a random occurrence and acted as Wood's leading man in many films until his death. I found his performance in relation to his drug abuse most entertaining.I definitely recommend this move to watch and learn about an old obscure filmmaker.If you rent the DVD I would recommend watching the bonus features as well, there is a really cool little section about the Theremin instrument! It's the one that makes all of the cool horror sounds and is controlled or played by the movement of your hands! Medium Popcorn with Butter!

"a touching, hilarious romp through the weirdness of Hollywood film-making","The late Edward D. Wood, Jr. is (in)famous as one of the worst directors in film history. His repertoire includes  Glen or Glenda, his paean for understanding for transvestites; Bride of the Monster, a mad scientist attempts to creates a race of supermen to take over the world; and his magnum opus, Plan 9 From Outer Space, wherein effete grave robbers from space invade Earth. Ed Wood was the Eddie the Eagle of Hollywood--he loved making movies, but didn't have an ounce of talent in his body. Tim Burton directs this loving portrait of the ups (such as they were) and downs of the career of Ed Wood. I loved this movie. I'd loved every frame of this movie. Photographed in glorious black and white, the movie looks absolutely exquisite and gorgeous. (Do not let Ted Turner in the same room as this movie!) The cast is marvellous. Johnny Depp brings out Wood's eternal optimism without playing him for a moronic simpleton who likes wearing his wife's clothes (""You think it's the worst film ever made? Well, my next one will be even better!"" -- ""Yes, I like sex with girls. Wearing their clothes just makes me feel closer to them.""), and Martin Landau is spellbinding as the tragic Bela Lugosi, the nearly forgotten star who befriends Wood and acts (if one can use that word) in Wood's movies, while his drug abused body is quickly failing him. The supporting cast is stellar, too, particularly Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge, Wood's friend and occasional co-star. It would have been very easy for Burton and company to play Wood as a no-talent idiot. Wood was not an idiot. Indeed, one gets the impression that Wood would have excelled at the ""deal-making"" aspect of Hollywood (just don't let him near the camera). Instead, Burton gives us a touching, hilarious romp through the weirdness of Hollywood film-making, delivering a loving homage to 50s B-movies, and an uplifting tribute to the human spirit. The final irony of all this is that the movie's moral is not to compromise your artistic vision, which, to his credit, is one thing Ed Wood did not do. He fought hard to bring to the screen what he thought were glorious masterpieces, and his vision, as faulty as it was, must have some enduring, and endearing, quality to it, because, here we are, forty years later, still discussing, dissecting, and, yes, even enjoying the films of Ed Wood.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The second best film of 1994, but still one of the best of the 90's","Highly enjoyable and very amusing biopic of the ""worst director of all-time"", Edward D. Wood Jr.  He made the'classics' ""Glen or Glenda"", one man's struggle to cope with his transvestite tendencies, and his masterpiece, the supernatural thriller ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"".  Of course, the film glosses over some of the more unpleasant aspects of Wood's life and takes some creative licence but the finished result is fantastic. Johnny Depp gives a career best performance as the charismatic Wood, making the character very believable and endearing, this being one of the reasons the film works so well.  A great deal of praise must surely be given to Oscar-winner Martin Landau, who plays the frail Bela Lugosi with great aplomb; the likeness is quite uncanny.  There is also able support from the likes of Sarah Jessica Parker, Patricia Arquette, George ""The Animal"" Steele, Mike Starr and the brilliant Bill Murray in one of his best roles, as the effeminate Bunny Breckinridge.There isn't really much of a plot (who needs one when you're having so much fun?), the film focuses on the Ed's dream of being the next Orson Welles (""He was twenty-six when he made Citizen Kane - and I'm already thirty!""), and there is a truly memorable scene in which he meets his hero, probably my favourite scene in the film, in fact.I can't praise the film enough, one of the most enjoyable films ever made, and this is still director Tim Burton's second best film, behind the outstanding ""Edward Scissorhands"", which also starred Johnny Depp in the title role.  Bettered in 1994 only by ""The Shawshank Redemption"", I heartily recommend this film to anyone and everyone.  Sheer brilliance.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Bizarre, hilarious look at the worst director of all time","An absolutely hilarious take on Hollywood of the '50s and the worst director of all-time. Though not for all tastes, this is a brilliant look at the life of the titular character, and his crazy antics, strange friends, and terrible movies. Filmed in black and white to recapture the look of films of that era, it successfully recreates the making of three of Ed Wood's bad movies, and the stories behind them, which seem almost too weird to be true. But truth is stranger than fiction, and the movie barely has to fictionalize anything to be interesting and entertaining. Truly bizarre and wildly unique, but still brilliant.Johnny Depp is at his most insane here, combining a weird voice and deadly seriousness to make the character that much more effective. His performance is the centrepoint of the movie's bizarreness, and is quietly one of Depp's best. Martin Landau as the aged Bela Lugosi is nothing short of brilliant, whether it be a perfectly-recreated Hungarian accent spewing out profanity-laced barbs at Boris Karloff, or a depressing cry for help from his morphine addiction. Landau truly earned his Oscar for this one. Tim Burton directs what is perhaps his most visually stunted film, as he is restricted to California of the '50s, but he still manages to make it memorable and creative. The score (done not by Burton's usual collaborator, Danny Elfman, but Howard Shore) is fantastically strange - just like everything else in this film - and the supporting cast is as hilariously brilliant as the rest of the movie. A definite winner.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
In Glorious Black & White,"For those among us who remember when about half the movies that came out were in black and white, and nearly all of television, and who look back fondly on those days, Ed Wood is, if nothing else, a feast for the eyes. It is a gorgeously photographed film and I loved every second of it for the cinematography alone. Its subject, Ed Wood, was and to a large extent still is a marginal figure in film history. He was a man in love with the movies who wanted to be a great film-maker. Most of his career was spent, sadly, making low-budget pictures, and he apparently never had much talent to begin with. What he did have was enthusiasm, and the movie of his life is (charitably) about this great passion he had for films rather than about his talent. Ed had his problems, which included among other things, a fondness for dressing up in women's clothes. He spent his professional life, such as it was, on the lunatic fringe (literally) of Hollywood, and it is this marginal, if you will crepuscular world, that director Tim Burton lovingly recreates in his film. One of the things I like most about this movie is Burton's total immersion in this world of genuinely eccentric people. Now there's eccentric and eccentric. Purple hair and body-piercing are not, strictly speaking, eccentric, at least not anymore. These Ed Wood characters are eccentric from within. They don't need funny costumes, though most of them do tend to dress oddly, but they needn't have bothered. This bunch would be weird in three-piece suits. Bela Lugosi also figures in the story (natch), and the scenes with him I found sad rather than funny. As Lugosi Martin Landau is extraordinarily good. At its core Ed Wood is a valentine for the world of the might-have-beens and wannabes of the Hollywood's demi-monde. I should add performers here; all the actors are excellent, not good, excellent. Johnny Depp captures what I imagine was Ed Wood's warmth and naivetÃ© to absolute perfection. Jeffrey Jones is a droll riot as Criswell, and he really should be used more often than he is. I also liked Bill Murray's turn as Bunny Breckinridge. As a tribute to the low-budgeters of Hollywood's Poverty Row, Ed Wood could scarcely be better. The irony of all this is that in celebrating the life of a hack director Tim Burton has shown himself to be anything but.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
I like the best of Tim Burton,"It's a lovely film that is the best one I like the best of Tim Burton and for so many things to love about it. Martin Landau is excellent where he plays of Bela Lugosi and it is such a really good way of showing the later days, which are clearly not the best ones, but it is a fair way that gives an idea of how it really was difficult but he had one of the good old days. I forget about Bill Murray and just how good he was and funny. I admit that Burton has a really exceptional way of treating Edward D Wood Jr. He had made so many films but not too many people liked then except only for them to had a laugh. Burton and of course the splendid acting effort as Johnny Depp gives Ed Wood a wonderful way of showing of his love of film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A good film that changed on second viewing,"The first time I saw this film a few years back I was totally drawn in by the way that Depp played the single-minded and passionate Wood, by Landau's remarkable performance as Lugosi and by a host of other exceptional portrayals of very unusual characters. I watched it again last night and I began to feel a little uncomfortable.Landau was, of course still brilliant and most of the minor characters still came across as simultaneously believable and unbelievable. But the Wood character seemed colder, where once I saw passion I now began to see ruthlessness, where once there was single-mindedness now there was neglect of responsibility to his cast/friends. I'm not totally sure which Wood I was supposed to beleive - I liked the first one better.This change in my perception of the lead role suddenly made the film seem overlong (actually at 2 hours plus it IS overlong), made Depp's acting seem a little less convincing and made the whole a less enjoyable (if still engrossing) story.If you haven't seen it I suggest you do, if you have seen it you might find that things have changed when you watch it again. Still a seven (but I suspect that's likely to change on a third viewing).",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The worst director in one of the best movies?,"'Ed Wood' is a truly brilliant movie.  Charting the life of unbelievably talentless director Edward D.

Truly amazing!,"I am getting this movie for Christmas and I am so excited.  This film is just gorgeous and you are either laughing or crying all the way through. In particular Ed's relationship with Bela is very touching.  The first time I saw it was when my brother and some of our friends and I had a passion for making extraordinarily bad horror films using an extremely old camcorder and alot of ketchup and girls called Cassandra and guys called Bradley.  This movie inspired us to make ""House of the Damned"" and after each scene was finished we would all utter the immortal phrase ""Perfect, lets move on!""",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Eddie take a bow,"I think this movie is great. It deserved best picture, best score, best cinematography, best actor and supporting actor. My favorite actor in this movie is Johnny Depp. He is great as Ed and becomes a totally different person in the process. I'm surprised he actually has a movie  that I can say is great. I usually don't like Depp movies. Burton? Well, forget Burton. I'm not ready to start praising Burton for this film when the rest of the crew is fine without. It's a good thing this film wasn't like a Burton film because I would have hated. Ok, some people say Ed Wood is weird, but at least it isn't Burton weird.The only problem with this movie for me is that it goes by too fast. In the very end when the song This IS the One comes on I can't help but shed a tear. Those beginning shots and ending shots of Hollywood are  phenomenal. This movie got me to admire Edward D. Wood Jr. I had already seen Plan 9 because of my admiration for Bela Lugosi. When I  was little I found out about this movie. I thought it was about Bela Lugosi. I had no idea who Ed Wood was, but to my surprise he was the director of that great movie Plan 9 from Outer Space. Not to mention his other greats. This movie shows how Ed wasn't screwing around he was doing what he loved. I think people that labeled him worst director of all time are ignorant people. As for the others that say how bad a film maker he is. They are ignorant too. I hope where ever Ed Wood is he can see how some people like myself admire him. Like Criswell said in the premiere scene, Eddie take a bow. 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Cast, Director, Lead and subject matter melded together beautifully.","An exceptional cast, making an exceptional film, with Johnny Depp giving what I think is one of his best performances. He captures perfectly the boundless enthusiasm that Wood must have had, his complete naivety regarding his own utter ineptitude. I'm completely at a loss as to why he didn't get the Oscar for this. Tim Burton's ability to mesh this cast of complete one-off's is blissful too. Bill Murray, Vincent D'Onofrio, Martin Landau, S-J Parker, Jeffrey Jones all capably of carrying the camera away with them, but Burton achieves balance and cohesion effortlessly. And it's so generous and affectionate. They are all saying, there but for the Grace of God, (and some talent) go I. It's a tribute to every passionate movie-maker and inhabitant - it says we are equal in our shared devotion to this deity, good, bad, indifferent, sublime, we all know each other and recognise each other as compatriots of this celluloid land.

A great an enjoyable Tim Burton film,"Ed Wood is a funny and interesting movie. Johnny Depp who played Edward D. Wood Jr. was miraculously funny with that smile on his face all the time and when he always put that pink sweater on to not feel stressed out. When they were playing his movies, it always made me laugh of how bad they were. Martin Landua had by far the best performance yet as Bela Lugosi who was one of the most famous actors at that time at being in Ed Wood's films, brought his famousness considerably down. He had very funny lines like when he was grumpy and all. Or when he was in ""Glen or Glenda"" doing that scary speech. That was so funny instead of scary.

"Tribute to a legend, or not","Pros: Cinematography, script, characters, humor.Cons: Not entirely accurate.Ed Wood is Tim Burton's tribute to the worst director of all time. This is probably Burton's most personal and best film. The film stars Johnny Depp as Ed wood, a cross dressing director whose hero is Orson Welles. Martin Landau plays Bela Lugosi, who befriends Wood in his last years. Most of the exploits are true but I am not sure that's the way Ed Wood acted. The script is spot on and never falters under its own silliness. The cinematography of black and white gives an authentic feel to the movie as that was the way the real wood filmed his films. Most of the characters the real Ed wood hung around in real life are all present here. Initially a box-office failure, Ed wood is often very funny and a delight to watch. It shows Tim Burton at his best.Premise: Ed wood tries to make Plan 9 from outer space.Ed wood won two Academy awards.

amazing,"i had doubts about watching this the first time. just the cover of the movie made me avoid it for some time. i mean, why would i really want to watch a biographical story of ""the worst filmmaker of all time?"" obviously i learned my lesson never to judge a book (or movie) by its cover.for about 2 years i went to my favorite video store 2 times a week. it seemed as if i had seen every comedy movie in the history of movies. except for one johnny depp movie that stared me right in the face for the longest time. i kept thinking ""next time I'm gonna rent ed wood"" but then 'next time' came, then i thought ""next time"" and so on. finally i watched it, and it was one of those masterpieces that you cant get over. I'm glad i spent 2 hours of my day watching it. it was well worth it.johnny depp never fails to amaze me. in fact, i think he gets better in each movie. this one not only did he do a good job, but he looked awesome. boy, that hair and his face--it just made me happy to watch him as much as the movie.i, and like many other people, had never ever heard of ed wood. I'm guessing since how many people liked this film, its accurate. correct me if I'm wrong, but i don't think I'm ever gonna watch an ed wood film until the day i die.i recommend this film to everyone. i don't even think it should be rated R. I've seen a lot of pg-13 movies with just as many cuss words as this. if you don't like it the first time you watch it, try watching it a second time. even a third. i like it more every time i watch it. definitely a 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A truly loving take on unwavering optimism and determination,"Ed Wood is a figure that stands out in the polished cinema-landscape of the 50s. He is strange and unapologetically so, moving past criticism with ease. This film captured the determination and quirkiness of his figure so well. Johnny Depp was absolutely perfect in the role with his softness and almost blind-devotion to Bela Lugosi who is played by the late Martin Landau. Landau's performance captures a gritty, depressing reality of the washed-up movie star and also serves as a sort of future perspective for Wood. People who are familiar with him and the course of his life will know about his own washed-upness and addictive tendencies. The film purposefully does not capture the entire course of Ed Wood's life in order to really catch the spirit of the wildly creative yet untalented young director. Furthermore the film is beautifully shot and every shot is so rich and well composed that only watching it for merely its form, with no knowledge or special interest for Ed Wood and the plot, is still pleasurable. All-in-all a great film that is ultimately about the artist's struggle in Hollywood and the confrontations that will hit the outcast weirdo in such a landscape in the face.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A classic bio-pic of a fascinating and strange man.,"Johnny Depp is one of the best actors around today. What I particularly enjoyed was Depp's delivery and projection throughout the film; that kind of 1950's Mickey Mouse ""HIYA, OH GEE, HOW YA DOIN, THATS GREAT"" kind of mentality. ""Its Perfect"". Martin Landau became Bella Lugosi. There are so many great performances in this. Bill Murray's Queen, George the Animal Steel's Brute, etc. etc. There are those bad movies that everyone loves to watch just to laugh at. Ed Wood made those movies, and this is a movie about him making those movies, which in a sense has that same affect of camp, but at the same time, casts a feeling of pity for those involved.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ed Wood...,"It is hard to believe that a man so obviously short of talent could have such a big influence over people who have such an abundance of it, but this biopic goes a long way to explain how. First, however, one must understand that this film was not intended to be a literal account of this period in Ed Wood's life. It is easy to mistake it as such after Jeffrey Jones delivers his Criswellian monlogue, but it isn't. Tim Burton appears to have more intended to make a film to celebrate the life of one of Hollywood's most creative failures.The film covers the shooting of three of Wood's best-known films. In the order they appear in the film, these are Glen Or Glenda, Bride Of The Monster, and of course the infamous Plan 9 From Outer Space. The telling how all these titles were changed, and why, from those that Ed originally gave them, is hilarious in itself. Between the shooting of each film, we also get to see representations of how Ed found ""talent"" and financing to make these films. During these sequences, the film becomes the Spinal Tap of the film industry.Johnny Depp is in brilliant form as the titular character. It is hard to get into a character who is so oblivious to his own lack of talent, and keeps such a brave face in spite of such crushing knockbakcs. Depp does this so brilliantly that it's a wonder he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Speaking of Oscars, Martin Landau is dynamite as the ailing, forgotten one-time king of the horror silver screen. As Bela Lugosi, he is so in character that it gives a unique insight into the final days of Lugosi's life. As we learn what happens to Lugosi while Wood is hammering the final nails into his career's coffin, it's hard to say whether we shed tears for Lugosi's unfortunate demise, or because Landau portrays it with such conviction and sympathy.If there is a weak link in this film, it is Sarah Jessica Parker. In one of life's ironies, as she is portraying Delores Fuller and reading a review of a stage performance, she asks if she really has a horse-like face (or something to that effect). I bet she didn't have to do much research in order to learn how to do that convincingly. Only Gary Busey, Jake Busey, and Julia Roberts exceed Parker for being obnoxiously ugly. The fact that she can't act worth a damn also lets the side down, although not as badly as one might expect, given that everyone who plays an extra in Ed's films is expected to turn in a rotten performance.Some of the quirks that make Ed's films as great as they are were left out of the film. Jeffrey Jones, for example, doesn't even try to imitate the weird back-and-forth movement of Criswell's head as he explains that future events such as these will affect you in the future. However, one of the funniest incidents on the Plan 9 set, an actor playing a policeman scratching himself with his gun, is captured here with a certain kind of uncanny accuracy. From this, one gets the impression that Jeffrey Jones didn't care nearly as much about researching his character as did Martin Landau or Johnny Depp. In the end, however, the positives outweigh the negative quite dramatically.All in all, I gave Ed Wood a 10 out of 10. It entertains from start to finish, which, like the titular character's actual films, puts it well ahead of numerous films that made a lot more money or garnered a lot more critical praise. This is another film that proves quality is still possible in Hollywood, in spite of how hard the system rails against it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Man of Conviction, If Not Talent","Every young movie maker thinks he can do anything and everything that has not been done already. Ed Wood is no exception, and that is why he's so special. Often considered THE worst movie director of all time, his life story would have been interesting if he had not made Play 9 From Outer Space. Tim Burton's tribute to the writer/director of the 1940s and 50s chronicles Wood's life from studio ""lot boy"" movie plants from one movie studio to another up to the premier of Plan 9. Along the way, we root for and feel sorry for Wood as he produces what he thinks are the ultimate pictures of all time, but we know they are turkeys. The charm of Ed Wood is how the director never questioned himself, how he always thought what he was doing was wonderful, and how everyone else got him wrong. The film features Martin Landau in an Oscar Winning Performance as the aging star of Dracula, Bela Legosi, and Bill Murray plays a make-up artist who really wants to be a woman. The real life characters that surround Wood make for almost constant comedy, and Burton's use of black and white gives us that feel of 1940s Hollywood. The background information we find in this movie gives us perspective in a man who was doing what he wanted to do in life, no matter what the results may have been.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Professionalism and arrogance don't match,"I merely wish to state the main point that Ed Wood makes for me, one which I haven't seen in any of the reviews so far. Ed was very enthusiastic and did most of the things right that you have to do in order to get movies made - he was enthusiastic, he knew how to communicate his fervour, he was an entrepreneur, he was ruthless and, most importantly, he believed in himself.But that is not enough. As we see numerous times during the movie, while Ed is enthusiastic, he hasn't a drip of professional film-making professionalism in him. He shows no regard at all for staging, for outside (wanted) criticism, for the importance of multiple takes, for attention to detail.Passionate as he was, Ed was arrogant about his own abilities as a filmmaker. That was why he failed. This was the stark but rewarding truth the film left me with. Wonderful.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Outstanding Film about Love of Filmmaking,"When Tim Burton picked up an ordinary theme (for him) - drama about life's up and down, his idiosyncratic aesthetics had to choose an extraordinary figure - Ed Wood, C-graded filmmaker in 1950s. Burton must've been confident enough to make such an outstanding film, while picking up Ed Wood as a material might've needed some courage. Through this homage to numerous ""mediocre"" films which have been buried in the film history and numerous ""bad"" filmmakers who have supported the film industry, Burton's love for filmmaking permeates on the beautifully shot black and white screen. Unquestionably one of the best films about filmmaker/filmmaking, as well as a human drama.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Ed Wood would be proud to know he did have value for the crazy world, thanks to his devotion, excitement, love of films and devoted friends and colleagues. I'm not even a big Tim Burton fan, but this is his major accomplishment so far.This film should have won Best Actor and Best Cinematography (although Supporting Actor & Make-up wins were great).

Loved It,"This movie was so refreshing to me.  I haven't been to the movie theater for what has seemed like ages.  Most movies today are so bland they just seem to meld together.  Not so with this masterpiece of Tim Burton.  Someone finally had the guts to make a mainstream film dealing with a truly bizarre subject, the angora-sweater-wearing worst director of all time.  I was reminded of the fact that truth is stranger than fiction because fiction is limited by the human imagination. Anyway, there are just so many great scenes to mention.  There is no way I could list them all.  My favorite is when Ed Wood and his freaky band of misfits and outcasts agree to be baptised by the Southern Baptist Church. To get all the references you would need to have seen Wood's 3 most well known films: Plan 9 From Outer Space, Glen or Glenda?, and Bride of the Monster. I can truly recommend this film.  Wood's spirit appeals to the idealist in all of us.  Can we really look down on him for at least following his dream, something I doubt many of us would do?

Not Bad,"Not bad at all. It's another type of Tim Burton's film. I mean there is sometimes sad but well played parts. Johnny Depp was unrecognized to me in the movie.

Though I couldn't imagine seeing johnny Depp in woman's clothing, Bill Murray acting like a total fagg, and Jeffrey Jones acting like a ""strange man"" in person. But the movie was great. It's like a good director (Tim Burton) directing a film on a bad director directing! I didn't payed much attention to Jessica Parker's or Lisa Marie's performances. But Depp's and Landau's performances were well focused and the judging is simple; Depp-7/10 & Landau 9/10. It usually shows on HBO or the Max channels, or Encore History (If you have those channels) and if I had a choice of watching a brand new film on the channels like for example ""Mystic River"" or ""The Two Towers""...

A great movie about an awful yet genuine director.,"This is another one of those movies I didn't expect to get as much out of as I did. I'm generally not into biopic movies and stuff like that. I mostly bought the movie for two reasons. The first is that I'm collection the Top 250 on DVD, and the second is that I'm a fan of Johnny Depp and Tim Burton (no, not one of those fans who think he's god because they think he directed The Nightmare Before Christmas, I'm the kind of fan who watched movies like Beetlejuice and Mars Attacks! when I was a kid. I was very happily surprised at how much I loved it.So why do I love it so much? Well, even I'm not 100% sure of that. I guess it mostly comes down to how much I liked seeing the story of a man that was so genuineÂ… a man who wanted to make movies because it's what he wanted to do, not because there was so much money in it. The fact that it's brilliantly quirky and fun definitely would have helped. It also had the great acting behind it, with Johnny Depp doing a great job as the awful director, Edward D. Wood Jr., and Martin Landau doing an absolutely awesome job as horror legend Bela Lugosi.I can't tell you how accurately it portrays Wood. I don't know much about him outside this movie, and I haven't seen much of his work (other than Bride of the Monster). It's clear that the movie is biased towards Wood, but that doesn't stop the movie from being incredibly entertaining, wonderfully weird and just very well made overall. It has a great score as well!

"Overall, it is a quality movie and I recommend you to watch it, my rating is 9/10.","Many people wrote that this is Tim Burton's best movie, and I didn't believe it at first, but when I watched it, I realized that it was true. The film was shot entirely in black and white to convey the spirit of the 50s, and this made the movie even better and more interesting. The main role was played by Tim Burton's favorite Johnny Depp, who is not the first time he has played a role in Tim Burton's films. Johnny Depp played very well, he knows how to play very well. I would also add that I did not know there was a director named Ed Wood, and when I watched the movie I did not know that he was the worst director of all time (probably). When I watched the movie, I didn't think that he was really bad, the worst, as they say, but I wouldn't want to watch his movies. Tim Burton's direction is very good. The plot and script are great, and the denouement closes everything perfectly. I liked the acting of all the actors, all the characters were interesting, but it was unusual for me to see Bill Murray as a gay drag queen, but he is a comedian. The movie is dynamic, but a bit long, but I watched the movie in one breath, I recommend it. The editing, the cinematography are excellent, and the special effects are great. There is humor and there is drama, you can both laugh and sympathize with the characters a little. The sound and soundtrack are good, and the atmosphere, sets and costumes, as well as the hairstyles of the 50s, are great.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A masterpiece with the body of a comedy, but the soul of a tragedy.","Ed wood is a brilliant demonstration on how to deliver a worthy biopic. It has style, it has truth, and most of all it has understanding.It would be easy to look at Ed Wood in one certain angle. He was a man with many strange quirks, it's almost too strange to fully believe at first. But he was a man with many layers. He was a tortured artist, he was a piece of comedic gold, he was a man of passion, he was a man with drive and he was also a man who embraced the challenges set for him.Whatever was said about him, you can't deny Ed Wood had a relentless lust for creating and the passion to deliver, no matter how ill prepared he was. Wood seemed to always be swimming against the tied and due to the results being so shoddy in most respects, he never managed to catch any sort of break.Behind all the drama, comedy and beautiful imagery in this film is a story about perseverance despite failure. In many ways Ed Wood experienced nothing but failure which makes his life story seem so devastating.Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood with a stunning level of talent. Wood is portrayed as a man who sees the best in everything. He has an incredible supply of passion, friends, stock footage and basically no supply of anything else. Money is especially tight, causing him to cut corners at every corner.Martin Landau is incredible as the ageing Bela Lugosi, who became close with Wood professionally and personally. Lugosi was a fundamental part in Ed Wood's earlier projects, he was a legend who engaged with Wood as if he was any other Hollywood director. The film portrays Lugosi as the man who is in a huge crisis and has given up on everything.Lugosi's story is one of the film's most heartbreaking elements. He is a downtrodden star who's turned into a rather bitter man. Once so iconic, he is now effectively left with nothing but a substance addiction and a problematic financial situation.The fact that no one knows Bela is even alive and that he strolls around with a grouchy demeanour is humorous, however there's a great darkness lingering around him. He is old, tired, depressed and angry.Throughout the film he makes calls to ""Eddy"" late at night to come to his aid as he experiences a crisis. The fact that Ed Wood was always there for Bela was an incredibly touching part of their relationship. It's just heartbreaking seeing Bela in such a self destructive state.Every other actor in this film is really good and they all make the parts their own. And they're all incredibly funny and you warm to them all because if their commitment to Ed's vision.Amongst Ed Wood is one of the strangest ensembles from any Hollywood project. Ed was weird but also incredibly likeable, so over time he begins to have a grip on some washed up legends, some fallen from grace TV stars and even novelty acts.Tim Burton manages to tackle the heavy themes and all the strange events in the films with such a gentle grace. He was always going to be the best director for the job. As someone who is eccentric himself and a lover of gothic imagery, he really understood how to tell this story.The way this movie ends is quite beautiful and respectful to Ed Wood's innocent and passionate nature. It treats him like a person, not like a joke. He's a funny and eccentric guy, but he is displayed as a hard working and heavily inspired artist. Considering that the real ending of Ed Wood's life was so bleak, it's nice to see the film giving him the beautiful ending that he really deserved.This movie also wins great respect for one of the greatest opening credits sequences ever. This first few minutes deliver practically everything you need to know about an Ed Wood production. So thoughtful, respectful, funny, moving and stylistic.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great biography/comedy,"This film is wonderful, but it really helps to know who the characters are _before_ seeing this film.

Who... weit.,"Ed Wood. Alright before this movie I had no idea who that is. Turns out he's a director who is belived to be the worst director ever. I wish I got it. So the story is about him trying to tell stories. Did I mentioned that he also writes plots he directs? The plot is unbelievably funny. I'm not sure whether or not it supposed to be a comedy or drama but I think it's both. The characters are great. They almost as good as in The dark knight and that says something. My favorite three characters are Ed Wood himself played by Jonny D. to whom we'll get later. The character played by Martin Landau. And he totally deserved an Oscar for that. And the character of Bill Murey who is great. Well he's a man who wants to be a woman how could he not be great? So J.D. acting. It's incredible. His funny, not to smart, creative. He's awesome. You'll feel what he feels. Yeah you will. Special effect are... well there aren't any. And those which Ed does is really funny. So the movie is incredible(did I say it already?). If you want to hear a story (partly) of a man who likes to dress up like a woman (which is really funny) go watch it like right now.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful - and finally on DVD in the USA,A really wonderful film about a terrible filmmaker. Voted the Worst Director of all Time which he certainly is not since his films are never dull - something that cannot be said of some other directors.

Hilarious and poignant cult masterpiece,"I first saw the real Ed Wood's films ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and ""Night Of The Ghouls"" as a kid and had become interested in the fascinating story of the director and his bizarre group of friends and their experiences in later years.  His films are enjoyable and fun (which is more than can be said for a lot of truly awful movies that others have raved about to me).This film is a fitting tribute to Ed's dreams.  I know it has it's inaccuracies but it's never less than true to the spirit of Ed Wood's amazing (and sometimes touching) story.  I even went back and discovered that some of the things I assumed were artistic lisence in the story were actually drawn from Rudolph Grey's book (Nightmare Of Ecstacy). Much of the film is hilarious and has a lot of quirky humour and bizarre moments.  There are also some beautifully poignant moments and a definitesadness to some parts of the film.    The style of the film is great and really recreates the atmosphere of Ed's movies and also accounts of his life. Shooting it in black and white was an inspired and bold move on director Tim Burton's part and is an example of his obvious affinity with the material. There were many colourful characters in Edward D Wood Jnr's life and the film really captures them and almost makes you want to join in with his wild dreams and eccentric films.  The cast is uniformly excellent. Johnny Depp, apart from being in some of my favourite films(Cry-Baby and Ed Wood) is also one of the finest actors around and has an interesting film career (Sleepy Hollow, From Hell, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Edward Scissorhands etc).  He's a great choice for the lead role and gives the film a lot of energy and wit.  Martin Landau (Space:1999, Cleopatra) is truly excellent as Bela Lugosi and it's great to see him acting alongside hi lovely, talented daughter in some scenes.  Martin Landau provides many laughs in the film but also some of it's more poignant moments and makes you feel true sympathy for Bela in the film.  Juliet Landau (Drusilla in Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Angel) is perfect for quirky character roles and is a delight here. Sarah Jessica Parker (Sex And The City, Mars Attacks! )has some great bitchy moments and is another great actress.  Patricia Arquette (True Romance, A Nightmare On Elm Street 3) is sweet in her role and brings out the poignancy of Ed's following his dreams.  Both Jeffrey Jones and Bill Murray are great in their roles.  Criswell was a bizarre character and I enjoyed the real person's opening monologues in Ed's pictures. The film is mostly funny up to and including the making of""Bride Of The Monster"" but gets sadder and grimmer for a period when dealing with Bela's addiction and time in hospital but the film gets funny again for the making of ""Plan 9"".  The end gives the viewer some additional information about some of the main people portrayed and the film ends on a beautiful note (even though the reality for the characters isn't so great).  Ed's left in the film with his dreams of fame and the film is an inspiration to dreamers and non-conformists everywhere.  Funny and sad and always fascinating.  Another stroke of genius from Tim Burton.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tim Burton = Genius,"d Wood is the story of the ""worst Director - ever"". Until you find out that Tim Burton is the director of this film, you'll probably wonder why someone would choose to, almost, document the life of such a person. However, it is typical of Burton to portray the life of someone different, not typical. It is sad that Edward D Wood Jr. did not receive fame until after his death, spending most of his life creating films that were not accepted in Hollywood. The story of his life has become more popular and watchable than any of the films he made. He does still have a small amount of fans today, but, he really was no Orson Welles, despite aspiring to be. Tim Burton depicts the sad yet, hopeful life of Ed Wood very well. Although we know that none of Ed Wood's films gain huge success and popularity, that doesn't stop us hoping they do. We easily associate and believe in the character played greatly, by Johnny Depp. Ed Wood is filmed in black and white which makes it seem even more true to life. However, the actors cast to play Wood and his bizarre friends such as, Bunny (Bill Murray) and Dolores (Sarah Jessica Parker), are played by modern actors. This lets the audience know that Burton is clearly not trying to make a documentary/docu-drama etc, he is purely making a film; something that will entertain the audience. The many comedic moments in this film also add to this idea. Johnny Depp makes a marvellous Ed Wood, his lack of blinking and goofy smile add to the idea that Wood really was an eccentric character. This without the fact he liked to dress in women's clothing, something I think Johnny Depp, strangely enough, suited. Another performance that has to be commented on is that of Martin Landau who played Bela Lugosi. His performance was so good it won him an Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. The irony in this is that the real Bela Lugosi never won an Oscar himself. Landau is very well suited to the role, and looks like someone who could definitely have played Dracula. He knows himself that, ""what I do best, what I've always done best, is act."" He portrays wonderfully the character of Bela Lugosi and his struggle to find fame and fortune; dealing with a drug addiction and being willing to play any character thrown at him, however awful it was. Overall, Ed Wood is a funny yet sad, portrayal of Ed Wood's life. It definitely deserves to be named one of Tim Burton's best films, and again, we see a brilliant collaboration between him and Johnny Depp.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
best comedy film ever,"This is, by far, the funniest, wittiest, and most sly film ever made.  It is genius, and no comedy will ever compare to it.  Earlier this year I saw Election and was reminded of this film, for both comedies go beyond your typical comic cliches and make you laugh at things that normally wouldn't be very funny.  I would go so far as to say that Ed Wood is the best movie of the 90's.  I tend to resist when saying that however, because when I say that, my mind thinks of Schindler's List, which I also hold with much regard.  I don't think either is better than the other.  But I will go so far as to say that Ed Wood is the best black and white movie of the 90's. Oh, wait.....",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Fun And Endearing Movie To Watch,"Great story, endearing characters, and hilarious tacky moments shines brilliantly upon this movie from the beginning until the end.  While I don't have a clue about the true real-life story of Edward D. Wood Jr, one thing I know for sure is that I'm having heaps of fun.This biopic is basically about Ed Wood himself, the so-called ""Worst Director of All Time"" and how he is determined to make it in Hollywood. Although many considered his movies to be awful and regard him as a director with no sense whatsoever about the art of filmmaking, Ed Wood is portrayed as a director of immense passion for storytelling, yet who is so in love with every shot being taken and felt there is no need to take a second one.In Hollywood, Ed Wood has a bunch of strange and colorful associates from Tor Johnson the Swedish Wrestler to Vampira the Night TV Hostess which are all very amusing to watch.  But beneath all this, the movie's strongest and best aspect is about Ed Wood's friendship with the legendary and ailing Bela Lugosi. Herein lies the heart of the movie's storyline; the fact that both are ridiculed by their Hollywood contemporaries yet still recognizing greatness in each other is just endearing.  They helped out each other, and I really felt a pang in my heart when Ed Wood sadly watched the last film reel of Lugosi ever filmed while ""The Swan Lake"" plays in the background. Credit is to Martin Landau; he truly deserved those many awards that were heaped upon him for his most AMAZING role as Lugosi.  As for Johnny Depp, he is great for playing Ed Wood with a fresh enthusiasm.Tim Burton is to be commended for his portrayals of all the characters in the movie.  To make us laugh, he clearly pokes fun at them and the whole B-movie culture in the 60's but it's obvious that those portrayals were done with sincere affection.  One of the funniest scenes is when Lugosi were asked for a glass of wine and said ""I don't drink ... wine.""  It was a pleasant surprise for Dracula fans.  Another hilarious scene is when Lugosi gave the performance of his life wrestling a puppet Octopus in a cold lake.Ed Wood is a great movie that pays proper homage to its characters and the culture that they lived in.  It can be enjoyed again and again, and still makes me grin and laugh.  Most definitely one of my favorite films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Johnny Depp is hilarious,"Johnny Depp is hilarious as the 1950's camp underground film director, Ed Wood. A biography was to be made about Christine Jorgensen, the first male to female sex change operation ever done. because no rights could be obtained, Wood, who was a transvestite, convinced producers to let him make a fictionalized version of the story. The result was his first of many failures, ""Glen or Glenda."" Wood's next project is a low, low budget monster move. He convinces an aging and drug addicted Bela Lugosi, the original Dracula, to be the leading man. Martin Landau won the 1994 Academy Award for his blistering performance. Wood makes a huge mistake by bringing up Boris Karloff and Frankenstein, which sets off Lugosi on a maniacal tirade that is so over the top and hysterical and the scene which sealed the Oscar for Landau.The final and most infamous release was ""Plan 9 From Outer Space,"" which pretty much sealed Wood's fate as the worst film maker in history and fortunately for us gave us this great biopic.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
One Of the truly great films of our time,"This is one of the best films I have ever seen.I am glad that Landau got the Oscar for best supporting actor,but why Johnny Depp didn't even get a nomination, for the life of me I will never understand.He was absolutely brilliant.In fact,pretty much everyone in the cast did an excellent job.I especially loved Bill Murray as the flamboyant Bunny Brekenridge.People say that Ed Wood was a failure, but I like to think of him as the ultimate trailblazer,the very first independent film maker.He made movies that were very poor quality, but for the most part he had almost no budget, little talent,no sets or sound stages, and little or no crew.most of his outdoor,and public footage(what wasn't stock footage)was done on the fly without permits.He was the first truly guerrilla film maker.I think that Burton,and Depp really captured the spirit of Wood's work.I think that without Ed Wood, there could have been no Rodriquez,Tarintino,or Kevin Smith.So,No, I don't think that Wood was a total failure.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

An all too often forgotten Tim Burton classic.,"A black and white film about a horrible filmmaker made in the 1990s obviously wasn't going to shatter any box office records, or for that matter even break even. This movie in fact seemed to be forgotten and is never mentioned when mention of Tim Burton comes up. Despite the fact that this is possibly Burton's least known film, it is definitely one of his best. This is an outstanding comical character piece with stellar camera-work and direction, not to mention a cast that brings these oddballs to life.The film follows Edward D Wood Jr. (Johnny Depp), the wannabe film director/writer/actor who worked his butt off to become recognized. It takes place from 1953 to 1959, and goes from Wood's meeting and friendship of Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau) to the making of Wood's best known film ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"".This movie manages very successfully to be both funny and somewhat realistic. Mr. Depp gives an exaggerative performance at times, but is the performance unbelievable? Nope. And he never drops out of character either, so it just makes us believe Wood was a bit loony, but still likable. Martin Landau knocks his performance out of the park with his Academy Award winning performance as Bela Lugosi. Again, this character might be a bit exaggerated, but it still always feels real, and Landau plays on the Bela's frailties and emotions perfectly. Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette are good as Wood's love interests throughout various points of his life also. The only cast member who may have been a tad bit unbelievable was Bill Murray as Bunny, Wood's eccentric manager. His performance was too goofy to believe sometimes. Nonetheless, still stellar performances.The direction and camera work is really good, as is the lighting. The black and white accentuates the backdrops and scenes and also helps make this thing look really great. And to make the scenes even more lush, Howard Shore replaces Danny Elfman as the score composer, and makes the score just as good as Elfman would have likely done (No offense to the very talented Danny Elfman). The score which switches between corny sci-fi theramin score and beautiful brass and strings is just really fitting music for the film.Episodic plots can become boring because they just go from one place to another and never set roots, but this movie is never boring. It's interesting to see the processes this guy had to go through just to make no budget films, and it's interesting to see his home life. It seems overall, Wood was an interesting fellow.Overall, this is a really interesting movie, with enough humor to make it interesting, but not too much to make it stupid. And Johnny Depp's weird performance as Ed Wood doesn't stop the film from actually having a good amount of emotion and sentimentality. Definitely one of Burton's best films!My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. Rated R.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Fine tribute,"If you love movies, you've got to see ED WOOD, Tim Burton's brilliant portrait of the 1950s ""B Movie"" director - an odd, unique figure in the harsh world of Hollywood, who was responsible for such gems as ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and ""Glen or Glenda"". Working with nothing but blind faith and conviction to his cause Ed, against all odds, forged ahead with his dreams. Although much is fictional, the film captures the essence of Wood and the era in which he worked. Ironically it took a budget of 18 million dollars to recreate the look and feel of an ultra low budget Ed Wood film. Martin Landau is superb in a well-deserved Academy Award performance as Bela Lugosi. Landau, in his Award acceptance speech said that he ""was grateful that everyone who saw this film is here tonight!"" Pull the strings, Bela, Pull the strings.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing Satire with a Lot of Heart,"A hilarious and oddly heartwarming satirical take on Hollywood's most infamous director. A man who's heralded as the worst director of all time, but he's so passionate and excited about his filmmaking that you can't help but root for him to get his vision made. His chemistry with the rest of the cast is great, with some intriguing surprises like Bela Lugosi, Vampira, wrestlers, transvestities, Baptists, and even his wife's chiropractor. The cast knocks it out of the park, and they all play off of each other so well. The lighting of the black-and-white cinematography is very crisp and stunning. Despite all the punchlines, the movie is warmly accepting and arguably ahead of its time about Ed Wood's sexual divergence with his interest in crossdressing and eventually finding others who accept him for who he is, leaning into trans rights. It's the best movie about bad movies that somehow still captures the magic of making art, even when it isn't very good. It's a great watch and easily Tim Burton's most underrated flick.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Johnny and Tim we all know and love,"Back before the public seemed to generally go off the once-bankable combination of director Tim Burton and leading man Johnny Depp, they made 'Ed Wood,' the biographical drama of the now 'infamous' Hollywood auteur of the same name. If you know your film history, you may have heard of 'Plan 9 From Outer Space,' largely because it has often been heralded as the 'worst film ever made.' Personally, I think that's a little unfair as Michael Bay is still alive, but it's hardly a masterpiece.It was Ed Wood himself who wrote and directed this *ahem* 'epic' which he basically blagged his way to get funded. Burton tells this story using Depp as the titular character. Who is also a cross-dresser. Did I mention that? Yes, not only does Ed Wood truly believe that he is destined to become the next Orson Wells, but he also likes wearing women's clothes. Cue Depp turning his quirky on-screen charm up to eleven.For some reason, Burton chooses to shoot the whole film in black and white. At first some may find this a little weird and jarring, yet, before long, you probably won't notice that colour has been drained, especially when the 'films within the film' start rolling and you see Wood's sci-fi flick in all its colourless glory.Yes, it's based on the real Ed Wood, but does that mean it's a true story? Well, it's as true as the next Hollywood 'true' story. A few liberties here and there have obviously been taken to further the plot, but, on the whole, it's reasonably accurate. You don't have to know much about Ed Wood or his work to enjoy this, you just have to appreciate a role that seems to have been written for Johnny Depp, who plays the man with so much wide-eyed wonder that you can't help but root for him, even if he probably hasn't got the talent to back up his ambition (but then that can be said for pretty much ever reality TV show participant ever).Depp carries the film on his own, but, besides Burton's behind-the-scenes presence shining through, it's worth mentioning the bunch of misfits Ed Wood brings along with him, all of which are allowed to have more than one moment where they shine.The real Plan 9 From Outer Space was a flop. However, it has since found an audience with the 'so-bad-it's-good' audiences, plus Burton/Depp's take on Ed Wood have furthered its reputation. You may not want to see the source material after watching this (although I did and I enjoyed â€“ or appreciated at least â€“ it for what it was), but the time spent with Depp and his band of freaks and desperates should keep you comically entertained with its mix of pathos and fluffy pink sweaters.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Ed Wood"" as tragedy","The only place this film failed was in the advertising, which probably represents a lack of vision into what ""Ed Wood"" metamorphosed into.  What it isn't, is a comedy: viewers expecting a good laugh will go away disappointed.  From start to finish, this brilliant work of art is a tragedy, so thoroughly overpowered by Martin Landau's inspired performance that there are more tears and bitter recriminations than smiles.  Ed Wood, the self-destructive optimist may not have had the talent to survive in mainstream Hollywood, but he had the heart.  His story is legend.  And how many wannabe's wouldn't trade places with him?  Being the ""worst director of all time"" is better than not being a director at all.  Martin Landau gave dignity to a very beloved and underappreciated actor; Martin and Bela shared a soul for this film.  One of the most inspired performances ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A lovable failure,"Ed Wood charts the story of Edward D. Wood Jr., voted the worst director in Hollywood. But to say that this story is about his failures and his lack of artistic ability behind the lens would be a total generalisation, one that would not do this film justice. Instead, Tim Burton has filmed a story paying homage to a man, that, despite his many flaws, you truly have a sort of respect for at the end of the film.Burton's film is aided by the listing of a stellar cast, not least of which is Johnny Depp in the title role, who plays Wood as a sort of innocent egomaniac, who while he seems friendly and charming as a man, has absolute conviction in his talents, and never questions them for a second. With Depp is Sarah Jessica Parker and Particia Arqutte as the women of Wood's life and Bill Murray as his confidante Bunny.But truly the star of the show, along with Depp is Martin Landau as the once great horror star Bela Lugosi. Once the toast of the cinema, now nothing more than a drug addled ruin with his career now in tatters.But this isn't a story about falling from grace, nor is it a story about failure. As much as anything Burton uses this film to pay homage to a man who didn't listen to the executive big wigs, nor was tied down by petty changes that had to be made. In fact Burton, deliberately compares him to Orson Welles, showing that although that Wood may not have had the talent, he certainly had the drive and if anything he should be respected for that.This is a movie that shows that the weird is often lovable, despite, if it fails. How else can you explain a transvestite director coming across as charming?",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

There is something for everyone...comedy, romance, Drama.From the onset of the film you can tell that it is a Tim Burton Movie.

Bill Murray was great, Geoff Jones were impressive as ever and band of misfits were hilarious. However, i must say that the credit has to go to Martin Landou and Johnny Depp. with other actors cast, it wouldnt have been the same. and Marin definately deserved his oscar.It was nice that the movie did not make fun of Ed Wood. It was very sensitive on the way that it portrayed his love fir the art of Directing. It gave him the respect that he deserves.Personally, i dont think that he deserves the title of the worst director of all time.

Burton and Depp's best.,"My Take: An interesting and hilarious biopic, as well as a loving tribute to the film-loving side of Ed Wood.Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors, and ED WOOD is probably his best film. Along with the brilliant EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, ED WOOD is another personal work from Burton wherein he feels right at home with the story and its lead character of the gifted outcast. Whereas EDWARD reflected Burton's childhood, ED WOOD reflected on Burton as the imaginative outcast in Hollywood, as well as his friendship with the late actor Vincent Price (which was uncannily similar to Wood's own friendship with his idol Bela Lugosi).Johnny Depp really looks as if he is Ed Wood. The weirdness and all. But he is not, by any means, a mockery of the real thing. Instead, Burton and Depp revel in the eccentricity and odd imagination of the man. Instead of condescending the man's lack of any real talent or experience, Burton and screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski embrace them man's love for his work and his insistence to do what he wants. Here we see he loves movies and not the business they make. Wood may be the worst director of all time as he is claimed to be, but does do it right. Other than Depp, Martin Landau's performance as the late Bela Lugosi is one you've got to see to believe. From the accent to the excellent make-up effects, Landau IS Lugosi. It sort of reminded me of the making of Ed Wood's PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE where Wood used stock footage and a double to make it look like it was the recently-deceased Lugosi's true final film. Well, Burton would have made Wood proud; this is the closest we can get to bringing the man who played Dracula back from the grave.I really love this movie. Take my word for it, ""Ed Wood"" is a great film; one of Burton's best films and perhaps Depp's greatest and most eccentric performance to date.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Wood Jr., played by Burton favorite Johnny Depp.Wood was a forgettable B-movie director until his naming as the worst of all time a couple years after his death in the '70s gave him a cult following. Burton tells his story in a fitting black and white form that uses both B-movie and classic techniques (in addition to a score with some classic themes by Howard Shore) as an appropriate ode to the director. It's partly fascinating because you want to know why Wood was the worst and how someone who is the worst is motivated to make movies.For the first time in Depp's career, he gets to really show what he's capable of in a leading role. Depp brings this naive charisma and desperation to make motion pictures however the heck he wants to Wood, who clearly had to have had a few screws loose to make the movies he made. Since Wood also took pleasure in dressing up in womens' clothes, particularly angora sweaters, this adds another quirky dimension to the film that most would recognize as more up Burton's alley. Depp plays those scenes with a silly modesty.But the dimension that really makes this one of Burton's best films, if not the best, is the brilliant subplot of the relationship between Wood and horror icon Bela Lugosi played marvelously by Martin Landau. Lugosi was aging, getting senile and addicted to morphine when he met Wood and so Landau's performance is the most hysterical and touching of all the roles in the film. He's self-centered and curses a lot, but you can tell that making movies was his life too and how his time out of the spotlight crushed him emotionally. An Oscar much deserved.With the feel of an old-time movie yet the insight of a modern one, ""Ed Wood"" is as unique a film as they come. Not quite comedy and not quite drama, it is both a satire of Hollywood and light-hearted examination of the business while also getting at what it takes to make movies and why people are so impassioned to do it. In a way, it's Burton's justification of his bizarre style of film-making, though in my opinion he need none.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Charms Through Its Whim and Wisdom. Never Has A Bad Director Been Smothered In Such Respect,"Renowned for crafting incredibly bad films and often cited as the ""worst director ever"", Edward D. Wood Jr. has become a cult icon inside the world of film. Although his films are entirely detestable, they are rarely a chore to watch because of the comedic value which is on offer. It could be argued that he was the man who gave birth to ""Z movie horror."" It is widely acknowledged that Tim Burton has long been an admirer of classic horror films, which resulted in his reoccurring use of German expressionism (mise-en-scÃ¨ne) and Gothic themes in his own works. Similar to many of Tim Burton's films, Ed Wood is about a bizarre, eccentric and unique man.Chronicling a man's rise to ""personal success"" and his overwhelming desire to become the next Orson Welles, Ed Wood charts the director's fascinatingly manic career; from Glen or Glenda, to Plan 9 from Outer Space. Both are two of the most shamefully undesirable disasters ""Hollywood"" has ever produced, but to Ed Wood they were gold. Even so, he was a man who had the utmost level of zest for his so-called ""art"" and would never back-down to the barrage of criticism he would constantly receive. To Ed Wood, Glen or Glenda was a highly personal film, which was supposed to tell the world his desire to wear women's clothes, instead it made him look entirely foolish. This pretty much defines the career of the ""world's worst director."" Strangely enough, Ed Wood is not a biopic which bashes the man, or makes fun out of him. Instead, Tim Burton creates a loving homage to the quintessential master of the ""Z movie.""Upon finishing a Tim Burton film it is irregular not to undergo satisfaction, but with Ed Wood it is impossible. Evidently, (or at least I believe so) it is Burton's most triumphant work to-date, yet oddly enough, receives underwhelming acclaim. It is a shame that viewers of today are prepared to spend money to see terrible odes like Mars Attacks (a disastrous experiment by Burton) and then turn down the opportunity to experience a genuine homage, such as Ed Wood. The lovable, informative and often amusing take on the life of a cinematic failure ranks among the greatest films from the '90s.Delivering staggering vigour and once again proving his versatility, Johnny Depp took centre-stage for his finest collaboration with mentor-like Burton. And to think that it was not until 2003's Pirates of the Caribbean was released that Depp received his first academy award nomination. Robbery, considering his performance was undoubtedly the best of its year (1994). How many male actors are prepared to accept almost any role, do anything for it (e.g. prance around in drag) and actually achieve the utmost level of professionalism? Luckily and ironically, actor Marin Landau received an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor (awarded for his role as the drug-addicted and deadbeat Dracula star, Bella Lugosi). These are performances of aching personality, and are drenched with amusing anecdotes.Filmed in black-and-white, Ed Wood crafts a precise image of the 1950s Hollywood scene. Not only does it signify poignancy, but it also swells with nostalgia. Camera movements are both graceful and erratic, suited as allegory for Mr. Wood's own unpredictability. Surely this is a personal work, something which can be noted through the tactfully comic screenplay. With the exception of factual (although not fatal by any means) inaccuracies, the picture remains a victorious achievement and should be hailed for its comic brilliance more regularly, if you ask me. As a director (and on a side note), Tim Burton should be applauded for his ability to pay sympathy and respect for a man who was painfully oblivious of his exceptional ineptness. It would have been arrogant to have shown blatant pity for Edward D. Wood Jr., so as a director he remains subtle when underlying his sympathy (and even understanding) of a futile longing for excellence.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A great masterpiece in black&white of a world full of colors.,The passion has too many faces and so different ways to express it.

Murray as Bunny,"I know this movie won an Oscar for Landau and Johnny Depp is top-billed, but I wanted to call attention to Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge.

Ed Wood has appeared on my DVD shelf a few weeks ago, it has become a permanent part of my top 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The third best movie of all time!,"The Lion King, Fight Club and... Ed Wood. Yes, these are my top 3 movies of all time, and Ed Wood had to be pretty awesome movie to get up there. It's easier for a movie to be depressing. There's more ""street cred"", or ""critical cred"", generally, in an incredibly depressing movie (take Million Dollar Baby, for example.) It's the simpler route to striking an emotional chord among audience members. If something is indescribably sad, then you can't poke fun of it. You can't laugh about it-- people DIED, dammit! And Ed Wood is one of the rare, non-depressing, actually inspirational, great movies. Somehow Ed Wood skirts cheesiness with its darker, implied undertones and sincere but rather campy dialogue. The movie is uplifting- it shows how an opus (Plan 9 from outer space) can be created just out of ambition and self-confidence and determination. It shows the success that sprouts from self-acceptance. And the film is about the so-called worst director of all time! And he died of alcoholism-related things in the seventies! And yet Ed Wood still manages to be an inspiration! So it's easy to call a happy movie clichÃ©. Especially a happy movie with an old-fashioned, less than subtle or minimalist directorial style (like the scene about Dolores' angora sweaters- she says something like ""why are my sweaters stretched?"" and Ed turns over toward the camera with a guilty look on his countenance). But it has deep themes of friendship and it really questions society itself. The people in the movie- the freaks and outcasts- were rejected by society and then demonstrate their spark and vitality in the little movie world Ed makes. So to conclude, it's funny, it's sad (but not overly so, almost in a textbook-like sense is it sad. What I mean by that is it shows the facts, but it doesn't dwell on them) and it's inspirational. Plus Johnny Depp is hot.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Funny, touching, inspired, well acted Tim Burton movie.","The director of great visual masterpieces such as Beetlejuice, Batman, and Edward Scissorhands makes his best and most emotional movie here.  Lovingly shot in black and white, it is a lovely tribute to people who make low-budget horror/sci-fi films.Ed Wood, made ""classic"" films like Plan Nine From Outer Space and Glen Or Glenda (see them before this movie to get an idea of the unintentional humor in his films).  Johnny Depp plays him brilliantly including his love for angora sweaters (Depp's roles are consistently underrated).  It costars Martin Landau (who won an Oscar) as Bela Lugosi the star of Dracula in the last stages of his life.  The love for Ed Wood towards the horror legend Lugosi is very touching.Rather than make fun of Wood and his film-making friends, it treats them with respect for doing something they.Anyone who loves cheap B-movies should see this film and everyone else who ever dreamed of making their own movies will sympathise with this odd bunch of characters.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Romantic, idealistic schmaltz by any other name","Ed Wood, the movie, is an homage to two quirky, dedicated idealists of the silver screen, the director Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) and the actor Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau). It seems to set up as a comedy initially, as we watch producer-writer-director-actor Ed learning the ropes of Hollywood â€”he's the epitome of the independent filmmaker, operating on a wing and a prayerâ€”and struggling to make ends meet. Right off the bat we learn Wood has a fetish for wearing women's clothing, which really isn't supposed to be funny by itself, but it fits with the sort of lovable offbeat losers he seems to like to surround himself with as cast and crew.So Wood is going about his business in LA and has a chance encounter with Lugosi, who is doing a promotion for funeral caskets. They get to know (and like) each other as people. Wood is a huge fan, having grown up in the archetypical small town of Poughkeepsie, New York, where he relished the movies... particularly the classic 1931 Dracula in which Lugosi stars, and for which he acquired fame and some degree of fortune. These two men come to have a deep respect for each other, and Ed Wood the Movie does an excellent job of making that respect real....For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2009",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

An inspiration for anyone who wants to keep on fighting for their goals.,"Tim Burton and Johnny Depp hit this perfectly.  Ed Wood is an inspiration to anyone who has a goal and wants to achieve it.  In brief, the movie is about a movie director who is a complete failure.  And despite it all, he keeps finding a way to finance and make his next movie (again and again) despite the fact that they're all horrible.  We could all take a lesson from this movie.  Never give up, keep on looking for a way to accomplish your goals. Excellent movie.  Well done Tim Burton and Johnny Depp!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The best Tim Burton movie ever.,"Being a really big Tim Burton fan, I can't say it's easy to pick which one is the best. Edward Scissorhands had the emotion, Beetlejuice had the comedy, Batman had the quirkiness, Sleepy Hollow had the visual scenery, and so on, and so on. But I still think that one movie stands out when I think of Tim Burton's movie. That movie is Ed Wood. The movie is a total masterpiece! The screenplay was hysterical. The acting was superb. The music was great. The directing was amazing. Every single thing that could be cool in a Tim Burton movie is in this movie! The two actors that stand out for me in this movie is, of course, Johnny Depp, who gave an incredible performance as the worst director of all time, and Martin Landau, who was outstanding as the late horror icon Bela Lugosi.The mostly true story is about Edward D. Wood, Jr., who made such atrocities as Plan 9 From Outer Space, Bride of the Monster, and Glen or Glenda. He was awarded, after his death, an award for the worst director of all time. The movie is about his life and his journey to become a great movie director. Through his years he befriends Bela Lugosi, Crizwell, and many other '50's icons. Ed also has a problem, a problem his girlfriend (sarah jessica parker) has never known about. He's a transvestite! He likes to wear woman's clothes.The movie, although a comedy, had some dark Tim Burton moments aswell as a lot of drama in it. It fit so well together that the movie is overwhelming. I'm so glad that a large amount of critics also thought the same about this movie. Johnny Depp and Martin Landau are great, nominated Martin Landau for an award, and everyone else in the movie is great to, such as Bill Murray, Jeffrey Jones, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Patricia Arquette. Tim Burton really made a movie that could top all his other works. 2000 on a 10 point scale.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Filmmaking is not about the tiny details, it's about the big picture.","This was a first time watch for me and I've also never watched Plan 9 from Outer Space (1957) in its entirety, but I have heard about it and seen pieces of that movie. After watching this movie, I'm now a little curious to watching Plan 9 from Outer Space (1957) because this movie was awesome.Positives for Ed Wood (1994):
First off, I love the black and white aesthetic that Tim Burton goes for in this movie as it feels like you're being transported to a different time. The performances from the cast are awesome and you definitely believe that these are people from the 1950s. The standout performance in this movie is of course Johnny Depp as Edward D. Wood Jr. And I am completely blown away by how great he is in this movie. Depp manages to convey how incompetent and arrogant Ed Wood is during the production of Plan 9 from Outer Space (1957). And finally, the humor in this movie is top-notch from beginning to end.Overall, Ed Wood (1994) is an absolute masterclass of taking something that we can all make fun of and at the same time appreciate it for all of its faults.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of moviedom's greatest failure/success stories,"Ever cheerful cross-dressing movie maker Ed Wood is now famous as 'the worst director of all time' and his schlocky movies are now treasured for their unintentional hilarity. But to his mind they were great art and were all destined to be blockbusters.The three movies dealt with here, 'Glen or Glenda', 'The Bride of the Monster' and 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' were only a small part of his output. This movie concentrates mainly on his relationship with Bela Lugosi whom he befriended long after Lugosi's career ended and who starred in several of Woods' opuses before his death in 1956.Shot in black and white it features some fine acting performances and a perceptive script that is redolent with irony and humour but still manages to deal sensitively and even affectionately with the main characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best films of all time....,"Tim Burton and his writers depict the life of the eccentric filmmaker, Edward D. Wood Jr., a man who enjoys his films so much (and the scenes that he shoots, which have obvious mistakes in them) that he is blinded by how ridiculously awful they are. Sure, Ed did make awful films that he considered (and predicted to be) blockbuster hits. But Ed Wood isn't just a simple ordinary filmmaker who makes horrendous pictures, he has so much love for the films he's making, and so much love for filmmaking itself. This film gives you strong insight and depth into Ed Wood.I watched this movie a couple days ago, but before I watched it, I always wondered why everybody hated Ed's films (I haven't seen any of his movies), but after seeing this, I now know why: Ed Wood had the littlest insight on how to make good movies, because he didn't know what was good in a motion picture, and even worse, he never learned from his mistakes, which was one of his major downfalls. Another major problem in Ed's filmmaking abilities (if you want to call them abilities) is that he loved the scene he would shoot so much, that it overrode the fact that there was major problems in the scene. In one of the movies most memorable scenes, Ed Wood is filming a scene in his film, I which a character walks through a door. The actor who portrayed the character was Tor Johnson. Johnson accidentally bumped into the wall, causing the set to move. Ed Wood liked the take, and didn't bother to do another one, claiming that `In actuality, Lobo would have to struggle with that problem every day.' Ed Wood loved his scenes and his films so much that is resulted in only one take per scene. This movie flat out, and boldly tells you that Edward D. Wood had no filmmaking skill whatsoever.This film is all in black and white, which at first, I thought would have been a problem for me. I was proven wrong, because the film seems to be better because of the fact that it is in black and white. It bares that 1950's feel to it, and an Ed Wood feel as well. The decision to shoot the film in black and white, I thought, was really creative, and ingenious.Johnny Depp gives an excellent performance as the film's mains star, Ed Wood. Edward D. Wood (as mentioned earlier) is an eccentric filmmaker, who is blinded by the rancidness of his films. Wood is also a transvestite, who he proudly admits to almost everyone. He also sees the fact that he is a transvestite as the most normal thing in the world. Depp creates a great amount of character for Ed Wood, and gives strong insight on what Ed Wood was like. Martin Landau portrays the burnt out has-been actor, Bela Lugosi. Ladnau delivers an excellent depiction of Lugosi, and bares a strong resemblance. His character Bela Lugosi is an old, burnt out actor, who, in secrecy (for the first half of the movie), is a morphine addict. Lugosi obviously enjoys being apart of Ed's movies, and is practically in them voluntarily. During Ed's picture `Plan 9 From Outer Space,' Lugosi tragically died, thus he was replaced by a man who covered the bottom part of his face with a cloak. Like Johnny Depp, Landau creates a great amount of character for Bela. Landau also creates a vast amount of humor with Lugosi in some scenes, such as in one scene, before filming a part of the movie, he yells out, `Let's shoot this f***er!!'  The very hot Sarah Jessica Parker plays as Ed's miserable girlfriend, Dolores, who participates in some of his films. Parker too gives an exhilarating, and inspiring performance as Dolores. She too also gives good insight on how Dolores put up with Ed, hesitantly taking parts in his movies (which they never actually flat out specify if she hated them or not, but in one scene, she says how everyone is working on `s**t.').I like how the film is comical, such as when Wood continually mentions Lugosi's name to everyone, and they reply `I thought he was dead.' The film always seems to make transition from happy moments, to tragic moments, thus making you think that things are starting to go good.This film is my fifth favorite film of all time. It has excellent cinematography, a good script, VERY good performances from every single actor, the fact that it is in black and white creates ingenuity, and it really gives the audience strong insight on Ed Wood. Though Ed Wood's films were beyond awful, you cant dismiss the fact that he had so much loyalty to the art of filmmaking. Ed Wood has earned a lot of respect from people for that.Overall score: 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Glorious Film Career of That Director Ed,"Ed Wood is neat stuff, especially for those with fond memories of all those low budget monster pictures from the fifties. But, it's not restricted to just those fans; as a movie biography, it's accessible to just about anyone. The bio contains many cases of dramatic license being taken with the real Ed Wood's life and that of Bela Lugosi, but it all fits neatly into place. Their lives were touched by a bit of the fantastic, after all, and this picture emphasizes the idealized versions of events in our memories as much time passes by. Wood (Depp) is a 'never say die' fellow: despite a lack of talent, no money and even bad luck, he manages to persevere through several writing/directing efforts, all the while jumping back into the game when it seems he's played his last card. Just when it seems he's growing despondent and is finished, something galvanizes him to tackle another feature. You can't help but root for the guy. You can't help but laugh along with a studio exec who can't take Wood's work seriously but, at the same time, you want Wood to continue putting out these lame efforts. Hey, at least he's doing it, right?The viewer really can begin warming up to the picture as Wood begins assembling his 'posse' of actors and production people. Besides Bela (Landau), this includes wrestler Tor (George Steele), stage entertainer Criswell the prognosticator (Jones), strange actor Bunny (Murray) and, later, TV host Vampira. They bond together into a sort of team, even heading out on dark night missions to 'borrow' props from other studios. Though seemingly outcasts from normal society, they're comfortable with themselves; if you aren't, well, that's your problem. I guess that includes Wood's transvestism, which isn't shied away from. Wood's directing techniques, as played by Depp, are flat-out hilarious. I was especially appalled, in a good way, by how he directed Bela & Tor to get through a door. The cast is pretty much perfect. Landau just nails the Bela Lugosi role (he won the supporting actor Oscar), lending much poignancy to the famed actor's twilight years. When Wood gets around to creating his most famous movie, ""Plan 9 From Outer Space,""(1959) there is a sense of history being made. Was it about as bad as a movie can get? Yes, but it's still legendary. The audience has a front row seat to witness a legend being created right in front of them.Filmed in atmospheric black & white, the entire film has a bittersweet taste to it by the time it runs through a brief 'after-history' on the main players. Most of them are deceased by now, of course, and their 'careers' never really improved later. But they all had the pleasure of actually working on a movie set, as a sort of odd family. I felt I'd just seen something irreplaceable - a glimpse into a decade when dreams could be realized on the silver screen, flawed as they were. Very flawed, yes.

I was really ready for this movie, and it more than delivered. Maybe not enough of the general public knows of Ed Wood and won't take the time to learn about him. What a shame. I love this movie and know the words to all of it. Casting did something few movies ever do..... Awesome choices. The actors were the best for the roles. I can't say enough about this movie.

"A sincere tribute to the man and his work, full of bizarreness, humor, artificial octopuses and angora.","I've been wanting to see this for a while now, and the opportunity finally came. Very intelligently directed by Tim Burton, it is a brief biography that honors Ed Wood, reckoned as the worst director Hollywood has ever known (although that title is disputed by other more recent directors).I already knew Ed Wood's work, I've seen one or two of his films, and I can guarantee that his fame is justified: the films are the most amateurish imaginable and the number of errors and problems is such that even the general public saw the director's inability and naÃ¯vetÃ©. I won't dwell on this point, just add that this film covers the filming of ""Glenn or Glenda"", ""Bride of the Monster"" and ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". As is typical of Burton's films, there is a certain amount of bizarreness which makes the most sincere homage to Ed Wood's work. One notices, implicitly, a certain sympathy or admiration for the director, who never achieved fame (at least, positive) and to whom success has eluded. He is a man with a vision and a dream, but without any ability to achieve it and who, even so, never gave up.Johnny Depp was a smart choice for the protagonist. The actor likes unusual roles and portrayed Wood in a very faithful way, emphasizing his incorrigible and absolutely blind optimism, as well as his habit of dressing like a woman and the problems that caused him in being taken seriously. There is, in the character, a certain bizarre fetish about angora fabrics that I don't know if it was real, but it fit very well. I also really liked Martin Landau, a very respectable veteran who fit wonderfully into the role of Bela Lugosi, the mythical horror actor who was forgotten by the industry towards the end of his life and succumbed to morphine addiction and depression, and Lisa Marie, who played Maila Nurmi, Finnish actress famous for her character Vampira. Sarah Jessica Parker also did an impeccable job as Wood's girlfriend. Jeffrey Jones does a good job as Criswell, a fake psychic famous for his TV appearances. Bill Murray appears little, but does a decent job whenever asked.The film was very well shot in black and white, and I believe this fit better with the spirit of the film, and the way it was designed. There is a beautiful limpidity and the cinematography is very crafted and stylistically rich. The film plays a lot with the difficulties that Wood encountered in filming and promoting his films, and the total amateurism with which he did so, and this is funny and, at the same time, moving. The sets and costumes are excellent, convincing, and the reproduction of the films was well done and honors the originals. The soundtrack, written by Howard Shore, does the rest and gives the film a bizarrely delicious tone. Finally, a word about the opening and ending of the film, in a style magnificently suited to cheap horror productions of the time.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
What a wonderful film,"I loved this movie, everything about it was brilliantly done. Johnny Depp showed great talent in playing Ed Wood, and all the supporting characters were also just as good, especially the Bela Lugosi character. Even though it was inaccurate in the portrayal in that he died a lonely man, I still think it was wonderful acting and a perfect cast. This is one of my favourite Tim Burton films, and I feel he has outdone himself. My favourite thing about this film was the heart Ed Wood had. I also loved the way they made a lot of subtle jokes, such as, ""Wow, you could make a whole film out of all this stock footage!"", and how the funders of plan 9 noticed the mistakes and Ed said no one would notice after he edited the film. This film was absolute genius and a joy to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"good and ghoulishly funny, one of Burton's best","Original, sweet-tempered and enjoyable movie, one of my favorites out of Burton's oeuvre. Ignored in life, mocked in death, Edward D. Wood Jr. was a real phenomenon in American cinema history, especially famous for his Z-budget filmmaking. Making a biopic about such a schlocky visionary reputed as the worst director of all-time is just a groovy idea, which only Tim Burton dares to do it.Shot beautifully in moody black & white, the film centers on Wood's most ""prolific"" period, when he relentlessly churned out one movie after the next, from his 1953 beyond-awful debut ""Glen or Glenda"" to his ""groundbreaking"" 1959 sci/fi ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". Paying a final tribute to this idiosyncratic director, Burton opts to portray Wood and his misfit menagerie in an over-exaggeratedly sympathetic way, not to depict the darker side of his life. The film ends before his slide into porn, misery and alcoholism. The film charts Wood's tragi-comic career: his flagrant ineptitude as a writer, producer and director; his efforts to beat the bushes for cash; his indifferent, hyper-enthusiastic and over-optimistic disposition against all kinds of professional and personal setbacks; his sheer passion and child-like naivetÃ©; his transvestite tendencies with a particular taste in fluffy Angora sweaters, blond wigs and high heels; and lastly his strange friendship with 70-year old sepulchral Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi.The film is hilarious and witty from beginning to end, especially the recreation of certain scenes from Wood's original work (e.g. Lugosi's fight with a flaccid rubber octopus puppet and graveyard scene of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"") are hysterically funny. But such a film desperately needs a some degree of gravity. The relationship and chemistry between Wood and Lugosi is the emotional core of the film. Johnny Depp gives a sympathetic and charismatic portrayal of Wood. But, this is Martin Landau who really steals the show, and he is the glue that holds the movie together. His performance is dazzling, conveying the ego, pathos, pride and real dignity of the former horror hero Bela Lugosi. This is the role which won him Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and he really deserved it.To me, ""Ed Wood"" shows that life is not merely about success, fame or money; but rather about your creative spirit, and how much you cling to your principles and how much you love what you do. Burton portrays Wood as a winner, because he dared to make films yet he had absolutely no gift when it comes to filmmaking. Today, despite the fact that his films are used as a benchmark that the most awful films are measured by, that's not the problem at all.The wonderful irony of the film is that it won two Oscars with the name ""Ed Wood"" written on it :)",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
That Look,"That inner light in Johnny Depp's eyes as he watches Plan 9 says it all. What a terrific film! What a wonderful character study of a complex failure. In his own perverse way, Ed Wood is heroic. I love the scene where Sarah Jessica Parker's chiropractor meets her in the restaurant and Wood instantly sees the new Lugosi.The black and white print was so luminous, it almost jumped off the screen. And I love the way Burton avoided schmaltzy nostalgia for a time gone by. Burton seemed to reach a certain Epiphany with this film and, to me, has never hit these heights again. The final 'where are they now' epilogue brought the film to a proper conclusion.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Ingenious comedy with memorable characters,"I'll confess that though I'm familiar with Ed Wood's body of work, I've never actually seen one of his films.  Tim Burton's portrayal of a man who truly loves the movies and is living his dream almost makes me want to watch Plan 9....This is a great movie, though.  The acting is superb all around, and while there are not a lot of big laughs in the film, the movie oozes warm, good-natured humor.  How can you not love the always chipper Ed Wood (played by Johnny Depp) or sympathize with the washed-up, but once great Bela Lugosi (played by Martin Landau, who won an oscar)?The only flaw in the movie is that things seem to come togther  a little too neatly.  For example, there is a scene where Ed is eating at a restaurant with his new wife (or is she still his girlfriend then?).  In walks her chiropractor who moments later gets the role as body-double for Bela. Somehow, I don't think events worked so quickly and neatly in real life. Still, the movie is a comedy, not an informative (though it often is) documentary on Ed Wood.  It almost seems fitting that events in his life come together with unbelievable ease, since most of his movies operated the same way (or so it seems).  If Ed wood were to make a movie of his life, I don't think he spend an hour introducing the chiropractor and setting up his meeting with the young director.I give it a 9/10 and a strong recommendation.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Enjoyable and pretty funny!,"Once again, I was surfing the 300 channels when I saw this was playing. I heard about this movie's academy awards and like most of those kind of movies. So I watched this movie, mostly because I like Johnny Depp and Tim Burton, and found myself watching a very good movie.Like any Tim Burton movie, it's different in a good way. Its unique style of writing, characters, and humor stand out among the other movie. Oh, and speaking of humor, I think it's funny. Like where he tells his girlfriend that he likes to wear women clothing, she responds ""So you don't like sex with girls"", which he says ""No, I love sex with girls!"" It's funnier than it sounds here, since you have to see it to understand.I feel the actors did a good job in their roles. My favorites were Johnny Depp and especially Martin Landau, with guys like Bill Murray close behind. It was strange that it was done in black and white, but I guess Tim thought it was good.Overall, despite some harsher than usual words, it was a funny Tim Burton movie.Rating: 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Burton's work of love,"Depp continues to prove that he is one of the best, and most underrated actors in the biz and ever for that matter.  Tim Burton was the perfect person to direct a biopic about such a wierd and cultish director and coaxes the best only best performances out of his actors in this fine piece of work.  Depp plays the part with just the right amount enthusiasim and energy.  And Landau as Legousi, while not a physical match (who is)is excellent as the ageing junkie who had no respect for Boris Karloff.  A must see for Burton, Depp, and even Ed Wood fans. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Something quite beautiful,"I did not really know too much about Tim Burton until I watched this film but it made me realise just how brilliant the man is. After seeing this film I used IMDb to find out more about his career and discovered he had directed several films which I thought were great. If you love films you will love Ed Wood. It is beautiful. Granted, Johnny Depp's contribution should not be taken for granted (where's the Oscar?) but Burton creates something so wholesome it makes you believe that something good will always come from something bad! This film even reaffirmed my faith in Father Christmas! If you need a bit of optimism in your life then Ed Wood is the best medicine for you. Watch it, love it, think about it all the next day, it's that kinda film!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
An extremely funny film about a real life director.,"A film about Ed Wood, who was supposed to be 'the worst director of all time', does not sound too promising.

This is an extremely funny, and well made film, that I can't recommend enough.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The (best) movie about the 'worst' director,"Ed Wood is a hilarious film, detailing the film career of the titular director through his many failures that could, only in hindsight, be viewed equally as his successes.Johnny Depp's portrayal of Edward D. Wood Jr. Was near flawlessly entertaining, and endlessly fun to watch as we watch him getting in and out of predicaments, resulting in hilariously bad films to be produced. The supporting cast are all great, embodying the persona's of the 'celebrities' really well. The 1950s setting, dialogue, and costumes were all detailed and executed effectively. The black-and-white aesthetic, as well as the performances, felt like they're purposefully replicating either Ed Wood's style or actual scenes, with the film ultimately seeming to play out as if it were an 'Ed Wood' film itself.Of course with it being a biography, an easy nitpick is that it's not completely entirely accurate, but it's a minor overlooked fact that didn't get in the way of the overall experience.Regardless of how close to the truth this biography is, it manages to be more entertaining than most, delivering constant laughs through its quirks and scenarios that (mostly) actually happened.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Eternal optimist in an angora sweater,"This is a very well done film about a very strange man and his even stranger entourage.Ed Wood made up for in optimism what he lacked in talent.To say he was a hack film screenwriter/director is being kind.He had no talent and didn't know it. But he never gave up.Burton's film follows Wood from his first film to his cinematic ""masterpiece "" Plan 9 From Outer Space"".Martin Landau gives a deserved Oscar winning turn as the drug addicted washed up Bela Lugosi.No doubt great many liberties were taken with Lugosi such as his extreme bitterness toward Boris Karloff.Also the scene where Lugosi is wrestling with the octopus in the middle of the night is pure dramatic license.(Watch Bride Of The Monster and you can tell that isn't Bela.The cast is wonderful and this is a film to catch by all means.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Ed Wood is celebrated, made fun of, applauded, and mocked,","Ed Wood as we all now is one of the worst but best filmmakers of all time. Watch Plan 9 From Outer Space, or Bride of the Monster and you'll see what I'm talking about. Well this movie does it's best to celebrate Wood and mock him at the same time. It does this perfectly. We see Wood (Johnny Depp) interact with his friends who among others include Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau) the tired old film actor now watching his life fall down. The film showcases the making of Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster, and Plan 9 From Outer Space. It shows the films being made, it shows the scripts being written, and it shows the interaction between Wood and Lugosi. Now while it shows the making of the film it shows the mistakes made by Wood, and it shows his incompetence. For example there's a scene where Wood is acting in Glen or Glenda, then they see a police car and run away because they don't have a permit. So yes it's funny, and it's even endearing at times. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in going into filmmaking.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Delightful film about a fascinating subject,I have always avoided horror films and material about them until meeting this biography on IMDb. Suddenly I see what the genre is about. Depp is fantastic in the role of Ed. His angora'd girl friend is so soft and fuzzy. Bill Murray is naturally great. The direction and cinematography are excellent. The attempt to be horrible is outrageously comical.This is about a small collection of real people doing what Hollywood does and doing it badly but very really. Only the Bela Luigi part seemed hammy. Maybe a serious addict could be like this in tinsel town. An Oscar was awarded for it but that often doesn't correlate with art. You can feel the desperation to get into production and through the final scene before the resources are spent.Appealing to the Southern California Baptists for production costs is a scream. The story has only one possible ending and there it lands.The art of life is never better presented. Ed Wood is Hollywood's Hamlet.,9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Who Woodn't Enjoy This Film,"This film comes from the talented director Tim Burton. Burton has done many good films including: Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish, and even Mars Attacks was enjoyable with its over the top humor and fun. But Ed Wood is a different type of film. Unfortunately, Ed Wood did not get the box office results that was hoped, but it did get him critical acclaim and rightly so. Ed Wood is a biopic about the notorious director Edward D. Wood Jr. Who is responsible for such films as Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster, and of course the infamous Plan 9 from Outer Space. However, Tim Burton does not try to show how bad of a director Ed Wood was, but rather how enthusiastic and how great of a man he was. The movie is a comedy/drama, and it can be hilarious at times, and also be just a down right great movie at other times.This movie's strongest and weakest points are it's acting. Jonny Depp did a splendid depiction of Mr. Wood and he was perfect for the role. Martin Lundau was perhaps the greatest virtue of this movie. Portraying Bela Lugosi, Lundau did a phenomenal job being both funny and dramatic. He won the Oscar for this role and is almost believable as Lugosi himself. There are also some good acting from Sarah Jessica Parker. So if you are a Sex in the City fan, or even if you aren't, you will enjoy her performance. Bill Murray fans may also want to check this movie out, for his performance is brilliantly played and also can make you laugh as Bill Murray always can. Unfortunately, George ""The Animal"" Steele and Lisa Marie did not have the best performances. However, their characters, Tor Johnson and Vampira, were still enjoyable.Tim Burton's directing was exquisite and precise and the music was an added enjoyment. I'm glad Tim Burton was the one to direct this movie. In a way, Tim Burton is just a more successful version of Ed Wood. They both got a chance to befriend their mentors at the end of their life. They both enjoy science fiction. This is perhaps Tim Burton's best film and it is probably due to Tim Burton's similarities to Ed Wood.In conclusion, this is a piece of masterful cinema. It has both the power of making you laugh and bring you almost to the point of tears. If not for all the great talents and performances in this movie, original Ed Wood fans and fans of old films should not miss this film either. This movie is a definite must see and will not disappoint you.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of my favorite movies - more than just a comedy,"This movie was excellent!  The screenplay, direction, and period flavor were nearly perfect, and Martin Landau, Johnny Depp, Jeffrey Jones, and others were all perfectly cast.  The film is by turns comedic, dramatic, and inspiring.  Perhaps only film lovers such as myself can truly appreciate this film, but it should be seen by all.  Seeing Plan 9 From Outer Space prior to viewing Ed Wood helps a lot in getting many of the jokes, but it's not 100% necessary.  The scenes from Wood's films are painstakingly recreated, and the black-and-white cinematography is beautiful to look at. Francois Truffaut once said that he was only interested in films that show the joy of making cinema or the agony of making cinema - this film does both.  Warning: not to be mistaken for a documentary recreation, since it plays fast and loose with the facts of Wood's life.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

great film about the 'worst director ever',"One of the best thing Hollywood makes is films about Hollywood. Some may judge these movies like kind of acts of self-adulation, but the fact is that films dedicated to films making and even homage films about past stars and directors resulted into many remarkable creations from the classical Sunset Boulevard to recent films like Hitchcock to remember just the one recent film in the genre I happen to remember now. These films have in common a dose of nostalgia for the times past and a lot of respect for the creators who preceded them. Even when they contain a dose of critical nuances or they describe disputable characters in the history of American film making like is the case with Tim Burton's Ed Wood they still carry a dose of reverence and fraternity across the generation. All this is very visible in this film of Burton which is almost hard to believe that was made 20 years ago, so fresh and contemporary it looks. In Burton's filmography it may be one of the less 'rebelious' movies, yet it contains its dose of inventiveness and the sure mastering the skills of film making.Ed Wood (the real character) was - arguably - the 'worst director' in the history of film-making. There are certainly many great contenders to Wood for this title. Most of the IMDb ratings for his movies range between 3 and 4, with a deep dive to 2.2 and a stellar 6.2 for one of his latest films. Yet Burton's film shows him as a man of passion, and a fighter with the system and the big studios sharks (BTW - I am waiting for a great film about Hollywood producers!). One of the scenes to remember in the film is the one of the meeting of Wood with Orson Welles. The (problematic) message of the scene is that all directors - genius or trash - had to fight the same problems and the same system. The difference between them is of course that one had a huge talent, the other had just a daring character and a charming personality that allows us to sympathize with him while he is following and partly achieving his dream of creating trash on screens.It does help of course that the lead role is played by Johnny Depp, the permanent fetish leading star of Burton. He is rendering the character of Wood in its whole complexity, oddity, tenacity and charm. It is however the splendid re-enacting of Bela Lugosi by Martin Landau that caught my full attention. A great star of the horror-fantasy movies of the 30s, Bela Lugosi was all but forgotten, in poverty and sunk in drug addiction when Ed Wood re-discovered him in the 50s and allowed him a few last presences in his films. Ed Wood the movie is to a large extent the story of the friendship between the two men. Filming in black and white also gives style and quality to the film, and reminds us that The Artist may have rediscovered the silent film, but not the black and white movies. If Ed Wood did not create any quality on screen during his activity in Hollywood he has at least inspired a film which is much better than anything he made as a director.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A very good film about a very bad director,"When you hear names like Ford, Hitchcock, Scorsese, and Spielberg in discussions about who the best director in movie history is, you are not going to hear the name Ed Wood mentioned with them. Edward D. Wood, Jr. is considered by many to be the worst director ever, and this film tells his story.Set in Hollywood in the middle part of the 1950s, Wood's goal is to direct, following in the footsteps of his hero, Orson Welles. He embarks on his quest, and at this time happens to meet the legendary Bela Lugosi, who has no money and has been battling a drug addiction for many years. The two become friends and eventually collaborate on several Wood films.With Lugosi in the mix, Wood and his group of friends begin filming movies that have been rated among the worst in cinematic history. However, the young filmmaker has a never give up attitude. He loves the movies, and feels that this is his calling, and just keeps working.The movie is very enjoyable to watch. The acting is very good, with Johnny Depp doing a great job as Wood, and Martin Landau giving an unforgettable performance as Lugosi. Landau would go on to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for this role, and it was deserved. The script is well written, with several memorable lines spoken throughout the film's duration. Not only that, the characters are interesting. None of them are weak. The opening credits pay homage to the movie's main subject (you'll understand if you've seen Wood's movies. If you haven't, you'll see what I mean later in the film). Fittingly, the movie, like all of Wood's, is shot in black and white. ""Ed Wood"" is an example of quality movie-making. Directed by Tim Burton, who deserves praise for this film, ""Ed Wood"" is a movie that you should not miss.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Edward D. Wood Jr. was just awfully great,"It is clear from this movie that Tim Burton is a big fan and admirer of Ed Wood's career (this and of course Mars Attacks). The movie was made with such an enormous amount of affection that clearly shows on the screen. Ed Wood is portrayed as this endlessly optimistic filmmaker who doesn't mind that his movies are way below average, he loves them and that's what counts in the end.The one performance that really jumps right into your face when watching this movie is the role of Bela Lugosi, played to perfection by Martin Landau. His portrayal of the legendary horror actor was very moving and sincere. Of course Johnny Depp was awesome as always in the role of Ed Wood, his wide-eyed fervor while pitching his scripts is hilarious.I especially loved the ""cameo"" of Orson Welles, this was done to such great believability that it was hard to see that this was really Vincent d'Onofrio sitting there playing the legendary director.This is a must for anybody who recognizes that Ed Wood's movies are both hilariously bad and on the other hand a lesson that everybody can make movies if you just don't think about it too much. He is the only man who could have said that in every film encyclopedia he has gotten no stars whatsoever but still has cult status. Hail the king of crap!!!9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the most underrated films of the last 15 years,"ED WOOD is the best overall film Tim Burton has ever directed, in my opinion.What's the greatest thing about it? The acting from all corners, the pacing in the directing and editing choices, the beautiful black-and-white photography, and the story setting are all superb. But the very best feature of this film is its tone. It's hard to combine the comedy of the hilarious/ridiculous scenarios that Ed Wood found himself in while embarking on a career as the Worst Director of All Time, while also showing the failure and tragedy of that career where that label was richly deserved. There are moments in ED WOOD, like Ed's explanation of why he doesn't want to re-do a shot where Tor visibly shakes the soundstage's formation and his efforts to get Bunny to not over-camp his PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE role, that are as funny as anything I've seen at the movies. And then there's genuine drama and sadness, in the relationship between Ed Wood and Bela Lugosi, that's a perfect 10 on the dramatic side of the scale.The fact that this movie is ensconced on the IMDB Top 250 is sort of poetic justice. When it came out in 1994, it was quickly eclipsed by THE SPECIALIST and STARGATE, both of which made scores more at the box office than this film did. The only film of that period to get both critical and commercial super-status was PULP FICTION. After about seven years, it's great to see this film, along with THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and QUIZ SHOW, getting the recognition it deserves. This is a movie where history has given the right verdict.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Holy Wood!!,"While the majority of biopics focus on personalities who were the best and/or the most popular in what they did, ""Ed Wood"" tells the story of the man who is considered today as the worst filmmaker of all time. It must be said right away that the life of Edward D. Wood, Jr. is far more interesting and fascinating than those of many other popular Hollywood legends and this movie shows why.For starters, Wood was a filmmaker who defined himself as a writer-director-actor-producer, much like his idol Orson Welles. However, unlike Welles, Wood didn't have any magic touch, he never showed any visible talent in his movies, should it be his own or those of his faithful associates.Ed Wood is played here by Johnny Depp, in what might probably be his best dramatic performance ever. Wood is portrayed here as a fiery film buff who is well decided to leave his mark in Hollywood. His main characteristic is his unequaled optimistic attitude and this attitude pushes him to go forward, even in front of the most insuperable problems. He is always able to find a ray of sunshine inside the most devastating reviews. But in a movie like ""Ed Wood"", the hardest thing to do would be to find some negative in such a genius and entertaining film.""Ed Wood"" is directed by Tim Burton, probably the most weirdo of all mainstream Hollywood directors and the most capable of presenting the life of Wood and his motley crew of misfit collaborators in the most adequate way possible. Besides Wood, we can find the veteran star of ""Dracula"" Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau), drag queen Bunny Breckinridge (Bill Murray), the ""amazing"" Criswell (Jeffrey Jones), Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson (real-life wrestler George Steele) and TV show host Vampira (Lisa Marie).The actors are fantastic in the sense that they are able of recreating such bad acting roles with that much conviction. Once Burton's camera starts rolling, we can see their real talent in front of us, but when Wood's camera starts rolling, they become pathetic, unconvincing and they deliver the Wood-written lines without even realizing their absurdity.The movie is shot in black-and-white, which is frankly the only logical option for this kind of motion picture. Honestly, how could we imagine in color those sets that we can only see in black-and-white? How could we possibly imagine ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" in color? The recreation of Wood's turkeys is simply perfect. The story is set in the 1950s, the era where Wood directed his worst projects: ""Glen or Glenda?"", ""Bride of the Monster"" and ""Plan 9"".The 1950s, it must be said, represent the golden era of the Z-movies in Hollywood. Although there have been many classics, like ""A Streetcar Named Desire"", ""High Noon"" and ""Ben-Hur"", this era is much remembered for those horror and science fiction flicks interested in the atomic age and monsters derived from it. Besides Wood's masterpieces, we can also mention ""The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms"", ""It Came From Beneath the Sea"" and the Japanese opus ""Gojira"".The 1950s is also an era where the studio system still prevails and the directors are always at the mercy of the producers who are the supreme authority and they own a veto over every aspect of the movies. And it can even go well outside of the movie. For example, in the ""Bride of the Monster"" making, Wood is forced to modify his cast and even his ending in order to meet the requirements of his main financier. And for ""Plan 9"", he must go under baptism (and so must his friends), so a group of Baptists will finance the picture. This adds even more to the incredible, as if the movies were not enough.Even if ""Ed Wood"" contains numerous scenes showing the stupidity and the lack of talent of the protagonists, there's still some fair level of intelligence emerging from the picture and some goofy statements suddenly become full of sense. For example, Bela Lugosi, even if he's been addicted to morphine for twenty years and lost nearly every bit of his talent since he made ""Dracula"", is able to deliver some interesting utterances, such as why the Dracula character is more interesting than the Frankenstein character and why women should love the classic 1930s horror movies from Universal.The actors from the movie are all tremendous, but two of them clearly stand above the others. Johnny Depp plays his Ed Wood role in an immaculate way. He knows how to write a script, how to shoot a picture and he's able to detect some qualities in people that very few would be able to see. That's why he casts Loretta King (Juliet Landau) just by watching her commanding in a restaurant.Depp also seems to be very comfortable when comes the time of wearing women's clothing, just like Wood did in real life as a transvestite.In the case of Martin Landau, the scale of his (Oscar-winning) performance is difficult to surround. Simply said, he is better as Lugosi than Lugosi himself was. His Hungarian accent is perfectly convincing and he delivers very interesting quotes (""This is the most uncomfortable coffin I've ever been in""). His relationship with Wood is touching and extraordinary. Lugosi finally meets someone who still believes in him and who is able to find him some new work.""Ed Wood"" is without a doubt the greatest Tim Burton movie for the moment. The Ed Wood story couldn't have been directed by anybody else than him. Instead of ridiculing Wood, which would have been too much easy and far less interesting, Burton seems to celebrate him and making him a symbol for those who idolize movies and absolutely want to leave their mark in Hollywood, whatever the result be good or not. ""Ed Wood"" is the ultimate proof that cinema is far more than a job and an art. It's mysticism.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A treat to watch.,"Certainly one of director Tim Burtons' very best films, ""Ed Wood"" takes an unlikely candidate for the feature film biography treatment: Edward D. Wood, Jr., a man who at least had the distinction of being voted the worst filmmaker of all time, and who had given us a movie that has been cited as the worst movie of all time, ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"". Mr. Wood wasn't bursting with talent, and worked with minuscule budgets, but he didn't let these things stop him from making the movies that he wanted to make.Now, this isn't all-encompassing as a biography; it doesn't go into Woods' origins or childhood, basically focusing on his career. We see him as he starts on the stage and soon works his way into the motion picture business, choosing a project (to become ""Glen or Glenda"") that was near and dear to his heart. From then on, it's fascinating to watch as he goes through the process of filming another classic howler, ""Bride of the Monster"", and the notorious ""Plan 9"", and comes to be good friends with the drug addicted and impoverished horror icon Bela Lugosi.It's to the credit of Burton and crew, such as production designer Tom Duffield and cinematographer Stefan Czapsky, that this movie has such a wonderful look. Shot in black & white, ""Ed Wood"" is a delight in the way it takes us back to '50s era Hollywood and the prospect of shooting low low budget efforts back in those days. The story is compelling and just draws the viewer right in. Wood is an easy character to like; Johnny Depp is completely convincing as the man whose passion exceeds his abilities.But Martin Landau and Rick Baker truly take your breath away with the way they bring Bela Lugosi to life. Landau immerses himself in the role, and Bakers' makeup is so perfect, that one can forget that they're watching a performance and totally buy that this is Lugosi. Both men definitely deserved the Academy Awards that they won as a result.The entire cast makes vivid contributions, with many familiar faces on hand - Sarah Jessica Parker as Dolores Fuller (Woods' girlfriend when we first meet him), Patricia Arquette a new acquaintance who becomes his wife, Jeffrey Jones the phony, priceless psychic Criswell, Lisa Marie as TV horror host Vampira, George ""The Animal"" Steele as Tor Johnson, Brent Hinkley as Conrad Brooks, Max Casella as Paul Marco, and Bill Murray as Bunny Breckinridge. (There are also cameos by the real Brooks, as a bartender, and Gregory Walcott, the hero of ""Plan 9"", as a potential backer.)The scene where Wood runs into none other than Orson Welles (a very good Vincent D'Onofrio) is a true gem, especially when Welles bemoans the impositions made on him regarding his film ""Touch of Evil"".We don't really learn that much about Wood by the time the movie is over, but it's entertaining enough to make up for that. A funny, and sometimes profane, script, by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, helps, as does the obvious affection Burton has for his subject, right down to the way the opening credits are done.

Special but definitely worth a watch,"Let me say one thing first: It's one of those movies, that I might not rewatch a lot but I'm glad I've seen it. Especially great is the direction by Tim Burton and the acting all around. The black and white visuals might not be for everyone, I for myself think the movie looks great and that black and white fits it perfectly. The story does have a few oddities and lengths but for the most part it's unique and interesting and sometimes even quite inspirational and hopeful. I like how it balanced out the more heavy themes without ever making them lose significance.That being said, it's not the perfect 10/10 movie for me personally but I can see it being that for others. I had a good time watching it though. I'll rate it 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best of the worst,"Ed Wood was the best bad Hollywood film maker. It takes a particular genius to create truely aweful films, films that are so bad, they are almost great.Ed Wood (the movie) is a wonderful homage to a truely bad film maker. Made, ironically, by one of cinemas great film makers.Tim Burton has an obvious affection for Wood and his bizzare entourage. He doesn't make fun of them, rather presenting them as eccentric and unusual; colourfull and rather charming.The film follows Wood's professional career from backlot worker to his 'masterpiece' Plan 9 from Outer Space. This is not a film about failure, rather it is a celebration of the human creative spirit. Wood's indominitable belief in himself and his actors raises him to majestic heights, particularly his relationship with Bela Lugosi.Beautifully shot in crisp black and white, the film is almost a pastiche of fifties B movies; the script and acting are wonderfully wooden. It's to Burton's credit that he carries this of so well.The cast are a joy to watch, in particular Bill Murray as the failed transsexual, Jeffrey Jones as Cresswell, a ham psyhic and Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Landau's preformance is a revelation after some of his hamier preformances in bad 70s' TV shows.Ed Wood is a film for all lovers of film, good or bad. It not only tells the story of Ed Wood, it captures the magic of a movie maverick.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
How anyone could give this less of a rating then a 10 is beyond!!,"I like to find out a lot about directors but this movie tells more then you would expect. Director Edward D. Wood Jr.(Depp) is an eccentric man with many ideas that are a little good (and very moronic), and this movie helps you find out about them. The movie of Wood's which backround is 'Glen or Glenda'. If you ask me 'Glen or Glenda' was the stupidist idea any moron could ever think of. The funny thing is Wood thought it would ""grab people"" even though hardly anyone saw this the ones that did probably really hated the so-called film. But the movie isn't about 'Glen or Glenda' it's about Ed Wood, his friends, and his career. One such friend was Bela Lugosi (Landau) Star of great movies such as 'Dracula' and 'The Black Cat'. Some of the funny things are about how much Bela hates Boris Karloff. Calling Karloff a s.o.b. and other vulgar words he shows he hates him. Another film of Wood's which I say was a lot better was 'Bride of the Monster' (a.k.a. Bride of the Atom) which stars Bela Lugosi, Tor Johnson (George ""The Animal"" Steele), and more of Wood's friends. After that he made a film named 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' in which because of Lugosi's death Wood used a double for Lugosi and made the movie keeping the doubles face covered. I won't say anymore about the plot. Tim Burton did a terrific job and stars Johhny Depp, Martin Landau, Patricia Arquette, and Sarah Jessica Parker turn in great performances.RENT ""ED WOOD"" TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Delightful and Well-Acted,"Ed Wood is a wonderful, quirky movie. Martin Landau gave a remarkable performance as Bella Lugosi.  The film was well acted, well scripted, and well directed.

One Mad Genius Salutes Another,"Vies with ""Edward Scissorhands"" as my favorite Tim Burton film -- though ""Scissorhands"" wins in a squeaker.Burton was not above poking fun at infamous good bad movie director Wood, but you can tell he also obviously has some affection for the guy, and even admires his dedication to the craft. That makes all the difference in this movie, which could have been a glib if enjoyable comedy, and becomes in the hands of Burton something touching, a tribute from one mad genius to another.Johnny Depp gave us an early indication of his talent for playing crazy eccentrics, but it's Martin Landau, in a tour de force performance as washed up movie actor Bela Lugosi, who you will remember most.The film looks great in black and white, and has a terrific opening credits sequence.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
What  A Gem,"I have to say that I was blown away by this movie. I mean you have all the right stuff in it. A veteran actor like Martin Landau who out does himself as the struggling, junkie actor Bela Lugosi...You have fan favorite Johnny Depp in probably his best role ever. His voice, his peppy behavior and of course his false teeth are simply outrageous. Also, not too mention great supporting roles by both Sarah Jessica Parker and Bill Murray...Every actor captures what I'm sure these people were like. I find it hard to believe how somebody cannot laugh out loud at the times when Johnny Depp is so excited about a terrible and rushed scene that he just shot (which happens a lot throughout the movie, so lots of laughs will be had.) Also, add in the brilliant eye that Tim Burton has in directing his movies. This film just got me that much more excited about the new Willy Wonka movie..Depp and Burton create masterpieces when they team up..Do not hesitate to see this movie and I didn't want to add too many spoilers on this one because I do not want to spoil anything for any potential viewers...A remarkable movie over all...10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unforgettable Ed Wood,"Tim Burton shows us an Ed Wood who is outwardly bizarre, with his penchant for transvestism, but actually has many ""everyman"" traits.  He loves women physically and is inspired by them emotionally, he loves his work and is determined to find his niche in the world.  Johnny Depp is excellent displaying Ed's manic enthusiasm and innocent love of filmmaking.  He is saddled with low budgets and knowing that time is literally money takes shortcuts in the process which are hilarious to see. Ed takes delight in making ""B"" movies in his own unique style. This style befuddles some of his assistants, financiers and his first girlfriend, and results in many unintentionally funny films and hilarious directions to his cast. Martin Landau captures the desperation and wounded pride of Bela Lugosi very well. He also has some of the funniest lines of dialogue while preparing or filming scenes. Ed's friendship with the drug-addicted Bela is truly touching. This film has it all and I will never forget it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fun Take to Bring the Story of this Odd Character to Life,"This is a movie that I vaguely remember coming out. I'll be honest, I didn't have any interest in seeing it until I got older. Seeing that this was a Tim Burton and Johnny Depp team up that I hadn't seen was intriguing to me. Learning more about who Ed Wood was in real life has helped. At the time of writing this, I had only seen two of his movies. As a director, I've seen Bride of the Monster. As a writer, I've seen most of Orgy of the Dead. Jaime and I watched this for our podcast, JwaC Presents Depp Dive: A Depper Look at Johnny's Feature Filmography.Synopsis: ambitious but troubled movie director Edward D. Wood Jr. (Depp) tries his best to fulfill his dreams despite his lack of talent.I'm doing a full review of this due to this movie being listed in the Horror Show Guide Encyclopedia, considering this to be a 'horror film' due to the titular character mostly making movies in this genre. We start out seeing Ed as he is working for a small studio and is directing a play. What turns his life around is when George Weiss' (Mike Starr) production company is looking to make an early exploitation film about a person getting a sex operation change. Ed applies to be the director, but he has no clout and is denied.What turns things around for him is meeting Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau). He is down on his luck and we will learn about his drug addiction as this goes on. Ed wants to help him and sees an opportunity to get the director's position for this film. His original pitch revealed that he's a transvestite. Now he's able to use Bela as a bargaining chip.The movie he made there was Glen or Glenda and this strains the relationship with George. Ed now has momentum and we see as he goes about getting his next movie made. This is the one I've seen, Bride of the Monster, but during production it was called Bride of the Atom. Ed has a team he uses including his girlfriend Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker), Bunny Breckinridge (Bill Murray), Paul Marco (Max Casella), Conrad Brooks (Brent Hinkley), his cinematographer Bill (Norman Alden) and makeup guy Harry (Leonard Termo). Along the way he'll meet Loretta King (Juliet Landau), who strains his relationship with Dolores. He also meets a wrestler, Tor Johnson (George 'The Animal Steele) and even Vampira (Lisa Marie). Ed Wood has the dream and the drive, but as the synopsis says, he might be lacking the eye for talent.That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I want to start is that I feel bad piling on the real person of Ed Wood. He did something that I'll never do. I know what he made was schlocky and he didn't fully understand how to make a good movie, but credit to him for still doing what he could. Now everything that I'll say from here is going to be looking at this as a fictional piece of work.Since this is more of a character study of Ed, Bela and their relationship, that is where I want to delve. Depp does a great job at being this quirky guy. Now I've not read the biography that this is using as source material. I've also not seen interviews or anything of this real person. What I do know was that he was an oddball. His movies reflect the budget that they're working with. Having now seen this, I'm intrigued more in seeing the movies that this is referencing being made now that I have insight behind the scenes. Depp was made for this role and from what I've read, Ed's real wife agreed when visiting the set.Shifting then over to Bela. He's one of my most seen actors of all time. Landau transforms into him which is impressive. I knew that there was a feud between him and Boris Karloff in real life. I'm glad they played that up. I also knew that Bela was addicted to morphine and how it ruined his career, also contributing to his death. That is heartbreaking. It seems like Ed was taking advantage of this aged star, but I don't think that was the case. He truly wanted to help him and give him work. Landau pays homage to this legend well from my point of view.Since I've been leaning into the acting here, I want to say that we have a great cast here. I'm not the biggest fan of Parker, but I like the role she plays here. There's friction as things go between her and Ed. It is also an intriguing dichotomy between her and the Patricia Arquette character that he meets later when Ed takes Bela to rehab. It is a bummer the decisions that Jones made, because he's solid in this movie and never seemed to have a bad performance. G. D. Spradlin is solid as Reverend Lemon who works with Ed. His character gets upsets Ed with decisions to the film he's making with their money. There's good cameos by Vincent D'Onofrio, Murray, Starr, Cassella, Hinkley, Marie, Steele, Juliet Landau, Alden, Termo, Bellamy and the rest of the cast. It all works to bring these people to life.All that I have left to go into is filmmaking. I thought it was a good stylistic choice to go black and white. That feels like it is paying homage to the era that Wood worked in. I thought this was lit well, which is a challenge when filming this way. The cinematography is great as well. How things are framed is great as well as capturing things that were in Wood's movies. This is limited in the effects, but it also didn't need them. The peek behind the curtain of what was used in Wood's films was another great aspect to show the charm they carry. Other than that, the soundtrack fit what was needed. I like that they used music from the films that they're showing so credit to that.In conclusion, this is a fun movie that is capturing real history. There are things left out. There are also probably things that didn't happen or were moved to another place in the timeline. Just knowing that a movie also needs to be entertaining, I'm forgiving. The acting here is great. Depp shows such range. Landau is great as Bela. There's a strong cast behind them as well. I thought that this was well-made. Special credit there to the cinematography. I'm not sure how many fans are out there for Wood today. What I'll say though is that this is an underseen Burton and Depp film, so if you're fans of them, check this out.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bela Luguosi Is Brought Back To Life In Ed Wood,"Ed Wood is an excellent biography of the life and times of a man who let nothing including lack of talent stand in his way of making movies. The viewer has to admire the spirit of this man who stands up to Hollywood and refuses to be rejected. The film is inspiring at times and always interesting. Martin Landau actually becomes Bela Lugosi mastering the voice, timing and mannerisms of the actor best known as Dracula certainly earning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. The relationship portrayed between Wood and Lugosi is heartwarming to say the least. All the characters work well together making you feel this is a true story of people who knew and worked with each other. Lisa Marie makes an excellent appearance as Vampira. The black and white filming adds to the mystique of this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant!,"One of Tim Burton's best. This movie is a fabulous retelling of the life of Ed Wood, a struggling film maker in the 1950s. Moreover, it shows the powerful bond of friendship shared between Ed Wood and the legendary Bela Lugosi. I superb movie which actually portrays the struggles of Ed Wood who was never able to make a movie worthy of appreciation during his own era.The Movie starts of very well and develops a plot almost immediately. One can see that the character of Ed Wood is very well crafted by Burton. In addition, I think the most praiseworthy part of the movie is the friendship of Ed Wood and Bela Lugosi which is very well manifested by Burton.The irony is that Bela Lugosi never won an Oscar himself and Martin Landau won an Oscar for playing Bela.Four out of Four!Brilliant!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Black-and-white, and full of colour...","ED WOOD is essentially a biopic about a guy who is listed as the 'Worst Director of All Time' and whose biggest movie PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE was labelled 'one of the worst movies ever made'. So there's no reason why this wouldn't generate a significant cult following, as viewers would flock to it 'just because...'.The movie itself, shot entirely in black-and-white, is pretty decent. The screen writing is above par and goes to great lengths to examine the complexities of directing and producing a movie with little or no capital at one's disposal. Tim Burton was suitably billed to direct this feature, and his homage to the vintage science-fiction/horror is a testament to fine movie-making. To me, Burton is just one of those guys who revels in the extraordinary.Johnny Depp is brilliant as the cross-dressing, mediocre writer/director/producer/actor Ed Wood who became renowned for the unbelievable speed with which he shot movies (not bothering to re-shoot scenes even where there are obvious flaws), but to me, the real star of the show is Martin Landau, who plays the once famous Bela Lugosi, a man who is now aging, addicted to morphine, and haunted by loneliness and lost fame. Landau deservedly picked up an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and, as Lugosi, steals almost every scene in which he appears, such that there is a considerable drop-off in excitement every time the movie switches focus away from his character. This leads me to wonder if the film should have focused more on Lugosi than Wood...The costume design, set design, and makeup are simply superb, and the Oscar won for Best Makeup was well-justified. Film-makers in the future would do well to follow the design aspects of this Motion Picture.In conclusion, the movie is slightly better-than-good, but rarely reaches the pinnacles of greatness. The nature of the subject will undoubtedly continue to draw a serious cult following and it is no surprise that this movie is featured in IMDb's Top 250 (as I write it stands at #192). The movie is quite entertaining and watchable for most of its ~125 minute run-time.Deserving of 3 stars (out of 4) and a rating of 8/10. I have no problem placing this film in my 'Honourable Mention' list. Recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Burton's best?,"Two towering performances from Johnny Depp and Martin Landau are the jewels in the crown in Tim Burton's glorious satirical biopic of Ed Wood (Depp), the so-called ""worse director of all time"". The film follows Wood as he aspires to create a big-time blockbuster, refusing to let a string of awful flops (Glen or Glenda?, The Bride of the Monster), his own cross-dressing activities and the troubles of his washed-up ""big star"" Bela Lugosi (Landau) stand in his way. Depp and Burton could have gone for the obvious - an outright mockery of Wood - but instead achieve something far richer; Wood comes across a sympathetic character whose blind determination and enthusiasm comes across as touching, even admirable. Depp's versatility as an actor is never more apparent whilst Landau fills the role of the tragic Lugosi inside out. There's little to fault here - the ending is perhaps a bit abrupt - but the film has too many merits for it to be tainted. A wonderfully entertaining movie and one of Burton's best.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
This movie changed my vision of Ed Wood.,"Unlike most of the people, i heard about Ed Wood before i heard about this movie. Somebody recommended to me Plan 9 From Outer Space, and i watched it. It was clear to me : this movie was one of the worst, if it's not the worst, movie ever. The realisation, the acting, EVERYTHING was poor! Almost a year after i decided to watch Tim Burton's Ed Wood. This movie is fabulous, and is the best work of Burton. Johnny Depp is incredible in the role of Edward Wood Junior, and Landau is perfect in Bela Lugosi. I know that the events of the movie are not really the same that really happened, but after seeing it, you cannot hate Ed Wood.You better watch it after seeing Plan 9, or reading a little bit about Ed Wood.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Burton: ""We remember, we care""","This is Tim Burton saying that no matter how many people don't care about B-horror pictures, he does, and showing us that there can be poetry in them. ""Ed Wood"" is a bio-pic of real-life B-hollywood director Edward D Wood Jr, done in the style of one of his pictures - unexplained framing devices, like Criswell's introduction, noirish lighting for no apparent reason, and incidental performances by actors who look like they've just shown up and not been told what part they're supposed to be playing. These last, like the doctor in Lugosi's hospital, are provided for colour, but are an example of the balance struck in this picture. It has the expression of a comedy - yes, we're asked to laugh at Wood's haphazard way of making pictures, and we can laugh about how terrible the pictures are, but beneath the comedy a great truth is found, and a message Tim Burton is passionate about is expressed. The heart of Ed Wood is really in the character of ""washed-up"" Dracula star Bela Lugosi (played to a tee and rewarded with an Oscar, by Martin Landau).Twenty years after Dracula, Lugosi's career was over. Nobody cared about him. It was like, as is Hollywood lore, you're only as good as the last thing you've done. And whatever classic roles or films you may have done, it all counts for nothing if you do a bad picture. This theme of the cruel way Hollywood forgets its greatest talents is also why the name Orson Welles keeps cropping up. Its not because Welles made pictures like Ed Wood's, its because, like with Lugosi, Welles's having made what is considered to be the greatest picture of all time, Citizen Kane, counted for nothing in Hollywood. If your pictures didn't make money, you were useless - so Hollywood did everything it could to keep him from working - RKO sabotaged his Ambersons, and eventually he could not get backing for many great pictures in Hollywood that, and here there is another analogy with Ed Wood, he raised money for himself and made independently. It is this determination to succeed, and persist in your work no matter what others think of it that makes Ed Wood (thanks to a terrific fun performance from Johnny Depp) such an important and admirable character. You can't help liking Ed, for his irrepressible spirit and optimism. It was Ed Wood who gave Lugosi another chance, the content of which Burton  romanticises and focuses on in his film. Ed Wood cared about Lugosi's work - Wood didn't care about popular opinion which said Lugosi was ""washed up,"" whatever that meant. Wood had seen Dracula, and Lugosi was a legend, and that was all that mattered. Wood gave him the chance to be in pictures again, symbolising the appreciation of great works, not recent moneymakers. Burton and Martin Landau give the legend of Bela Lugosi his last great performance, turning him into the tragic figure to end all tragic figures. His performance of his ""I have no home speech"" set to stirring, haunting music, on the steps of the hospital - his performance of the infamous flower-smelling scene from Plan Nine from Outer Space, the last footage Lugosi ever shot - all have the tone of appreciating a legend, giving Lugosi his due, saying who gives a sh*t if Hollywood doesn't remember, we remember.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
I Love this Movie,"I don't know what attracts me to this little gem. Maybe because it's funny or in black and white or the performances. No one could do Lugosi like that except Landau in a great performance. Depp was good too, certainly his best with Burton. This film really got touching when Lugosi died and when they played swan lake, I was really touched and at the ending. Howard Shore's score is also fantastic.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Burton's Best,"I have just seen this film and I think that it is Tim Burton's best film. Ed Wood is a bio-pic about the worst film director in Hollywood, Edward D. Wood. It is mostly a comedy, but is serious at times and is a perfect project for Burton and Johnny Depp. The film shows that Ed Wood was a struggling director who had to work at a studio as a stage hand to make ends meat. He get an opportunity to write, direct and star in movie about someone getting a sex change and able to get his hero, Bela Lugosi, to be in it. He makes a terrible film and can't find a studio to hire him. He decides to finance and produce his own films and makes a load of B-movies, which are not very good. Ed Wood is portrayed as a nice man who loves what he does and wants to be like Orson Wells. Unforuately his isn't very good at what he does. As well as the comedy in the film, there is dramatic aspects, such as Ed's transvestitism, his relationships and Bela's drug problems. The characters in this film are over-the-top but I think that it works for this film.The film was well written, has a good cast and I liked the fact that it was filmed in 1950s style and shows how the film industry works. I also liked how Ed Wood was portrayed a man that was too positive for his own good. I admit that I don't know much about the man but he most be better then Uwe Boll who is considered the worst director at the moment is just arrogant about his work and considers himself as a misunderstood man and he will never gain a cult following.Ed Wood is a good film, and if you like Tim Burton and Johnny Depp then you will like this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A great movie about the movies,"""Ed Wood"" is probably the best movie ever made about the movie business and those desperate to break in.  It is director Tim Burton's valentine to the cheesy B-movies he loved as a child, and also to those who love films so much that they are willing to do whatever they can to be a part of the film world, notwithstanding their complete lack of talent.The performances are wonderful - especially Martin Landau's remarkable turn as Bela Lugosi - and Stefan Czapsky's black-and-white cinematography is absolutely gorgeous.  What really makes ""Ed Wood"" work, however, is that Burton and his actors found exactly the right tone in their loving re-creations of Wood's awful movies.  Unlike the star-studded cast of Burton's subsequent film, ""Mars Attacks!"", where it was painfully obvious that everyone was in on the joke, the ""actors"" in the likes of ""Bride of the Monster"" sincerely believed they were making great art, and that's what makes these old movies so much fun.  Of all the ""A"" movies that have tried to duplicate this, only ""Ed Wood"" and 1993's ""Matinee"" get this right.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Sarcastic, inteligent and moving view on Ed Wood","MY RATING- 8.0To begin, it's a well-aclaimed mov here in Portugal and we have some Ed
Wood
moviegoers (thank god there isn't a lot!)It's a damn well made mov, created when Burton had finished his personal
Batman Returns, this one on the life of Edward Wood Junior, the worst
director ever.
Well I never watched a mov from Ed, and to be honnest, I don't intend to
spend my money doing so. This mov spare us the torture of it, and Burton
uses again his strange sense of humour to tell the story of a guy who was
convinced that his movs were excellent. In a way, the message is given by
Vincent D'Onofrio in a delicious cameo as Orson Welles- we must go through
with things, even if they're bad as Ed's movs.
As Ed, Johny Depp goes quite well, as well as Sarah Jessica Parker as the
girlfriend who leaves him, Bill Murray (ultrafunny!), Patricia Arquette
(very sweet), Lisa Marie Juliet Landau and Jeffrey Jones as the
omnipresent
Criswell. But the real surprise is Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, the
horror
star from 30's Dracula. Under his heavy makeup, we really forget we're
seeing an actor, he truly looks like Bela! What a performance! Impossible
not to sympathise with him, he even won the Oscar (which is quite rare in

the director's career, that will please fans and nonfans.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

An uplifting portrait of one bizarre man.,"Tim Burton takes a chronicling of the 'worst director of all time' and transforms into something far beyond that. He crafts a film about ambition and the dedication a man took in order to follow that ambition and turn it into a reality. He shows us a man who follows his dream, no matter how bad the reviews are. We see that it's not the world's dream, and it's not something that will be critically accepted in his industry but it is Ed Wood's dream and his final success of getting his picture made is one that completed his life. An uplifting tale of self-acceptance over doing things based on what other's perceive as excellent.The performances really take charge in this one. Martin Landau greatly deserved his Oscar win for his portrayal of the late Bela Lugosi. His transformation is vital to the story as it's Bela who really charges Ed's career and inspires him to become the legend he eventually became. Martin captures the drug addicted, bitter old man's essence with ease and makes us feel as if we're watching the real deal. Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette also deliver superb performances, each taking over one half of Ed's romantic life. For me though, the real star of this one was Johnny Depp. He has stated that his portrayal of Wood was a mixture of 'the blind optimism of Ronald Regan, the enthusiasm of the Tin Man from The Wizard of Oz and Casey Kasem'. As bizarre as that sounds, it looks as though he hit the nail on the head and delivers one of the best performances of his career. A true marvel to watch, as he always is for me.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

He also had his excellent turn with Michael Keaton's, Batman films (1989-1991). Ed Wood (1994), also deserves to be up there at the top of Tim Burton's directorial list. It is a film, that had to struggle to find an audience in 1994, because of the subject matter within it. It is a biopic about a man, that is only known well by movie historians, fans, buffs, junkies, whatever you want to call us. He is most popular in the horror, science-fiction, B-movie arenas of film fandom. So, this Tim Burton film would have an uphill climb, to attract a large audience to something, that was a niche novelty to some. It is a film about the greatest, worst film director ever, Edward D. Wood JR. (played remarkably well by Johnny Depp).Ed Wood (1994), is a comedic take, on a biopic, about the man, who created low-budget, science-fiction, B-movie classics, like Bride of the Monster (1955) and the infamous Plan 9 From Outer Space (1957). These movies are hailed as being the worse films ever made, but as we eventually learn, since 1957, many more horrible movies have been released, since the days of Ed Wood. It has created a cult-following, among film-buffs of Wood's and established a renewed appreciation of the man and his films. You see the worse of it in the technical, professional-side of Wood's films, while underneath, you see the passionate, emotional drive, that this man had. Tim Burton captures this aspect of the film perfectly, with incredible recreations of the sets, costumes, action and bad acting, seen in the original films.Both Burton and Depp manage to summon to the surface the sad, lost man, who only wanted to be as great as his favorite film director, Orson Welles (Vincent D'Onofrio). But, there was another hitch, that Wood's wife (Sarah Jessica Parker), couldn't handle, but his new girlfriend (Patricia Arquette), could handle. Wood had a secret, which is chronicled in his third most infamous film, Glen Or Glenda (1953), also known in its original title, ""I Changed My Sex"". Wood was a transvestite, who needed to switch into women's clothing, when he felt anxiety or stress. It relaxed him and made him more confident about himself. He is surrounded by interesting, colorful, personalities, in the guise of his cast and film crew. They are the ones, that stuck by him with help and support. We have the psychic, the Amazing Criswell (Jeffrey Jones), Wood's transvestite buddy, John ""Bunny"" Breckinridge (Bill Murray) and wrestler, Tor Johnson (George ""The Animal"" Steele).The talented supporting cast, completely nails the characters Burton wants in this film, albeit with a comedy flair. They create this world, that totally represents the pop-culture view of Ed Wood's work. The most spectacular aspect of this film and the one that won them one of two Academy Awards, was the performance of Martin Landau, as original Dracula-actor, Bela Lugosi. They also won for Best Make-Up Effects, for legendary make-up artist, Rick Baker. Martin Landau would win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and it was rightfully deserved. This film isn't just about Ed Wood. It also tells the tragic end-story of a film-icon. The last decade of Bela Lugosi's life. I man who was on top of the world in the 1930s, but was a washed-up, elderly, tragic figure by the 1950s. It is an amazing performance by Landau. Do yourself a favor. Watch Lugosi's original Dracula (1931), Wood's Glen or Glenda (1953) and either, Plan 9 From Outer Space (1957) or Bride of the Monster (1955), Do so, if you haven't seen Ed Wood (1994), yet. It will make things, so much more clearer to you.9.2 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Prince of Razzie-Calibre Schlock Portrayed in an Ed Wood-ish Style Film;  Laundau as Lugosi Steals the Show,"The 1950's and 1960's were the Golden Age of sleaze and schlock film, particularly for the drive-in movie-goers who had better things to do than actually watch the movie! And the King of All-Schlock has to be Ed Wood, voted Hollywood's Worst Filmmaker. If you're going to be bad, you might as well be the worst. No one remembers the fifth worst! Wood employed some of the strangest talent for even stranger projects, and the genius of Wood was not the production value but getting the funding! I mean, who in their right mind would fund ""Grave Robbers from Space"" after having read the script? Conservative Baptists? His one name star, Bela Lugosi, is remembered for being in some of best horror films at the dawn of the talkie age and some of the worst care of Wood.One thing to keep in mind: Ed Wood was not alone. Aside from some of Wood's more wretched offerings, such as ""Glen or Glenda"", regarded by some critics as far more unwatchable than ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", Hollywood was ripe with many memorable celluloid fiascoes. ""Robot Monster"", ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"", and (my favorite) ""The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies"" are all cult classics of bad movie-making remembered for their combination of strangeness, silliness, and unwatchable-ness. None of these were produced by Wood and yet were made during the same era.The entire era from circa 1950 to 1970 had such nutty movies that if someone wrote a novel about it, no one would believe it! At the top of the heap is the oh-so-memorable ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", so ridiculously bad that it invites after-movie conversation much more than many movies being produced today. The bad sets, the bad dialog, the bad acting are still discussed today. No one discusses films which are merely mediocre. With ""Plan 9"", schlock was elevated into its own category, probably the inspiration behind the ""Razzie Award"". ""Plan 9"" is the film by which all other schlock films are judged.""Ed Wood"" with Johnny Depp in the title role chronicles the brief career of the one producer of movies who stands on a pedestal above the rest in the museum of cheesy film production where talent didn't quite get their footprints into the Chinese Theatre. If Barney Fife (the frantic deputy from the Andy Griffith Show) wrote and directed movies, the results might be of the Ed Wood variety. Wood's writing was filled with clichÃ©, incomprehensible story lines, bad characterizations, and even worse stage direction. And yet, among his more memorable ""works"" (if works they can be called), the dialog is what we remember most. I mean who else but Wood could come up with: "" I'll bet my badge that we haven't seen the last of those weirdies."" or ""They've been like that all down through the ages. Especially in a spot like this."" Pure Razzie genius.Tim Burton's homage to the era of schlock works on every level. Ironically, A-list acting talent plays some of the most borderline ""talent"" of the era who ended up in Woods' projects basically because they didn't fit in anywhere else. The Amazing Criswell a.k.a. Criswell Predicts (played by Jeffrey Jones) was amazing because he was the one act who could appear on the Johnny Carson Show without having any talent. Vampira, who in real life later sued Elvira, had just been fired from her local television studio. Sarah Jessica Parker (of Sex in the City fame) plays Wood's girlfriend. Johnny Depp, now just about as A-list as they come, plays Wood, and highest honors go to Martin Landau as the aging Bela Lugosi in a tour-de-force performance. Lugosi never could distance himself from Dracula, and Wood was the only filmmaker in town who still appreciated the Hungarian accent and his tuxedo.Shot in B&W, ""Ed Wood"" almost feels like a slightly better Ed Wood movie. The film concentrates on three of his most remembered projects, ""Glen or Glenda"", ""Bride of the Monster"" (formerly ""Bride of the Atom""), and his masterpiece ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". There are a few moments of clichÃ© writing which almost seem purposeful, paying homage to the man who wrote the book on clichÃ©. Of course, the irony is that Ed Wood is now remembered as the pioneer of schlock movie. A few production companies do carry on the tradition, such as Troma Entertainment whose offerings have a look and feel in the Ed Wood tradition: over-the-top acting, clichÃ© riddled scripts, and low-budget sets, such as ""Surf Nazis Must Die"" and ""the Toxic Avenger"". Many of the offerings of Roger Corman are also in a similar vain. Ed Wood may or may not have been the absolute worst, but he is remembered for living and breathing film, believing his catastrophes were art.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Irony! it kills me!,"I did love Ed Wood. It is in fact one of my favorite movies. (and made by my favorite actor/director team, who made my number one favorite movie) But man, does it kill me that one of the worst filmmakers inadvertently managed to make it onto anyone's best list - a genuine one, that is, not in the Mystery Science Theater 3000 sort of way where horrid cinema is revered for its very badness (yes, i like MST3K too) - by having a movie made about his horridness.

Now all it needs is an octopus.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Remember ...,"Ed Wood is one of the clearest cases on an auteur than you can find.You would never mistake one of his films for anyone else's film.One of the things that I dearly love about this film is that it asserts that Wood's vision is just as important as Orson Welles's. This is true.Note that I'm not saying that Wood made film that were as good as Welles's. That's not the important part.There are many other things to love about this film, not the least of which is Landau's career-best performance as Bela Lugosi.But it's fundamentally worth remembering that not all badly made films are bad films.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

You Gotta Fight for your Dreams,"Only Tim Burton could agree to do a movie like this, only he could direct a movie like this.

In all its storylines and dynamics, the film pushes you to always follow your heart even if it seems difficult at times (most times), both if you're an aspiring filmmaker in Hollywood or a random guy walking down the street who feels comfortable wearing women's clothes. It was the right time for me to watch this as I am myself starting out in the craft and I could see many (unfortunate) similarities.

One of Burton's greats,"This film was a great film about a bad film maker. Edward D. Wood Jr., was a crappy film maker and alongside his faithful morphine addicted acting friend, Bela Legosi, he makes many bad films. This film is basically honoring Ed Wood and his enthusiasm towards making films. In some scenes, Bela uses some profanities, and people argue that thats not what he was really like, but I don't care, it's just a movie.I definitely recommend this film to anyone and everyone.Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, Martin Landau and Jeffrey Jones were great in this film.

Smart story of a famed moron,"If Uwe Boll makes another film he might steal the title, but so far Edward D. Wood Jr. is the biggest dumbshit to step behind a camera, common knowledge. If the Razzies began thirty years earlier, he'd win them all. It is ironic then that he is gone but NOT forgotten. Forty years later, a film maker by the name of Tim Burton (who needs no introduction) began making a name for himself. Contrary to what many think, Burton is not always colourful and bright. His early work is very dark, in fact his only film with a warm heart was Big Fish. Edward Scissorhands maybe, but it was still a dark tale.Burton knows exactly what he is doing. To make a movie about B- movies is not enough, the film itself has to look like a b-movie. The first step of course is too put it in black and white. The next step is to have everyone overact, which rarely works, but it's perfect here. Then add a lot of satire, such as the kind of random music quese that draw attention to themselves.Few actors are as diverse as Johnny Depp. He truly captures the essence of a moron, but he is almost upstaged by Martin Landau, as Bela Lugosi. The movie covers only a short chapter in Ed Wood's life, but probably the most important. In 1952, with funding of the LA Baptist church, he made Plan 9 from Outer Space (also needs no introduction). It was a triumphant moment for Ed Wood, (or so he thought). The movie ends there, but you won't forget it.Though it is not Tim Burton's Cinema D'auteur, if looked at in a different perspective from his other films, one could argue that this is his smartest film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Coupled with Johnny Depp's huge popularity, it's a great idea.As the owner of a specialty video store in Toronto, I have turned on countless customers to the life of Ed Wood.

"Brilliant, funny, and a homage to the past!","Ed Wood is one of those rare films that grows on you with each respective viewing, and since I fell in love with it the first time I saw it...it still gets better and better.  Who would have thought the career of one Edward D. Wood Jr. would become a household word practically?  I never would have believed it...but its true.  The director of such films as Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster, and his infamous Plan Nine From Outer Space is big business and world famous.  If you don't believe me, just look in any horror magazine or cult publication.  Why?  Give the credit to this film, Tim Burton, Johnny Depp and other actors, one oscar winner named Martin Landau, and one fantastically funny, sensitive and nostalgic script.  This movie has it all and it is a non-stop look at the movie business for the independent film-maker in the fifties who just happened to like dressing up as a woman and befriended interesting individuals like a man who wanted a sex change operation, a wrestler-turned-actor, a phony larger-than-life psychic, and of course one man named Bela Lugosi, forgotten by Hollywood but not gone.  Tim Burton wisely chose to do this film in glorious black and white, and the photography, lighting, and shading are first-rate.  The script bends the truth quite often about Wood and his cast of irregulars, but then again this is a film meant to entertain not instruct.  Bela, as far as horror icon Forry Ackerman knows...and who alive would know better...never swore so much as even saying a damn.  But Landau is so convincing as the aged Bela...rejected by Holloywood and lost to poverty and obscurity..that his performance has resurrected interest in Lugosi and his films, and for one time brought him more popularity than his horror crony Karloff.  This film is an experience and if you haven't see it...do so.  It is really as good as every one says.",,Anonymous,Biography
Burton sells his visual soul for a script,"Perhaps, since this movie, Tim Burton has realized that the macabre he creates is too playful in its intentions compared to what others have tried. Whenever he tries creating moods, whether in 'Apes, Batman 1 & 2, Beetlejuice, Mars Attacks!, or Edward Scissorhands, he is always trying to make something funny or lighthearted about his topics.  Imagine if Kubrick did the same, would he be so great?With Ed Wood, Burton tries to create a story about an unfathomable loser. Depp, one of the most diverse actors I have ever seen--no wonder Burton keeps using him, is wonderfully inspired, but it isn't him or anyone else dominant in the cast--not even Martin Landau--that is the standout.I am, of course, referring to Vincent D'Onofrio's fleeting moment as Orson Welles.  Had Welles himself seen it, I bet he'd have thought it was effective.  Granted, Burton strips such a vibrant character of much detail in order to make a B&W version of Robin Williams' character in Dead Poets Society.  Still, the amount of elaboration that Vincent puts into the character, even the mannerisms, make him the highlight.  He also has some great delivery with milking the audience, if they're smart enough to catch it.Burton uses his camera more like a stage appliance this time.  He probably knew that this was going to bomb upon release, but he made it anyway.  Thus he is no different than the character he is making.  The fact that Burton's movies keep winning or getting nominated for Makeup awards shows how he focuses on altering the acting element of filmmaking to create props out of people, not characters.  Best example: Beetlejuice.Overall, not as good as the IMDb rating would suggest.  I still think Batman Returns is Burton's best work.  This isn't too bad, though, for the extreme minority that it appeals to.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Bela Lugosi: Romanian, or Hungarian?","When Martin Landau did Bela Lugosi's trademark hypnotic hand gesture, he revealed the secret of it to Ed Wood, as being ""double-jointed"" and ""Hungarian.""  Bela Lugosi was born in Romania, but anybody with an adequate amount of knowledge of central europe, also knows that parts of Romania contain a significant population of ethnic-Hungarians, most of which live in...TRANSYLVANIA!(No Joke!).Throughout Romanian history there has been strife between the two peoples, in fact, during WW2, Adolf Hitler took the Transylvanian province away from Romania and gave it to Hungary. So if Lugosi was an ethnic-Hungarian, then maybe that line wasn't a goof after all.If anybody has any comments on this issue, feel free to speak up...and correct me, if you must.",,Anonymous,Biography
Perfect,"It says a lot about the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that the sole honours they accorded this film were those related to Martin Landau's -- admittedly phenomenal -- recreation of Bela Lugosi. Best Supporting Actor and Best Makeup. That's it.One must wonder how many of those people have seen Plan 9 From Outer Space, and if so, how many enjoyed it. My guess would be not many. Mercifully, Tim Burton seems of a different mind. Like me, he evidently saw Plan 9 as perhaps the most tragically hilarious film ever made -- a shining beacon of how such a total failure can ultimately be something of a success.So, proceeding in that frame of mind, this movie is a spectacular success. The script doesn't try to bite off too much; simply showcasing three of Wood's ""best"" movies, delving into his penchant for cross-dressing, and rooting itself in his friendship with Bela Lugosi. Johnny Depp is superb as the infamous Edward D. Wood Jr., embodying the desire to follow your dreams no matter what stands in your way. He never asks the audience for sympathy, no matter how bad things get. He wants only to continue his quest to make movies. This makes his ultimate fate, revealed to us in text at the end, more effective.As I said before, Martin Landau's Bela Lugosi is miraculous. He disappears totally into the character of the cripplingly drug-addicted fallen celebrity, and irresistably conveys his pain. The affection he feels for Wood for easing his pain becomes our own. Other bio-pics/comedies can only dream of this type of power.",,Anonymous,Biography
One of Tim Burton's finest.,"Ed Wood is one of the finest (possible even THE finest) films that Tim Burton has ever made. It is basically a bio-pic of 1950's film director Edward D. Wood Jnr, who today is regarded as one of the worst directors of all time. Having said that, Wood's films are more sought after today than many of his more talented counterparts and have stood the test of time with reasonable success. In the movie he idolises Orson Welles and dreams of being a successful writer/director just like him, and although many have pointed out its inaccuracies - (I only know there is inaccuracies because somebody else told me there was)- I highly recommend this movie. Prior knowledge of Wood's work is not required to enjoy the film - (I had no idea who he was when I first saw it) - as it is just a genuinely engrossing tale of a little fish in a big pond.",,Anonymous,Biography
Burton's second best movie....,"...after Batman. Usually Tim goes over the top with imaginative visuals and neglects storyline (Batman Returns, Mars Attacks!, Edward Scissorhands), but when he's focussed on bringing something to the screen, like with Batman, it works brilliantly. And this is a wonderful movie, unusually heartwarming from Burton, with great performances and great visuals. All Burton's trademarks are there - isolated central character with a bunch of strange people who follow him, weird iconography, Danny Elfman score (very Mars Attacks!-ish), great performances from his cast and returning actors - Johnny Depp played Edward Scissorhands and is in Burton's upcoming The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow, and Sarah Jessica Parker would appear in Mars Attacks!Johnny Depp as Ed Wood constantly makes silly expressions with his mouth and eyebrows - in exactly the same as Jack Nicholson did as The Joker.

Burton obviously likes that sort of thing.A wonderful movie by one of the greatest ever filmmakers about awful movies by one of the worst ever filmmakers.",,Anonymous,Biography

He is a non-judgmental saint that accepts everyone and everything as is. This is why he does not see the faults in his movies. This is why he tolerates every eccentric character and can make friends with anybody. This guy wares not only pink angora but also pink glasses !.",,Anonymous,Biography

One of the best.,"I simply loved this film. I don't see why Hollywood didn't like this film. They thought that it didn't have a happy ending (Edward D. Wood, Jr., of course, never had a mainstream audience in his life.) That's not what the film is trying to say. The moral is, no one else has to like the sort of films you make. As long as you like them, they're more priceless than any other movie.Although this does cover the most amazing segment of Wood's life, I, myself, would've liked to have seen the making of ""Night of the Ghouls"", ""The Violent Years"", or ""The Sinister Urge"". And some stories are left untouched, like the time when Tor Johnson swallowed five bottles of wine and fell unconscious, and it took a dozen men to get him to the ambulance. Still, this is a very entertaining movie. Johnny Depp is probably at his best here (he's a good neurotic), along with Martin Landau, but my favorite probably is probably a toss-up between the guys who played Conrad Brooks or Paul Marco.In short, this is a film that will appeal to any fan of the B-movie industry.Now I just wonder if there could be a biography of Coleman Francis or Roger Corman . . .",,Anonymous,Biography
"Love it or hate it, ya gotta see it!","Several weeks ago a director who won an Oscar in the 1940's died, and I didn't recognize his name or his achievements. Ed Wood wanted desperately to be known as a director, and people remember him better today than many much more illustrious directors. It's hard to consider him a failure, since he did write, direct, and make films, (albeit terrible ones), he is remembered, and his films are popular still. This film captures the essence of his desire to direct films, no matter under what circumstances. It's a perfect film for Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, who seem to specialize in off the wall films about unusual characters. They show the cast of oddballs he gathered around him to make his movies, without casting obvious judgement on them, thereby allowing the audience to draw it's own conclusions. The first time I saw it in the theatre, at least 1/3 of the audience walked out in the first ten minutes, and the remainder enjoyed every minute. Highly recommended, but not a mainstream film. I was surprised and impressed that Martin Landau received an Oscar for his role, since it wasn't a type of film likely to be popular with hollywood's cognoscenti.",,Anonymous,Biography
Great!,"In this film, Tim Burton pays homage to the legendary bad director, Ed Wood. Never in my life did I think someone could make such a good movie about such a bad director.  The film follows Ed Wood through some of his early years as a director and ends after his disastrous film, Plan 9 From Outer Space.I would gush about how good Johnny Depp is, but he's always good.  And i'm not just saying this in passing; i've never seen the man turn in a bad performance, even when he's in a bad movie.  He really becomes Ed Wood in this.  Martin Landau is also wonderful as Bela Lugosi; I had no idea the man was so tortured.  And definate kudos to George 'The Animal' Steele.

Cannes & Landau,"If you look twice at the context in which this movie was made, you can't regard it as anything but serious. It's a biopic that may very well have you laughing hysterically. And if you do find your funny bone being tickled, you're not getting the wrong message; you're getting the right one, because this true story told so accurately and meticulously by Tim Burton is really that funny - and tragic.Wood's Plan 9 from Outer Space won the Golden Turkey Award in 1988 as the Worst Movie Ever Made. This is a singular distinction. Many film critics say that amateur film makers would have done a better job. Check the memorable quotes section to see just how bad Wood's scripting was - it's atrocious.Yet Wood is history, and through Plan 9 and especially this movie, possibly as well-known as his idol Orson Welles.The movie itself is done with such care and precision that it can't help but engage you. Depp's Wood is nothing short of fantastic; no one but Parker could have done the Fuller part as well as she did; they're all great.But Martin Landau stands out from the beginning. Landau does more than portray Bela Lugosi: He is Bela Lugosi. The transformation is so complete you forget you're watching an actor and become completely engrossed in this tragic tale. Wood is tragic, and it's about Wood this movie is made, but the personal real life story of the real life Lugosi is almost too horrible to contemplate here. As Landau quips, 'Hollywood chews you up and spits you out.'We watched this tale on video just tonight; I'd seen it once before. And I couldn't get over how incredible Landau was doing the Lugosi part, and blurted out loud 'but that should have been worth at least an Oscar nomination.' How appropriate then for the temporarily clueless yours truly to discover that Landau won a total of 11 (eleven) major awards for best supporting actor, including the Golden Globe and the Oscar.Everything that Ed Wood was not Tim Burton is in this movie. Alexander's screenplay, based on Grey's book, is spot on at every twist and turn. Ed Wood is simply amazing, and its b/w cinematography should not bore you either, but knock you out: this movie is a tribute, as the Golden Turkey Award was, 'to everyone who has ever had a dream, an ambition, and pursued it relentlessly - only to fall flat on their faces.'",,Anonymous,Biography
a story that needed to be told,"Thank goodness for these 'pet projects'.  As a fan of really BAD cinema, especially '50s Sci-Fi, Ed Wood's movies are right at the top.  Therefore I'm glad to see the story about how a rich medium such as film can be made so horrible in the right hands, and Ed Wood certainly had those hands (Gads, that sounds like a line from one of his scripts!!!).  Depp is marvelous, but it is Martin Landau that showed us the glimpse of TRULY GREAT ACTING, a completely electrifying moment in the archway of an old building.  I have seen Landau make even lesser roles gleam like he did in this movie enough times to prove that great acting is no accident.",,Anonymous,Biography
fantastic work of film,"I'd just like to say how much i enjoy this movie.  it's such a touching story about Ed Wood and his passion for making the ""great"" horror film and about bela lugosi's sad ending months of his life. truly amazing performances in the whole film. one of Tim Burtons best works.  4 stars definitely worth seeing.",,Anonymous,Biography
Masterpiece.,"The true story of movie writer, producer and director Edward D. Wood Jr. comes to the screen in this wonderful homage. How Ed made his movies, from ""Glen or Glenda"" to ""Bride of the Monster"" and the legendary ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", how he met one of his true idols, the late Bela Lugosi, and brought him back to the screen...This is an absolutely wonderful, deeply touching homage to the tragic life and work of Ed Wood, who became famous as ""the worst movie director of all time"" after his death. Despite being incredibly funny at times, the film never loses respect for its main protagonist(s) and succeeds on every possible level. Johnny Depp and Martin Landau play their parts with sheer brillance, and Landau deservedly won an Oscar for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi. Everybody who loves cinema should see this movie, and especially those who like 50's science-fiction and horror movies. However, don't see before you know at least two of Ed's films: ""Bride of the Monster"" and ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", of course. Those three together make for an unforgettable time at the movies. Only the genius that is Tim Burton could have come up with it, and I'm very glad he did.",,Anonymous,Biography
Just downright hilarious,"After you see this film, you'll want to run to your local video store and rent just about any Ed Wood film you can find.  Not to look at them and say how bad they are, but to look at them and just fall on the ground rolling how incredibly hilarious they are.  They really are that horrible!This is Johnny Deep at his finest.  He plays the role with so much charm and you just have a blast watching him.  Martin Landau is outstanding too, but overall this is Tim Burton's masterpiece.  There are so many moments in this film that should go down as the funniest moments in film history, like the scene with the fake octopus without the motor.  It's just hysterical.For those who are looking for a great comedy, look no futher.  Although some of the people today may be turned off by the black and white transfer, it only adds to the brilliance.  I just can't even begin to say enough about how big of a smile this movie puts on my face.  For those who haven't yet seen it, I envy your first viewing of it.",,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant! Marvelous! Fantastic!,"This movie is genius Tim Burton's tribute to the infamous ""Worst Director of All Time"" Edward D. Wood Jr. All of the performances in this film are great- Johnny Depp, Martin Landeau (in the role that won him an Oscar), Jeffrey Jones and Lisa Marie shine through in particuarly. The film also benifits hugely from Tim Burton's keen visual eye, which faithfully re-creates scenes from Gen or Glenda?, Bride of the Monster, and Plan 9 from Outer Space down to the very last detail. I watched this movie right after viewing Plan 9, so all the images were fresh in my mind- and it's often hard to believe that they did not use footage from the actual movies. I give this movie a 10/10",,Anonymous,Biography
I loved it but...,"This is one of my most favorite movies that my VHS copy has finally worn out. I did not like Johnny Depp all too much before but after seeing this movie, I am totally impressed by his acting. Of course, Martin Landau really stole the show as Bela Lugosi. Fantastic performances all around.   I love the movie but jeez, where's the DVD?",,Anonymous,Biography
Tim Burton's best,"Ed Wood, was Tim Burton's best for sure. I enjoyed it from the beginning, which is an introduction like they made in cheap scary movies of these years to the great ending where they tell us everything that happened to the characters after the Plan 9 From Outer Space Premiere. it was funny and touching and I'll never see Edward D. Wood Jr. the same way. He was not stupid at all, he simply had no talent. He was nice and positive and happy most of the time, and he enjoyed his movies, he really thought his films were great. He is just the opposite of Orson Welles, who made Citizen Kane, the best American film. Ed Wood made the worst. Martin Landau was EXCELLENT in the role of Bela Lugosi, and his arms were disgusting (because of all the stitches he had) and he won the oscar for best supporting actor, but I thought Johnny Depp gave an AWESOME performance too. It represents the story of Edward D. Wood Jr. the best way we could imagine. The fact that the film was in black and white was another good point too...we were more in the atmosphere of old films. It was funny, smart, and it was not laughing at anyone, even with the main character (the worst director of all time) and that was a good surprise. The kind of film you have to watch over and over again...don't rent it, BUY IT. It is great! Not the best film I've seen, but quite a good piece of entertainment. I was surprised to see Bill Murray in this, who was in my mind a bad actor...but I realized he played in good films and in this one he did a very good job. When I'll see Ed Wood films, I'll remember how he was feeling and how he liked them, and I'm sure I'm gonna like them too, if I watch them with this idea in my head. Watch it at all costs...I didn't find it in the three first videos I went to, but I finally found it and enjoyed it. I give it 87%.",,Anonymous,Biography
"""Worst film you ever saw. Well I'm sure my next one will be much better.""","Tim Burton. He's a great storyteller. The first two Batman movies were well directed and nicely performed by its stars, and had some other good elements. Edward Siscorhands was very poetic and good, and Depp was terrificly sympathetic as the protagonist. I loved The Nightmare Before Christmas and I think it is one of the best animated films of all time. Mars Attacks! was very comical and I seemed to enjoy it more than everybody else did(though I would have liked to see stop-montion flying saucers).But he was born to direct this movie. This movie is so offbeat and so oddly comical it could have only been done by him. And throughout this film you can see clearly that Burton understands Ed Wood. Any other director given this script (and an excellent script it is) would have rewritten and made fun of Ed Wood. They would have scoffed at him and lobotimized the character for laughs. But not Burton. He plays Ed's relationships with the other characters so well. Ed befriending a dying Bela Lugosi is very well done. Not too gushing with emotions but not too rigid, he plays it like they're friends. Bela is played superbly by Martin Landau. Bela knows the movies he's making are not the high quality pieces he was making in the thirties, but he's happy he's getting work and that somebody has faith in him enough to put him in one of their movies. That somebody is as big a fan of Bela's as Ed is. Ed's the shining light in old Bela's life.And Ed. Somebody knew there was a story in Ed Wood. You feel sorry for the guy, knowing he's gonna turn out to be a porn director. An average Joe who wears Angora sweaters and is so upbeat he doesn't let pesky little things like huge executives denying him a movie. And that's where the movie succeeds the most. Ed's such a likeable guy. In the movie, there's not a mean-spirited bone in his body. He'd never back-stab one of his friends. And Johnny Depp. He's great. He's been a great actor before, but has always played a deadpan personality, but in this he's over the top and very comical.On one last note, there's on great shining star in this movie: Bill Murray. He has a good time playing Bunny Breckinridge, the homosexual sex-change-wannabe.All in all a great comedy. I hope I didn't make it to serious sounding, because really it's a great comedic film. The movie is just downright, out-and-out funny.",,Anonymous,Biography
This movie is brilliant.,I love this movie.  It is so much fun.  I like Ed's friendship with Bela Lugosi and his cross-dressing habit.  It's hilarious.  I highly recomend it to Tim Burton or Johnny Depp fans.  Having it in black and white also adds to the old Hollywood feeling throughout the movie.,,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best movies I've seen,"If there ever was a complete film that tugged at your heart, split your sides, and made you think-all at the same time, it's Ed Wood. The film, which I saw recently, just completely bowled me over. Frankly, I am at a loss for words while describing Ed Wood. Perhaps the only way to describe it is as a paean to that eternal loser hiding inside all of us-the loser who, despite a complete lack of talent, chugs on simply because he knows not that he knows not. Don't miss Ed Wood.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Some wonderful moments and one truly great performance, but not a great film","Maybe you have to be really into the bizarre to truly love ""Ed Wood.""  Yes, it was fun to watch a well-made movie about the making of awful movies and about a ""family"" of colorfully dysfunctional, marginalized individuals (though in my view, ""Boogie Nights"" succeeds better on both counts).  But, in the end, what was the point?  Were we supposed to be moved by the sincerity of Ed's dreams and by his intense commitment to his vision, even if the end product of his vision was some of the worst dreck ever put on film?  In other words, was the Orson Welles analogy semi-serious?  This could have been a film about self-deception and delusion, but Tim Burton had too much fun with these delusions to really explore their pathetic side.In addition, I was very unimpressed by Johnny Depp.  Most of the time he was just glaring and grinning, and I never found him moving in the emotional scenes.  Sarah Jessica Parker, who is so good is ""Sex and the City,"" is merely OK here.  On the other hand, Martin Landau gives a magnificent, unforgettable, deeply moving performance as the aged Bela Lugosi -- ""Ed Wood"" is definitely worth seeing just for him.  Also, Patricia Arquette is excellent as Kathy, the love of Ed's life.  The moment she appears on the screen, you forget all about Depp and you know you're seeing real talent. (Too bad we don't get to see more of her.)  Bill Murray shines in a small part as a would-be transsexual, and the underrated Jeffrey Jones is very good as a TV ""psychic.""It's a very enteraining and amusing movie, but the only parts of it I'd care to see again are the ones with Landau.  I suspect that the high rating this movie has received (I wouldn't give it more than a 6) is due to Ed Wood's cult status as the worst filmmaker of all time.",,Anonymous,Biography
What a star!,"What a star Johnie Depp is, eh? He has made this a superbly enjoyable film. Definitely a video for the home collection. I recommend this thoughtful gentle comedy with just an edge of black to it. And amazingly, its all true (so they tell me). If Ed Woods hadn't existed, you'd have to invent him just to brighten up your day.Inspired performances all round.",,Anonymous,Biography
Tim Burton's best movie,"At the time of its release, Tim Burton's ED WOOD seemed a slight but sweet-spirited charmer; a few years later, it seems like an almost-great movie, a sincere song of love to a giftless Pollyanna's love for filmmaking. Burton cast perfectly down to the tiniest bits, and Peter Suschitzky's steely black-and-white photograph puts the movie's images in the league of RAGING BULL and THE ELEPHANT MAN. Burton seems somehow more deeply connected to this material than anything in his other pictures--in his kitschy way, he has as sure a touch with this story and its milieu as Coppola had with the Corleones.",,Anonymous,Biography
The BEST,"It helps if you know a bit about Ed Wood, or get a copy of Criswell Predicts. But either way this movies is incredible. Depp, Bill Murray, the whole cast is spot on. Burton rules. Watch it friend, because it is where you and I will be spending the rest of our lives.",,Anonymous,Biography
Tim Burton reflects the passion of moviemaking,"Although ""Ed Wood"" is a satiric look at the lives and times of the infamous B-movie director and his friends and cast members, it's also Tim Burton's opus to the passion of movie making.For those of you who know anything about the real Ed Wood, his life was nowhere near as invigorating as this film portrays it (although the film seems to accurately portrays the best years of his career).  True, Wood did progress into alcoholism and directing soft porn, but Burton emphasizes the struggling director's passion for his art.After seeing this film, I picked up a copy of the book containing snippets of interviews of many of Wood's cohorts, and found that almost all of the film is true to life.  I remember someone saying in the book that although Wood's films were viewed today more for their cheesiness and bad production values rather than their artistic merit, Wood would have been elated to see that his films were so widely watched.  Burton never explicitly says that in his film, but I really wouldn't doubt that fact judging from Johnny Depp's enthusiastic portrayal of Wood.Keep a close eye on some of the allusion's to Orson Welles's ""Citizen Kane"" throughout the film.  Not only does Wood idolize Welles, but Burton uses several shots and relationships that seem influenced by ""Kane"" (e.g., the opening shot of Hollywood is similar to Welles's shot of the rafters in the opera house, and Wood's relationships with his girlfriends is similar to those of Kane's).For the record, this is the film that made yours truly go to film school. After a year of vigorous cinematography courses, I changed my major, abandoning my dreams of being the next Spielberg.  Ed Wood, however, still held onto that dream even after a series of flops, and every filmmaker should take notice of that.",,Anonymous,Biography
This movie will grow on you!!,"When I first watched this film, I had never heard of Edward D Wood Jr. or saw any of his tasteless films.  I kept waiting for his story to have a happy ending -like making a movie the world would love and couldn't understand why he seemed like such an idiot while I waited patiently for him to ""hit it big"".  When the movie ended, I felt cheated until I investigated who the real Edward D. Wood Jr. was and rented out some of his ""classics"" -""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", ""Glen or Glenda?"", ""Jailbait"", ""Bride of the Monster"", ""Night of the Ghouls"".  Now I am the ""proud"" owner of all these ""classics"" and am the biggest Edward D. Wood Jr. fan.  I also have ""A Look Back in Angora -The Life and Times of Edward D. Wood Jr"" (a must see for any Ed Wood fan) -This hour long film shows the real Ed Wood and interviews those that knew him well.  His life really spiralled out of control after ""Plan 9"" was nade (just like the movie said) and he became a bloated drunken derelict too pathetic to even make skin flicks at the end of his life (although he made numerous tasteless porn flicks during the 60's).  This true life story would make an effective A.A. film -showing the devastating effects of extreme alcohol abuse and how it ruined Edward D. Wood Jr. (although it never destroyed his talent since he had none to begin with!!)---10 out of 10 definitely (it will make you an Ed Wood fan too!)",,Anonymous,Biography

A first-rate film about a tenth-rate director and the insanities of film making...,"Well, what is there left to say after the justly deserved accolades laid at the feet of Tim Burton's direction (particularly his inspired decision to shoot in black and white), Johnny Depp's quirky but on-target performance (the real Ed Wood, from what I've read, truly did believe that he was making films of importance), and, of course, Martin Landau's career-best performance as Bela Lugosi (anyone who likes him here should check out his work in the old ""Outer Limits"" episode, ""The Man Who Was Never Born"")? Well, how about Burton's subtext about the headaches of getting a movie made?You see it practically every step of the way. Wood trying to find positives in a decidedly negative review of his play. His trying to convince a producer that only he and he alone can film the story of a transsexual. His infuriating said producer twice, first by changing the story to that of a transvetite, then by making it so badly that the producer will never have anything to do with him again. His pitch session with David O. Selznick, which he had to sell an idea off-the-cuff as it were (I imagine Burton has had to go through similar aggrevation with studio suits, whom Harlan Ellison once described as less literate than a dyslexic). His trying to keep his actors happy with their dialogue, parts, etc. so that they keep working. His never-ending struggle to find financing for his films. His duking it out with his financiers (a Baptist church, no less!) over what his vision of the movie should be. I sincerely believe that there is not a director on the planet who could not relate to at least one of these instances, if not several. The scene where Wood meets his idol, Orson Welles (another director who had to swim upstream for his entire career in film), just underscores many of the points made here.Not that anything else that's been squeezed into this picture doesn't help make it great. But that little facet of this gem of a film has never been alluded to and I thought that it would be best if it were. I wonder what the real Edward D. Wood Jr. would make of this representation of his life story?",,Anonymous,Biography
all copies of this film should be burned,"This film is without doubt the biggest exercise in misery and depression ever released on the small screen under the guise of comedy.It's intensely boring from start to, well I can't say finish because I sure as hell didn't stay that long,but if I caught the best bits this film ranks somewhere between waiting for a bus and talking to the elderly on a boredom scale.As soon as the overlong start finishes and you grasp the film is in black and white you begin to fear the worst.These fears are soon realised with the arrival on screen of Sarah'guaranteed to ruin anyones evening'Jessica Parker.(Incidently the only bit I liked in the film was where she's told she has a face like a horse).From here on in the film takes you to levels of boredom you didn't know existed. You're presented with a group of weirdo,depressing, loser, misfits who it seems are supposed to represent enthusiasm and idealism. For me this film lacks anything resembling humour and it annoys me that it was ever made, nay conceived.Unless you enjoy all things bleak in life and have particular appeal for the trials and tribulations of a cross dressing loser you won't enjoy this film.",,Anonymous,Biography
***** out of 5,"Director Tim Burton has weaven a film here that is nothing short of a masterpiece. Every serious film buff should see this film, as it cronicles the life of ""the worst director in history"". Johnny Depp is superb as Edward D. Wood Jr. an up and coming director whos dream is to be the next Orsen Wells and make the next Citizen Kane, just to bad everything he makes is hated my critics world wide, he is even seen as a practical joke when he hands his movie Glen or Glenda over to the people at Warner Bros. Studios. Matrin Landau plays longtime friend and once great horror movie actor Bela Lugosi who is best known for his work as Dracula, who is portrayed here in his years where he was seen as a washed up drug addict who no one cares about anymore. Next came Bride of the Atom who's name was later changed to Bride of the Monster. But the movie flopped, people were even rioting in the theater at the movies premire and Ed and his cast had to leave because they were being attacked. Og course by that time Wood was out of money, Lugosi was in a rebhabilitation center and things were looking down. But after the death of Lugosi Ed got the opertunity to make another film through the funding of a baptist church, that he promised to be a huge blockbuster and make lots of money. That film was PLan 9 From Outer Space and it is funny because even though Lugosi is billed as the top actor he only appears in footage that was shot earlier by Wood and for the rest of the movie is a body double who wasn't allowed to show his face in the movie. It's very ironic because in the theater at the premire of Plan 9 Wood said ""This is it, this is the one I'm going to be remembered for."" That statement couldn't have been more true just to bad not the way Wood wanted. See it was the one he was remembered for but he was remembered for it because it was penned one of the worst movies ever made. Burton shot the film in black and white and does a fantastic job of making the movie feel like it is actually from the days of Ed Wood. Depp is great as Wood himself but it is Landau as Lugosi who steal every scene he is in, whether it be him expressing his hate for Boris Karloff (Frankenstien) or to him shooting the final scene in Bride of the Atom where he must be attacked by a giant octopus but he has to wave they tenticles around himself because someone forgot to get the motor to run the prop. The film is often times very hilarious in seeing that Wood thought he was making brillent works and mostly only did one take for each scene and in the beginning seeing how the film crew would have to run away everytime the police came around because they were filming without a permit. The mvie also has several scenes that scream satire, like whenever Wood says he has a big star to be in his movies and he tells people it is Bela Lugosi eveything thinks he is already dead and a scene where Wood asks a crew member which dress he likes and he says well I'm colour blind I can't tell the difference but I like the dark grey one. This film is nothing short of genious and even though it will not grab the attention of everyone who sees it there is no denying Burton has carved himself yet another winner.",,Anonymous,Biography
What a great idea to come up with!,"To come up with the idea that people acting in Ed Wood's movies would have lives that were far more unique and entertaining than the actual movies, is an achievement of it's own.An example: one scene from ""Ed Wood"", where Ed Wood's team are filming in the middle of the night. They have got a bad ""motorized rubber octopus""-prop without the..um.. motor. Actually, they just stole the octopus from a prop stock. The team have just finished the ""sea"" for the octopus, then the scientist, Bela Lugosi, about 70 at the time, steps in the water to ""fight"" with the octopus (ie. sit on it, scream, and flap it's rubber flippers around like a kid lost in his toys) after taking a shot of morphine.If that really happened - and stuff like that must've happened around Ed Wood - the people in the set were sure to remember it for the rest of their lives.. surreal, funny, unique situations.Funny film - at times you just feel sorry for Ed Wood, the center of this network of outcasts and weirdos - he basically wanted to make things happen as soon as possible without having the skills to pull them off. Johnny Depp really gives the impression of Ed Wood's will to make it big, and of course, how that driving force ends up making the movies so bad.The whole film has a very surreal feeling to it, at times it feels like a ""normal"" biography, and at times it's very much like a 50s-movie with that black and white soul to the acting. The end result gives you a great feeling of the mood that must've surrounded Ed Wood, almost lets you smell his bad props. Nice work by Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, and especially Martin Landau.",,Anonymous,Biography
Hollywood's Holy Fool,"A touching look at the life of one of filmdom's most confusing figures. Ed Wood, the man, the struggling film-maker, the transvestite, wanted so dearly to be recognized as a Hollywood film-maker, but his works came out so warped and inferior, that they almost seemed like practical jokes. He spent his later years writing pornographic novels, forgotten by the film industry he had embraced, only to become the Holy Fool of Hollywood after his death.The cast is flawless. Bill Murray's performance as transvestite entertainer Bunny Breckenridge is hysterical, Lisa Marie as the icy Vampira is wonderful, but it's Martin Landau's Oscar winning performance as the near-forgotten Bela Lugosi that brings the film it's dramatic and tragic nuances (Many say that Landau earned Lugosi his Oscar by proxy).The scenes with Wood and his entourage are to be cherished. The riot that happens at the premier of ""Bride of the Monster"" leaves the party running for their lives. They escape in a taxi, literally at the last possible second, as the mob of unruly teenagers nearly overtake them. Lugosi comments, ""Now THAT was a premier!"" Priceless!This is recommended to be watched before seeing ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"". You'll swear the same actors are in both films!An odd yet touching tribute to an odd film-maker, and a sign that despite all the negative press and cold shoulders he received in his life, Ed Wood has finally been justified and venerated.",,Anonymous,Biography
Sympathy for the devil of film-making,"In what is personally one of my favorite films of all time, director Tim Burton gives us the true story of the one often named the worst director of all time; Edward D Wood Jr (Johnny Depp). Passionate about film-making but incompetent at the skill, Ed frantically scurries around Hollywood with cap in hand to seek film companies willing to finance his dead-in-the-water productions. With the help of the down-and-out horror movie icon Bela Lugosi (brilliant performance by Martin Landau) and a reluctant team of showbiz misfits, Ed creates the cinematic anti-masterpieces of his own desire. Undaunted by the cutthroat criticism of the film industry, Ed stumbles on with his passion, door knocking for funds, facing rejection, tragedy, and heartbreak, all leading to the creation of his most infamous motion picture...Compelling, engaging, and frequently hilarious, ""Ed Wood"" has an all-star cast providing brilliant performances from Johnny Depp, Martin Landau, Bill Murray, and others. By being filmed in black and white, the movie is able to accomplish the nostalgic effect that is critical in emphasizing the heart of the B-Movie era of the 1950s. One of the central questions which the film raises is if Ed Wood was truly the worst the directer of all time. Many understandably think so due to his incompetent directing skills, penniless budgets, and ""the-first-take-is-perfect"" philosophy. However, with this film, it's almost impossible not to have sympathy for the devil of film-making. Ed really was passionate about film-making and really didn't care about the scathing reviews or cardboard sets, because, as he says in the film, ""movies are about the big picture"".To understand the hilarity of the film, I would personally recommend watching ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" and other Ed Wood films before enjoying this to truly appreciate the inside jokes. ""Ed Wood"" really is a cinematic treat and is the best movie about the worst that cinema has to offer.10/10",,Anonymous,Biography

It is a shame for such a nice hommage to classic horror movies, to a man who love them, who was very human and kind to an old and great star in her last years.

Wonderfully bizarre,"I watched this obscure little film mainly because the idea of someone making a movie about the worst director of all time intrigued me. I expected it would be funny, but I didn't expect to be so moved. The most poignant part of the movie was the relationship between Ed Wood and his idol, Bela Lugosi. Some other highlights for me were:1. The black and white cinematography. If ever a movie demanded to be shot in black and white, this one was it. It perfectly recreated that 1950s B-movie atmosphere. 2. The opening credits appearing on tombstones, just like in Plan 9 from Outer Space. 3. The conversation between Orson Welles, believed by many to be the greatest director of all time, and Ed Wood, commonly thought to be the worst. It was priceless! It showed how the two of them may have been on absolute opposite ends of the talent spectrum but in many ways they shared the same problems and joys as filmmakers. 4. The fact that even the weirdest characters were given humanity. 5. The end of the movie where the eventual fate of all the characters was revealed.I'm not the world's biggest Tim Burton fan, but my hat is off to him for this one!",,Anonymous,Biography

Enter the aging and drug-addicted Bela Lugosi-lonely,feeble and unemployed!Believed to be long-dead by Hollywood!And then there's Tor Johnson-the 400lb former wrestler making cheap monster-movies just for fun!And the ""amazing"" Criswell-long before the ""psychic friends network"" making bizarre and bogus ""predictions"" on local variety shows!Ed's girlfriend Dolores Fuller-a struggling,second-rate model who finally leaves Ed for a ""normal""life!(she eventually became a successful songwriter!)And the one-time TV horror-hostess Vampira-who finds herself playing the ""ghoul woman"" after she's broke and blackballed in Hollywood! But the most intriguing character is Ed himself!Played to perfection by Johnny Depp he's ambitious,shrewd,caring,loving,imaginative and totally in love with his own twisted belief that he could be a true Hollywood legend!And despite the fact that he made nothing but laughable trash and lived the rest of his life in alcoholic obscurity and poverty...he succeeded after all!!!",,Anonymous,Biography
What a Movie,"I only just recently got chance to watch this movie, boy am I glad I did! Johnny Depp was very good as Edward D . Wood Jr. It was amazing film. The funniest scene was with the octipussy with Bela Logius, It really made me laugh. It's a little hard to get into at first, but the charming wit and interesting script mades this a must see.",,Anonymous,Biography
I watched this horrible piece of trash because....,"I am a huge fan of a wonderful actress, Patricia Arquette but, even her great talent cannot redeem this ugly bit of cinematic trash. Not wishing to bad-mouth the work of those I formerly considered greatly talented I will simply state that this bit of rot can most properly be described by the word ""BOMB!""",,Anonymous,Biography
Pull The String!!!!,"Offbeat biography about the eccentric director Ed Wood, notable for giving us what is considered to be the worst film ever made, Plan 9 From Outer Space. If Johnny Depp doesn't win this Oscar, its time for someone else to start up an awards show. Brilliant performance by the kid. Burton too, just completely outdoes himself. So does Landau for that matter, he at least was recognized with an Oscar. But the film should have been showered with them. It's a masterpiece. Shot in black and white, its atmosphere nails postwar Hollywood, in the final days when movies still had no need for ratings. The irony is Ed Wood in his lifetime, never amounted to anything. His films were beyond horrible to the point of just being unwatchable. Subject matter that's just hard to even comprehend.  I can't begin to describe the awfulness of them; it's worth renting one just for the history aspect.  That said, in his own way he was a pioneer. Directors especially the likes of Tim Burton owe a little something to this guy and his work if only for expanding the boundaries of conventionality. And this film is tenderly handled to give some respect to a guy who never saw any in his lifetime. One of recent Hollywood's better achievements.",,Anonymous,Biography
The best film of 1994,"A funny and surprisingly affectionate homage to the ""Worst Director of All-Time"" Edward D. Wood, Jr., ""Ed Wood"" is easily one of the best films of the 1990's and, despite major success with acclaimed films like ""Batman"" and ""Beetlejuice,"" remains director Tim Burton's masterstroke.Considering the subject matter, ""Ed Wood"" could have easily been a mean-spirited parody of a man who craved significance and success, but Tim Burton has always had a soft spot for misunderstood oddballs (""Edward Scissorhands"" immediately comes to mind.) Once again working with ""Scissorhands"" star Johnny Depp, Burton not only shows Ed Wood as a likable human being, he also displays warmth and genuine admiration for the cult hero who wasn't fully appreciated until years after his death.Depp truly shines here in the title role. An actor usually known for his brooding performances in such films as ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" and the aforementioned ""Edward Scissorhands,"" Depp is all-smiles and charm as Ed Wood. An eternal optimist with more determination than talent, Ed Wood was also well-known for being a crossdresser...""Ed Wood,"" the film, addresses his transvestism with amusing matter-of-factness and spends a great deal of time on the making of Wood's laughably-bad cross-dressing opus ""Glen or Glenda."" The cross-dressing, of course, causes a strain in Wood's relationship with his usually supportive girlfriend Dolores Fuller (played to the hilt by Sarah Jessica Parker; the real Dolores Fuller reportedly hated Parker's portrayal of her). Wood, of course, only wants to be accepted as is; oddly enough, Dolores is the only person close to him who can't accept his passion for wigs and soft angora sweaters.Despite being set back by uncooperative girlfriends, disillusioned studio execs, and a constant lack of money, Wood keeps working (the film covers the making of three of Ed Wood's features, including the classic ""Plan 9 from Outer Space""), with his loyal troupe of amazingly amateurish actors and crew members following his every whim. The film captures quite nicely how Wood's optimism and sweet nature allows him to maintain an assortment of odd, but extremely loyal, disciples. But together they all share a common goal...movie stardom. (One interesting note...like Ed Wood, Tim Burton often uses the same actors in different films; Johnny Depp, Jeffery Jones and Lisa Marie are just a few of the actors who have appeared in several Burton films.)Most of the film, however, details Ed Wood's friendship and working relationship with aging horror legend Bela Lugosi (played by Oscar-winner Martin Landau in an amazing performance). By the time he began working with Ed Wood, Lugosi was a washed-up drug addict who couldn't even pay his bills, let alone get parts in movies. Although Wood and Lugosi initially use each other (Wood wanted a marquee name in his films, Lugosi just wanted to work), they eventually learn to respect and even love one another. Once again, Landau's performance is truly astonishing, and his on-screen chemistry with Depp is a sight to behold. They make a great team.Filmed in glorious black-and-white, ""Ed Wood,"" like all biographies, takes liberties with the real-life story of Edward D. Wood, Jr. (Lugosi was actually married when he began starring in Wood's films, for example....one interesting note, however, is the original script for ""Ed Wood"" covers Wood's brief marriage after his break up with Dolores Fuller; this storyline was cut for the film). Stellar performances abound...Patricia Arquette is sweet as Kathy, former pro-wrestler George ""The Animal"" Steele is uncanny as former pro-wrestler Tor Johnson, Jeffery Jones is positively brilliant and hysterical as would-be psychic Criswell, Lisa Marie (Tim Burton's real-life mate) gives an appropriately dour performance as Vampira, and Vincent D'Onofrio has an effective cameo as Orson Welles. But the real scene-stealer here is Bill Murray, who gives one of the best performances of his career in a small role as the flamboyant Bunny Breckinridge.Even if you aren't familiar with Ed Wood, and even if you have never heard of Ed Wood before in your life, ""Ed Wood"" is still marvelously entertaining. Alternating between hysterically funny moments and depictions of true sadness and alienation, this movie has something for everybody. An absolute must-see.",,Anonymous,Biography
a pure joy,"I loved this movie.  Depp is perfect as the half assed director of terrible movies. His child like giddiness brings the joy back into film making. This film even makes Woods real movies bearable.This was a beautiful movie about friendship, perseverance, and a childlike love for the movies.  It was also very, very funny. Great acting all around.  Great story beginning to end.  Great message about film making and at that any kind of art. Just a great movie all around. I recommend this to anyone. Actually, I'm going to go watch it again right now.",,Anonymous,Biography
Fun Flick,"Tim Burton's satirical tribute to Ed Wood here obviously paved the way for Bill Condon's more serious biopic four years later on James Whale (""Gods and Monsters"").Burton created a rather weird atmosphere for his entire opus, through eerie black and white photography, spooky soundtrack, offbeat camera angles and movements, and Martin Landau's mesmerizing impersonation of Bela Lugosi.Great date flick for the college crowd, that'll dig Wood's unusual wardrobe preferences, along with other Burton hip references.Johnny Depp does himself proud--all bright, chipper and optimistic--young man in love with movie making, no matter what.  And the thought of a no-retake approach to shooting is a hoot.""Great, wrap it, on to Scene 54! . . . """,,Anonymous,Biography
first rate all the way!!!,"It is really ironic to me that one of the best film biographies should have been made about a man who people consider the worst movie director of all time. Ed Wood was a transvestite (ironically he was a very decorated Marine in WWII who fought wearing a bra and panties underneath his uniform, he said one of his worst fears was being wounded in combat and having the medics cut off his clothes and revealing his secret). Wood was a good and decent man and this is well shown in this film when he befriends Bela Lugosi. Lugosi was one of the biggest Hollywood horror stars when he made Dracula in 1931, however he made a horrible mistake when he turned down the role of Frankenstein that Boris Karloff took. This part made Karloff a star and he was able to enjoy a bountiful career. He was able to play other parts that proved he was a fine actor when he wasn't playing a monster. However, Lugosi was typecast for the rest of his life and never approached Karloff's success. Maybe that is why he didn't like him. There is a funny scene in this film where Martin Landau as Lugosi goes off on a profane tirade about Boris Karloff. Johnny Depp and Sarah Jessica Parker and Bill Murray all give wonderful performances in this film, but it is Mister Martin Landau who makes it for me. He simply IS Bela Lugosi. This is the finest screen performance of a real life person since George C. Scott played Patton. It is almost like Landau stepped out of his own mortal soul and became Lugosi. I think one of the reasons he did such a wonderful job is that there is a connection between him and Bela. Maybe I should explain, Landau was thrown aside by Hollywood for so many years after he did Mission Impossible. He had to do garbadge like The Harlem Globetrotters On Gilligan's Island (I kid you not that was one of his roles!) Lugosi had to do trash like that as well. One of his films was called Bela Lugosi Meets A Brooklyn Gorilla. Landau was able to make a comeback with films like Tucker: The Man And His Dream. He was able to make the comeback Bela could not. In fact when he won the Oscar, one of the things he said was ""Bela wherever you are thanks"". The thing about this film that really got me is that Ed Wood was somewhat noble. He was a person who loved filmaking and was as genuinely dedicated to his craft as any great director like Orson Welles, William Wyler or John Frankenheimer, he just wasn't any good at it!",,Anonymous,Biography
"Interesting, but not accurate bio of Ed Wood Jr.","While I found this bio of director Ed Wood Jr. to be very entertaining, I must admit I was rather annoyed by the many historical inaccuracies contained in this film. It's shame that so many people watch a film thats based on a true story and think everything in it is 100 percent true. Perhaps the most annoying was Tim Burtons callous, inaccurate way he portrays Bela Lugosi. Martin Landau is good in the role, but the Lugosi shown here is not the Lugosi presented is several bio's that I have read. Lugosi was a drug addict, but it was a doctor prescribed addiction, he was not just some junky. Lugosi as far as every bio I have ever read, could cuss with the best of them, but being a gentlemen from the old country, he never cussed in front of women, as he does in this film.A few other historical inaccuracies contained in this film:1)The scene of Wood and Lugosi in Las Vegas, where Lugosi hosted the ""Bela Lugosi Review"" makes it look if the show was disaster. In the fact the stage review, directed by Wood, may actually be the only thing Wood did that received good critical notices from the trade papers. ""The Bela Lugosi Review"" ran  successfully for several weeks, audiences did not boo Lugosi off the stage.2)The films gives one the impression that the only films Bela Lugosi made in the fifties were for Ed Wood. They fail to mention Lugosi's real last film, THE BLACK SLEEP for United Artists in 1956.3)Ed Wood did not introduce Tor Johnson to acting in films. Johnson had been appearing in films for years before he ever met Ed Wood. It should be stated that Wood was crucial in making Johnson a star of low budget monster movies however. 4)Gregory Walcott was not cast as a leading man in PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE under the same circumstances as Tony McCoy was cast in BRIDE OF THE MONSTER. Gregory Walcott was a busy working actor in Hollywood at that time, playing minor roles in major films at the time. The real story of how he ended up being cast in PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE is lot more funnier than the way presented in the film. To bad Burton lacked the imagination to present the real story.There are a lot more historical inaccuracies in this film, but these are the major ones I think need to be pointed out.Thank you and have a nice day!",,Anonymous,Biography
Clever Approach to a Biopic,"Director Tim Burton builds his biopic off the clever notion of making the film as a 50's style cheapie, with similar photography, score, etc. Fortunately the performances are much better, and Burton's stylistic homage is inspired and largely true to the 'feel' of the era. Cast is all-around top-notch, and film is fun from start to finish. While not as imaginative as Edward Scissorhands or as madcap as Beetlejuice, it is still a must for any Burton fan.",,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent,"A very pleasant and emotional story about the man who had the dubious distinction of being the worst director of all time.  What helps to make this movie won of the finest of the decade is its wonderful performances all around in a cast of some pretty crazy characters.  In the title role, Johnny Depp is heartful, but at the same time shows the bizarre many aspects of his character in what seems to be a very true to life way.  In support, Bill Murray and Jeffrey (Beetlejuice, Amadeus) Jones always manage to steal their scenes. Sarah Jessica Parker exhibits frustration with her husband and bad acting on stage very well.  Oscar winner Martin Landau becomes Bela Lugosi in every way.  After watching Pulp Fiction I wondered who could possibly have beaten the irrepressible Samuel L. Jackson's Jules Winfield?  We now have an answer.  Few biographical movies are this good, I highly recommend this movie.",,Anonymous,Biography
What a great movie,"I wholeheartedly agree with the raves here.  Tim Burton and Johnny Depp were perfect for this film, Landau was great as Lugosi, filming it in black and white was a wonderful idea, etc. etc.  But there's a couple points I feel you guys have neglected:Does anyone else find it just a little sad that this movie was rated R in the United States, but PG or PG-13 (or their equivalents) in every other country?  Quite a comment on our culture, I'd say.Everyone seems to be ignoring what a fantastic love story this was!  Wood goes out on a limb, admitting he's a transvestite to Kathy on their first date, and she accepts him to the point of throwing herself in front of a car for him (not to give anything away...).  I thought it was much more touching than plenty of other 'romantic' movies  *cough, cough* Titanic *cough*.Without a doubt a must see.",,Anonymous,Biography
Bizarre perfection!,"This has become one of my favourite films...the ingenius Tim Burton creates a unique, enchanting masterpiece.  To me, this may well be Depp's best role and it is a pleasure to see him in a comedic role.  Ed Wood may have been voted worst director of all time, but his life and movies could never be described as dull to us now.  He was so bad, he was good!  Being in black and white creates an atmosphere that fits the film faultlessly and each and every performance was a treat.  Bill Murray surprised and Martin Landau couldn't have been better. In all, a film you can never be bored with and can find new gems in each time.",,Anonymous,Biography
Weirder Than Weird,"This cult film is a must see.  Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are truly in a world of their own with this one.  The real Ed Wood was a sensation of sorts in his time and continues to fascinate, although with heavy laughter.As Roger Ebert says, when poor movie making reaches these heights (or depths), there ensues a sort of grandeur.  I could not believe my eyes.  And the parts about Bela were touching and beautiful in their weirdness as well. Loved the angora.This is a ten.",,Anonymous,Biography
Essential Viewing Â– Masterpiece!,"Ed Wood is one of the best films that I have seen. The discreet mix of comedy and sincerity works at so many levels! The acting performances are superb from Martin Landau, Johnny Depp and Bill Murray, though the performances from the supporting cast are impeccable. Tim Burton escapes from his Super-Weird style of directing and leaves the audience wowed by his thorough story telling and nice camera set-ups. Maybe the finest art of this movie is the music, mimicking the 1950's UFO movie scores whilst making the movie comfortable to watch at the same time. The nice thing about Burton's directing is that whilst you can see that Edward .D. Wood Jr. had little to no directing or writing talents, he was someone who enjoyed making films an telling stories. Bela Lugosi isn't a very likeable character in the film. His frequent mood swings are funny, but not nearly as funny as Bill Murray, who plays the unsatisfied transvestite whom wishes to say goodbye to his genitalia. By all accounts, this movie is historically accurate, and anyone who has been unfortunate enough to see Â‘Plan 9 From Outer Space' and is interested in its making (even if you're not, you will be after seeing the movie!) you NEED to see this film. Contains Frequent Swearing, Mild Sexual References and Frequent Drug Abuse.",,Anonymous,Biography
Fantastic!,"Tim Burton films are always enjoyable, but the only one that I would call ""great"" is his 2007 adaptation of Sweeney Todd. Now, I can add another one to that short list of great films.Ed Wood is fascinating from start to finish! The atmosphere of the period is takes place in is authentic. But the direction and screenplay really shine! The film is very much sort of a character-study. Johnny Depp is fantastic in here, and it's probably one of his best performances. Not knowing much about Wood, the film sparked an immediate interest. Not just in him, but in the sheer ambition and love for film- making that one can have, even him. The film portrays him with an immediate optimism that really gives the film a wonder, a sense of happiness. That really stood out to me among the rest of his films. I have no clue whether the era Wood was like this, but the films succeeds in that department. In fact, it succeeds in almost everything.By the film's end, I was fascinated and was left in awe over this person and this era, regardless of it's actual reality. That to me, makes a great film. It also makes me wonder whether I should see Wood's films, since the only time I did was when I watched a couple of scenes from 'Plan 9' in a Halloween party and remember the guests saying something like 'this is the worst film ever and we love it'.",,Anonymous,Biography
Lovable...,"This is a movie with a wonderful story and absolutely lovable characters. I don't know if the real Ed Wood was like Johnny Depp portrayed him, but the character Depp is playing is so wonderfully idealistic, naive and still headstrong that you just have to like him.The bizarre supporting cast, crowned by Martin Landaus brilliant performance as Bela Lugosi, is another element which makes this film so... realistic in a way. I can just imagine walking down the street and meeting those guys, desperately trying to make movie history again.The pure kindness of these characters is it which makes this film work for me. And it nearly made me cry to read the credits and to learn about the end of Ed Wood, the faithfulness of his wife and the fate of the other guys. Excellent work, Tim Burton!",,Anonymous,Biography
