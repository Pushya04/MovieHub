Good for What It Is,"Have not commented on anything in a long time. But after reading all the overly positive ""scariest movie of all time"" and overly negative ""two hours of my life I'll never get back (hour and a half actually)"", I had to comment. I heard about this in Entertainment Weekly and was waiting patiently for it to come out in wide distribution. All in all, it's a good movie for what it is. A low budget horror movie using the faux documentary premise. Compared to The Blair Witch Project, where you couldn't see a damn thing to be scared of, and Cloverfield, which just made me nauseous from the jerking camera, this film at least has steady camera work most of the time. If you are a die hard horror movie fan, will this movie terrify you? Probably not, except on a psychological level possibly. The notion of a demon haunting a person as opposed to a haunted house, while nothing truly original in the sense it hasn't been done elsewhere, is still not seen to much in horror (except in possession films), least these days in the days of Saw and Hostel and other crap. There are a few startling moments in the film. They are comparable to a friend sneaking up on you from behind and shaking you. But honestly, that's what I want from a horror movie. To be in suspense and have something shock me and get my heart pumping for a few. I can't remember the last film I saw to do that so at least Paranormal Acivity got my blood flowing a couple times. But mostly its disturbing. Some of the night scenes would be slightly shocking, others would just be creepy to watch. But in each something different happens. In terms of acting, nothing spectacular but hardly as terrible as some are whining about. And while the film suffers from all other faux documentary films with the ""'WHY ARE YOU STILL FILMING? TURN THE CAMERA OFF!' 'I WOULD BUT THEN THERE WOULDN'T BE A MOVIE TO SHOW.'"" moments, there are actually times when the boyfriend gets yelled at to turn off the camera and does so. And his character is shown from the beginning to be stubborn, frat boyish, and egotistical. So, while his stupidity starts to wear on you, its a slightly more plausible reason for the continual filming than say Blair Witch Projects ""THE CAMERA IS ALL I HAVE LEFT!!!"" moments. To sum up, is this the scariest film of all time? No. But it is without a doubt the scariest film to be shown in the mainstream theater in the last few years. Its more terrifying then the endless remakes and sequels we have been plagued with. One thing I hope for with all the hype is that horror fans want more genuine shock moments than over the top gore.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Did the hype kill this movie?,"Did the hype kill the movie? I watch a lot of horror movies and normally I would really have liked this one. In the endless stream of b-movies and even expensive crap, this movie really stands out. Paranormal Acivity is a scary and straightforward movie and it isn't boring. But of course there is the hype. After I heard this was the scariest movie ever, expectations evidently went up. Eventually resulting in a slight disappointment. This movie would have been much scarier, creepier if I hadn't had any expectations, if I hadn't read any reviews. I guess Public Enemy was right about the Hype.The movie is scary indeed. After watching Paranormal Activity I noticed that the nightly sounds of my 200 years old house were louder and creepier than ever. But I did not let my good night's sleep for it.The acting was good but sometimes slightly overdone, which made it difficult for me to connect with the characters. I understand that Micah, the bf, had to be annoying, the character was written that way. But their is something wrong if you start imagining in the middle of the movie gruesome ways he could die. The movie should have been scarier if I had had more empathy for the characters.Anayway I enjoyed watching this film, but the hype made me expect more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Entertaining.,"Katie and Micah move into their new home, but instead of domestic bliss, the couple share several sleepless nights, prompting them to set up cameras during the night. The nights become more and more eventful.I didn't exactly fall in love with this film when it was first released, people were apparently collapsing with fear in the cinemas, I never bought that, I didn't find it scary, looking back, I find it original.It always felt as though the found footage genre took off after, and because of this film, not my favourite type of film, but I can appreciate what went on behind the scenes here.I actually think the followups did a better job with scares, they took it much further, but when it came to originality, this one is the winner.Later films seem more scripted, and are definitely more heavily produced, this one feels a lot more raw, more naive in a way, that's where this film's charm comes from, that and the snappy running time.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Best Bargain in the Basement,"Paranormal Activity (R, 1:29) — Fantasy: Supernatural, bargain basement, original""Significance"" is one of several dimensions I use to categorize SF&F films. It refers to the amount of resources — writing, acting, sets, costumes, effects, promotion, etc. — thrown into any particular movie, and I drop things into 4 pigeonholes: biggie, 2nd string, 3rd string, and bargain basement.Earlier this week I put The Age of Stupid into the last of these (movies that could have been made in somebody's basement), but Paranormal Activity is even basementier. In fact, compared to its siblings, The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield, it may be the basementiest feature film ever released. You could make 10 of these for what Transformers probably blew on latex alone.But that brings us to the ""bargain"" part. Dollar for dollar, you get about a zillion times more entertainment out of Paranormal Activity than you do out of even good blockbusters like Iron Man, let alone such overblown, overfrenetic, overloud crap as Transformers.The movie is set entirely in a single house and features only 2 actors, both nonentities, aside from fleeting appearances by a couple of equally unknown supporting actors. It's all filmed with a consumer video camera, and much of the film is devoted to what that camera, mounted on a tripod in the young couple's bedroom, captures on its ultra-low-light setting as they sleep each night away for 2 weeks in late 2006.As we learn in the opening sequence, it's a pretty expensive camera, and Katie Featherston (playing a character of the same name) is fretting over the cost, but her boyfriend, Micah Sloat (ditto), assures her that he makes that much money in a single morning. It develops that she's an English-lit student and he's a day trader.Of more interest is why they acquired this geeky gizmo. Katie's been haunted by strange apparitions at least since she was 8 years old, and at the beginning Micah is humoring her by indulging his penchant for guy toys with a view toward capturing some of her more recent paranormal visitations on audio and video. He's pretty skeptical, but soon enuf weird poltergeistic effects start showing up on tape, just tiny little things, but inexplicable, and gradually he dials down the scoffing and (honest, well earned) chuckles and starts thinking this is ""cool"" (and, we are left to infer, possibly profitable). Katie, meanwhile, gets increasingly jittery and frightened. Neither is sleeping well, and they start snapping at each other, followed by regrets and reassurances.The dialog and performances are absolutely, totally, 100% realistic. Katie and Micah behave and talk exactly as you would expect of any happy young couple. Nothing is forced or artificial. The film completely avoids all horror-movie clichés. No cats jump at you out of the dark. Every time they flip a switch, the lights reliably come on. There are none of those cheap tricks where you see a character all alone in a wide-angle shot, then cut to a close-up as a hand appears out of nowhere from behind. In fact, almost all the shots are long, fixed- camera, wide-angle perspectives, and you can see exactly what's going on at all times (including the time stamp in the lower right corner).All of which make this the kind of movie that I'm always hoping for — an original story, well told, effective, using believable characters and, at least in this case, not needing a huge budget to get the job done.Since I saw it the same day as Pandorum (3), with its seizure-inducing stroboscopic credits, I must also say a good word about the closing credits for Paranormal Activity: 3 minutes of total black screen. True to the producers' conceit, they maintain the illusion of documentarihood to the very end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Wonderful Under Certain Conditions,"PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is THE most popular movie of the year and will ultimately be regarded as one of the best horror movies of all time. Therefore, PA has warranted a HUGE debate on whether it sucks or not.Under this pretense, I have divided this review into 3 sections: 1 for the things in the movie that work, 1 for the things that don't, and 1 for the summation.******THE GOOD******************************1. Originality - not a cheap knockoff or a member of Hollywood's non-stop horror remake/reboot wave. That is a game winner right there! Comparable to the Blair Witch Project, PA has received a lot of flack as being a rip off of BWP. Taken into consideration, the film's only real similarity to BWP is the use of home camera/1st person footage, and non-professionals inducing reactions from the supernatural world. That said, you have to answer yourself a question: Would you rather see another Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, or a completely original off-BWP type film?2. Suspense and Tension - the film does not rely on cheap scares and loud noises deafening you to induce the desire reaction of fear. Nor does it have the smallest fraction of gore/sex/exploitation compared to most of today's horror movies. If you prefer horror movies that usually don't stick with you and follow you out of the theater, then skip it by all means. The film gives you a few inches, and leaves your imagination to finish the mile.A suggestion on viewing the film: If you want to get the most out of Paranormal Activity, then DO NOT see it in the local theater on a Friday night. We all know what happens when you are in a theater with middle and high school kids during a horror movie. To fully immerse yourself in the movie, see it with your significant other, by yourself, or with just a couple of friends at a time when the theater is the least crowded. Try to see it at night, or at home in the dark. This film invades the sanctity of one's bedroom, and the old tactic of pulling the covers over your head doesn't work.3. Special Effects - even on a small budget, the film provides some very impacting scenery. Some effects are blatantly obvious, and some of the best effects are actually the most subtle.4. Acting - the movie is well acted considering it is full of unknowns. The characters are not obnoxious like most horror movie protagonists. They appear genuine and very convincing in most of the film. But in some scenes, not so much. More below.5. Plot - there is a pleasant (oxymoron) surprise with the direction the film went regarding the source of the phenomena. It's not your typical ghost or haunted house story. I will not embellish on this as it will spoil the movie for those who haven't or are deciding to see the movie.******THE NOT SO GOOD***********************1. Writing - this is actually a 50/50 split. The 'supernatural' scenes are very convincing considering the subject matter, whether scripted or improvised. However, the dialog and character motivation/action during the 'down time' is unrealistic at times. This is a large complaint by those who didn't like the movie. Although the film is a large departure from teen filled slasher movies, the characters at times seem to be just as brainless as the teens getting whacked by Jason. There is a lot of ""WHY DIDN'T THEY JUST....?"" scenes in the movie.2. Acting - like the writing, the acting seems to suffer in the 'down time'. Fortunately, during the important (scary) scenes, the acting is spot-on, and very convincing. However, you might be taken out of the movie when the protagonists are interacting with each other during the in-between scenes, and the authenticity of their relationship is questionable in some parts.3. Scenery - granted that the whole movie is filmed in or on the characters' house, the static viewpoint of the camera gets a little boring. With all the phenomena going on, it would have been refreshing to see things from a different angle, especially in the bedroom. Fortunately, this doesn't hinder the movie, just a minor complaint.******AS A HORROR FAN***********************Follow the suggestions above regarding with who, where and how to watch the movie. Seen under the right circumstances, and with the right state of mind, the film can be very effective, and having you looking over your shoulder when you turn out all the lights in the house, and crawl into bed. For this reason, I fully endorse this movie as a new member of the horror family. Fresh and original, the movie deserves all of the attention it is getting.Let this be a glaring message to Hollywood that originality is still the craved for in the movie industry. Horror fans have grown tired of having their favorite classics butchered and pointlessly remade. Directors and producers do not deserve revenue for just upping the violence and sexual gratification of old horror movies.The film's success is also a great indication that as a population, movie goers respond better to thought provocative subjects than mindless in-your-face cannon fodder. It relieves me to some degree to see that tension-fear based horror movies still have the chance to take the cake. Especially on such a small budget.Well Done, producers, directors, and actors. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good but depressingly over-hyped. Disappointment,"I watched this movie in the cinemas since i wanted the full effect and to be horrified like never before as the youtubevideos suggests. The movie was so hyped i hoped it to be that scary movie I've been waiting for since my experience with Rec.The setup is a house, two people in it and a camera. Starts off promising with fairly good acting. It almost seems they are a couple in real life, that would be my guess. Micah(Micah) does what you would expect from a boyfriend after his girlfriend tells him she hears noises and sees things after midnight - he sets up a camera in the house and starts taunting. As texts in the middle of the screen shows the process, day1..day12 etc. things escalates from day to day. People in the audience are getting nervous and i feel the tension rising and building up my expectations. However the movie is never really kicking off and nothing is ever happening, its like Scream without the guy with the knife. Its like your lover giving you a lapdance and leaving in the middle of the show. Its like i pay 15bucks to get scared but i get angry instead. The whole movie felt like the first 30 minutes of a good horror movie, then all the sudden texts start running down the screen and the cinema is lit up - the movie is actually ending after 30 min? oh well my clock tells me I've been sitting here for 1½ hours.Taking the budget into consideration i would say its a great horror movie. I guess i was just expecting something more frightening. Want to know how the audience was reacting? They reacted like me, laughing and complaining when walking out.I could almost promise you the hype is mostly made up and the videos you can watch online are promotion and bullshit. I cant imagine anyone leaving the cinema or getting freaked out. OK, maybe if they are bored and leave or angry and freaked out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
not THAT great,"That's what I get for believing the hype. Yes, it was a good movie, but not much more. Having watched movies for 40 years, I can think of others that disturbed me more. The most disturbing part was what the characters DIDN'T do when they had evidence. No one would react the way they did. If you had video evidence of a presence in your house, wouldn't you tell just about everyone? If you bore the marks of being attacked by an invisible presence, wouldn't you have them checked out? If you were one of the few friends that they did tell, would you really let them stay in that house another two weeks? If you were the girl and your boyfriend lied to you as much as this guy did, would you still stay with him? I was glad to see a movie acknowledge the existence of demons, however.Finally, the ending was cheesier than my nachos. It's worth a watch, but I have seen better and scarier.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"One of the Original, and One the best Found Footage Movies","I have a soft spot for found footage movies, and this was one of the first I saw, following Blair Witch, which I feel was more successful due to marketing rather than substance. There are some fairly low scoring reviews for this movie, and I am pretty certain it is due to expectation. This was made over 15 years ago, when found footage was just nascent. It was made on a miniscule budget and was so believable, not leaping straight into the horror, but building up slowly, with increasing suspense. Nowadays, there is a higher expectation for found footage movies, but back then, it was a real risk to make. There is a saying in the business world KISS, Keep It Simple Stupid., and this movie personifies this philosophy, and to good effect.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Theatre Experience I'll Never Forget.,"A couple decide to document their nights while they sleep, after they hear strange noises that they believe to be a haunting.I respect this film, for the fact that it was shot for less than 20,000, had absolutely no marketing campaign and has become a huge success based on word of mouth and the audience demanding to see it. If only other studios would follow suit and listen to people demanding to see movies they want to see, maybe there wouldn't be so much crap out there.Paranormal Activity is shot like Cloverfield, Blair Witch Project, REC, Cannibal Holocaust, etc. If any of those films gave you motion sickness, you might want to skip this one. Half the film is shot while they sleep, so the film is on a tri-pod, the other half is them walking around with it. So if you've never been a fan of those films, skip this one. Second, the film is not as scary as people make it out to be. Instead, it is one creepy and suspenseful film, that seeing in a theatre, only heightened my enjoyment of it.The audience I went with, all had a collective ""Oh My God"". I could hear it every time something creepy happened. You could literally feel everyone in the theatre holding their breath every time they went to sleep. Again, if you are the type of person who wants to watch a film and not hear a peep out of anyone else, skip this film.Now the film itself, shot in one week, small (very small) budget and every penny of it went towards the special effects. The special effects are what sell the film, if you don't buy them, the film will not creep you out. They looked real and impressive enough to push the film into a successful goal, which is to scare people. If you are already afraid of the dark, this film will not help you. Every creek, thump, noise you hear in your house will now have you thinking twice.Less is more, The Blair Witch Project uses this, as does Paranormal Activity. The two leads, are haunted by a demon, one we never see, only hear. Whenever you go into a horror film, as a kid you would close your eyes in fear. Big mistake, because it's the ears you need to be covering. The sound is what makes you jump, hear nothing, fear nothing. The sound design behind this film is what is scary people, accompanied by the visuals (memorable scenes with the powder and bed sheets).As the film progresses, the haunting gets worse. I don't want to give anything away, and I urge you to not watch the trailer. I watched the trailer and was waiting for those things to happen, it took away from the general fear. Not knowing what to expect will make this film that much better, that much creepier and that much more entertaining. I didn't expect it to be as funny as it was either, the lead male had some comic relief dialogue, the ease the tension.The couple are believable, the hand held camera angle works here and the fear will set in. I applaud Paranormal Activity, for not only becoming an unheard of success, but for being one of the creepiest films I've ever seen.Bravo.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Too much hype, Too much of a let down","Let me say, I was expecting that ""Parnormal Activity"" was going to be an awesome horror movie that really made you scared and really reminded you what fear feels like. This wasn't the case. Before this movie hit the theaters in my area, I was dying to see it because of all the hype it was getting. When it came to my theaters, I went out to see it with a few friends. Let me say, it really wasn't that good. I don't understand what people saw in this movie. What was so scary about it? What was so interesting about it? The scenes dragged many times, and most of the time, nothing really ""scary"" happens. Can someone say ""OVERRATED""? I think this could win the award for most overrated movie of 2009. I hope the sequel isn't a let-down.Don't waste your time seeing this.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
so over-hyped....,"The movie was good, but not great, it did not meet my expectations at all. Truthfully speaking, i was a little disappointed. however, the idea of using a camcorder throughout the whole movie was a cool. Don't get me wrong, it was a good movie and even a little freaky at the end. but the trailer raised the expectation too high, saying that it is the scariest movie ever. NOT EVEN CLOSE. it was not even the scariest movie of the year. some people even felt asleep during the movie, i got close to it, but i forced myself to stay awake. You will jump a few times in a movie, but that's about it. I personally would watch the zomebieland instead if you just want to go watch a movie right now.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""Paranormal"" is extra-ordinary","I was fortunate to see this film about a year ago, and have become curious as to why it still has not seen the light of day. A little research has indicated it still might.The storytelling here is simple but also inspired. Young couple Katie and Micah plan to film their home at night while sleeping in hopes of capturing evidence of a ghost that seems to haunting them, or more precisely Katie, since this is not the first time she has experienced these type of visitations. We watch the footage of the young couple sleeping and gradually things do start to happen. Katie and Micah also film themselves discussing the situation, a visit from a spiritualist, and a few other random moments. Doesn't sound like much, right? Or that it could possibly be the slightest bit scary. Well, Oren Peli's little indie film is everything a scary movie should be. In other words, it is indeed very scary.Peli accomplishes the improbable through utilizing tension, character and imagination. The found footage concept used in the movie, a la ""Blair Witch"", ""Cloverfield"" and the recent ""Quarantine"", is perhaps slightly more effective in this situation. It's usually a still camera with things sometimes occurring just beyond what we can see. The result is a heightened sense of reality and a greater sense of dread as to what those sounds could be. We've all been there. We here a noise out in the dark and are frightened by the unknown. Peli seems to understand this greatly and uses it to great effect. When the camera does move it is often done slowly, perhaps in an effort to avoid the shaky-cam effect, but it also helps create greater tension.But perhaps the one element most important to this film's success is the performance by Katie Featherston. In the beginning we meet a sweet young woman who has concerns about what could be happening to her. Perhaps a metaphor for fears regarding her relationship with Micah and their new home. As we approach the final scenes, Katie has been reduced to a person on the verge of a nervous breakdown, and we are deeply concerned for her well being. Each night as our young couple goes off to sleep we experience a deeper and greater dread that something bad is going to happen, and we don't like it. It helps that Ms. Featherston is an unknown (it's difficult to imagine caring this way about a recognizable actor) but her ability to create a believable and sympathetic character is remarkable and turns an effective thriller into something extraordinary.It's not often that a movie will truly have me on the edge of my seat. Watching it I was reminded of those days long ago when I first saw ""The Exorcist"", ""Halloween"" and ""Alien""; movies that have stayed with me over time as moments spent in a theatre genuinely frightened. It doesn't happen that often anymore, movies are either too gimmicky or too unbelievable or too music video flashy to get to me. But a little movie made with no money and no special effects did. To the cast and crew of ""Paranormal Activity"" - Thank you!p.s. with regards to the future of this movie, the latest news is that it will be released and not remade as earlier planned. No idea when that will happen, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed that this special little film doesn't get left on a shelf.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Horrors of Banality,"It seems no mere coincidence that a sleeper so far below the radar it took two years to find big-time distribution and commercial success has come on the 10-year anniversary of the innovative (though somewhat thin) found-footage footsteps of ""The Blair Witch Project."" Also familiar is the carefully calculated hype machine (which began as grassroots chatter that slowly garnered major interest) used to land the film in as many theatres as possible, with the beaming, always-hyperbolic blurbs of impressed bloggers lighting the way.When it wants to be (and it often is), ""Paranormal Activity"" is an effectively extemporaneous haunted-house freakout. Like ""Blair Witch,"" it takes a simple premise (young couple encountering a restless, unseen presence in their home), and builds around it a claustrophobic vortex of suspense, where our (not always) sympathy-garnering protagonists become mankind's last stand against forces far beyond its control.In an interesting narrative choice, the film begins with Katie and Micah (she's the reserved student; he's the cocky day-trader) already complicit with the strange happenings in their new house, to the point where Micah is actively recording the proceedings in hopes of catching an ectoplasmic curveball. Their banter possesses a slice-of-life realism that helps ground us in the banality of suburban America, complemented by the house's own lack of production-designed, artsy flourish. The consumer-grade camera work, while already a well-established avant-garde cliché, is fittingly abrasive and starkly honest.With his shoestring budget and limited resources, writer-director Oren Peli has created a film that (yes, like ""Blair Witch"") requires the viewer to drop all expectations of a slick, glossy gorefest and embrace the lost art of the subtle, slow-burn scare. This is more of an Unease Film than a Horror Film. And while the sense of psychic disturbance in the air is indeed palpable, ""Paranormal Activity"" plays like an intriguing short subject stretched beyond its capacity; by the time the disappointing, jump-scare conclusion rolls around, it feels like an out-of-place shock in a film that doesn't quite know how to combine its parts into a satisfying whole (Katie's haunted past, for instance, is left dangling). And once the screen went black, I was just wishing Peli had pushed the supernatural elements even further. In the end, ""Paranormal Activity"" is a risible (yet not superior, especially in the wake of ""Diary of the Dead"" and ""Quarantine"") contender bringing up the tail end of a cinematic fad.6.5 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
You demanded it,"The only thing I demand about this is my money back.Simply put, this movie, if you can call it that, is flat out terrible. I put it up there with Cabin Fever. So, if you liked Cabin Fever, by all means go see this. If you liked Cabin Fever, you like anything.I'm sorry I missed this at the festival. I would have warned everyone sooner.This is what I call the Blair Witch Cookie Cutter method of film production and distribution.1. Make a video or film with all shaky grainy hand-held shots to look homemade. You can even save on proper lighting.2. Have it loosely based on some mysterious subject.3. Spend a lot of time and money on Internet marketing trying to get the ""idea"" of the movie viral. Aim this marketing at younger people. Social networking sites are a good place to start.4. Market the movie like ""everyone"" wants to see it (which, by the way, was one of Barnum's idea's.)5. Hope that you get a huge initial release box office take and then be happy with at least a 50% drop each subsequent week.6.

Decent But Was Expecting More,"I enjoyed the cool sounds effects like you can really feel the bass go right through you and the realistic acting (even though the roles weren't hard to play)I feel it really is one of those films you can only enjoy at the cinemas, unless you have a sick setup, if you watched it in a proper auditorium in the dark on a cinema screen then I believe it would scare the hell out of you and me.It had no hold over me emotionally and I found it really hard to submerge myself into the film to make it feel believable and put myself in one of the characters shoes because there was no tangible storyline and weak character development IMO.Character development would have gradually given me a better understanding of them so that I am able to put myself in their shoes and even though it was realistic, it was boringly realistic and the characters didn't put their emotions in enough perspective for me.You can tell the general script and storyline wasn't very well written or original, maybe it wasn't meant to be(nothing more then I'd expect from a low budget indie film) if a film like this attempts to play with your emotions/fears then I feel like it needed a little more uumf if you know what I mean, there was too much subtleness, cause at the end I was left thinking is that it ? Was quite disappointed in the ending, it didn't reveal enough, and was kind of supposed to let the watchers imagination do all the work, maybe this film will be more scary to people who are more open minded to the possibility that supernatural things are real (whereas I'm not), wasn't my type of film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Some great, terrifying aspects, but it drags, and it really is low budget in spirit","Paranormal Activity (2007)Don't you hate it when a preview turns out to have all the great moments of a movie? Well, that's sort of true here--and they are great moments. But there is a lot of waiting around, and a lot of suspending disbelief to make this simple movie fly.Yes, it's a super low budget effort, and good for them. I love the spirit of it, and the plot proceeds steadily, if with a lot of deliberation, a steady progression to more and more horror. The format, showing the main couple sleeping each night in a kind of home-brew surveillance camera is clever, and builds suspense each time. It's a smart situation, and if it had been smart all through, it would have succeeded even with its beginner's credentials.But oh well. Why, for example, do they refuse to turn on the lights in some scenes? And why do they refuse to just leave--at least to go to MacDonald's or something for a breather? The lead young woman is a student, but you wouldn't know it. I like her in general, and that helps. And he's likable in his annoying ways, too, and he does what for a living-- daytrading? Is that still a job? Enough to pay for a big house in San Diego? Well, you get the point. There are holes in this cheesy movie to make the Swiss proud.Does it work anyway? Sometimes. You won't be angry leaving the theater. But you'll be happier watching it at home--it's all about being afraid to go to your own bed, and so might as well make it too close for comfort. The obvious precedent in Blair Witch Project is tough because that earlier movie is so much better--better in concept, better acting, more range in the filming, and an amazing ending.

The Hype-The Film-The Fear,"Dearest readers, a film like this has not come along since The Exorcist. After listening to all the hype, and following this film until 2007 you could say I knew a lot about this little film. Nothing could prepare me for the climatic, scary ass situations that the cast and crew put on celluloid. Yes, my friends, it really is a scary movie.I won't tell you what it's about because by this point you should already know that. What I want to tell you is how great this film really is.Director Peli has succeeded in creating a masterpiece with little money and simple theme park haunted house gags. He does something that Hitchcock did so well in his prime-he creates a level of suspense so intense that the smallest sound makes your heart jump.That, is great film-making, because it is made with an educated audience in mind. He doesn't cater to the general public he gives film lovers what they want and he gives it to them hard.Don't go to this for gore. Don't go to this for Hollywood crap. Don't go to this with your kids under 15. Most importantly....don't go to this...alone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Absolutely terrifying, possibly the scariest film I have ever seen.","After just witnessing a special showing of this spectacularly terrifying film, I can say without a doubt, that I will not be sleeping tonight.

This tension reaches the point where even the slightest flicker, movement, or shadow makes you want to fly out of your seat. The beauty of this film is that nothing is revealed too quickly the director lets the previous events simmer and settle with the audience before revealing more.Rarely do films leave me so terrified that I am shaking after they have ended. Paranormal Activity is an exception to this. I highly recommend this film to all those that want to be scared out of their wits.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A truly cunning stunt...,"...or, to be more accurate, how a very cheap and silly film was repackaged and pumped-up to fool an audience and make an absolute fortune.""Paranormal Activity"" is truly about as scary and believable as an episode of ""Scooby Doo."" Nothing more than a brutally cynical, major-league exercise in hype, marketing and ultimately a result of mass-audience gullibility for such things. Along with the plebian tendency to concur about the Emperor's New Clothes being everything they were led to believe.Whatever people see in this ""film"" of any emotional or creative worth, I'm afraid I don't, and I'm going to stand up, point and shout: ""But the Emperor hasn't got any clothes on!"" Let's face it - old hat, badly done. Liked the string pulling the door closed though. Was that included as an in-joke do you think? A little ironic jab in the ribs?To borrow a rhetorical slice of quippery from one John Lydon (a.k.a. Johnny Rotten): ""Ever been had? You 'ave now!""",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Pretty good,"I thought the movie was pretty good for the most part. Yes it had a few dull moments(what film doesn't) but other than that it was pretty good. Now I don't see this as being anywhere near the most scary film I've ever seen but it is better than some of the ""big"" Hollywood movies. I won't give anything away if you haven't watched it yet but there is one really scary part near the end of the movie that really made me jump. When you watch the movie you will see what I'm talking about. I thought the ""no name"" actors did a really great job in this movie. It's a lot like ""The Blare With Project"" only you can actually see something other than darkness. Again it's not a movie that will go down in history as the best but it's sure worth watching!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Errr...,"A husband and wife who never seem to work or do anything at all decide to spend their free time hunting demons and recording footage of their bedroom whilst they sleep - that's literally as deep as I need to get into describing the plot to do it any favours. Gets a better rating for its convincingly jumpy moments, decent special effects and well-produced audio, but overall the dialogue is painful AND the entire thing has to be one of the most poorly constructed films this decade in terms of editing (and I don't mean that in an exaggerated way, I totally mean it).

Well done self made film of shadows and sounds that teases and entertains.,"I must saying that after seeing this film it was pretty much a treat to watch it. Even though I didn't let the images and shadows and sounds get to me like those others in the crowd, yet that's expected of teenagers. Anyway ""Paranormal Activity"" may not be a good old fashion gore feast of blood and guts, still it's just spooky enough with it's images and sounds to keep a viewer interested and on the edge of your seat. As it's true many times as legendary director John Carpenter said it's not what you see that scares you the most, but what you don't see that's coming around the corner that frightens you the most.The film stars a young married couple who go by their real life names as they neither are well known stars you have Katie and Micah who live in a suburban San Diego, California home. The couple's use of a hand held camera moves and paces the film along well as everything is told from their points of view. As they record nearly everything from their conversations to the visits of friends. Yet the main purpose that they use this recording device is to document the strange happenings that they feel is going on in their home as they feel are ghostly and one expert even tells them it is a problem with demons. As the tape rolls on all during the night hours of filming the couple's tossing and turning in bed in which many of us do unaware.And to keep viewers on the edge of their seats this night footage shows strange shadows creeping under the cover, you see doors slam hear groans and moans with wicked screams! These strange things cause fear for both Kate and Micah even one scene takes you back to your childhood nightmares as the under the bed monster(that you knew as a kid)drags Kate underneath pulling her away from bed! What more must I say I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it as you find out what a shocking twist it takes in the end.""Paranormal Activity"" is certainly a well done film that's interesting and gets the viewers attention for the way it was made and self paced with suspense that you don't really see. This film probably will be a cult independent classic that stands the test of time for years.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Greatest ""Shakey Cam"" movie ever.","I must admit I am a huge horror fan, being proud to say that nothing phases me. But as I gripped my girlfriends hand near pain, every time the characters went to sleep. I found myself happy and scared out of my mind. This film is that great. The film begins with the usual introduction of characters, and the problem they are having. After the initial twenty minutes, the movie quickly picks up and we get a glimpse of the so called problem. What really makes this film shine above the rest, is the fact that the characters are really relatable (for anyone in a relationship) you find yourself feeling for the two. This and the simple fact that the gripping tension each night they fall asleep is the perfect formula to hold the audiences attention.I caught this film at a screening in Glendale. If you get a chance to see this please do so before they remake it and it loses it's independent touch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Overrated,"This is a prime example of marketing over substance. It is a tedious watch of low budget but also low on ideas film making. While Blair Witch Project was innovative both in marketing AND in execution, this remarkably successful flick is proof that marketing can do better when selling such low budget movies than establishment tra sh like Annihilation. It gets some redemption for this extreme low budget approach, but the only thing cult about this movie is how much money it made, or more precisely, how much money studio made buying the rights and then giving the flick to their marketing department. The ending was improved, and it is the single part that stands out a bit, but make no mistake, this is one boring marketing hoax, and the joke is on the unwitting paying viewers.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
worst movie ever,i rented this movie for $1 at redbox and feel that i got ripped off. i would have rather paid to not see this pile of dung they call a film. the director of this movie should be gagged and shot on site. anyone who says this movie is anything other than a complete waste of time is out of their mind. its not just because this was a low budget film to make. absolutely nothing happened! i tried to stay awake after just about dozing off almost four times because i thought that something would happen at the end of the film. i could run around my house filming absolutely nothing with a crappy camcorder and release it on DVD and it would be more entertaining than paranormal activity. i cant believe they actually got the OK to release this horrible excuse of a film. DO NOT RENT THIS FILM. DO NOT BUY THIS FILM. if you do you will be sadly disappointed. i think i would rather chop off my own testicles than watch this mockery again. it is absolutely unbearable in every which way. all they do is turn off the lights with night vision on the camcorder and have someone hide in the bathroom or other rooms and make retarded noises that sound ridiculous and shut a couple doors. that basically sums up everything about this abomination,,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A fairly effective movie for this genre.,"""Paranormal Activity"" is one of those polarizing movies that, for the most part, will simply either work for the viewer or not. While scanning the most popular reviews, one can see comments ranging from quite positive to quite negative. In any event, it certainly developed a winning formula for success, having been filmed on a VERY low budget and generating huge revenue, proving that big budgets aren't necessary to create a box office sensation. It takes no name actors and puts them in a ""found footage"" scenario as a boyfriend (Micah Sloat) stubbornly insists on documenting just about everything when he and his girlfriend (Katie Featherston) start experiencing strange phenomena in their large and opulent San Diego home. As can be expected, things start out small and become creepier as time goes on. Eventually, things end with a big bang. Director Oren Peli manages to create a good atmosphere for the many night time scenes, and some genuine shocks, and does all of this with a noticeable lack of special effects. Our two leads are able to consult with a psychic (Mark Fredrichs), who gives them some valuable knowledge, but he's still not exactly an expert in matters deemed to be demonic in nature, so there is little that they can do to protect or arm themselves. The very minimal level of performers also helps to achieve a level of intimacy, and the movie never leaves the one location of the house. Understandably, it's kind of hard to sympathize with the somewhat annoying Micah, who keeps up a pretty cavalier attitude towards the whole thing, and he's one of those characters in these types of movies who keeps the camera going even when implored by another to stop. Katie is definitely a more universally appealing character, but she does bring some baggage to the relationship and scenario, as strange things have been happening to her for much of her life. Ultimately, this viewer gives this moderately positive feedback because, while it never gripped him the way it did so many others, it still managed to come up with some good and eerie moments, and does a fine job of giving off that whole vibe of a house in the early hours of the A.M.

Interesting and very realistic,"Interesting and very realistic. Kind of an indoors Blair Witch Project, but much more effective. Starts off very slowly though, to the point that I was just about to give up on it. However, the pace and the scares ramp up as the movie goes on. Pacing is quite uneven throughout though.Innovative direction, using a hand-held camera to give a home-movie feel. Not entirely orginal (Cannibal Holocaust, Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield etc have all done it before) but well executed.The two main actors - Katie Featherstone and Micah Sloat - give excellent performances, helping give the movie the realistic feel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Paranormal Activity A Creepy Horror Thriller,"Paranormal Activity is a creepy horror thriller with just the right amount of suspense from writer/director Oren Peli whose admirable in making this movie that doesn't rely on cheap scares and CGI effects to entertain the audience. I actually preferred this one over the Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield because for the most part there weren't too many shaky camera movements. Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat are effective as the two leads giving believable performances as their characters. The suspense build up was good which doesn't quite pay off but isn't exactly a failure either. The sounds they came up with for the demon or ghost terrorizing the two leads were very effective and well paced throughout the film. It definitely helped add to the creep factor and the special effects are equally impressive for a 15,000 dollar budget. I think the demon or evil entity is seen only twice briefly as a sinister shadow proving that sometimes the things we can't really see can be far more effective than the ones we can. I enjoyed the fact that instead of relying on CGI and cheap thrills writer/director Oren Peli chose to use more practical effects like the sounds of footsteps, growls, a door closing shut, lights going on and off, and loud bangs to scare the audience. I wasn't very scared watching this but it definitely creeps you out. I suggest you go in not knowing too much about the movie otherwise any spoilers might ruin the experience for you. Overall Paranormal Activity was better than I thought it would be and it's worth watching. The ending is a little predictable but the good outweighs the bad. This film might not be up there with The Shining but its certainly no Shutter or The Grudge to name a few that weren't the greatest at least to me. So if you're in the mood for a suspenseful horror thriller than Paranormal Activity is the movie for you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
First things first...,"...I will concede that this movie was never going to actually ""scare"" me. While I love horror movies, I simply don't have the sort of mindset (or at least haven't had it since I was 12 and had trouble sleeping after seeing the first ""Nightmare on Elm Street"") to find myself viscerally frightened by a movie or TV show. I'm far more likely to be viscerally disgusted -- which is why I won't watch torture porn -- than frightened. So anything I have to say about this movie has to be understood in this context.Having said that, the first time I watched this movie, 10 years ago, I really did start to get a sense of the tension and dread being built up. Some of the behavior of the characters made little sense (why not go to a public place for the night? or turn on actual lights rather than relying on the camera? or show the evidence to others? or even just decide that inexplicable and deeply unpleasant things happening demand to be taken seriously? looking at you, Micah) and that led to a sense of the director manipulating the audience by cutting off any avenue of escape by preventing the characters from finding relief, which in turn creates a sense of the inevitable. If they never leave their house/yard, at least not that the audience actually witnesses, well, yeah, it's going to feel suffocating and inexorable. That said, I do believe it works. Even if you have to suspend some belief and common sense, the movie accomplishes its goal, and does so with a nicely developing series of escalating phenomena. I can certainly see how people would find it disturbing, and could feel it myself (it wasn't going to scare me but that doesn't mean I'm insensitive to the effect.)Unfortunately, the aspects I've mentioned also drag down the rating. It's just too manipulative, too much like cheating. I wanted to love it, because you always want to pull for the guy who makes a movie for $15K and hopes for the best. I liked it, even if I didn't really like the leads (especially Micah, who comes across as a stereotype to keep the movie going, which also feels like cheating, a little) and I do admire the director's combination of real creepiness while exercising a restraint that few horror directors seem to be capable of. My rewatch has left me with the same opinion as my original watch, so I feel comfortable in the consistency of my reactions to the movie as a whole/",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
No nonsense horror,"This isn't your typical horror movie. Not flashy with insane special effects and buckets of fake blood, not some giant killer with a knife or chainsaw or machete. This is exactly what it was called, Paranormal Activity, a movie that once it grabs you it never lets go. I am going out on a limb with confidence in saying I am the biggest horror fan alive, no offense to anyone but just test me and you'll agree. This is now in my top 3 best movies of all time (If you don't have annoying people laughing in the theater while you watch it). Every moment was intense and breathtaking, a horror work of art. the supernatural is so unknown, movies like this have a way of forcing themselves into your mind and staying there.

PN is an innocent attempt to portray a different kind of horror based completely on what kind of person you are!,"Paranormal Activity is fair attempt at popularizing the genre of cam-reality cinema. It combines a very interesting plot along with a creative screenplay which lacks shaking cams, over-done screams, etc. Though interesting and refreshing, the movie neither meets the expectations nor the euphoria that this movie has propagated far and wide.The movie throughout uses the element of surprise as its lifeline for adding the SCARE element! No matter what the scenes are, you will be scared if you are always worried as to what is going to happen now. Most people who have praised PN as the scariest movie they have ever seen come under those category of people. If you are one of those people, you should definitely watch the movie.However, then there are others who are not worried, but are the edge of their seats expecting something horrific to happen soon and towards the end of the movie, they not only lose their patience, but their expectations might/might not be met. If you are one of those people, I would say that maybe you would find this an average affair.Lastly, the last kind of people who are none other than horror fans who expect to wet their pants are coming in for a shock. This is not one of those movies!Nonetheless, PN has several well directed shots towards the latter half of the movie that show its creative genius.On a final note, PN is an innocent attempt to portray a different kind of horror based completely on what kind of person you are. It is definitely refreshing and at least a one time watch :)",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Avoid this film at all costs! The horror is so boring it might kill you!,"I gave this a 2 because I have seen a fair number of movies made for more money that were not any better. However, that is a mere curiosity. I confide that I have written a couple reviews for movies I love, but for this dreck so foul I found the impetus to declaim before all you who are fortunate to have up to now missed out on this stupefying movie! The low budget results in a very poor sound quality: I had to watch the movie at jet engine take-off volume because my partner could not make out what the characters were saying. This made it torture to watch AND to hear. I want to be scared, not tortured, but Paranormal Activity offers precious little scariness, yet countless annoyances, the sound being only one of many. I won't continue with details. Just trust me, one who rarely shares his opinions -- this is at best an absolute waste of time.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Blair Witch in Suburbia,"Just as it was the case with ""The Blair Witch Project"" a decade ago this horror mockumentary is clearly a matter of love-it-or-hate-it. I actually liked the earlier pic despite its flaws and I've got the same opinion about this scary little shocker. (Yes, it IS scary! Don't listen to all those desensitized film geeks who get their kicks from chainsaw massacres and the likes.) I agree, the character actions are entirely too dependent on the visual and local limitations and thus seem partly forced and loose, and basically the script's just playing with old-hat spooky house clichés.But the narrative arc is quite effective, the central issue is treated with a certain inner logic, the performances are natural and the sparse use of special effects and gore is welcome in times of mindless slasher trash.7 out of 10 footsteps in the dark",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Doesn't live up to the hype,"I expected too much out of Paranormal, that, despite it being a decent movie, I left the theater disappointed. I expected to be frightened and to s*** in my pants, but that didn't happen. I appreciated how different the movie was, and how the director used small, but clever scare tactics, being his first film and all; good thing this wasn't a Hollywood movie, too! That would've ruined it. The movie had wonderful actors, and the couple had realistic chemistry with one another. The thing I didn't like, though, was the fact that the movie was too slow trying to get to the scary moments. The slow parts dragged my patience for so long that I ended up bored for most of the 'scary' moments. Lots of people in the audience freaked out (mostly the women) and hollered at the scary moments, but I didn't', and I'm not that hard to scare. Most of the audience laughed during the scary moments, because everyone expected to be scared out of their minds. Yeah, the movie was funny, because of the guy, Micah, and his humorous attitude, but after a while, I stopped laughing. The best part of the movie, though, is the final act. Things really started to pick up near the end, but the ending was anticlimactic and disappointing. The movie didn't deserve such an ending, but the moment RIGHT before the ending was amazing. The minutes before the movie ended was the truly intense, freaky, creepy part of the movie. If only the film was like that the whole time, I would've been scared and loved it! Although I was disappointed, the experience as a whole was absolutely fun. With the movie theater packed and stuff, and everyone expecting the same thing from the movie, it was fun and exciting. If you truly want to be scare, though, I'd suggest going alone, or maybe with a few other people, on a day when the movie theater isn't packed. Go on a weekday in order to get an empty theater. Hopefully that would heighten the scary parts of the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
What you can't see is always scarier than what you can,"In his review of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" Roger Ebert said, ""The noise in the dark is almost always scarier than what makes the noise in the dark."" Indeed, that film terrified audiences 11 years ago by exploiting that fact. Now, Oren Peli has taken the same concept, and made a similar horror flick. And ""Paranormal Activity"" is a hell of a lot scarier.Katie and Micah are two roommates who are witnessing some strange occurrences in their home. They decide to buy a video camera to record these occurrences, and that's when the film begins.Plot is of little matter here. Neither are special effects. The camera is hand-held, but usually it is on a stand or resting (thank God). The actors are very real, which is the point. It doesn't take long before we believe that this is actual footage.The construction of the film is genius. The occurrences are what in other contexts would be normal sounds, but without a visible source, they become frightening. But what really gets us is that many times we are unsure that anything happened at all. Oren Peli is a genius for making this all work so well. One could divide the film in three parts: slow, creepy then downright scary.It's not perfect (the beginning isn't very effective, and initially the possible explanations seem downright silly, although once the film gets going, that all changes). However I'm giving it a 10 because it actually scares the hell out of us extremely well, and the tension builds to an ultimate crescendo. And the climax (the original...the alternate ending is pretty weak) is downright terrifying.This is one film that goes beyond thrills and crosses the line into utter fear.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The mouths were wrong...,"For the life of me I can't understand how this film generated such good word of mouth. No doubt if the stuff that happens in this film happened to you in real life you'd be scared witless. Doors open and close in the middle of the night, loud bangs disturb the peace in the dead of night, hapless victims are dragged by their ankle from their bed as they sleep – it would be enough to drive you crazy with fear. Trouble is, when you transfer all this to the big screen and use Blair Witch-style home video recordings to show it all, it all comes across as a little 'so'what?'It doesn't help that Micah, the boyfriend of Katie, the girl with her own demonic stalker, is the kind of smug idiot who films himself strumming the guitar and seems intent on irritating whatever it is that his girlfriend has bought into the house at every opportunity. He films everything, and ignores her repeated and increasingly short-tempered pleas to switch the damn thing off, and he prolongs arguments by refusing to answer questions with answers. Together, they're the kind of couple you might enjoy seeing once or twice a year, but any more and you'd really start looking for ways to avoid them, regardless of whether their demon was in tow. Add to the fact that they refuse to take the obvious steps any normal person would take, and you end up being too irritated with them to care what fate awaits. I know if the demonologist the ghost guy had recommended couldn't make it the first thing I'd do is rustle up a small army of parapsychologists (or whatever those crackpots are called) on the basic principle that there's safety (and comfort) in numbers. I'd phone the local TV station too, and the local papers. But these two bozos seem to be cocooned in a world of their own and choose to simply tough it out alone when the demon guy is out of town for a couple of days.On the plus side, the film's well-made on a tiny budget, and the two leads perform well, but that's about all it's got going for it. When the film finished the audience in the cinema remained rooted in their seats, not because they were terrified or stunned by what they had seen, but because they weren't quite sure whether the film was actually over or not. It's the only time I've ever known an entire audience (although it was pretty small, admittedly) sit through the credits and the minute or so of blank screen that followed waiting for some after-credits clip to somehow make it all worth while. Only when the lights came on and we all blinked at each other with a kind of bemused disbelief that we'd actually sat through the entire film did we begin to file dejectedly from the theatre.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Shatter the lens,"Interesting mix of reviews here. A lot of one or two stars, and others saying that the film is great. I think it all depends on how you approach this film. If you're coming into the theatre with the attitude ""I'm a horror movie fan, lets see some shock scenes, gore"" etc, then maybe it's not what you're looking for. If, however, you approach with an open mind and take it for what it is, is can be very frightening indeed.Approach this film with an open mind. Don't hide behind your ""knowledge"" of horror films, or with your movie-critic hat on.The film, as mentioned in other reviews, is seen through the eyes of a video recorder. This imparts a unique sense of voyeurism, realism, immediacy and believability; but also -crucially- a sense of protection, as we (as the audience) are kept ""behind"" the main characters or ""behind"" the lens, maintaining a subtle distance from the action.

What happens when you sleep?,"This film and the movie The Blair Witch Project (1999) are what started the horror movie genre known as found footage, and despite what I have heard from many people who have seen the very first Paranormal Activity (2007) have said it was the scariest thing they have seen at the time, but after I watched I didn't think it was as scary as people have said; but despite it not being completely scary, it does not mean I did not like it. The first film Paranormal Activity (2007) was good with the ways they use the found footage element on the film, the occasional scares, some creepy imagery with the invisible entity, and the main thing I liked was that the demon entity could not been seen; when it comes to this film or the sequels is that you will be bored if you have low attention spans, but for those who can hang on beginning to end, this film is worth watching at least once.Mainly, there are essentially just the main couple Micah and Katie and rarely will you see anyone else, so I will just say that these two characters consists of one being an idiot and the other being reasonably freaked out about what is happening; Micah was the one I thought was as an idiot because of how he does things he shouldn't do when having an entity like this in their house, along with recording pointless things and ignoring things Katie says, but I will say he does have his moments where he is a good boyfriend so I can't completely hate on him. Lastly, Katie acts how we would in this situation by being freaked out, trying to call a professional, and trying to deal with the demon problem by trying to get rid of it; there are hints on how things could connect to her and the progression of her character till the unsettling ending was well-done, along with certain things that occur that has you questioning things about her.What I looked up in the trivia was that this movie was filmed in ten days, and despite knowing what kind of film this is, it was impressive for a first-time director to film this in a short amount of time because of certain things that occur because of this invisible entity like someone being dragged or something being moved on camera; the practical effects and work that was done on the film was well-done with there being some unsettling moments and a couple good scares. I like that we do not see the demonic entity because it makes the film scarier in that sense since what you cannot see is scarier than what you can see, so it was effective when it is suddenly revealed at times that it was next to them the whole time, along with it mainly focusing on the bedroom each night because of the weird events that would happen; lastly, I will say that the found footage element of the film worked as an advantage because it was a way to make the film feel like real events of sorts.The first film Paranormal Activity (2007) was good with the ways they use the found footage element on the film, the occasional scares, some creepy imagery with the invisible entity, and the main thing I liked was that the demon entity could not been seen; when it comes to this film or the sequels is that you will be bored if you have low attention spans, but for those who can hang on beginning to end, this film is worth watching at least once so you can understand the impact it has had. I liked the film but did not find it the most terrifying thing I have seen like others have said, but the film had effective creepy imagery and a deeply unsettling ending, so for those who have not seen it, give it a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Scary Treat!,"Paranormal Activity may very well be the scariest film you will see all year. So turn off the lights and grab a pillow, and don't forget your camcorder with you as you never know what may be crawling pass your feet as you watch this very intense horror!Gore fans turn away however, as this film does not employ gruesome tactics to disgust the viewer, rather it uses clever suspenseful scenes to keep the audience on their toes throughout. The film moves quite slowly via a day-to-day account of the events that took place, but every day feels like a piece to the jigsaw puzzle that is Paranormal Activity as every night, something new as creepy as the events that took place the night before will unravel. This will certainly make you feel weary after each passing sunset in the film makes you more and more fearful of what is to come.Unfortunately, for a film that uses a documentary style filming to add a sense of scare to its viewers, it fails to be convincing in this aspect due to the horrendous acting. Probably the most paranormal thing in this movie is the male lead. Throughout the series of stressful events, the character manages to keep his cool throughout and never losing control. There were so many situations in which you would expect the male lead to just completely lose his mind and act accordingly, but he was unusually calm throughout. For a human being to act this way under such stressful situations is quite inhuman and I find it a tad bit scary to be honest!All in all, Paranormal Activity is a good enough horror flick for all you horror-seeking zombies to feed upon for the time being, but it isn't anything special in terms of modern film-making. What it does manage however is to provide tense-scary moments that the big budget horror directors out there fail to create.In summary, Paranormal Activity contains:Mind-numbing horrorSuspenseful scenesScary calm actors",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
ghost? what? where?,"well i had heard of this movie a while ago and was immediately intrigued. i just saw the movie today and though some of the audience laughed their way through the movie, most of the crowd was having a panic attack. now this movie was definitely a horrifying movie there is no doubt. though there are points where nothing is happening except for talking and arguing, it helps the storyline so bear with it and realize it's valuable information. the characters played their parts very well, the scenery was very realistic, and for the last half hour, i truly believed that it was really happening. now while this movie is not the real video, it is based on true events. to sum it up, the movie was great, a definite must see movie. it's not a gory horror movie, it's a psychological horror. it's much better in theaters. hope this helped some of you decide if you're going to see this movie or not.Nick",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the best in the found footage genre.,"There's been a flood of found footage films since 'The Blair Witch Project' popularized the genre back in 1999. Few were as effective as 'Paranormal Activity', and I still think this is one of the best films in the genre.It's interesting that the actors starred as themselves. This fact and the fact that they were unknown actors, makes the film more believable. The film doesn't show us how the paranormal activity started in the home of Katie and Micah. The film starts with Micah having bought a fancy new camera to record the strange goings-on in their home.'Paranormal Activity' doesn't start all subtle like most haunted house movies. It plunges the viewer into the scary and creepy world of paranormal activity right from the start. Off course, the haunting intensifies as the film unfolds. There are a few rather disturbing images. This is truly a frightening film.The performances were very natural, and the film felt authentic and real. It was also totally believable why they were constantly filming.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Very good edge of your seat horror movie,"Saw a screening in Seattle and all I gotta say is it is worth the hype. I've been so disappointed with recent horror movies, (and yes I've read threads where people actually liked the Grudge)that I've begun to think that Americans couldn't make horror films anymore. This movie dismayed my thought that this couldn't happen. People were literally screaming and moaning in the audience. The girl who sat next to me couldn't watch the last hour because it was too intense for her. One girl next to my friend was crying she was so terrified. I'd totally recommend this for anyone who wants a good theater going experience because it just heightened the tension. Very simple simple plot, but the way the filmmakers build up the tension is priceless. It kept everyone on the edge of their seat. Highly recommend this movie and hopefully it will shake the system.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great use of technology in a modern ghost story,"Heralded by many as THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT for a new generation, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is one of those no-budget creepy horror films that work through the powers of suggestion alone to create an intense viewing experience for people watching blessed with vivid imaginations. In essence, this is BLAIR WITCH done in the home: a couple are haunted by what they believe to be a ghost, and set up a video camera to catch evidence of it.The film is very good, thanks to the strong sense of realism that rarely departs – except maybe during the over-the-top climax, which unsurprisingly turns out to have the involvement of a certain Mr. Spielberg! Although some might find the on-screen antics boring, slightly repetitive and overly staged, I was hooked by the escalating haunting and caught up in a sense of impending menace and doom. There are many great scenes, especially those taking place in the latter half, and the bit with the footprints is supremely disturbing. Kudos too to the actors involved – Micah Sloat is saddled with playing a bit of a jerk, but Katie Featherston is believably scared throughout and reminded me at times of Heather Donohue.Okay, so that climax – the last few shots – is a little overboard, but until then we get a frightening film that works hard to achieve its aims through simple footsteps and bangs where there shouldn't be. PARANORMAL ACTIVITY bears similarities to BLAIR WITCH, but I actually think it's closer in spirit to horror classic THE HAUNTING, albeit filmed via modern technology.

Scariest Movie I've seen to date.,"Let's just say that that Tubbx3 is right on point with everything. I caught a special screening in Santa Monica, and at first I thought that there is no way this movie is going to scare me. As the movie progresses I was holding on to my seat. This movie is by far the most unpredictable horror movie I've seen. Words couldn't describe how good it is. I cant tell you much without giving stuff away, so all I have to say is that this movie is a must watch once it is released worldwide.Just like Tubbx3 said, ""What really makes this film shine above the rest, is the fact that the characters are really relatable (for anyone in a relationship) you find yourself feeling for the two. This and the simple fact that the gripping tension each night they fall asleep is the perfect formula to hold the audiences attention.""Right on point brother.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Worth seeing...,"FOR ME the scare factor for this was highly overrated. It's kind of creepy, but it's never really outright scary, it nowhere near plumbs the depths of terror. I would say the movies that have scared me the most are The Ring and The Orphanage. I think maybe why it isn't very scary is because it's not visually explicit/vivid so it lacks real terror - that doesn't mean every horror movie needs to have an actual monster depicted or ghastly-looking things happening, but it is why Paranormal Activity isn't anywhere near as scary as horror movies can be. This does have tension building up sometimes, but trust me, it's not exactly a visceral, super powerful, heart-pounding kind of experience like people have been saying. I would say the scariest part of it was in the last few minutes.I don't think what this movie does is that original, the personal-camera-perspective thing is a bit like movies like Cloverfield. And the dialogue is not super intelligent. But I do applaud their making a movie entirely without special effects, other than a few visual tricks, and leaving the horror entirely implicit. It's not really anything like The Blair Witch Project, I don't know why people are comparing it to that other than the minimalist/non-explicit aspect.The guy, Micah, is kind of stupid and annoying, grossly insensitive to his girlfriend at times, and therefore not realistic in that way. I don't think he should have acted as he did, and he's just not a very strong part of the movie. That's not to say he's just totally an idiot that we can't relate to. But I think the strongest part of it is actually Katie's performance towards the end, her reactions to the hauntings as they become more personally targetted and escalated; it really is how you would feel and act. I really felt for her then, I was sorry for her. To see someone in so much suffering and horror is very moving.So is it scary? Not really. But it's still worth seeing, pretty enjoyable, and a little bit different, despite the moderate weakness of the dialogue and Micah's acting/behavior.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the best found footage horror films to date.,"This is one of the best found footage horror films to date. While it isn't the movie that kicked off the genre, it is the movie that reignited the craze. Paranormal Activity provides an eerie atmosphere and it all felt very real; the main characters were incredibly relatable and I couldn't help but feel a great deal of empathy for both of them throughout the entire movie. While there is a great lack of jump scares, the atmosphere and build up of suspense more than makes up for it. I felt a sense of dread take over me as the story progressed to a point of what I can only describe as sheer hopelessness. One of my favorite things about the film is the fact that the antagonist is never seen, so your imagination can take off in a variety of directions which for me personally makes it all the more frightening. If you're into found footage horror films and have not seen this yet, you're missing out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Fun and scary, but not ""great""","I definitely enjoyed watching this film, and there were some scary moments, for sure! Worth seeing, especially for paranormal and horror buffs. That being said, this might have been a great film except for two things.First, Micah is nearly devoid of personality. He is so much Mr. Average Young Adult that he ends up being nobody at all, and it is hard to immerse oneself in a film where one of the two main characters is boring and undefined, yet irritating. The female character compensates with having a more defined and complex personality.Second, the style of the ending doesn't fit well with the rest of the movie. It feels like it was spliced in from a different film altogether. But the ending works well enough that the film is not spoiled by the abrupt shift.Following the shaky cam action on the large screen was a bit much when I sat near the front of the theater. Moving toward the back of the theater helped me to see what was going on much better. I recommend that you find a seat at least halfway up from the front if you don't want to be overwhelmed.Go and enjoy!",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
YES it is scary!,"I was ready to be disappointed. I came in expecting this to be awful like ""Blair Witch"". Well, guess what? The film works. About the only criticism I have is that yes, he does bring the camera along everywhere to an absurd degree, but when the screen goes blue (when they are sleeping) it is incredibly chilling.Not only that, but the accompanying low-range, ""rumble"" of ambient horror sound really freaks you out. The actors did a good job of appearing ""real"", especially Katie.As far as the ending goes, yes it will shock you...however, the final shot felt a bit clichéd. I would have changed it just a little to make it even scarier.Some people complain about the mundane stuff. But what they don't understand is that that is necessary to make the couple and their experience feel more real.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
You will be clutching the chair your sitting in,"I saw a special screening of this frightening film last week and I have never been so scared in my life and I watch a lot of horror/thrillers. Blair Witch Project freaked me out 10 years ago because I knew nothing about it, similar to Paranormal Activity, I knew little and it worked it's magic on me. A slow build up of a couple who think there may be a presence with them in their new house. Wow, things get worse every night. Filmed on video camera mode, there's actually comedy too, but this couple are doomed, it's just extremely scary getting there.

Booyah!  A scary movie that's actually scary.,"This is definitely a movie to be enjoyed in the comfort of your own home. Turn off all the lights, put the kids to bed, crank up the surround sound, and put yourself in the actors shoes. This movie is off the charts creepy.Yes, there are definitely several ""come on"" moments where that will require you to suspend logic in order to play along. Overall, this movie rocks.For my wife and I, this was the fourth movie in four days. I saw 'Avatar' in the theater Sunday and was completely and totally blown away. Then, we were tortured, as we slogged our way through the painful experiences of 'Extract' and 'The Goods'. These two mind-numbingly bad movies waste talent and resources worse than the Unites States Congress.Then last night, 'Paranormal Activity' put a fright in me that I hadn't experienced since I was a kid. I found myself saying a little prayer as I tried to fall asleep. And, when I strangely awoke at 4:44am for no apparent reason, falling back asleep was next to impossible.Any movie that keeps me thinking about it the next day has on some level succeeded.

what scares us all is what we can't see...,"Paranormal Activity arrives to us in the multiplexes already becoming a hit. And how easy it is: its budget was ten grand, looks like it was shot for ten percent of that, and made a profit in just the first night of its limited-run midnight screenings across the country. Now as a bonafide hit (if not yet the Blair Witch sized phenomenon, though it's on its way to be just that), it comes as something one may be a little curious about at first but not entirely sure. Does it live up to the gargantuan hype? That depends on what you've heard: some adore the movie, have been scared s***less by it, and others, frankly, laughed at the end. But what it is is an effective ghost story put to film, taking with it the same 'it's not there but is it' film-making approach that made the original Val Lewton Cat People so scary.Seeing it in a packed audience has its ups and downs. The big up is that the audience, if properly primed or the right crowd (i.e. young people), will react to it like a ride in the guise of an minimalist exercise in suspense and tension. The big down is that... you're seeing a movie with a huge obnoxious crows that can't shut up or put away the cell phones. But those who want to be attentive to the movie do get rewards. Paranormal Activity provides its audience a ""this is happening"" style movie. It's not in the same this-is-how-we-found-the-footage editing of Blair Witch or Cloverfield. It's more like a collection of clips and scenes that do add up, where Micah and Katie are living in a house and are (to put it nicely) bothered by a demonic spirit of some kind.Where it came from, why its hounded Katie for so long, why it hasn't taken her or done more damage over the years, are questions (if not entirely logical gaps) that will come to the viewer. One may even wonder, until its answered for us, why the couple just doesn't leave the house and get away from the spirit. What makes it work as a movie utmost is that it's a fresh take on familiar subject matter. We've seen stories of a possessed house, we've seen movies with possessed people, but not in a style that calls to mind Andy Warhol's film of a non-stop movie of a person sleeping on a bed for six hours straight. Paranormal Activity isn't as arty as that, but it does provide the same frame of reference: every night, it would seem, that the camera records in that same spot the tri-pod is on, things happen of a disturbing sort, from creaks in the night to lights turned on/off, to shadows, and finally slammed doors and bodies pulled out and bitten.The acting, for this kind of docu-horror movie, is pretty good if not always great or totally believable, and the set-up of the characters early in the film makes them sympathetic, simple middle-class characters. The director puts the audience in their shoes- or more-so Micah's shoes as someone who looks at this whole ghost/demon event night by night half-jokingly- and then lets it rip for what we don't see to be far more terrifying than showing anything (albeit the final shot of the movie is a true stunner, oddly enough it being Spielberg-inspired since it's a call back to Jaws by the way the audience reacted). Filling in the blanks and things-in-the-dark-what-the-hell-was-that scenes make up some of the best moments in horror movies, and first time director Oren Peli milks this style for all its worth. At its best, it's on par (or better) than Blair Witch.If nothing else, while not a perfect movie, I would hope that its chances at the box office top the upcoming fecal money-shot of Saw VI. I don't know how much either will make, but it would be nice if real horror and real scares won over torture porn with audiences again. A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

One of the most psychologically disturbing films ever....,"There has been a void left unfilled in the horror genre since 2002's The Ring. That void was filled when Paranormal Activity was released. While the trailer looked promising, I was a little skeptical because of the tremendous level of hype the movie was getting. Let me say this folks, this movie lives up to the hype and then some.The true genius of this film lies within the directing. This film epitomizes our fear of the unknown. It's the simplicity of things in life that scares us such as a dark corner, an eerie silence, or an unknown sound. Oren Peli took all these elements and brought it to the screen with fierce deliverance.Some movies are only good as the actors and the acting in this is so believable you might think for a second that the footage is real.In closing let me say that every several years a movie comes out that transcends it's genre. Paranormal Activity is definitely one of them. I hope that this is the movie that will be known to kick Hollywood in the ass. You don't need a super high budget packed with lame special effects, a weak story, and bad acting(unfortunately this has been the case for most horror movies in the last several years).Hollywood take note, this ""$11,000 film that could"" made me cringe in my seat in such a way that I have never experienced since watching ""The Exorcist"" as a child.

Very hard to believe people got scared,"First, let me say that I thought the movie was good. The script was well written, the idea was interesting, and the acting was fantastic. It's hard to find a movie that does such a good job of making the characters seem realistic, and I'm not sure I've felt a connection to the actors this well in a while. That being said, the movie was boring.Now, there were genuinely suspenseful parts, and parts where I was more than a little creeped out, but it was in a boring way. These parts were few and far between, and each one seemed very anticlimactic. I hardly ever watch scary movies because I get scared fairly easy, but watching this alone, in a dark room, at two in the morning, I barely felt spooked. To me, most of the scary events were more like ""wow, that's kind of weird"" moments instead of ""holy freaking cow I'm going to wet myself if I try to sleep tonight"" moments.Without giving anything away, the ending, I thought, was appropriate and well done. I saw the original ending and, while a little anticlimactic, I thought it fit perfectly. The theatrical ending I looked up online, and, while it was scarier, seemed like it was in a completely different movie.The verdict: Good from a cinematic point of view, but seriously failed to scare.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Ridiculously Overrated,"Katie (Katie Featherston) and her boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat) have been living together for three years and out of the blue, they are haunted by an entity while they are sleeping. Katie discloses to Micah that she has been haunted since she was eight year-old and the skeptical Micah buys a camera to videotape the paranormal activity in their home during the night. Katie calls the psychic Fredrichs (Marc Fredrichs) to help them, and he explains that he is specialist in ghosts; however he feels the presence of a fiend and advises the couple to call a friend of him and do not try to contact the demon. However, Micah borrows an Ouija board endangering their lives.After the original ""The Blair Witch Project"", many low-budget movies made with hand-held camera have been released and the only exception that really worked is the Spanish ""(REC)"". ""Paranormal Activity"" is ridiculously overrated and I cannot understand the hype around this flick. The acting is reasonable, but the screenplay is ridiculous, with Micah filming their daily routine even in the most bizarre and unusual moments. I cannot understand how a viewer can startle or fear with the awful scenes and noises, unless those that are easily influenced by the marketing of smart producers that releases a cheap crap wrapped in advertisements and fake reviews promoting the movie.

"Finally, a movie done right","Everyone kept talking about this movie for the past months. About how some people have already seen it on it's original release date or how they are going to go see it. And the talk about it was just constant. I am not a fan of scary movies, because I am easily scared (or at least I think I am). So I held off on this movie for some time. Not to mention whenever I asked what sorta movie it was they always compared it to the Blair Witch, which I thought only had one good part (the ending scene).I finally saw it though (with the alternate ending, I have no clue what the real ending is. I saw the Spielberg suggested ending). This movie was amazing. They did pretty much everything right. The scenes were perfect for escalation, the length of the movie was just right. The way it was shot was very well done and everything seemed to have it's purpose.One thing I loved about this movie is it pretty much proved to me that my scary movie theory is correct. And that is that scary moments in films make it all that less believable because it's trying to hard. But creepiness and suspense is really what gets at me and has a much lasting effect. This movie has NO SCARY PARTS. It's all just very very disturbing and creepy.As you watch the movie you'll be wondering, ""WTF, how did they shoot that?!""

"Okay, But...","First of all, I want to make a comment on the predictability of this movie. It seems like scary movies these days have slipped into a trend of what I call a formula projection. It seems like every second of the movie I could predict what was going to happen before it happened.On the scary aspect, I really wasn't scared at all during the entire movie. Don't get me wrong, there were a few times where I was shocked, but it just wasn't a screamer if you know what I mean. There is a lot that the director could have done that would have made it more scary, or mysterious/creepy. ie. if the movie camera would have been picked up and moved by the ""Demon"". But, none of that happened and it seemed like the director missed a lot of opportunities to take this movie to another level.Frankly, it's not The Exorcist, as far as scary goes.Humor was another aspect and was actually quite prevalent. There were a few times that I found myself laughing at comments made by the characters or their conversations.All in all, it was a pretty good movie. I do not recommend seeing it in theaters because I feel the theater setting degrades the scare factor of the movie. But, if you like a good shocker, this is the movie for you.

The Best Ghost Story since The Shinning,"I know that is a tall claim but I have to say that it is true. However don't take the idea that I think these two films are similar. They are in no way related except in tone and emotion.I went to see this movie last night with a good friend and both of us left the theater totally creeped. The actors were phenomenal. The director was hugely successful in creating an atmosphere of real suspense and fear. If I had been watching this movie at home, it would have been one that I turned off for a while about half way through to bring myself back to reality. Keep in mind also, I love scary movies. I watch them all the time and this one was the first in a LONG time to actually send chills down my arms and make my stomach sink from dread.Okay so why then did I give it a nine not a ten? Two reasons first: the ending while apropos and good could have been stronger. (this is really a nit-pick it was very good). Second: I should have sat farther back in the theater.

One major flaw that hurts the entire film!,"Paranormal Activity could have been more than just a very scary movie, but due to a specific major flaw, the entire film falls into being unbelievable & absurd; wasting every realistic aspect to the movie that it tried so hard to be.There are two main characters in the movie. You have the female/girlfriend character (Katie) and the male/boyfriend character (Micah); where the ghost/demon/entity is haunting the young couple. Now, the major flaw that lies in this movie is the Micah character. The personality and actions by the boyfriend is so idiotic, unrealistic, selfish and illogical. Micah is absolutely STUPID and his character literally ruins the whole movie, where I actually started to root for the demon! As I watched the beginning of this film, I was very intrigued in where the story was taking me; but as the movie progresses, the Micah character is very distracting, by all his ridiculous personality & actions. After numerous paranormal activities that Micah had already captured on his own camera, I officially lost interest to the film after the boyfriend said ""What the f**k was that!"" for the 20th time! The actress who portrays Katie did a fantastic job and had a believable performance; but due to the distractions of Micah's unrealistic behaviors, his performance even begins to hurt Katie's role by the time the film nears its conclusion.The major reason why Micah's character seems absolutely disjointed is his lack of concern for his girlfriend. In the beginning of the film, it's brought to our attention that the two are a young couple who are ""engaged to be engaged"", so we're assuming that they absolutely love each other. Maybe Micah isn't the brightest guy in the world, or maybe he was very interested in seeing ghostly activities; but nevertheless, there is no way a loving boyfriend would ever put his girlfriend through so much grief & agony for his own selfish indulgences.Other than the flaws in the boyfriend's character, the visuals in this amateur film were excellently done! All the bedroom scenes gave you chills and most importantly, you thought about those sequences after the movie ended; especially when you got home to your own bedroom. This film was creepy and I give the filmmakers absolute kudos for accomplishing that with a minimal budget.I may seem highly critical & harsh on this amateur film, but this movie had so much potential and I really wanted this film to work. ""Character Writing"" is the most important ingredient to a story, and when the audience starts to loose sympathy for the victims in peril, then there is something seriously wrong with the main characters. If only the writer/director Oren Peli decided to rewrite & restructure the boyfriend character, Paranormal Activity could have been a brilliant horror film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"It's not a movie for everyone, but it's worth it.","This is one of those films that I always heard about but never predisposed to see ... until yesterday. I already knew, and some reading to prepare this criticism confirmed this information to me, that this is one of the most profitable low-budget films ever, as it was quite cheap to make and made a huge commercial success, marking the cinema of terror, like it or not the marks left.The script is simple: it is like watching a home video, where a young couple seeks to document the paranormal phenomena that are happening in the house where they live. There are no initial credits, the final credits have been reduced to what is required by law for commercial exhibition, there is no soundtrack, the filming is done with a homemade camera and everything is reduced to the simplest. This makes the movie look authentic and the special effects added are so compelling that they work very well. The ending is a little out of place because it is more exaggerated, but at least it provides a good climax.The cast is small but capable and competent. Katie Featherston is easily the soul of the film, but Micah Sloat has a good relationship with her, although he's never been so good and his character is more annoying.

"Smile, You're on Candid Camera","Greetings again from the darkness.

Peli gives us a slightly more controlled video package from our lead players, Micah and Katie.Neither Micah nor Katie have any real acting ability, and I believe were cast because they come across as believable.

Seriously, there are some very creepy moments which I won't give away and I did enjoy the approach of the stalking demon, instead of a possessed house.As for a fright factor, I still rank The Shining and Poltergeist as far superior but these days, any horror film that doesn't involve major slashers has to be commended.

One of the most suspenseful and thrilling theatrical rides you will ever take,"I never saw The Blair Witch Project (I saw it's very rarely mentioned predecessor Cannibal Holocaust, which I try to forget), but I imagine the pandemonium and terror that filled theatres back in 1999 was nowhere near what anxiety and horror has been brought ten years later by Paranormal Activity. The faux documentary about a young couple Micah (Micah Sloat) and Katie (Katie Featherson)'s attempts at documenting nightly disturbances by a demon in their new home is every bit as frightening and scary as you have heard. It has taken me days to figure out what to write about this heavily demanded film, and I remain just as much on edge now as I was after seeing the film.For just under ninety minutes, Paranormal Activity acts as the ride you really want to take but immediately regret hopping onto. Filmed for an incredibly small amount of money, this two-year-old indie horror flick falls into the same company as District 9 in how much it accomplishes for its genre with so little. It offers an excessive amount of pulse pounding scares, and two fantastic leads that we actually care about. We only learn a small amount about either character, but the performances by these two amateur actors is more than enough to make us feel their pain and dread as they try to figure out why the demon is tormenting them night after night. This is what true horror is, and now that it is has struck gold at the box office, I can only hope horror films in pre-production take note on what this film does right.The reason the film works is right in its set-up. The film takes place entirely in and around the couple's house, and is all shot on a camcorder that Micah purchases at the very beginning of the film. Right away, director/writer/editor Oren Peli sets up the film to jump between the couple's interactions with each other and guests during the day and their sleeping during the night. The audience acts as voyeurs for the majority of the film, watching the two sleep while the unexpected takes place with little notice. It makes for a very uneasy picture, as the pair does not always wake up to scary things happening in their bedroom. They frequently only discover the same horror we have seen the next day as they examine the footage. The times they do wake up lead to some of the most terrifying sequences in recent memory.But the sequences are only terrifying because of how the audience reacts to them. I saw the film in a sold out theatre, and you could hear a pin drop during the night time scenes. Everyone was filled up with trepidation and breathlessly expecting the worst each time. And while the film is merely only freaky (and slightly boring) for the first half hour before kicking into high gear, the audience reacted the exact same way to each scene at night. The collective exhale as the day scenes began is something that simply must be marveled at. I do not think there has been a movie in recent memory that has impacted an audience so unified the same way Paranormal Activity does. It practically screams that it needs to be experienced with an audience in order to get the true effect of what Peli and crew envisioned when they made the film.Another source of wonder is the special effects. While many of the effects are practical and are pulled off with ease, some of the later effects will simply horrify you into trying to figure out how they were possible on such a small budget. They are so simply and effectively done that they make Michael Bay's bloated effect-filled epics like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen pale in comparison. They are just so tastefully done and used so well that you have no choice but to try and figure out how they were pulled off with so little an amount of money. They look far too real to be fake.While I really enjoyed the ride Paranormal Activity provides, I cannot help but be disappointed at the fact that the film will never provide the same experience more than once. It was clearly not made for repeat viewing, and it hurts the film as a whole in the end. The scares and effect of the film was not made to be seen in the same way as a Saw film or a Friday the 13th film would be. Sure, there may be some new things to discover that you did not see before, but the film is ruined ultimately by only being effective enough to scare once. I imagine a lot of people will think one viewing is enough, but for someone who watches movies more than once, it will no doubt sadden you. If I did see the film again, I imagine I would be watching simply to see the reactions of the audience, not feel as immersed into the film as I was during the first viewing.The triumph of Paranormal Activity is in the fact that it was made for so little, but has the ability to terrify so many. It works on so many levels that its few faults are more than easily redeemed. The film is short enough to not overstay its welcome, and scary enough to make even the most hardened film-goer wince in fear. It's the most suspenseful trip to the movies I have ever taken. And if not anything else, it speaks to a young generation of future filmmakers the same way District 9 did. If you have an idea for a story, the equipment to pull it off, and a little bit of time and money to invest into it, then there is no stopping what you can create.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Nightmares guaranteed.,"With an estimated budget of somewhere between $11,000 and $15,000, Paramount's expertly marketed ""Paranormal Activity"" manages to be one of the scariest films of all-time. Shot with the ""shaky camera"" technique (which has been used in other horror films such as ""Blair Witch Project"", ""Quarantine"", and ""Cloverfield""), Paranormal Activity evokes pure terror with an authentic, yet old-school ""this-is-really-happening"" vibe that leaves all of the rotten clichés of most horrors films of late at the door. The film immediately starts with a disclaimer from Paramount, undoubtedly a trick to suck us right into thinking this is really real. Then we are introduced to our happy couple, Micah and Katie (who's names are the same as the actors who portrayed them, same as ""Blair Witch Project"", yet another trick to authenticate the viewer's nightmarish experience). Micah has just bought an expensive camera to document the strange, paranormal activity that has been going on in their house, which has apparently been drawn to Katie all her life. We are immediately drawn-in and like these characters, who feel so real. Micah makes some funny, light-hearted jokes about the paranormal activity, which makes us laugh (even if they are nervous laughs, for we know what is about to come, unlike him). What Micah and Katie don't know, is that the camera is not only going to document paranormal activity, but demonic and satanic activity that leads the couple to paranoia and especially traumatic fear. And we as the viewer are along for the ride! The acting, script, and direction, were all just fine. Nothing to point out as good or bad, except for the overall realistic dialogue was good. Where the film shines truly shines, is what we all go to this movie to see, is the paranormal activity. The night scenes, in which Micah and Katie set up the camera to watch the room as they sleep, are so terrifying and shocking, it's hard to believe that a low-budget, 7-day shot film, can make the audience jump, scream, and even cry. The film does have some flaws. Although it is paced much better than I thought it would, there are a few scenes that are fairly tedious. The sub-plot about the woman, Diane, was unnecessary and contrived. Although the film was apparently shot out of sequence, I felt the acting and the script fell off a little towards the end. ""Paranormal Activity"" generally has no theme or point to it, except to scare the living crap out of the audience (which it does). I've been looking for a horror film for quite some time to come around and scare the living daylights out of me. Although I was one of the least scared members of the audience, it was what I was looking for, and I was as scared as I am ever going to get by a horror film. ""Paranormal Activity"" is a brilliant and admirable low-budget masterpiece that succeeds in it's obvious goal to ensue sheer chills and thrills and to be the scariest and most groundbreaking horror films of all-time. You've seen the ""shaky camera"" technique before, but you haven't seen anything like this! Don't see it alone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Fresh Breeze In the Horror Genre,"Psycho brought fear into taking a shower. Jaws made you scared go into the water. Blair Witch made you scared to go into the forest. Hell, even Grudge made many fear the attic. But Paranormal Activity brings fear to the one thing you cannot avoid, the feeling safety in your own home. Although while many give this the stamp of ""scariest movie of all time"" I did not find this scary although I did find it as an entirely creepy movie that sent chills down my spine.It starts off slow but don't let that fool you because it builds up to a spine tingling ending. This movie contains many recycled scenes but they give it a fresh and unique feel to them. This movie does not rely on cheap scares and random build up of music. I think I speak for everyone when I say Oren Peli....we want more!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Micah is a day trader.,"This is a great example of found footage done right. Super simple story and a slow crescendo leading to a big bang ending. If you get easily distracted, you might struggle with this one. If you want to be scared, this one will pull you in.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Impressive given the low budget,"So back when this movie was trending I watched it with a friend and we laughed our butts off, that is until my friend received a phone call and had to leave.. Not so funny to watch alone in the dark. I watched it again yesterday to see if it still had to same effect on me. It didn't. The scares were all worn out and the acting was plain pathetic. But regardless of my subjective point of view I am impressed by what this movie accomplished with it's extremely limited budget. People actually ran out of the movie theaters in fear and it was actually banned in certain countries. The point of any horror movie is to scare the audience, and this movie succeeded to say the least. It didn't age particularly well but for it's time it was somewhat original, despite taking a little too much inspiration from The Blair Witch Project.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Better than your average horror film,"Honestly, Paranormal Activity is funnier than it is frightening, which works well to relieve tension, and to keep the film interesting during the scenes that aren't meant to scare the audience. The scares it does deliver, however, are mostly genuine; you aren't going to be forced to leap from your seat because of some cheap jump cut spliced together with a loud noise. The parts meant to disturb you are due to the film's images, not its editing techniques.But all in all, it's not really going to be that frightening unless you're one of those people who goes into the theater knowing that you're going to be terrified for the rest of the night. Those of you who dare the film to scare you will grunt and shrug: ""That wasn't scary, bro. I'm from Detroit."" You know who you are.You're not going to scream and pee your pants, but Paranormal Activity is still worth your time. It's engaging and suspenseful and definitely worth sticking around for the big finish at the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Paranormal Activity is in the ratings...,"Ten years ago, two guys, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, put together a scary little film on a peanut-shell budget and utilized the still-fledgling Internet to create a seemingly ""paranormal"" phenomenon which became known as The Blair Witch Project. The film was shot from a first person perspective of an amateur film crew out to investigate ""paranormal activity"" stemming from a spooky little backwoods legend. The effects were simple, yet spine-chillingly effective and many folks began re-thinking the whole camping idea. It was an amazingly original idea and to this day, I still consider the film and its marketing campaign a work of genius. It was something new and without a doubt, prompted the whole ""reality"" scene we are all too familiar with today.Now, fast forward to present day and we have been shelled with a film which attempts to capitalize on all the elements that made Blair effective. This time, however, the gimmicks are a mere hodgepodge of unoriginality from its shallow introduction of the protagonists to the dragging around on the floor REC (Quarantine) style, to the open-ended questions that are meant to linger in our minds when the final credits role. To boot, there is this very suspicious marketing campaign that borders on the edge of unethical where screenings and online reviews more than likely have been staged by greedy film execs to hype up that which just isn't worthy of the hype. Let's see we have shadows, doors opening and closing, chandeliers swinging, sinister voices, and a whole lota' screams from the female lead. We even have a Ouija board. I am not kidding. They are pulling all the stops on all the haunted house gags this time. I found myself wondering when Abbott and Costello were going to run through the room chased by a dangling skeleton. The most fun you might have watching this little venture is if you bring along a pad and pen and jot down which film each of the overplayed ""scares"" are stolen from. Then, however, you still are forced to endure the most boring of sequences to make it to the next evening all the while dismissing all logic to believe a couple would even remain in this haunted house.Frankly, I am very disappointed. I had hoped for a fun and scary ride with Paranormal Activity but it turned out to be nothing more than pretentious in an annoying sort of way. What is most ""disturbing"" is this clatter and clang of borderline heresy I keep hearing that suggests Paranormal Activity gauges up there with films such as The Exorcist. If you can look me in the eye and keep a straight face while trying to convince me that such fear can be derived here, I will most certainly wince with a disgusted perplexity and reply, ""Surely you jest...""",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The beast unveiled.,"It's almost always a pleasant experience when I sit down at a screening, and know absolutely nothing about the movie I'm about to watch. So, walking into the screening of Paranormal Activity was a total treat, seeing that I had absolutely zero knowledge about the movie. As the movie began I was a little disappointed thinking I was watching Quarantine, or the early parts of Cloverfield. For some reason every hand-held, no budget, cheap thrills movie has to spend loads and loads of time developing the characters and establishing the fact that you're going to be on a very ""bumpy"" ride for the duration. We meet Micah and Katie in the first shot of movie, as Micah explains why he bought the camera, for the purpose of catching something ""paranormal"" on it. Katie has been seeing and feeling something out of ordinary since she was a little girl, and it seems to have followed her to their new house. Micah spends most of the homemade movie ridiculing her notions of being ""haunted"", and just laughs off most of her claims until something is caught on his camera overnight. I'm sure the producers would like a critics to keep the plot and surprises in this film to a minimum, so I will be short with the plot. Basically, a lot of nothing happens right up until the last 5 minutes of the movie. This is a good exercise in storytelling, proving that we must about the protagonists, before we can start to care about them. The cheap tricks and thrills that we get at the end (startling the entire movie theater as they shrieked and screamed) would have had completely different effects on everyone had the movie been way shorter. That was the only criticism I could give this movie, its length. Many impatient viewers will become tired of the daily, diary like style Paranormal Activity plays in, but the juice is certainly worth the squeeze in this case.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Yeah it was made with basically a shoestring budget but that still doesn't make a great horror movie,"My friend really liked this movie but I just can't understand how anyone can find this movie to be a great horror flick. My friends constant remark was that this movie was made with basically a shoe string budget and that is goes in a direction that it's somewhat believable. Yeah this movie is made with basically a shoestring budget but I didn't find the premise believable at all and seemed like it was trying a bit too hard to make it seem like it's all real. With constant dry interactions with characters that will bore you to tears. And seriously where does the creepy music come from in the movie anyways if this movie is suppose to go in a realistic direction. Like everything in this movie actually happened. In a way this movie is worse than the ""The Blair Witch Project"". Now I know this movie at least has something going on but I found how the characters try to investigate what is going on when crazy stuff happens in the house to be funny and ridiculous. It would have been more entertaining to be with a couple of friends and talk about ghosts and supernatural stuff than to watch this movie. Because that is basically all they do in this movie, constantly going on and on talking about supernatural stuff and weird noises going on later on. So yeah just talk about ghost stories for a while yourself and couple of other people and than go hide and smack pots and pans and that sums up this movie. The movie isn't even original this premise with the videotaping of what is going on while the characters knowing they are being videotaped has been done before. The trailer to this movie is unbelievable at how it tries to sell itself as being the scariest movie ever made. Cause it's not, actually it's far from it, in fact it's more boring than actually scary. The movie even lacks tension and it's composed of mainly two boring than real life characters. It's just sad to see how this movie became notorious and actually a hit in theaters when it came out. I am just glad I didn't see this in theater and just saw it with a couple of friends on a television screen. I give this movie a 3.6 cause there is at least something to talk about or even laugh a bit while watching this with other people on TV although the movie itself is bland, dry and not scary. I heard even the audiences that did see this in theater was rolling there eyes after cause they felt cheated. It would have been somewhat watchable if the characters weren't so bland and was actually relatable and if the direction wasn't so predictable.3.9/10",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Believe the hype - This is the real deal,"When it comes to modern horror, we hear crazy claims like ""The best horror film since The Exorcist"" with basically every new release. We've had a particular recent release be considered ""better than Halloween"" and, while it was good, nothing compares to John Carpenter's masterpiece.But, I have to say. . . Oren Peli's Paranormal Activity is the first that actually does deserve its praise.I drove 70 miles up to LA to see this and, without a doubt, I would've driven more if necessary. I will not lie. I do not scare easily, but this one had me going. The tension was palpable throughout the rather slow beginning. At first, it seemed as if the film simply wasn't going anywhere and the same tricks would be used over & over again. But no. The crew knew exactly what they were doing. They knew how to play with our minds and deliver truly superb suspense. For about half or two-thirds of the film, I felt mainly just creeped out, on edge, etc. But, once it's cranked up, it really gets going and does not stop. There is one scene in particular, and those who have seen it will know, that is truly one of the scariest ever. I am a man, but I will admit. . . I did get a bit teary eyed in fear watching this particular scene. And there was another that, quite literally, made me duck in my seat.So, all I have to say. . . well done. For once, fan approval and desire is really getting to the studio and they're doing the right thing to release this phenomenal little film. It was truly one of the best haunted house movies I've ever seen.

"Boring, pointless, and *not scary.*","This movie is good if and only if you are terrified by the following things:Watching people sleep. Listening to couples argue. Seeing a door open and/or close. Modern suburban architecture. Talcum powder. Shaky camera movements, and Coma-inducing dialogue.Allow me to preface this by saying that I love paranormal/scary movies such as The Ring, The Grudge, Insidious, The Conjuring, etc. I had heard that Paranormal Activity was chilling, suspenseful, and filled with the kind of jumpy delights that only a good horror movie can offer. Well, I was egregiously misled. This movie is truly snooze-inducing, and by that I mean that I literally fell asleep. This movie is painfully slow, has no plot development whatsoever, and there is nothing even remotely scary within the entire film. The film's lack of scares could perhaps have been forgiven if the movie was actually entertaining, but it is NOT.

"One Of The Worst Horror Movies Ever, Or So I Thought.","Theater Review: Can someone yell conspiracy? I've read so many reviews on here and other sites that praise this film for being ""the most scary film ever!"" In my opinion and many others, this is just not true. The almost 8 star rating on here is very suspect, one can almost assume many of the good ratings and reviews could be linked back to the filmmaker or to people who haven't seen the movie, or to people who have no idea what a scary film is. The current 7.9 rating, which for any horror film that has over 1,000 ratings would be remarkable, is fraudulent in my opinion. I understand people's taste in films differs, but the horror genre fans tend to mostly agree with each other when a great horror film presents itself to us, and this is simply NOT a great horror film, nor is it even near great. I cannot prove fraud here, but I can sure smell it. I remember how disappointed I was with Blair Witch, the film had some scary parts, but for all the hype it got, just like Paranormal Activity has received, it was a true fail at horror. The majority of the episodes on the Discovery TV show ""A Haunting"" is scary than this film.Conclusion: This film is over-hyped, over-rated and not a bit scary. I only gave it a 2 for the filmmakers attempt at showing the big studios the small guy can make a better horror film with only a fraction of the budget, the attempt failed miserably.Home review/New Conclusion: My above review that came with an original rating of 2 was based on my experience of seeing this movie in a packed, uncomfortable and ridiculously loud theater after more than a few drinks, and of course we had the occasional warning before a scary scene from some dummy who had seen the film the night before. One of the worst theater experiences ever. The very next night I was lucky enough, although, one day too late, to possess a legal high-quality DVD screener of this film. I watched this film sober in my home, in the dark, alone. The first 20 minutes of course are a snooze-fest but I forced myself to get into it and by the 30 minute mark I was enjoying it without effort and appreciating the long first 20 minutes a little more. The pace of the movie is perfect, more and more activity progresses with each night and the video evidence gets stronger and much more frightening. There is a scene where the entity makes itself very known mid-way on that made me almost jump out of my seat even though I had just seen this the night before. I do have a problem with one of the scenes that's not the couple, but something they're watching, it's so unrealistic it almost ruins the pace and feel of the movie for me. Soon after though the movie picks right back up and begins to become absolutely frightening, the point where the entity becomes physically present is one of the scariest parts in the entire movie. This did have the Blair Witch feel no doubt, the choices the couple makes gave me that frustrating feeling I had when the girl and two guys in Blair Witch turned into idiots and just yelled, cried and lallygagged their way around the forest they were trying to get out of, but under the circumstances of the categorization of this entity, I understand their actions but disagree with how the director interprets what a normal couple would do in that same situation. The ending is not something I could of predicted even though it lays itself out well before the film is over. HERE'S THE DEAL! If you love being goofy scared and having that packed theater feel then go see it, but if you truly want to be scared and enjoy this film to it's fullest potential, DO NOT watch this in the theater, watch the DVD at home, in the dark, alone. I will never watch another horror film in a theater again! I apologize to all for my original review and rating, the horrible theater experience along with my alcohol buzz totally ruined this film. I may just give up on theaters all together. I upped my rating from a 2 to a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I wouldn't want to watch it again,"I cannot say I was blown away by the film but it is nothing like as bad as some suggest. I can see why it had such success because the premise is original and the drama so well set up. The constant single picture of the nighttime bedroom begins to pall but the naturalistic banter between the two and the gradual unfolding of the back story and the beginnings of 'activity' are well done. Most of the film is as if through the couple's camera whether resting on its tripod, lying on the side of the bed or jerkily hand held. Things do happen and at least a couple of moments are genuinely scary. Use of sound, I understand Spielberg tinkered with the print for the theatrical release, is effective and combined with sudden movements are all it really takes for this to work.

They look as though they were done by a student in 5 minutes.This is a better movie than wrong turn 3 but its not as much fun.Wrong turn 3 knows its rubbish and doesn't expect to be taken seriously..Paranormal Activity thinks its a gripping drama.The movie seemed to divide the Frightfest audience.. liked it, some hated it.

When Dorks Confront the Unknown,"Carrying on with the documentary-style of Horror like ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""Paranormal Activity"" continues the tradition, warts and all. A geeky couple film the supernatural occurrences in their house. The obnoxious boyfriend films his harassed, haunted and somewhat sexy girlfriend as they cope in various ways with dealing with the malignancy that slowly engulfs them. Shadows, moving and slamming doors, lights turning on their own, footsteps heard and eventual manifestations that would accelerate and get worse with time bring on the chills and unsettling effects. Slow going (and this sure could crawl) and far too long, the film tries to get you scared with its attempts at realism but there are far too many dead spaces in between the too few frights. This would have been better and would have packed more punch as a short. A fine entry in the Horror field and a surprise hit, this isn't a bad way to pass an hour and a half.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not as good as it's made out to be but fresh and totally original,"OK. A lot has been said about how terrifying this movie is. In truth it is a little slow and does have a number of really scary bits. But it is blown out of proportion. I would tell you more but don't want to spoil it. I took my daughters Amy (18) and Ria (15) and they were both pretty freaked out and hanging onto me for dear life but it's not half as scary as Drag Me to Hell.The lack of ANY credits whatsoever is brilliant though.

By far the scariest movie I have ever seen,"Of those in doubt about the hype, believe it. I just saw this movie with a few friends and I am still sore from shaking so much. Every time the film would fade in on the shot of the bedroom from the camera we would grab hands and our hearts would begin to pump.The film is incredibly simple, but incredibly realistic. The characters seem very real and everything that happens seems frighteningly real, mainly because of the less is more technique. By the end of the film, such a simple thing as a light turning on or footsteps will make you want to scream. Me and my friends would start freaking out every time we heard a noise.The director brilliantly brings you into an unbearable tension that does not let up until the film ends. And, at the beginning, you may be wondering when it will get scary. I know I did. But take my word for it, this film gets to the point of being too much to bear.In a nutshell, 'Paranormal Activity' was an amazing horror film that brings a breath of very fresh air to the dying genre.

Great *One* Trick Horror Movie!,"PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is a pretty decent horror flick based on a deceptively simple idea.Like ""The Blair Witch Project,"" PA is basically an ""amateur"" film that has been discovered after some horrific events befall a young couple. As the audience, we don't yet know what that is but the video tells us that the guy is a tech-gadget junkie and he decides to make home movies to document his live-in girlfriend's story about being visited by ""something"" ever since childhood, which she feels is still making regular visits (and we're not talking about her monthly visitor either, lol).There's a slow build up of minor events happening, as they continue to grow in scope and weirdness, to the shocking ending. It had me and others jumping at certain points and so it definitely had its moments.The film is a lot like those cable reality shows where people go into reputed haunted houses and other places, flick on the night-vision camera, and end up scaring themselves half-silly.But the main difference between those shows (and even ""The Blair Witch Project"" movie) and PA is that ""PARANORMAL ACTIVITY"" actually shows you the strange and spooky stuff that's going on and it's not just the people suggesting it or showing dust specks and claiming that that's a spirit. You will see what's going on and it's pretty odd and frightening.Creating an amateur-ish like quality, most of the film is shot in a locked-off camera point-of-view, although there is a little shaking and swinging in the beginning and peppered throughout--not too much or long enough to cause motion sickness--only adds to the movie's mystique. Some shots are shot with the character's head only in partial view which lends to the idea that this is just a candidly shot home movie.Anyway, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is a fun and frightful film that's great to see with a packed audience and perfect for this Halloween season.Unfortunately for the filmmakers this can't be repeated (like ""Blair Witch""), because everyone will be jaded to this clever filming and marketing technique.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I really wish i did not see this film!!!,"This is the scariest film i have ever seen in my entire life!!! To be honest I don't watch horrors often, I'm much more into films that make me smile and don't make me scared to walk into a dark house!! The whole audience in the cinema reacted to the film throughout, both men and women were screaming and jumping out of their seats!! Everyone looked slightly worried leaving the cinema.Its simplicity is what made it so terrifying. Rather than watching torture porn like Hostal or the Saws, this film lets ones imagination run wild!!!The reason behind me not giving it a rating is because it really is a fantastic film just not for someone like me, so I can't really give a proper answer.I would recommend this to absolutely anyone who love to be scared out of their whits, but if you are more like me (a complete and total wuss) then I would stick to New Moon :)",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"While not quite living up to the hype, it's reassuring to see a film like this in the theatre anyways.","Just saw this film tonight and had reasonably high expectations. Mostly they were met.We meet a middle class, happy, seemingly normal West Coast couple at the beginning of the film - Katie and Micah. They live in a very nice house in San Diego and all seems well save for the fact that Micah has just spent a whole bunch of money on video and computer equipment so he can conduct surveillance on the house, particularly while they are sleeping.... As the story unfolds, we learn that Katie has a rather sinister past and appears to have been, and still is, the target of some kind of sinister spirit or presence. A visit from a psychic sheds some light on the situation - he agrees that there is a presence in the house and explains the difference between demons and spirits. He recommends the couple speak to a Demonoligist but Micah is against this. As the nights go by the presence becomes more and more bold in it's actions and some of the scenes, even now in retrospect, are making my hair stand on end.The good stuff - the acting and actions of the characters are very believable. At the beginning of the film Katie is a happy-go-lucky student and by the end she has very nearly lost her mind. Micah goes from being cocky and (thinking he's) in control of the situation to being inwardly scared but not showing it, and then completely frustrated and ultimately powerless to do anything to help protect the girl he loves. The house goes from being a warm, homely dwelling to something very much like a prison - claustrophobic and cold. The special FX are used sparingly but are very effective in the scenes that they do feature in. The sounds effects are also quite cool.The bad - a little more background on Katie would have been nice and added another dimension to the proceedings. Also, the reaction of the psychic when he visits a second time was somehow not played as well as it could have been. Minor complaints.See it if you like to be scared and enjoy getting the adrenaline flowing.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
All About Paranormal Activity?,"Paranormal Activity, as many of you know, is solely about a spirit/ghost that is haunting the life of the main character Katie. The plot revolves around Katie and her boyfriend attempting to capture footage of the ""spirit"" inside their house in an attempt to finally solve the mystery that has been surrounding Katie for as long as she can remember.After finally getting the time to watch this movie, i can say without a doubt that this movie was a bit over-hyped and i believe that due to that fact, the audience now believes that this one of the scariest movies ever created.With that being said, the movie did take an interesting idea and did a ""decent"" job with what they had to work with. There is a factor that this movie deals with and it is one that i myself have seen occur with many other movies. This movie suffers from something i would prefer to call ""theaterism""(if that was a word). That meaning that this movie falls under the category of being a bit more nerve-racking/terrifying if being viewed in a theater rather than being viewed inside your home in front of a television set. I can instantly see how a good portion of the audience would be terrified of this film while watching it in theaters, along with the surround sound and big screen. But beyond that point, it would be careless if one was to give this film higher than a seven or eight.This movie, in my point of view, was actually funnier than it was scary. I myself have been a fan of so-called ""horror"" movies and quite frankly, i do not feel that this movie falls under the category of horror. I can say that if you are a fan of movies that have loud noises and make ludicrous attempts at scare tactics, this is the movie for you. However, to say that this is the best horror film of 2009 would be even more ludicrous.The film had an interesting idea, had some fine points and some not-so-fine points to it. In the end, the film fell flat and it can be said that a good portion of the audience would have probably expected more after watching the first hour or so.6/10 STARS",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

First horror film that has actually effected me....,I have to say that i really enjoyed watching Paranormal Activity. It started off slow to begin with. But once it got going i loved it. Its about a couple called Katie & Micah who decide that they want to record their nights sleep while they are sleeping. Soon after they begin to hear strange noises that they believe to be something evil. I loved the way in which the film was shot by using a hand held camera. I did not find this to be too much of a problem though which was good. Most of the film is also done on a tripod too whist both of them are sleeping. I really wish that i had the chance to have seen it in the cinema on a big screen it is a very creepy and haunting film. I was able to feel myself holding my breath when they went to sleep each time.

Whats all the hype?,"I must admit that I bought into the hype!

I will however give credit where credit is due.The person responsible for promoting this film is a genius.The fact that only 15k was invested into a film (most of which probably went to the video camera) which has already grossed over 22 million speaks for itself.Congrats to those responsible for making this film, you not only stole the cash needed to purchase my ticket from me but also two hours of my life.This has been the only film that I have ever commented on through the web and I just hope that I can save someone the agony that I endured.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Haunting Silence,I give Paranormal Activity 8/10 because its the totally different experience of HAUNTING and Fear and top of that natural acting. What i like the most is the simple scenes which can shake you down to deepest core of imagination as if you put yourself in the actors shoes and experience the mental situations. The most scariest scenes in the movie are without any noise and disturbing images they are just silent moments which are more scarier than with scenes from other films with noise and CGI. It force you to think and think for it and you will become very anxious about what will happen next... For those who didn't like this movie i suggest them WATCH it ALONE...AGAIN,8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A refreshing horror movie that deserved its success:,"I would have given Paranormal Activity a slightly higher score, but for two reasons:1. I didn't get to watch it in the conditions that are best for a horror movie.and...2. The movie was spoiled for me long before I got to see it. Very lame.Despite those two things, I ended up liking Paranormal Activity a bunch. The idea and execution were very well done, and going with two unknown actors really added to the realism of the project. If any of the events Katie and Micah experienced ever happened to me in real life, I'd be terrified, and I thought they did a pretty convincing job of appearing as confused and freaked out as I would have been.This kind of horror won't work for everyone, as it relies a lot on tension and a sense of immersion.  If you can't put yourself in the place of the two main characters, then Paranormal Activity won't do much for you. But if you're brave enough to watch it at night and alone, there's a good chance that your imagination will make the rest of the night...interesting, for you.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Genuine Scare.,"It takes a true film to scare me witless these days, but somehow this was a film that succeeded. Paranormal Activity centers on a young couple, Katie and Micah, who are haunted by a supernatural presence in their home, and that's pretty much it for a storyline as it focuses on the in's and out's of the couple dealing with it. It's fair to say it takes a while to kick in...the first hour deals with Katie mainly complaining during the day but by night things take a different twist, even the most obvious cliché (door slamming shut) is used in a subtle way that you don't see it coming. Without revealing too much, by the last half hour, you will be truly petrified. Superb acting performances come from Katie and no doubt you'll be finding yourself wincing when the scene switches to night mode. As stated before, it takes A lot to scare me but by the time the credits rolled i actually screamed (the whole cinema in fact). The weakness however is simply that it takes too long for the action to kick in, the best parts of the film come from the last half hour so it makes you wonder if it was worth paying £7 for a film that only scared you for a half hour or so, but if you do have the patience believe me it's worth it. To finish, it was by FAR overrated, but if you do like a good scare, i'd definitely recommend but maybe just a rental.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A lesson in doing the most with the least, especially with fear","I don't necessarily understand the phenomenon that ""Paranormal Activity"" became in the Fall of 2009, especially considering the success of ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Cloverfield"" bringing exposure to the documentary-style and low budget horror/thriller. Yet people demanded this film be shown in their cities and towns and this $15,000 movie grossed more than $100 million. We might never fully understand why, but my hunch is it's partially because filmmaker Oren Peli is able to effectively do what bigger-budget horror filmmakers can with just a fraction of the resources.""Paranormal Activity"" is not all it's cracked up to be, but it's proof again that money is not what makes a good horror movie. You can sink cash into science fiction and action films and that can make them better, but fear is like humor -- it's a part of our brain function, it has no price tag. The pleasure some people get from a scary movie comes with skilled direction; money only dresses it up and allows a filmmaker to execute fear tactics in a different physical context.The film follows a young couple that has just moved into a new home. The girl, Katie, has had experiences with some supernatural presence much of her life and it has followed them into her new home. Her boyfriend Micah has bought a camera to see if he can get down to the bottom of it and his footage is what we see. Everything takes place in their home (the home of Peli, in fact) and the paranormal events escalate as well as their relationship tension throughout the film.This premise and screenplay is just head-strong writing. First off, its premise fits its budget. ""Found footage"" film-making is cheap and provides an artistic excuse to make a film that way while also appearing very real. If at any moment in the film you buy into Peli's attempt to make it realistic, then you'll be at least somewhat scared or fascinated with the events.As far as being scary, Peli's tactics are simple but executed perfectly. Everything is foot-in- the-door -- worked in one scene at a time. A great horror filmmaker knows his audience's expectations and turns them into his or her greatest tool. We learn early that this ""demon"" comes mostly at night and so Micah sets up his camera to record them in bed sleeping, the same shot from the same angle countless times throughout the film, the same sound effect cues to trigger our response that something is going to happen. At first just the door moves, or Katie sleepwalks, but it gets a little more intense each time and spooks you just enough before you ever realize what you've bought into is kind of ridiculous. It's relentless in its ways and yet something you were rolling your eyes at five minutes ago now has your complete attention. Sometimes you're like Micah, just itching for something to happen already and ""Activity"" insists on just creeping forward to the climax. It's a plot ramp, not an arch.In this way we're tricked into thinking ""Activity"" is a good movie. In reality, though the relationship between Micah and Katie is believable, the way they handle this situation is kind of weird. First of all, I don't know how anyone could sleep let alone 21 nights in a row knowing something was haunting them. There are many times where Katie addresses the camera and you feel that the script is really stretching to make excuses for why its on at pivotal points. And as realistic as the movie feels, there's never a scene beyond the half-hour mark that feels strikingly truthful. It also takes us that long to get our first piece of subtext, that Micah's a bit upset Katie never told him about her haunting experiences before they moved in.Yet for its many flaws there's a brilliance to the fear in us that ""Paranormal Activity"" preys on. First of all there's the ageless notion of scary things happening at night when we sleep, then there's that blurry line that we all experience in our lives like did the door just move or did the wind blow it shut? How did that end up on the floor. Peli works in these daily oddities and slowly shifts them over to completely abnormal events. It's taking fear where we find it in our everyday lives and exaggerating. That's the effectiveness of ""Paranormal Activity.""~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Why this film is so big,"I wanted to mention why I think this film has been so profitable - and it's not because of the movie itself, which I didn't find to be that great or that scary. It's because of the marketing.The extremely limited pre-Halloween release combined with the TV ads and internet trailers showing people watching the film and apparently having a jump-out-of-their seat fright-after-fright sort of time, created a demand that will probably go unchallenged in the future as moviegoers are unlikely to fall for the tactic a second time. But it was sheer brilliance to play on that human desire to want what we can't have, and their PR team deserves a few medals.So that's why I saw it in spite of bad reviews. I wanted to judge for myself and at first I COULD NOT because it wasn't playing nearby, and so I spent a few weeks anxiously checking new releases hoping it would arrive in my area. Like many others - I got played.Regarding reports of people running from the theater - they had motion sickness and were about to throw up. I initially thought reports of vomiting in the theater were from fear, because it's ""that intense"" but seriously people, it made me very queasy and I have never experienced motion sickness in a movie before. And yes, I saw Quarantine, Blair Witch, and Cloverfield. No sickness at all.In a nutshell - brilliant marketing and the ability to make people puke doesn't make a movie great.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Creepy and believable but over-hyped horror.,"With a cast of only five amateurs and a budget of a mere $15,000, director Oren Peli deserves tremendous praise for even managing to form a feature length movie never mind take the world by storm.Peli's 'Paranormal Activity' is being dubbed in the same bracket as great horror classics such as 'The Exorcist' and 'Poltergeist' and that for the director and anyone involved is an achievement in itself. Perhaps though, some critics are a little too easily frightened as the things they described 'Paranormal Activity' as were completely over-the- top.I vaguely remember feeling a chill or two, missing a heart beat and perhaps biting my upper lip however I was massively disappointed that my expectations were wide of the mark. Certainly was this not 'The Scariest Movie of all Time', far from it, the amount of scares were few and far between and some of them didn't have as great an effect on the viewer as others.With a mockumentary plot revolving around Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat starring as themselves, the combination of CCTV footage and hand-held camera footage gave a detailed account of the paranormal events which occur in the young couples' home.In fairness, the acting is outstanding considering the lack of experience in the ranks; the final third of the film is also rather disturbing. Unfortunately, the premise is a little clichéd and not very interesting since it's not actually 'real footage' so 'Paranormal Activity' is over reliant on the fear it injects into us. That fear doesn't begin to arrive for some time and when it does, it's not as shocking as you may interpret beforehand.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
.....what is this demon...?,"Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat) film and record the night-time activity in the house that they share. They are not alone......The film is a bit slow to get going. It comes alive after the visit of the Psychic (Mark Fredrichs). The cast are all good but there are the usual stupid moments that crop up in the storyline of nearly every scary film, ie, a refusal to switch on the lights when exploring something spooky in the night, and the compulsive urge to split up when strange noises are heard. The film is also full of ideas that have been ripped off from other films such as ""The Entity"" and ""Blair Witch Project"".Whilst the film is alright as entertainment, it fails to explain what the demon is and there doesn't seem to be a coherent story. I also didn't like the ending. It seems to have been added on to get a shock factor into the story. The story is actually a million miles away from true poltergeist behaviour. The writers invented a demon for the story which is undefinable and so can't be compared to anything. It doesn't exist.

Don't Watch It Alone.....Seriously,Alright so I just got done watching Paranormal Activity and I gotta tell you it scared the hell out of me. Oren Peli this out of the blue director creates a mockumentary based on the fiction events that took place in the home of Katie Featherson and Micah Sloat. He does a terrific job and it somehow gets into the hands of Steven Spielberg. Spielberg works his magic and in a couple of years boom! its on the big screen.Micah Sloat and Katie Featherson are a happy couple living in a modern suburban home. As days pass they become disturbed by an unknown presence. They put a video camera in their bedroom to see what happens when they sleep. And the rest is too disturbing to describe.To think that this movie was shot in a couple of weeks is amazing and how great it looks for a low budget movie. This movie continues the generation of mockumentary movies such as The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfeld. It leaves you on the edge of your seat and even though you might not want to watch it you have to because you want to see what happens. The ending is disturbing and riveting just as you would expect it to be and a little scarier. Another thing is that it is way More terrifying in theaters because all the lights are off the screen is huge and the volume is blasting. Unlike in your home where every light is turned on and your hugging a teddy bear as tight as you can. If you want a challenge try seeing this movie alone with all the lights off the volume at 100 and the TV 2 feet from your face. Seriously if you haven't seen this movie what are you doing here reading my review go out there and watch it because I don't say this to lightly IT IS ONE OF THE SCARIEST MOVIES I'VE SEEN.

More Hype Than Not,"I just saw this tonight and I'm positive I won't have any trouble sleeping. I find it hard to believe that there was so many people positively terrified after seeing this movie. It wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't scary. There was a certain amount of suspense, I suppose, but I kept watching in hopes that something really frightening would happen. I think the actor and actress who played Micha and Katie were excellent. The characters were well developed. At a certain point, Micha was aggravating the hell out of me. I understood his motives for certain behaviors, but still, there were times I just wanted to smack him. The ending was interesting and not really expected. I just didn't think it was scary. This movie comes off more of a psychological thriller than a horror movie. Too be honest, I can't even remember the last horror movie that really frightened me. Anyway, I don't think I'd recommend the the price of a movie ticket to see this, but it's worth a look when it comes on cable. Maybe it's worth a rental fee.

It has a few creepy moments, helped by some weird noises and the occasional loud bang, but like so many other documentary style horrors, the novelty of the hand-held format soon wears off, and the formula rapidly becomes tiresome: the spooky activity is mild at first, but predictably escalates as the film progresses; it's just a matter of time before the ectoplasm really hits the fan; and it's almost a cert that the film will end abruptly with one last shock and the camera falling to the floor/being dropped/smashed etc. (which it does, depending on which ending you see).Thankfully, unlike the Blair Witch Project, the characters are at least likable enough for us to care about them, which helps the tension a touch, and director Oren Peli does manage one or two good scenes amidst the more routine bumps in the night—the discovery of footprints that end under a loft hatch leads to a chilling moment as the camera explores the dark roof-space, and Katie being dragged from her bed by an unseen assailant is an unexpected jolt—but the film as a whole is far from the intense, relentless, crap-your-pants-in-fright scare-fest that the trailers, and many reviews, claimed it to be.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
very disappointed not as scary as all the hype,"I was expecting to have to hug the person next to me during this film. I was on the website everyday checking to see if this made it to my area, when it finally did I was on top of it! I went to the theater early got my popcorn & by the end of the film i wanted my $$ back! I laughed more than i was scared! Don't get me wrong there are a couple of scenes that gave me goosebumps but like i said a couple! The scenes they show during the promo's to get you to come see this movie were the scariest. At the end the whole theater sat & waited for something & then little by little people started leaving & were all saying what a waste of time! you could wait till this one comes out on DVD! :[",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Doesn't live up to it's hype, but still a good thriller.","I liked this film, I speak for everyone when I say that I would of liked it more if it Wasn't overrated.When I saw the Trailer I saw some comments, calling it ""The Scariest movie of all time."" when I was like no way. I also heard about the ""Demand it"" thing on its website, I thought this movie was going to be the return of the Exorcist,so I was really looking forward to it. The day it came out, was on my birthday, so I thought that was a little weired,I tried watching it but it was sold out. The next day everyone at my school was talking about how scary it was,they did mention some girl getting dragged, so I just pictured in my mind some girl getting dragged to a red hole, that was hell, so now I REALLY wanted to see it, that day I skipped my 4th period class to see it, & I was really disappointed,I was expecting something like the devil just coming out from the ground,or something ""Paranormal"" like a dog getting skinned, or something like that.Overall this film could of been better if it Didn't consider itself the ""Scariest horror film of all time"" because thats basically just sticking the middle finger to Alien,The Shining, The Descent, The Six Sense, or even Night of the living dead.Still a good movie, just Hated the hype for it",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Modern Classic Horror Flick,"I remember one time I was in a restroom and out of nowhere the sink came on (was not a sensor sink). At the time I simply figured the plumbing somehow short circuited, but who knows. Perhaps some supernatural ghost or demon was haunting the bathroom and was trying to tell me to wash my hands. Most people have had something unexplainable happen to them, and it just depends on the individual to decide whether the cause was coincidence or if there is such a thing as ghost.In Paranormal Activity a young couple begins questioning the weird sounds in the night and the mysterious things that happen while they sleep. In an attempt to get evidence of the ghost or demon haunting their house, the husband named Micah buys a video camera to try and catch the ""paranormal activities"" on tape. Day by day the camera records stranger and more evidential activities of demons in the house, who appear to be trying to control the body of the wife named Katie. The couple has no idea what to do because the demon seems to have been following Katie since she was a small girl. They want to leave the house but they know that the demon will only bring torment to other people they come into contact with. Micah wants to figure out the problem, but his pride and reckless personality does not allow himself to call for help. Katie just feels desperate, confused, and guilty. She doesn't understand why this is happening to her and simply wants it to go away (who wouldn't).What is very frightening about Paranormal Activity is despite its extremely low budget, it is one of the most believable horror films ever made. It is shot with a hand-held camera and with simple effects, which makes it almost look like a home movie. With this in mind, Paranormal Activity makes the audience question those sounds they may hear in the night. This is what makes this film really scary and unique. So if you like horror films, Paranormal Activity is a must see. First time director Oren Peli has proved that a big-budget, experience and all-star actors are not needed to make a top-notch horror film. All it takes is an original, interesting idea and 10,000 dollars (The Paranormal Activity budget) to scare people out of their seats.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It wasn't scary at all,"Good movie but it wasn't scary at all. Not even close. I don't understand why people are so scared about the movie. The Ring is so much better to bring suspense.The script is good, in my opinion and the director made a good edition. I watch the 2 endings, and the original, from 2007, is far far better than the Theater one (I think they are looking for a sequence, is this 2009 ending).A good point is a lack of gore scenes.I am looking forward to see what the director will bring to us in his next jobs. This guy seems to be very creative. With such small budget, it's very very difficult to came up with such a good film like this.Sorry for the bad English, guys.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Blair Witch Project Set in Suburban Home,"This Movie Sucked. I went in to it wondering what the hype was all about and that in itself is what lead to its downfall and why I didn't give it a lower score. The story is quite simple, a couple has recently moved into a house and began to experience Paranormal Activity. The entire movie is shot similar to Blair Witch and Cloverfield by using 'Archive Video Tape Logs' they tell the story through the lens. You also learn that the woman has been haunted since childhood and that's its not really the house that's haunted, it's her-kinda. A few things happen and I did get a little scared on a couple scenes but it wasn't enough to save the entire film.The Acting isn't that good either. The lead characters have no chemistry and both come across as boring and dull, if I knew them in real life, I would only hang with them if they brought the spirits cos that's the only thing that's interesting about those two leads.The movie ends quite nicely and that scene alone is probably the best in the film but again, too little too late.So, don't believe the hype and save this movie for a boring Sunday afternoon or when you have time to kill.peace.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A Valiant effort, yet ultimately, it falls down a bit","I saw this movie enter the US top 10 out of the blue and instantly was intrigued. I knew nothing of the movie, hadn't even read a trailer or a review. I kept it that way and got my hands on this movie asap. I prepared, and judging from the huge reception and hearing Spielberg had to switch it off half way through because he was so scared, I was expecting this to be very chilling.Granted this movie does a superb job at keeping suspense going with it's minimalist attitude, but at the end, for someone as enthusiast about horror as I, it became predictable. The last 20 minutes I could have scripted myself. That's not an insult, it was just a bit predictable.It's a great effort by a 1st time director but for me, it just wasn't scary enough. I would recommend people to see it, but don't expect a great movie. If you thought Blair Witch was the scariest movie you ever saw, see this!

Flavor of the week,"Or year, whatever suits you best. One thing is for sure though: This thing gets hyped as ""Blair Witch"" was hyped when that came out. While Blair Witch had a clever marketing campaign (or not, if you think people shouldn't have believed it to be a true story), this one grows by word of mouth.While it really is original and stands out for that, that is no reason to give it high points just like that. Apart from the fact, that nothing much happens in this movie (which would be fine in general, but combined with weak characters/actors is a very dangerous unhealthy mix), it also fails to be gripping most of the times. While Japanese movies have walked that way since the 90s, it seems the western world just realises that the ""real"" world can be real scary.Well it would be, because seeing situations that could happen in your home or maybe have even happened in similar fashion, might make you feel weird and uncomfortable. Having said that, it would have been great to have stronger performances and characters. Especially the male lead is not only annoying, but just plain stupid. It's common that people in horror movies behave strange and do things they shouldn't do. But this guy beats them all in just one movie. There is doing something stupid and then there is suicidal. Well this guy is suicidal.Not only that, he's acting strong in one scene, just to break down in another (similar) one. There is no consistency to it at all. There was no actual sense of fear for me, because I just couldn't care less. The only time I was really scared, was when (almost at the end of the movie) something scary happened. And I wasn't scared because what happened on screen, but because a few girls were screaming right next to me! I almost had a heart attack because of those screamers!Talking about the ending: There was an original ending (the movie actually was ready to go in 2007), but was deemed not scary enough! So they shot the ending that can be seen now in cinemas. If rumors are true than Mr. Spielberg himself suggested the filmmakers should re-shoot the ending.I didn't even go into other flaws (story/script/editing), especially the latter, because it's a general problem with all those movies that are being shot ""for real"". Who does edit them? Romero found a nice solution to that, which is integrated into the Diary of the Dead and REC/Quarantine is too powerful for you to notice. With the slow moving pace of this, you will be reminded painfully every other second ...",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scary and realistic,"Everyone who is giving this bad reviews must be under the age of 25. They don't understand that your own imagination is far scarier than any Jason or Freddy and any of these lame remakes that Hollywood is putting out which all suck. For me, the original Halloween (1978) is the scariest movie ever. Paranormal Activity is really creepy and if this stuff was happening in my house I would be freaking out! The setting is an ideal upscale San Diego housing development where Day Trader Micah and his girlfriend (The fabulous) Kristy (This girl can act!) find themselves at the mercy of a demonic force, which has attached itself to Kristy. This film IS very low budget, but its suppose to be, your watching someones home video of things moving in their house. It was totally believable. The bedroom scenes are just so creepy, after seeing the film and going home, I was not really thinking much about it. Then I went to bed and I thought ""What if stuff happens when your asleep and you don't know it""? That is scary and I thought this crew did a fantastic job putting this together. On a 11,000 budget they have grossed 9 million so far, that is because most people over the age of 30 want something good not some lame Michael Bay crap. I can't stand his work it is so bad and Rob Zombie, horrible. Paranormal Activity is worth the money to see in the theater. Is it the most scary? No, its not. It creeps you out and makes you look at your own home in a very different way. I did have to get up and check the closets and behind the shower curtain before I went to bed. And I left the TV on. Its just disturbing more than scary and it stays with you. The acting is great and the character development is excellent and it is very funny as well. The two actors work well together and are a realistic couple that does realistic things. The last few minutes are SO creepy that I just thought I would be out the front door running down the street if it was me. 9 out of 10 just for showing Hollywood it takes IMAGINATION not millions to make something good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A+ for concept,"There are some good scares in this film. In fact, I can't remember the last ""horror"" film that gave me goosebumps the way this one did. Returning to a ""the basics"" where suspense and storytelling are key--not the great folks over in CGI--hopefully this will be a demonstration to the industry of what's been missing from horror films: subtlety.On the other hand, the rendering of the concept in this case would be more appropriate for, say, YouTube than a feature length film. While the device of ""found"" documentary footage (like ""The Blair Witch Project"") is as valid as any other, here it's an excuse to omit production values: like actors of some merit, dialog that isn't mindnumbing, sets (although the house here is used effectively). I will compliment the videography/cinematographer, because given what this is, it's very effectively shot.As well, we get a very convincing portrait of a relationship, and while the actors aren't awful, I was always aware that they were ""acting."" But if you've got nothing better to do on a rainy night, rent or download this and it'll be entertaining. However, making the effort to go to a theater, putting up with what often awaits one in the audience, in addition to the cost...this is better viewed at home.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

So they set up a camera and then go to sleep. (literally half the movie is them sleeping then a loud noise them being like ahhhh oh my god..... It is so lame. After they watch the film they indeed find out there is something besides them living in that house.Please friends i am a huge horror fan and i could not stand this movie.

The way scary movies SHOULD be done,"Not since Blair Witch Project has a movie left me unsettled afterwards. This low budget thriller relies not on jolt scares or gore to make it's point. This movie allows you to savor the experience long after the movie is over. Most fans of horror movies have come to expect or even rely on the typical jolt scare or over the top gore (much like ahem... Saw VI ) to enjoy themselves. I say more power to ya. However this film is more of a ""scared of the dark, look under the bed before you turn off the light"" kinda movie. I like scary movies but the cheap jolt is overused and i've gotten so used to it, it no longer has the desired effect.Bring movies like this back, Hollywood.

Paranormal Activity (2007) ***,"A young woman who's shacked up with her boyfriend in his house has finally revealed to him that she's been stalked by a ghost or demon ever since she was eight years old. Her heroic partner decides to keep a video camera running all day and evening in case they can catch evidence of things that go ""bump"" in the night. I saw this last night with my wife and two friends. Our theatre was packed with a full house and everyone was getting into it, and I have to say that I got freaked out and felt fear and dread several times during this movie - and I'm someone who never really gets ""scared"" when watching horror films, and I personally do not even believe in the existence of ghosts or demons. There isn't anything in the way of story or plot here, but that's not the point ... the goal is to scare you, and the film certainly made good on that goal. Much like JAWS made me afraid to go into the water in 1975, this film often made me dread going to bed at night as a grown man. There is also some comic relief with the couple's squabbling, mostly courtesy of the wise-cracking boyfriend who means well but sometimes doesn't take his girlfriend seriously.I think it's much to this movie's credit that the simplest means of scare tactics are the very best, and this low, low-budgeted film - with no blow-away makeup or CGI effects, no dazzling camera work (the scariest parts come with the camcorder completely still in one frame at night), and only a cast of two or three people, can be more effective than the most action-packed multi-million dollar blockbusters. You have to know HOW to make a subtle scary film where less is more, and this certainly accomplished that. It is a complete slap in the face to bloated Hollywood that an amateur project like this can trump all ""traditional"" horror movies of the last couple of decades when it comes to producing scares. I thought I was getting tired of the ""shot on home video"" genre after THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and CLOVERFIELD (both good films, I thought) but I'm wondering if the success of PARANORMAL ACTIVITY will keep revitalizing this approach. The technique is very strong in capturing the ""reality"" feel of a horrific situation. *** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
How to waste $8 without even trying.,"I, like others, fell for the hype and with the prospect of possibly seeing something genuinely scary plunked down my increasingly scarce disposable income for a 10:35 P.M. showing of Paranormal Activity. The theater was about half full so all of the ""elements"" were there and after about a lifetime of trailers the no-frills film began. All I can possibly say is do not believe the hype. If this is the scariest movie someone has ever seen than might I sneak behind said person and pop a bag full of air. I have now surpassed Paranormal Activity on the terror scale. The sheer silliness of Katie and Micah's video documentation of demon harassment elicited more guffaws than gasps of horror. When the film ended abruptly the audience sat in silence for about five seconds before someone asked incredulously ""Is THAT it?"" to which I replied ""we all got duped"". On a side note might I lobby Hollywood now to discontinue the nausea inducing shaky camera films. If I want to wretch at the theater I'll go see a Michael Moore ""documentary"". The fact that this movie was made with only $15,000 should not be a source of pride rather a main reason this film is so boring to begin with. Because it's a budget film did I get to pay a budget ticket? The media hype surrounding this movie is pure marketing 101 as there was not one moment where I was even remotely intrigued into what was going to happen next. I found myself however more interested in Katie's bustline as it appears that she has natural D-cup size breasts. Only horror movie I ever left with a hard-on. Oh well, another lesson I should have learned especially after seeing ""The Happening"" that cinema is actually getting worse by the year.

The only thing which creates the suspicion about reality and takes a bit of scare out was the exorcism footage of the girl on internet.To me the movie is a fine piece and different in itself.

It seemed everyone in the theater that we attended left wanting more and feeling short changed dollar for dollar.

"Over-hyped, but effective at its core.","I'm not going to sit here and claim that there is nothing frightening about Paranormal Activity. It is essentially a scary little movie that will provide some chills. Its main drawback is the feeling you've seen it before. Only out in the woods. Paranormal Activity is just too much like the Blair Witch Project to truly stand out on its own. It is another series of episodes filmed on a microscopic budget and meant to look like it really happened to the people filming it. Of course you know this going in. You know that it isn't real. So why use the same gimmick? Well, to make money I guess. Both films have made a mint.The film details a yuppie boyfriend/girlfriend couple in San Diego attempting to film possibly weird goings on that the young woman claim have been happening to her since age 8. The young man buys a large camera and begins filming virtually everything that goes on in their home. He's a ""day trader"" we learn. I guess they have a lot of spare time on their hands. The house is modest, and very clean and free of clutter. It looks like a tiny house that has been scrubbed and polished for an episode of MTV Cribs. Not a spec of dirt anywhere... until one scene where the guy spreads a bunch of baby powder on the floor to see if anyone/anything walks across it. The couple banter back and forth as couples do, and since they really aren't required to act anything other than frightened, it really doesn't matter that they aren't the most interesting of people.During the evenings, as the couple sleeps, the video camera set up at the foot of their bed records some odd sights and sounds. Something keeps walking up their stairs which end right outside their bedroom door. Sometimes the door will swing open and shut for a moment. The fact that these two continually sleep with an opened bedroom door, even after things get really ugly, strains all credulity. So does the fact that anyone faced with this kind of situation in real life would be too frightened to keep filming. (Same for Blair Witch) Eventually, the fact that they stay there at all leaves one scratching their head. But are the events we witness and experience along with them frightening? Yes. Most of the time they are. I was on pins and needles waiting to see who/what was going to walk up those steps at the end. And both endings worked. Give this film a try. If nothing else, it will give your girlfriend a reason to hold on tight to you. And isn't that the best part about scary movies? Well, for some people. 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Disappointment Not Hype Related,"The movie had an auspicious path to release. Initially there were whispers about the tiny budget indie movie that could; there was the hokey (and almost certainly hoax) claim by eventual producer Steven Spielberg that his screener copy of the movie was haunted; then there was the nearly unanimous clout given by reviewers of the festival scene claiming the film contained unimaginable fright; and finally there was a purportedly grass roots effort that ended in propelling the movie from its limited midnight only distribution to wide release.'Paranormal Activity' takes on the style of a ""hidden footage"" film. Recent movies of note to use a similar style were Cloverfield (2008) and Rec (2007). The entire movie takes place in one house and most of the ""activity"" is in one room. It uses a combination of sound based and off-camera activity to help build tension and heighten the sense of the unknowable. There is very little by way of visual horror.The film opens with the viewer being introduced to the main character, the camera, as well as the main human participants, Kate and Micah. The viewer is never to forget that the camera is present and that there is no doubt that the camera is an intrusive presence. It seems that every other dialog part in the movie is Kate, in some form or another, complaining, ""Micah, turn the camera off."" The redundant exchange is grating. And oddly familiar. Then one recalls the same device being used ad nauseam in The Blair Witch Project. At that point the familiar becomes hackneyed.One could argue that the entire execution of 'Paranormal Activity' has been done once before in the decade old 'The Blair Witch Project.' It may be the limitation of the ""found footage"" medium, but other than the considerably longer runtime of 'Paranormal Activity,' the pacing, style of tension built (sounds, character reactiveness, off camera action), and even the sequence of events including the finale are almost exact.When the camera goes live, we are slowly told the story of Kate and her life-long battle with disturbances around her. The manifestations started when she was eight, always seemed focused on her, but even her sister could see the disturbances. She describes her fifteen year ordeal in great detail to a psychic who agreed to visit the house and hoped to help. The psychic, however, informs the couple that he deals with ghosts and reconnecting with the dead. Kate's problem is something else entirely, according to the psychic, and he refers her to a colleague in a field that might be able help. (The psychic has one more scene later on and it is one of the best in the film.)At this point Micah pulls some kind of daft hissy fit where he forces Kate to ignore the ""fruit"" of a psychic and let him, Micah, deal with the problem. Micah, see, is a Day Trader, and he has access to this thing called the ""internet"" which allows him to visit, over the ""word wide web,"" a web page called Wikipedia as well as some Angelfire and Geocities web pages that has precise information regarding this little problem of Kate's. It would be no problem for him to figure this thing out. That, in its entirety, is inferred. Kate, as tortured and near breakdown as she is, agrees.The movie will sputter, catch, rev, stall, and eventually die. There's no question that one must be able to suspend his disbelief to catch fright in a movie like 'Paranormal Activity.' I'm usually able to do that well enough to enjoy any film, but not this one. After a few taunt moments about halfway in, the movie gets so caught up in its tired repetition that one ultimately gets bored with the thing.Night scene, occurrence. Day scene, freak out, ""Turn off that camera Micah,"" examine footage,discussion. Night scene, occurrence. Day scene, freak out, ""Turn off that camera Micah,"" examine footage,discussion. Night scene, occurrence. Day scene, freak out, ""Turn off that camera Micah,"" examine footage,discussion.Whatever is behind Kate's problem could be burning entire villages in Tanzania and dumping the charred bones on their bedroom floor and Micah would still Have this covered, babe, armed with a Ouija board. Micah's character arc, or lack thereof, is a woeful disservice to the movie. It is not until the last moment that Micah thinks that whatever is happening is beyond his expertise as a day trader.The scenes of occurrence themselves have very little cumulative effect. Each, individually, are barely nerve-wracking but are underscored with a single note of subtle deep resonating bass. The nearly subconscious suggestion of the note whispers, ""wait for it wait for it"" Awesome idea. I thought so when David Lynch did it in the BOB and dream sequences from Twin Peaks twenty years ago as well.After the brief tension at the little before half point, the viewer must wait until the last act for a few more possible chills. In this act it is all in Kate's hands. Micah has gone into Day Trader Retreat and keeps maniacally fiddling with the camera, so Kate does what she does best and carries what little quality there is in the film. Her fear is palatable (which makes one wonder even more why she let Captain Day Trader attempt to save the day) to the viewer and what gut wrenching one feels in the film can directly be attributed to Kate. The final few occurrences are as close to scary as the movie gets.In summary, if one keeps the perspective that 'Paranormal Activity' was made for something like twelve grand, then it would have to be considered a strong effort.But is 'Paranormal Activity' is an unqualified success and extraordinarily scary without caveat? No it isn't.www.PopBunker.net @popbunker",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Lives Up to All the Hype,"Paranormal Activity (2007)**** (out of 4)By now everyone knows the story but a couple (Katie Featherston, Micah Sloat) begin to experience paranormal activity in their home so they set up a video camera to try and capture what's going on. As a die-hard horror fan I pay attention to all the news floating around year in and year out. Each and every year fans hype up the latest scary movie but more times than not that hype ends up being nothing more than the build up for a bad movie. That's certainly not the case here. I've had several people tell me this was the scariest film they had ever seen. I had people telling me they saw folks leaving the theater in tears. I had heard just about everything you'd want to hear about a horror movie but the most shocking this is that, even knowing the hype, the movie got under my skin like no other that I can remember seeing. I love a good ghost movie and this here is certainly one of the best. On a ""critic"" proof level the film is probably just a three and a half but the overall impact is quite remarkable and in the end this certainly lives up to the opinion of being one of the scariest films ever made. I'm not going to call out any of the scary sequences as to not ruin them for anyone else but I can think of three that had my blood turning ice cold. The film has been compared to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, which I think is fair because both movies take simple things that can frighten anyone. In this film we get a wide angle view of the bedroom and at first I didn't like this because you never knew where the ""scary"" part was going to happen so you were constantly looking all over the frame to pick up that moment. After a while I realized this was a masterful touch because, like the characters, you never knew where the scary moment was going to happen so by constantly looking around you were just building up the fright level in your head because you had no idea where it was going to come from or what they had in store for you. The performances by Featherston and Sloat were very good to say the least. This type of low budget movie usually doesn't feature this type of performances but it's another plus for the film. Another major miracle is the fact that the filmmakers could do so much with so little, which once again proves that you don't need money to show off talent. As with the previously mentioned hyped movie, I'm sure this one will take a lot of backlash but that's going to happen with any popular movie. For me, the movie worked marvelously well and certainly lived up to everything I had heard about it. Sitting here thinking back on a few of the scenes still gives me goosebumps.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
2 Words: Shock Value!!!,"I was breaking my head trying to see this movie and every time I went to AMC on 42nd it was sold out and these were midnight showings. All this made me want to see this movie more not to mention the trailers and the great DEMAND IT hype!!! So finally this past Friday 10-09-09 me and my wife saw the 6:55 showing at AMC on 42nd street. Quickly noticed that the theater was very packed compared to other times I have gone and the audience was very excited and now came show time. The movie starts off pretty basic you get to meet the couple and see a little of what's it about. Quickly start to realize this is an ordinary couple and there chemistry was great. About 20 minutes into the movie is where the movie quickly picks up steam and you just start saying to yourself this is just a movie. Every time the couple goes to sleep something more terrifying happens. I actually saw 2 couples leave the theater in fear. This movie is very scary and disturbing really what has been lacking in many years for a Halloween release. Very cheaply done for under $15,000 and I assure you, once you get home and lay in your bed you will be looking at your doorway it's very disturbing. My wife had her eyes covered for the last 10 minutes which by far were the most intense. This is a must see and it shows all these Hollywood people you don't need $50 million and tons of CGI to make a terrifying, scary and disturbing movie. This made my top five all-time list of most scariest movies. GO SEE IT!!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Over hyped and not scary at all.,"Total snoozefest. I almost fell asleep watching this over hyped movie. So NOT scary! The Blair Witch Project was fairly creepy throughout and had an ending that still disturbs me, many years later. Paranormal Activity was a waste of my time and money. Despite the fact that the actors were believable, especially in the beginning, their personas started to fall apart toward the middle of the film. Despite repeated pleas by Katie, the ""camera"" continues to roll and even in places where neither Micah nor Katie could possibly be manning the camera. We all know this is make-believe, but I was expecting something better, more engaging; not an hour plus of a deteriorating relationship based upon hardly there ""entities"". The camera that affords us the time-line in the lives of Katie and Micah fast forwards, but not early enough. I could have fast forwarded to the last ""scary"" scene about thirty minutes into this movie - and not missed anything.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Where the Wild Things Weren't,"I love a good scare. I like it better when shared with an audience full of fellow victims. So I didn't hesitate to see this movie based on the trailer. How could I pass up ""The scariest movie of all time"". So scary we saw reaction audience shots in the trailer to prove it.So at my local Cineplex, on a Friday opening nation wide weekend, there I sat. Popcorn bucket in hand. I also brought my family so I had someone to clutch.Fast forward an hour into the film...Popcorn gone(the mega free refill bucket). Why is this important? Because instead of clutching at family, and a possible stranger or two, I'm shoving my face full of buttery ecstasy. I'm now full and sleepy. This preoccupation with my popcorn bucket was brought about from watching a Serta Mattress commercial for nearly an hour.Yes there was an occasional bump or door creek. (I live in a decade old house) if this is scary to most, come spend the night here. The audience has yet to make one of those movie trailer synchronized screams. I however am telling myself it's building up to something. The short story is: it did. I loved the ending, and the 15 minutes leading up to it. However the first hour was so dull it really hurt the momentum. That multiplied by average acting (I did appreciate what non-actors brought to the films pseudo realism), and a script that had very little to offer other than the build up to the end. Couple that with the overused shaky cam effect (not as bad as recent attempts in films like Cloverfield and .Rec) and uninteresting dialogue and you have the makings of a sci-fi original.I can't help but think that most will get in line for the ride, but end up waiting patiently for the ride home. And if they live in a home like mine; the film won't be what keeps them up at night.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
the only thing scary about this movie was the ridiculous amount of hype,"The only thing scary about this movie was the ridiculous amount of hype. That and the terrifying profits they must be making off of a budget of $15,000. Don't waste your money, if you really want to watch it look it up on the internet for free. I have lost all faith in Hollywood. The only thing worth watching this movie is a couple of scenes that are pretty funny, and a few scenes that are kinda creepy. Basically 2 out of 97 minutes of this movie are worth watching. So if you feel that that justifies $10 for a ticket then by all means go see it. It just astounds me that there are people out that there honestly think that this is the next big scary movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Paranormal Activity,"Low budget indie films have been a good way for amateur filmmakers to break out for a long time. Kevin Smith broke out with a black and white movie made for $67,000 called Clerks; El Mariachi, made for only $7,000, turned Robert Rodriguez into a big name rebel director in the 90's. Horror is a harder medium to make it in the low budget arena. A field dominated by gory and effects driven movies these days, horror saw a mega hit in 1999's Blair Witch Project. Made for only $11,000, Blair Witch Project has often been duplicated, but the success was never repeated. Here we are, 10 years later, and a new phenomenon has come around with Paranormal Activity, a movie that doesn't try to be Blair Witch, but exceeds expectations. Made also for only $11,000, Paranormal Activity has made a huge splash in the mainstream breaking records in the process (in it's first weekend it broke $7 million in only 200 theaters), but is it really worth all the fuss? After a series of ""supernatural"" events have happened in their house, Micah, decides to get a video camera to substantiate their claims of a haunting. Katie (who's engaged to be engaged to Micah) has had these supernatural events happen to her since she was 8, she wants them to stop, and while she's not entirely comfortable with Micah recording the events, she goes along with it. They meet with a psychic who feels they're dealing with a demon and suggests a demonologist to help them take care of their problem. Micah doesn't take it seriously, and believes they can get rid of their visitor without outside help. Despite Katie's warnings and worry, Micah keeps trying to provoke the entity. Tensions build, tempers flare, and the paranormal activity gets more intense till it finally reaches the breaking point.Originally bought by Paramount with the intention of owning the rights to remake the movie with a better budget and bigger names, Paranormal Activity fares better without the higher production values of a big budget film. Shot with one hand-held camera and without a score, the movie feels completely real. The use of unknown actors also gives the film a more authentic feel, and it helps that they don't really feel like they're acting as well. As each day unfolds, we find ourselves prisoners in the house, which adds to the claustrophobic feel of the movie. We learn every nook and cranny of the house, so we notice the moving shadows, and the changes that occur all the more later on in the film.All in all, Paranormal Activity is a very well done horror film, stripping away many of the conventions we see in horror film, relying on real scares rather than gore or music cues to instill a sense of tension and fear in the audience. I highly recommend seeing this in theaters if you have the opportunity, the atmosphere of seeing this with others really helps with adding fear to the proceedings as large groups intensify the feeling among those in the group. For those of you planning on taking the children, there is foul language, but on top of that the film does start off slowly and the more nuanced scenes may be lost on a younger audience. Definitely give this film as a chance as it is worth the hype, even if only for the last scene of the movie!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""Blair Witch Project"" meets ""The Haunting""","I've probably seen ""Paranormal Activity"" too late. By the time the movie finally arrived in Austria it had already been hyped up for years. Yes, years. Bloody-Disgusting had already raved about this low-budget-sensation before the movie was picked up by a major studio and found a worldwide release. So, I had high expectations, but soon enough the backlash started and a lot of people pointed out that ""Paranormal Activity"" isn't the great, once-in-a-lifetime-horror-movie it had been made out to be at first.The truth is somewhere in the middle. For the low budget he had to work with director Oren Peli has made a highly atmospheric movie that doesn't need the help of a score or cheap scares to work. The horror happens in the viewer's mind, as they say. This is basically ""The Haunting"" remade with the looks of ""Blair Witch Project"".Of course, this also means that the movie isn't for everyone - myself included, because really nothing much happens: Most of the time there are noises in the house and we watch the main characters freaking out about it. This may be scary if you're having a lot of fantasy and not much experience watching horror movies. However, if you've seen anything this side of ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and ""À l'intérieur"", ""Paranormal Activity"" just doesn't really do it for you. It's not a bad movie by any means. It's just nothing special (except, of course, for its spectacular revenue, but that's information only movie studio bosses should be interested in, right?).One last piece of advice: Contrary to common belief that this movie works best at the cinema, I have to say, in hindsight I wish I had seen it at home. This is where the horror in the movie takes place. Watching it alone in your apartment at night probably helps to freak you out more than being in a public place with screaming teens.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not at ALL what was expected,"Simply put: This movie was hyped up to be unbelievably scary. Every other Facebook status I saw was pretty much talking about the movie. The IMDb rating was an 8.6 (VERY high for IMDb's standards) when I checked just before heading to the theater. Then I made the mistake of actually watching the movie.My verdict: Bad enough to make the crowd laugh at the ""scary"" parts, and boo at the end. Practically everyone yelled ""REFUND!"" while we walked out of the theater. No impact scary moments. No so-scary-I'm- about-to-wet-my-pants moments. Nothing. I pretty much consider this a complete waste of $9.50. Me and my friends (and the whole auditorium in which I watched, actually) seem to be the only people who don't like this movie. I really don't see what was so good about it, though. Complete waste of my time. Definitely 2009's ""Epic Movie."" I'm being generous with 3/10 stars.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Nutshell Review: Paranormal Activity,"Note to self: If I want to make a film that would allow a clueless audience to leave bewildered whether it's a true event or not, leave out all forms of credits, and end it as it is. Although Paranormal Activity is a work of fiction, its presentation made many amongst the audience wonder if it's true, even as the end credits did state it's fictitious. I guess not everyone reads.The Blair Witch Project could probably be credited as one of the earliest horror films which used the Internet extensively to market the film, and to build a buzz surrounding its probable ""real life"" events which unfold from a first person video camera perspective. It managed to spook its way to box office success despite being low budget, and there are now countless of films out there which have adopted similar techniques, though with varying degrees of success. But of course that doesn't stop films, like this one, from trying.Micah (Micah Sloat) and Katie (Katie Featherston) are the chief protagonists in a film as shot by Micah on his expensive camera, just to try and catch whatever's bothering his fiancé each night in her sleep. As we learn together with him on this voyeuristic journey, this disturbance is nothing new, as whatever it is has been spooking Katie since she was 8 years old, and as a ghost expert explains the distinction between ghosts and demons, this one wants Katie, and won't just go away even if the couple should move homes. Talk about not knowing what he has gotten himself into, hooking up with a girl who comes with some supernatural baggage!So as the story goes, Paranormal Activities has a repetitive presentation, which will either keep you intrigued in wanting to find out what's the next discovery and progress as the days wear on at the witching hour of 3am each night, or just plain bore you out of your wits. It's like a slow brew, watching little things like shadow movements, morph into shock jock tactics like sudden slamming of doors, to things that literally come crashing down into the living room. Half the movie gets shown in 1 camera angle, and that's watching the couple in their bed sleeping until something happens, which will creep you out in varying degrees.That said, it's the little things that just plant some frightful thoughts within your mind, but when the time is ripe for some full blown in-your-face horror, this film doesn't shy away from that either. It's one heck of a finale that you probably won't see it coming, akin to those viral marketing videos that have you stare until your guard is down, then sucker punch you and knowing not to drag it out for too long, for maximum results. Franking speaking, you can afford to dose off for the 1st hour.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Relatively effective,"For the first half Paranormal Activity starts to shape up as a seriously decent little horror film shot quickly on a shoe string yet eliciting some genuinely scary atmosphere from the innocuous household setting. It's a far more restrained affair than Poltergeist, and uses a subtly dark sound mix to ratchet up the tension far more effectively than Blair Witch ever could. But like i said: that's just the first half. Once we, the audience, have accepted that the malevolent presence in the house is going to do little more than walk around menacingly, occasionally banging on stuff, the threat evaporates and the film's sole strength - the unknown element of where it's all going is gone with it. There's little appeal in the amateurish performances and the hand-held camera-work gets the job done whilst adding nothing to the overall effect of the shots. At around 90 minutes it's also surprising that there still remain one or two filler scenes that add absolutely nothing to the film. It is worth baring with though for its finale, a little predictable perhaps, far better than the alternate ending certainly, and I for one loved it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"7-8 out of 10, you have to be kidding...!","I usually trust IMDb ratings but this movie was atrocious. From the beginning, I was wondering what the hell was wrong with the main characters. Who in their right minds messes with paranormal activity? Regardless, I kept waiting for something interesting to happen and was extremely disappointed. So bad that I was furious when the credits appeared ""in the memory of..."", what a farce!Nothing about the characters draws you in, nothing about the demons/ghosts is crafty or novel, and nothing about the way the story unfolds is worthy of praise.

Ingenious Execution on a (Relative) Budget,"Indie films are given no quarter by most reviewers among the general public: It's rare for a reviewer to give allowances to their verdict of an indie. Instead, it's typically rated with no more or less bias than a film with a $200 million budget.That's why ""Paranormal Activity"" seems to get marked down a bit. But what we have here is a great idea executed very well, and for comparatively little money. If you're a filmmaker, it's what you aspire to. If you're a viewer, one would think it'd be something you're looking to praise, to ensure the next one comes down the pipe, and perhaps this time with better funding.""Paranormal Activity"" is scary.

Probably the scariest movie I have ever seen,"So happy I watched this as soon it came out.

I hope newer generations are able to enjoy it too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Freaky,"I don't really believe that it counts as this generations ""The Exorcist"" but that doesn't matter, it's still quite good. It's not a series of screeching heads popping up to get cheap shocks out of the audience. The audience is in the dark and the screen is dark. You sit, and wait, and wonder what's going to happen next, and sometimes it's just really bizarre. It was incredibly suspenseful and the pauses are larger than some other movies which would've made it boring if it didn't capture your attention so simply and effectively. At first it seems like the entity is a serious lightweight with such spooky tricks as moving someones keys to the middle of the room at night and only making one thing go thud in the night but it manages to escalate to the point where it's not so subtle, but not so grand and amazing, but still really freaky. It's pretty clever n that respect and just goes to prove that budget isn't needed to make a film good.When Katie screeches it's really kind chilling. It's not got the whole generic teenager in slasher film sort of screaming. It was awfully chilling and freaky. As for Mika, he was an idiot. He was an absolute idiot who kept saying that he could handle it, he was in control and that he was making progress when really he just made things a lot worse. Thankfully his tool-like nature was not so extreme to be apparent instantly or ruin the movie.The relationship breakdown between the two as the movie progresses was very realistic and that part of the story was actually filmed more believably than in Cloverfield. In Cloverfield the ""OMG A MONSTER LETS FILM IT!"" aspect made sense but the ""hey just ignore the camera I'm holding to the side as I film your reactions to me flirting with you"" was just there because it needed to be for the story. The bits between the nights when it's filmed are realistic. It's believable that Mika would film some of it because it doesn't appear to be propped up as a reality TV show.So it's pretty freaky. It didn't leave me cautious to open doors or make me a little tense as I turned the lights off and went to sleep but it certainly spooked me while I was watching it. The person next to me was covering their eyes and freaking out though!",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not Exorcist. Not Blair Witch. Not even Cloverfield.,"I had opened up to the Blair Witch when there was still some doubt as to how 'real' it was. I went in hoping that if I opened up I might actually be scared, but about a quarter in I had given up even being as entertained as I was by Cloverfield.This movie went directly from potentially suspenseful/spooky to outright cheap, blunt, heavy handed schlock. The (adlibbed?) acting is initially convincing, but the protective boyfriend becomes the ""when is this d-bag going to die"" boyfriend in next to no time. I saw it with my wife, who is a lot easier to scare than myself, and she was laughing before I was. The people building the buzz about how scary this movie is must either be working to promote it or so simpleminded/ superstitious that ANY mention of evil spirits instantly puts them into the zone.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Forget the hype and the negative reviews...,"OK where to begin??? I heard about this movie from a friend and watched the Trailer and read all about it. So I was so excited from all the hype yet so prepared to be disappointed from the negative feedback I read as well. My advice is to go see for yourself when you can. If you go expecting to see a bad ghost film then thats what you will get. However, If you go with an open mind to realistic possibilities and just put yourself in their situation, then you may just get a good scare. Honestly I've never seen a scary movie that made me scared to leave my seat, but there are those that stick in your head and scare you later when you're alone. I would say this is one of them. You may jump at loud noises and get scared in the theater, but I think this movie was designed to make you keep thinking about it. Why?,Why not? Why didn't they?,and Wtf?? (spooky) So I guess my final thought would be to see this with an open mind, forget comparing to other movies and forget all that Hollywood action and FX.

The found-footage style is executed effectively and justifies its place in the genre.The performances are convincing, even if they don't stand out. That said, they feel natural rather than forced, which is a definite plus.

In the night the camera is set up and predictable enough things start to happen and gradually build up and up more each night. One part was scary when the girl is dragged from her bed, but even this wasn't all that amazing and happened around and hour and a half into the film by which time i just wanted to sleep. The woman gradually gets more and more weird and you expect her to turn into the girl from the exorcist, but just as the film starts to get interesting it ends. It was a big waste of my time.

Possibly the most frightening film I have ever seen.,"And the title of my review isn't hyperbole. I've seen a lot of the horrors that would be considered essential viewing for a fan of the genre. That is, The Exorcist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Omen, The Shining, The Ring et. al. The list would be too long to go through here, but you get the idea. All very good, but none have haunted me in quite the way the original Paranormal Activity did. All of the above I have seen more than once. More than a few times, really, but no longer would I have to brace myself in order to sit through a late night viewing of the films on the list of horror films that would commonly be considered seminal. Except for Paranormal Activity.It's easy to forget in the wake of the franchise it spawned just how good and how effective the original was. Where the sequels eventually went the route of CGI and cheap scares, the original relies on that brooding tension. That fear of the unknown. Simply put, the original PA has that ability to put across to the viewer the terror that a malevolent but unseen entity is inflicting in the home of a young couple and almost puts it into the room with us. We get to witness as they become increasingly fearful and mentally unraveled as events unfold. As things become increasingly sinister and bizarre in this home.I saw it back in 2009.

Entertaining but not original,"Paranormal Activity is a well-executed and entertaining film however it is not entirely original. It is the story of a couple who suspect there might be an evil spirit haunting their house. They decide to film the paranormal activity by using a hand-held camera. I have seen many movies about houses haunted by spirits but not one that is shot by hand-held camera in an amateur style. This makes the movie somewhat believable. But other than this idea, the film falls short of offering anything original. It has some scary moments and the suspense builds up nicely but when you get to the ending it feels like ""Blair Witch Project"" in the house.

No, wait, that was a dream I had last night, not this film. Oh well, this film was OK, but I coulda thought of more frightening scenes-like maybe an arm stretching and reaching across the room 20 feet in the dark half light-reaching for a smoke or something while the couple sits in bed freaking out like they had 999,000 volts running through them nonstop. Or something. Oops that was from another film. Run of the mill new school yank me crank me fiddlin'.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Wow  - a horror film with a few actual ""scares""...","Shot doco style in and around one house, this is the ultimate in low budget shoestring filmmaking, and is effective in maximizing what it can from minimal surroundings and FX.The film is supposedly the footage shot by a young couple in San Diego in 2006, who determine that their house is haunted. This point is not really argued but taken as fact, both the partner Micah and the haunt-ee Katie frequently speak matter-of-factly about the ""force"" or ""demon"" or whatever and just accept that it is there.As the film opens they are setting up a camera purchased to document events while they sleep, and the camera seems to roll at all times, while they chat, eat, and generally loll about the house.So we have less a plot than some stuff that happens while Micah and Katie go about their daily existence. Katie is a student and Micah is apparently a day trader, which must mean he is a good one as they both live in a very nice looking (and definitely not cheap) house.Where relevant, and it needs to be said tension building, the date and time appear on screen, so that we might see long periods of inactivity in a short space of time, this is especially important in the night scenes. The camera is especially well positioned, so that we can see both Micah and Katie as they sleep, and a conveniently opened door on the left of screen, where for 90 minutes we constantly wait for something, anything to appear.It is the wait that is more nerve wracking than the events themselves. By not showing anything our minds go to places that could not have been possible on a film with a $15,000 budget, so the viewer's imagination should be credited for 90% of the scares.I think the fact that I have watched so many horror movies hurt me a little here, as I am very patient in waiting for the next scare, and ""BOO"" moments don't have nearly as much impact seeing that I have sat through thousands over many years.As time elapses it becomes very clear that the two are not simply delusional, as over many nights evidence mounts up on the film and sound recording devices. Early on they solicit the advice of a psychic, who seriously explains various scenarios and calmly informs Katie that it is she that the whatever is after, and that moving or running away won't help.So it seems clear that the demon/ghostie things either has sat-nav, or that Katie needs to block it as a friend on her Facebook page.As the severity of the ""symptoms"" and encounters escalate, the usual cinematic devices are brought in, rippling bedsheets, slamming doors, on/off lights and my favourite, the hissing audio turned up loud that has an unearthly voice on it. (Never fails to get the hairs on my neck to stand up that one. The Sixth Sense one was best.) Most of the action comes to light the next day when Micah goes through the tapes.It must be said that there are some discrepancies here, it seems that Micah feels this is more of a lark, he taunts the being and tries to lure it out and I guess catch it or something. Katie explains that she has dealt with it for years and is far more cautious, she wants to bring in an exorcist type person, and often complains about the camera as being an irritant to both her and the beastie.Micah is both more understanding than I would ever be (I would ask a few more questions if my wife stood over me vacantly staring while I slept for two whole hours and then claimed not to remember anything) and inflammatory, mocking Katie at the same time as he watches hard evidence that she is largely correct in her fears. He ultimately does stir sh*t up when he brings a ouija board into the house despite Katie's misgivings, and though he doesn't get the chance to formally use it the presence of the board does have an impact. (A pretty cool one too.) There is a leap of faith required by the audience about an hour in that I never really went for as it seemed just a little too far fetched, and yes I realize I am watching a movie about ghosts and that leaps of faith are necessary to enjoy the film.The movie culminates in what I now know are two endings, having read about the other on the net. There was the original, more low key ending which I witnessed, and the more over the top one made for a wider release to US audiences. Having seen one and read about what happens in the other I think I prefer what I saw as it seemed to be more in keeping with the film's tone.But that is not apparently what the American audiences want, as this film is now the highest grossing R rated flick of the decade.The best bits of Paranormal Activity are 30 seconds snippets of very effective and audience manipulating filmmaking, the other 99% is OK, it did drag along at times.It seemed that the daylight hours were simply there as an intermission between the scary parts that went on while the couple slept.I instinctively kept glancing to the corners awaiting something dreadful, which is why kids are afraid of the dark in the first place isn't it?Final Rating – 7 / 10. Like having a great song as the closing track on a bad album, you finish happy but wonder of the first hour or so was really that necessary.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Killed by hype, slow, but Haunting, mysterious and very scary!","Paranormal Activity under the influence of Cabin Fever. The Amityville horror for the Youtube generation. If it weren't for the hype, this wouldn't stand out to be a great ghost haunting movie, but everyone is expecting the 'scariest movie of all time'. Unlike a lot of people, i did like this movie. This is a rare event in horror when i actually cared for the characters involved. Why? Because we get 2/3 of the running time jam packed with character development. It's like a slasher movie, we now no our character now we just want to see them get slaughtered, or in this case, haunted. Although the movie maintain interesting, it does take way to long to get into the big scares. They director would tease us with a few door slams, building tension and then cutting back to broard daylight. Making us wonder why didn't they decide for it to be over the coarse of one night, instead of 3 weeks.Paranormal Activity, believer or not, is pretty damn scary. We don't need Saw traps to make us tremble, because this is shocking, makes you jump and delivers on what you could ask for in a super natural horror. The greatest thing about Paranormal Activity is that you believe every single scratch, wail, bang and foot step. The realism is stunning. It's not just scares, but also there is mystery, that you feel really involved in and I thought was one of the movies strengths. One of it's weakness' is that the shocks are two infrequent, it's NOT the scariest movie of all time and there needed to be more. There were some touches that really made the movie scary, and I admired where the plot went, but the teasing does a grow a little to tedious, but in the end pays off.Overall: Haunting, mysterious and very scary. But the pacing slows this movie right down and the hype prevents it from being the great movie that it should have been. Still, a Most Haunted wet dream.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good but not excellent,"I watched this movie because one acquaintance, pretty loud-mouthed guy kept talking about how this film is so low budget and super scary in the same time. So I decided to see it for myself.He was right on one thing. Despite the movie's non-impressive budget it looks very well, I would have never thought about it. But what about the scary part? Well...The movie is scary. And one thing you should like about it is how different it is from other horror movies. It's not a B-category slasher with tons of blood and sexploitation. It returns to the classical horror movie concept "" There's nothing scarier than an unopened door "". However I have a few objections. The movie is scary, but not scary enough for what they declared to be the best horror movie ever. And you know what it did lack, the exact thing cheap horror movies are full of : screams and unexpectedness.Don't take me wrong, the style is flawless, the 1st person view offers a great immersion experience, but that is just not enough. Yes the effects were very good for this movie, but still...We all know how it works, ever since Jaws made the appearance on the big screen. First everything is calm, then the tension arises, the illusive calm-down and then BOOM something happens. In a attempt to look ""non-hollywood"" the makers of the movie seem to have ignored this rule. Sometimes they skip the tension part throwing us straight to action, other times there just is no culmination. Of course alternation is important, but it's a very sensitive thing, a thing the movie-makers couldn't squeeze maximum results of in this movie.Horror movies should be like roller-coasters, they should go fast-slow , first making you feel the overwhelming sensation of rising g-force then making you nervous waiting for the next fall. Unfortunately 'Paranormal activity' doesn't exactly feel like that. It feels more like driving a car accelerating at a constant pace on a highway, no sudden skidding, almost no unexpected turn. Instead of feeling as if I traveled on a road with very bad conditions: disturbed, cranky, nervous; this trip felt like a slide on butter. The movie has few really scary moments, the rest are not so scary. Plus to that the movie is too linear, i caught myself thinking ""wow this is just like in those old ghost stories, right now thing x should happen"" and I guessed, A LOT. Because of this you can't fully enjoy the movie, the sounds aren't loud enough, the events aren't scary and unexpected enough, developing too predictably, slowly and monotonous .Now, of course I am being strict right now. The movie is flushing with originality . It re-raises standards of the genre by once again proving that a movie can be scary :even with a basic ghost story you heard hundreds of timeseven without excessive violence, blood, sex and profanationeven without a immense budgetand most importantly it proves that tension alone and originality can still make a good horror movie.On the background of the achievements, the minor problems like sometimes asking yourself 'Why are they acting strange?' and the fact that the relationship of the characters looks a little not genuine just fade away.However...Yes it has good effects, yes the acting is quite believable, yes the scenes are creepy, but still it just missed a little bit of spice.This movie will probably enter the manuals of 'How to make good horror movies' but it was just a few steps away from perfection.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Two hours watching a bad home movie...... please.... (spoilers within),"98% of this film is mind-numbingly boring and pointless. The other 2% is contrived and pointless. Right, and I just sat through it.Its a substandard mix of Blair Witch and Exorcist with the plot quality of your average teen slasher movie. Strangely enough, that makes most of this almost believable as a straight edit of a home movie. Then, in the last 2 minutes, either the director or the film editor made a really bad decision on the final scene, threw away any shred of common sense and went for a contrived ending.What I really do not get is how anyone thinks any of this film is even slightly scary, or will stop them sleeping. Had any of the themes or plot devices been original, it would have helped, but since the sole selling point of this is the BWP style hand held camera, it fails.The one part that had me thinking at all was the sequence where Micah spreads powder to catch the demon's (NOT A GHOST!!!) foot/hoof/paw prints. The ploy works, until you see them. Chicken feet? What???? Even worse, the short sequence played back to show the marks being made very clearly shows three exact prints being made, by a biped, no powder kicked around, no impression of the feet (etc) rolling from ball to toes.... Why didn't he try and cover the demon with flour or something instead? I was guessing on a four foot tall, bad tempered, be-horned #something# for the dramatic irony, based on the 8 inch long feet.What would have helped the film a little, if ram raiding the Exorcist plot a bit, is the concept of actually bringing the demonologist in on the scene. Instead we get the very obvious demonic possession followed swiftly by the murder and the silly ending, that makes the whole unconvincing.I'm sorry, but unless you really want an excuse to fall asleep for two hours, simply avoid this film.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Wonderfully Creepy,"I've never heard of a horror franchise in which the first film was the weakest. At least in my opinion, but of all three Paranormal Activities released so far this is my least favorite. That doesn't mean I don't like it, in fact when I first saw it I jumped on the bandwagon of ""this is the scariest movie I've ever seen in my life."" Now I do know that this movie is very polarizing, and I can see why people hate it so much, but for me, I don't have too many complaints about it.Yeah, it can be very slow at times, it's not a movie that will continuously try and scare you, it needs build up, and for some people the build up is too long and doesn't pay off enough. Micah, one of the two main characters is...well...kind of an idiot. Throughout the movie you want to just go inside the movie and yell at him to listen to Katie. And the day scenes drag on a litte too long, you want to get to night because that's when things get really interesting. And the characters may explain too much to you, they always look over the footage and watch the scary parts.This is one of the creepiest films I've ever seen in my life. I mean, seriously, any time it turns to night, I begin to get so tense, knowing that these two characters are being watched. And it always leads to a great jump scare. It build gradually, the first few are so small that you may not even realize that something is happening, but then by the last night things just start going so crazy. Katie is a great character, reminding me of myself. If I were in her shoes, that is pretty much how I would act. I like the sense of humor it has so that it isn't completely dread filled. And the ending is fantastic, I've seen the alternate endings, and while they were cool to see, this is the best in my opinion.This is a love it or hate it movie, and I love it. Yeah it can be slow at times, and Micah is a bit of an idiot. But if you love haunted house movies, or found footage movies, than you owe it to yourself to see this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

It represents one of the unique living evidences that marketing can sell ANYTHING for what it's not and bring back lots of money WITHOUT any investment.I realized I shouldn't write anything about it because the simple adding of any critic will help this movie anyway whatsoever...even downloading this film from the internet is not worth the price of the telecommunication cost....what did I spend 5 minutes of my time to write this review?

"""Paranormal Activity"" is so enjoyably spooky that I am all the more disappointed that I passed on the chance to see it in a theater.","The peculiar pleasure of being scared is one of the most inexplicable and perversely fascinating things about the human psyche. Over the centuries, we have shelled out money to subject ourselves to a good scare, and when the auctioneers of the show hold up their end of the bargain, we come out of the auditorium chilled, quivering, and yet, more importantly, giddy all at the same time. Being scared at the movies is like subjecting oneself to an intense nightmare; the only difference is that this time we get to choose when and where we are pounded raw by the blood-chilling pseudo-paranormal. Perhaps that is the pleasure of a good scary picture. And in recent years, fewer have come close in influence, promise, and delivery than Oren Peli's ""Paranormal Activity."" It is precisely the sort of scare picture that I enjoy: spooky, clever, and yet not overdone to the point where it becomes depressing and the shock value diminishes.It is also evidence that sometimes a limited budget forces the creative monster out of all of us. For it is because it was filmed on a shoestring budget, and that it was literally filmed inside director Peli's own house, and that it was acted by talents who might as well have been playing themselves, it seems all that much closer to life - or perhaps the appropriate term is 'plausibility.' And therefore, it's all the more pleasurably creepy.A bigger, fiscally-minded production probably would have turned this story of a haunted girl (Katie Featherston) and her scrupulous boyfriend (Micah Sloat) into a modern-day ""Poltergeist"" with tremendous influence placed on what a special effects studio can do. Nothing necessarily wrong with that, as the marvelous 1980 classic that I just mentioned did it and did it well, but ""Paranormal Activity"" accomplishes something just as good with even less. It's one of those 'mockumentary' pictures, with the whole thing being pre-recorded footage supposedly picked up by a third party. As it starts out, Mr. Sloat, concerned over his girlfriend's confessions of being haunted, buys a camera to record them as they sleep, to prove to her that the only thing paranormal in the house is what she is imagining. Then, spooky stuff starts happening. They hear sounds from downstairs, the lights in the hallway come on and off without explanation, and the door, conveniently left open every single night, begins to move on its own.""Paranormal Activity"" has some great shock moments in it, but what it really builds its strength on its suspense. And again, this is where its limited budget comes into rewarding effect. Low-key (but not overly gloomy) lighting increases visual tension, similarly-shot scenes, and similar methods to help the audience watch for signs of danger. In the movie, the two haunted characters show little in the way of intelligence, for even as they start to believe that there is a specter among them, they always leave the door to their bedroom wide open. Is it because they're not the sharpest tools in the shed? Perhaps that's the plot's excuse, but it's really the ingenuity of the filmmakers. They know we want to see signs of a ""boo!"" moment upcoming. Therefore they keep the door open so that we may see the lights in the hallway turning on, and better still, a nondescript shadow passing against the lit side of the door. And for once, the hand-held camera gimmick comes to terrific effect, as it seems all-too-real.In spite of its uncanny ability to set teeth on edge, ""Paranormal Activity"" does not overplay its shock-and-suspense factor to the point of overkill. Rather, it plays its scare elements to just the right level and gives us proper stretches of relief in-between. What results is a set of chills and thrills that are giddily exciting, not depressing, not to be turned away from. ""Paranormal Activity"" is so enjoyably spooky that I am all the more disappointed that I passed on the chance to see it in a theater.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Not Bad, Under the Right Circumstance","Paranormal Activity, originally shot in 2006, didn't get a mainstream release until October of 2009 when Paramount Pictures bought the film. Paranormal Activity is an interesting movie, now although most people know the series today as the shaky, found footage film, that is about ghosts and demonic possessions, without ever actually showing it, the series started from humble beginnings. The first couple entries had to be demanded for, if Paranormal Activity wasn't playing at your local theatre you had to visit a website and ask for it to be played there, it was almost like a crowd funded movie before sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo were a thing. Made for around $15,000 and shot entirely in director's, Oren Peli's house, Paranormal Activity tells the story of Katie and Micah, a young couple living together who find themselves experiencing nightly disturbances for inexplicable reasons.One word that could sum not just this film, but the series as whole, is polarizing. As the first Paranormal Activity was growing in popularity, the film was heavily advertised as one of the scariest movies of all time, that in and of itself creates false pretence as it couldn't be farther from the truth. I do not consider myself much of a believer in the paranormal, so that may have tampered my experience with the film, nevertheless I can understand why someone would be frightened by this movie, however it is definitely not a horrific movie. It's totally easy to see why many people are so divided about this series, one side views the movies as a realistic depiction of paranormal occurrences and the other just sees a bunch of people shaking a camera around and slamming doors for an hour and a half. I consider pretty neutral with the issue, there are moments where certain events do get under my skin, however thinking back to it I realize how stupid it is.Now the first Paranormal Activity movie plays out almost like a psychological thriller, a lot is left up the imagination and you see the effect of the events taking a toll on the characters. There isn't a lot that happens in the movie, the viewer is basically confined to the house for the entire runtime and you do a lot of analyzing, asking yourself ""is that shadowy figure, or is it my imagination?"", ""did that lamp just move or am I going insane?"", and this is probably where my biggest issue arises from. I've seen Paranormal Activity a handful of times, and each viewing I keep a careful eye trying to see if I can pick up on any background things, however every time, I come up with nothing. For a movie that heavily relies on the viewer examining what's going on, there just isn't a lot there. You'd think that with a movie about a ghostly haunting that features these long drawn out scenes, the filmmakers would include subtle activity in the background to create even more of a frightening experience. Sadly they don't, and everything you get is at face value. Other problems that face the movie are, the acting, slow scenes, badly improvised dialogue, odd cuts, etc, most of these issues are constricted to the screenplay and low budget, so some of it is forgivable.Overall Paranormal Activity isn't a horrible film by any stretch of the imagination, it's easy to see both sides of the argument, however I lean more towards it being a pretty decent time. It's a watchable film that does have some good scenes of intensity, particularly the hallway scene where Micah uses baby powder, that was definitely an effective sequence that did get under my skin. As with most films it isn't perfect and it's not something I can recommend to everybody, you have to know what you're getting yourself into and although I was never frightened by it, I do enjoy watching this movie from time-to-time, so for the reason I'm giving Paranormal Activity a 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Terrifying until the last moments,"Few films are able to deliver raw terror as masterfully as Paranormal Activity.Filmed as a documentary-style narrative, the story tracks a demonic entity in the home a San Diego couple.Katie and Micah are being tormented by an evil supernatural presence. Micah's attempts to confront the demon are met with scorn.Armed with a 24-hour surveillance camera, hi-tech recording equipment & the best intentions, Micah and Katie are hopelessly out of their depth against this malevolent force.The presence is lurking in the shadows, waiting for its opportunity to possess the body of the woman it had marked out fifteen years ago, Katie.The tension ratchets up all the way and culminates in a gruesome finale – not for the feint of heart",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Boy oh boy I wish I'd never bothered,"This sat well with the style of Blair Witch as it was on par with the cinematic poor quality of said film.This 'film' relied heavily on the slammed door, 'boo' tactic to provide its horror and while a few fx made me smile a little there wasn't anything else of value to be had I'm afraid.Boring just doesn't sum up how hard it was to sit through this nonsense. In fact if I was pressed into a movie comparison I'd choose Blair Witch 2 because at least the first had some originality upon its emergence, this stanky mess is more a poorly related sequel than any original horror.The story would have been better served up as a conventional horror instead of trying to steal some reality TV steam (which has long since lost itself) through a poor poor poor reasoning as to why so many mundane activities were being filmed; bad idea that crippled this film.Save yourself the effort; rent it when it comes out, skip the first hour and scan through the 'scary' bits.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Charm of Paranormal Activity,"In its time, ""Paranormal Activity"" (2007) represented a refreshing breath of fresh air for films in the ""found footage"" subgenre, playing a crucial role in renewing the style. The film brought with it a feeling of genuine documentary, deceiving viewers who were not used to this type of narrative. It's essential for those who want to delve deeper into the subgenre, and the simplicity of the title is one of the main elements of its charm.The great magic of ""Paranormal Activity"" lies in its ability to instill curiosity and fear, making the public perceive the events as real, without resorting to the typical appealing devices of horror. Most of the supernatural events are presented concisely, making the experience incredibly tangible. However, the film also has moments of exaggeration that, at times, can diminish its impact.Although, nowadays, the film does not have the same impact as it did upon its release, it remains a well-planned work, enriched by documentary elements that give a touch of realism to the narrative. The actors manage to convey conviction in their roles, and the tension is maintained throughout several moments.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Good and genuine depiction of a demonic haunting,"There's been a lot of controversy about this movie, and there'll always be. People expecting to be entertained (read: scared) by a well developed plot and/or some gore effects will surely be disappointed. People expecting good character development and glamorous camera-work also should favor other movies above this one. If however you like to be thought-provoked and enjoy imaginative horror-flicks you can give this film a try, and probably like it as well. I went into this movie being for one a fan of the horror-genre and second having a great interest and knowledge about the paranormal. In that respect I can say that this is one of the few movies that delivers! If you ever wanted to know/experience what a haunting or poltergeist phenomena, if you will, are like, then this film gets it more right than many other (over the top) haunting/possession movies.You are thrown right into the film just after Micah bought himself a (quite huge) video-camera. This to document the strange occurrences happening in their house which focus themselves on Katie. There's no real character development, and that's a strong point of the film, because if you buy a camera to document some weird and frightening phenomena you don't really worry about developing a character, plot, looking good or making great dialog, let alone thinking someone would ever think about putting it on the big screen... You just want to film what's going on from a scientific or interest standpoint. That's just the way it is done in this film. You're presented a reel of film 'as is'. A documentation of all the happenings in the house.The clever use of mainly sound is what provokes a lot thought and wondering with the viewer. Not showing someone being slashed to pieces, but just a frightening noise which makes you as viewer think: ""What on earth was that?!"". This is on par with what a real haunting would play out like. Rarely you 'see' ghosts, but more often you hear or feel them while they play their fear-inducing tricks on you. Katie becoming more desperate and lost and Micah becoming more and more aggravated inducing the downward spiral of 'negative energy' which demons and ghost happily feed of, and therefore in turn become stronger and more malevolent.The more up-front theatrical 'Spielberg' ending of this movie is good and effective, plus it leaves things open for a sequel. Myself however, I liked the original ending a bit better because of the simple fact that it makes you wonder what happened downstairs and provokes more thoughts and pondering... The filmmakers really put their thoughts into this movie and did their homework regarding hauntings very well! Nevertheless I can see why there are people who feel this movie to be worthless. You can't please them all, and thank God for different tastes. However, people who want to take a tense emotional, and besides that genuine ride into hauntings and the paranormal should really not miss this one!

Can't quite capture 'Blair' magic,"Ten years ago a couple of guys with a camera and a handful of unknown actors turned the cinematic world on its collective ear. They produced a bizarre gem of a thriller for less than $25,000. Ignoring the somewhat questionable marketing of The Blair Witch Project, the cast and crew showed that a hand-held camera could serve as narrator and that CGI, monster costumes, blood, gore, etc., were not absolutely necessary to provoke fright.That technique in and of itself, however, is no guarantee of producing a legitimately scary film. Owen Peli has followed the same formula in the much-anticipated Paranormal Activity. It is a cross between The Haunting and The Blair Witch Project, we were told for months. Well  the plot, perhaps, is a combination of those two, plus Poltergeist and The Amityville Horror. The quality doesn't quite match most of those others.Overall, I think Paranormal Activity is OK. Rookies Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat turn in stellar work. However, I don't think PA captures the raw emotion and terror of Blair Witch. Chained to the camera-as-narrator device, meanwhile, it fails to evoke Haunting or Poltergeist-like chills, either.I almost wonder if a film ABOUT the couple trying to capture the occurrences on camera might not have worked better, such as in Poltergeist. In the Blair Witch type films, there is always an awkward moment where there is danger, yet someone takes time to grab the camera, ignoring the others' remonstrations to put the camera down. Of course, if they didn't grab it, there wouldn't be a film. Therefore the quest of 'realism' actually brings about a LOSS of realism. (Would it have cost much more money to have one stable camera recording the events as the couple makes their own video?) The film has its moments. It does gradually build up tension as events escalate and both endings are creepy. Still, there just isn't enough going on throughout the film to really keep an audience on the edge of its seat. Maybe if it were filmed in a more eerie, Gothic setting, where the house had some history, as well as the girl, it might hold tension better.The format works, as we have seen, but has its built-in flaws. Blair Witch never seemed to suffer for those flaws. That cannot truthfully be said of Paranormal Activity. Somehow PA misses matching Blair Witch's intensity and frightfulness by half a step.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Now vs. Then,"This movie is tough to review for me.

"One of the horror hits of the 2000s, but somewhat outdated","For its year of release, Paranormal Activity was an unexpected sleeper hit that took the world by surprise. One of the most popular movies of the year, it would go on to launch a hugely successful franchise of dubious quality. On the other hand, the original is at times considered a cult film thanks to its original approach to found-footage style. If Blair Witch Project is considered the father of the found-footage technique, then Paranormal Activity is to blame for the genre exploding into an incredible money-making industry.Focusing on the movie, it's a little hard to rate this film if you haven't seen it during its first glorious years, since as a horror fan, if you haven't seen a minimum of 10 found-footage movies by this point, you probably don't watch much. The genre is exploited, but it always maintains a certain charisma, mainly in its ease of production and the fact that they almost always generate huge amounts of money. Now, if you already have a lot of experience with the subgenre, then Paranormal Activity will feel a bit dull, bland and uninspired. On the other hand, old prejudices aside, the film has a creative style that gave it its position as one of the biggest hits of the decade. With a unique style that manages to transcribe a creepy thrill, as well as a simple but effective story, the film is a decent attempt to scare us. It's not entirely solid, as it has certain logic flaws, dull moments and some silly moments (as all horror movies do) but it will keep you entertained for an hour and a half and may scare you a little.Personally, I would recommend other films, but even so, its short length makes it a nice horror movie to kill time while eating some popcorn. Because that's mostly what this is, a fun horror popcorn flick.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""You promised me you wouldn't get a f#g Ouija board""","I'd call this a great slow burn thriller with scares in all the right places.

I feel scammed.,"Are you one of the thousands that were lured into watching this garbage because of internet and media hype? It all started on Facebook, it should end there too. Show your disappointment by becoming a fan of the ""Paranormal Activity was STUPID"" page on Facebook. Look it up.I won't spoil any of it, but I will use things that could've happened in this movie, to give you an idea of how crappy it was. - If this was ""based on a true story"", it would've been kinda scary. But it wasn't. - If the set up was a little bit shorter, and not over an hour long, it would've been less boring. - If I leave my laptop on the table and the next day it's on the couch, it would be scary. To watch that kind of stuff on the screen and watch people freak out about it... sorry, not scary at all. - If I hear a loud thud in my basement, it's freaky. If it happens on the screen, I would hope to see something in the basement, even if it's a faint reflection on a window. But no... there was nothing in the basement. - If I set up a trap for a ghost or a demon and the next day the trap proves that there was something there, it would be scary as hell. But if it happens on screen, it's just predictable. The jerky camera motion was supposed to make me feel like I was in the house. By the time anything interesting happened, I was too sick to care. Watching my cat twitch having a vivid dream with his eyes half open right now is a lot scarier than this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Well Done and Chilling,"There are horror films that are intense thrillers, and those that are intense chillers. This movie is the latter. At moments, I could literally feel my heartbeat quickening. Night scene by night scene the terror is turned up, keeping the movie dread inducing. I suppose almost everyone has a specific type of horror movie that rattles them. For me, it's movies about demonic hauntings. We watch this story unfold through the lens of a video camera, which makes the situation feel very real. The great performance by Katie Featherston also contributes to the authentic feeling of what we're witnessing. She's sweet and bouncy in the beginning and then shows her range as her character begins to emotionally break down. It's a well made movie that was made for just $15,000! It's one of the best movie investments ever made. It's no surprise that there are now 6 films in this franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
great movie!,"For a 5 thousand dollar horror movie this is pretty good. The acting was decent (it's not like their were much characters in it). The special effects were actually well done and the plot was nothing groundbreaking. It's pretty hard to scare me with horror movies because i'm a really big horror fan and i watch a lot of them, but this one actually scared me especially the ending. Now we go to the things I didn't like. To start of with: this movie is boring as hell sometimes. This movie also has only katie and micah as characters which makes you tired of them after a while (especially micah because i hated him in this movie like everyone did). I do think it's very clever that a film with a $5,000 budget could become an entire franchise of 7 films. I liked it so i give it 7,2/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A pleasant surprise!,"So after years of watching horror films and having the paranormal activity movies on my radar I've finally decided to give them a try.When watching Paranormal Activity I was at first skeptical about the whole found footage/held camera style of recording. However it works really well and the absolute nothingness that happens for 90% of the movie is more effective in building of tension and heightening the atmosphere then constant scares or ghostly activity would be.All in all, a great film with a tiny budget and brand new actors who made it into something great.8/10 and onto the next one!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I can believe he shot this at his house, he probably could not raise the money to afford to shoot it anywhere else.

Suspenseful but at times Annoying,"Was this movie supposed to be scary because I wasn't really scared at all? I am not a horror movie fan, get scared easily & usually avoid the genre because I don't find pleasure in being terrified which is why it took me this long to finally see this popular film. Perhaps it was the lack of visual effects/quick camera shots/scary music (horror movie standards) but it just didn't scare me. There was a lot of footsteps and banging, etc.. but I couldn't help but imagine the film crew making the sound effects on the stairs as the 2 lead characters lie in the bedroom. I don't know - the movie just wasn't terrifying whatsoever.What the movie lacked in fear, it made up for in suspense. It was the suspense that kept me on the edge of my seat watching and waiting to see what would happen next. There is absolutely no way to know the ending in advance, assuming one hasn't read spoilers, which makes it a lot better than clichéd movie endings that one can see coming a mile away. There is a nice buildup of action that finally leads to the ending climax.This movie was shot in a 1st person manner by the 2 lead characters - Katie and Micah. This means that all the footage in the film was created by the 2 leads which means that they end up filming anything and everything to give the audience a portrayal of their lives and a cohesive storyboard. Filming at night when the couple was asleep trying to catch paranormal activity on camera worked for me but the filming of anything and everything, no matter how random didn't. It was weird how they would randomly shoot their lives 24/7 as if they were on some reality show or shooting a documentary when in reality, they were trying to catch the entity mostly at night. Again, this was necessary to actually get the footage to create the film but from a logical standpoint, it didn't work. Why was the camera always on?As for the 2 main characters - great acting. I bought them as real people truly fearful of what was happening to them or really Katie, specifically, in the home. The movie is fictional but it was done in such a realistic manner that it would be believable that this was a movie about 2 real people and what happened to them.. although, again, it isn't - it's all fiction.I will say, however, that the first 15-20 minutes of the movie, before I got into the 2 characters and their dynamic, I found them and the movie to be extremely annoying and hard to sit through. This actually takes me back to the previous paragraph where I pointed out the random recordings of anything and everything - that is basically what the beginning of the film is ... it's the intro to the home, the layout of the home and the characters BUT at the same time why the heck is Micah, specifically, annoyingly recording everything? What's the point? He may like cameras but still...the camera was on 24/7 taping randomness for no reason especially at the start of the film. Again, yes, this was the only way to get footage for the movie BUT it was odd.6/10 Suspenseful but not really scary. It was good and original but nothing fantastic. I'd definitely consider this movie overrated based on the heaps of praise and the box office numbers but it isn't bad either - I'd recommend it because it IS good, it's just not great. I do plan on watching Paranormal Activity 2 so it was enjoyable enough for me to want more.Lastly, I saw the movie with the original ending which is apparently different from the theatrical version. After watching the theatrical version online afterwards, I'd recommend trying to see the version with the original ending, it was better.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Not great,but better than all other similarly themed films.","We've seen the formula before.""Footage"" taken with a home video camera that was found after the folks in the footage vanished.It's all too easy to compare this film to the likes of The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield because there's a similar pattern in all of them.Had this type of film not been done before,I would call this movie ""inventive"",but this can't be done since that credit goes to BWP.What I can do,since this is the latest in a string of similarly themed films,is call it the best of the lot.This movie did it's job in terms of giving me a good fright or two,and I would easily place it amongst other fright films for viewing on Halloween.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Awake,"Rented this movie last night, after hearing how scary it was for last year+. While not a namby pamby, it's only me and the pets here in my fairly secluded house in the woods, so watched it while still day out and for last part, with sound mostly off! I did not find any one part of the movie to particularly frightening, (maybe that darn pic up in the attic), it was more like a mounting dread. And to me, a connoisseur of horror movies since birth, that's the ticket to a good scary flick, the tense unknown. The anything-can-happen-at-any-moment wait-fest.You can keep your bloody saws and slasher demonic killers, I like the unseen ones that quietly go bump in the night.Altho not seemingly affected while watching, went to bed with light on and woke up at 3 a.m. absolutely terrified, waiting to hear that sound, any sound that would confirm the presence of the demon in my room.

Terrible Way to waste 10 dollars!!!,"I went to this movie expecting to be frightened but not scared by random things jumping out of nowhere. There was only one scene where this happened and it was basically near the end of the film.Also, this style of film has been done many times before. Even before the Blair witch project.Besides the one part of the film where anything exciting happens, this movie is boring and pure garbage. They could have saved an hour and half of my life and just put it up on youtube or something because that is what it deserves.All of that aside, I think this movie is inspiring. It will inspire many young people and old to go out and try and make better low budget films or even videos for that matter. That also reminds me, the writing was terrible as well...Have fun wasting 10 dollars or 20 if you get popcorn.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Didn't expect this movie to have mixed reviews,"I've known about this movie, but avoided watching it because I thought it would cause me to not sleep properly considering the way it was filmed.

I thought the couple were likable and felt they portrayed their characters well considering they don't have much acting experience.

No Sequels PLEASE,"All I can say is. check out this movie called Idiocracy. There's a part in the movie where it is explaining how the human race has become so retarded, a movie based purely on the showing of a bare ass, was the blockbuster of the year.This movie cleverly uses that exact metaphor.I have to say the film festival version at least had the better ending, while the released theatrical one was.....changed.This movie is what I call horror foreplay. THis moments when something occurs and IF they had done 'this' or 'that' could have made one heck of a scene. However, creating proverbial ""blue balls"", it never really makes any true home run hits when it comes to bringing a moment 'home'. Instead you find yourself with some, rather generic activity, strongly overshadowed by the MUCH exaggerated acting of the lead characters.I have to say, the main highlight of the movie had to be the leading actresses....assets. However any joy that can be obtained from such visualization is shortly ruined by a movie plagued by obnoxious characters, horrible scripting, and, for the love of god, the closer to the end it gets the more ludicrous it seems especially went eh 'real' stuff starts happening , you continue to question why are these people so nonchalant about it, however freaking out every night.The movie, which seems to be self ego'd for realism (the whole real TV thing going on) I have to say misses the ball, and strikes out hard.

Always wondered what goes bump in the night?,"Oren Peli's 'Paranormal Activity' isn't a brilliant film by any standards, nor is it groundbreaking, but considering it was made for only fifteen-thousand dollars and it has now grossed over thirty-five million dollars in the US before it has even been released worldwide definitely shows that it has appeal and the subject matter to tap into the general public's imagination – the issue of unseen paranormal activity that we have all apparently experienced at some time or another, but never been able to conclusively prove that it wasn't simply the ice-maker! While 'PA' also taps into the sub-conscious fear of that our homes are our fortresses, however in Peli's film, the home is anything, but a safe haven. Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat) are your typical young, suburban couple, however Katie believes that there is a paranormal presence praying on herself or the house in which she and her fiancée are staying, so Micah does what any young-buck would do in this technological age in which we live; we sets up a cheap video-camera in the bedroom and hopes to capture the ghoulish goings-on during the night – and it certainly isn't the dishwasher that's on the fritz! At around eighty-odd-minutes in length the film follows a simple three-part narrative structure. The first third of the film is focused around introducing Micah and Katie to the audience as they discuss what could be going bump in the night and their general lives, work, friends, etc. We also see the conflict in personalities from the beginning as well, as Micah is somewhat of a sceptic, he is always making fun of Katie and the presence which is clearly taking a toll on her life, while Katie outwardly accepts that there is some form of paranormal activity around her or her house and wishes to get rid, or banish it as soon as possible. From there on as each night passes, the second part of the structure focuses around Micah and the various small unexplained noises and movements that were captured on camera, slowly dispelling his scepticism and fuelling Katie's increasing paranoia, before the final third of the film completely puts to rest any scepticism Micah has and sends Katie into a detrimental spiral of fear and instability, concluding the film with a brilliantly terrifying bang! The use of Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat work perfectly, as the unknown, inexperienced actors that provide somewhat of a refreshing realistic quality to the low-budget flick. While the use of on and off-screen diegetic sound and movement, especially while the characters are sleeping, creates the perfect atmosphere for the unexplained goings-on in the suburban homestead. We can see everything that is happening, every small sound, or every slight movement, however while the audience can rest behind the protection of the movie screen, there is no such barrier for Katie and Micah which constantly raises and the suspense, tension and fear-factor throughout the film. Peli and his small crew, show how much you can simply evolve forth the narrative from such minimal and surprisingly fear-inducing events, such as slamming doors shut and banging loudly on various walls.'Paranormal Activity' is one of those rare films that will still stay with you hours after you have already left the cinema. It sets up the bases – character development, captured unexplained activity, and the history of said such activity – before finally winding back the bat and knocking the audience of the park with a well-shot, emphatic and truly frightening ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not Brilliant But Still Enjoyably Creepy,"Paranormal Activity is centered around a rather likable couple - Katie & Micah - who have been experiencing some strange happenings in their home. Micah decides to try and document the various goings on, and as time goes on the friction between Katie & Micah gradually increases as do the various incidents until they all reach their final crescendo.Now, films that are shot in POV/first person perspective I usually enjoy as they have a way of drawing you in to what is actually happening because it's like you are seeing it through the eyes of someone else; as if you are right there yourself, and Paranormal Activity does this pretty well. It stays realistic to what can actually be someone's POV instead of taking it to stupid & ridiculous angles like what happened in My Little Eye.The scares that happen in Paranormal Activity are good, and they obviously get more intense & frequent as the film goes on, but to be honest it does get a wee bit boring during some of the more ""relaxed"" moments. In saying that, however, it is a fine line for getting it right; if there are too many scares it can be overkill but if there are too few then it can get boring. Thankfully, though, Paranormal Activity is kept interesting enough for you to keep you watching.Just as a quick mention, the characters of Katie & Micah are pretty likable as I mentioned earlier, but there are occasions where they can get a wee bit annoying. For instance, Micah with his occasional macho ""I'll fix everything"" attitude, and Katie's woman-type attitude where no matter what Micah does or suggest it's always wrong. In saying that, though, I guess that describes practically every couple in the real world! So, just to end, while Paranormal Activity is nowhere near the excellence of films like The Blair Witch Project or Sinister it's still worth a watch and is a pretty decent film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Don't waste your time and money on this film!,"This film is so bad my girlfriend and I walked out of the cinema in disgust. It was like watching Big Brother when they are all in bed. The actors spent so much time in bed, with us watching them, that it was making my girlfriend want to go to bed to sleep herself.We stayed until approximately 15 minutes from the end, which I have been told was the BEST bit. Well, having to sit through 1 hours 15 minutes of mind numbing boredom to get 15 minutes of excitement is pathetic, and not worth cinema costs. We would rather have watched 1 hours 30 minutes of the crowd footage shown on the movie trailer as that was more entertaining.We will probably watch the film at some point when Sky show it and when we have had enough of watching paint dry! Actually my girlfriend suggested we might film paint drying and bring it out next year at the cinema if thats all it takes to make a hundred million pounds.

I am a huge horror buff, and I have never seen a film that scared me as much as this one. I think, in part, because it seems so real. The actors do a good job of making it seem like a true documentary. I never once noticed any bad acting or corny cliché's in this movie at all. I had a good time and am still jumpy an hour later. I would give this film 100 stars if I could, but I'm only allowed 10. Please go watch it. You won't regret that you did.

"Draws on innate human terrors, but falls short","When I first heard, by some accounts, that this was as scary or scarier than the Exorcist, I was immediately skeptical. To a degree, I hoped I was wrong, but I was not.The film is shot in mockumentary style, which is a device used to boost the ""scare factor."" People are more likely to be frightened if horrific events are caught on home video. There are certainly moments that make you sit on the edge of your seat, but the actual pop-out moments are a little bit disappointing and anticlimactic.Each night the couple films is supposed to get more and more frightening, which works to a degree, but that makes much of the film drawn out. The structure is lacking to a degree and parts are considerably predictable. The most frightening moments take place near the end of the movie.The couple's experiences with the demon are not really consistent with what is conventionally known about demons, which raises a few eyebrows.Overall, the movie does a good job of scaring most people (a girl in my theater even broke down crying afterwards) and does elicit a high suspense level, but it is by no means a great movie. The Exorcist does a better job at character development, conflict, and plot structure, which all help to boost the terror factor.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Nice found footage horror film,"The plot of the movie was basic, but I decided to watch the movie because it's very popular. The storyline was average, nothing wow.

There were many jumpscares and intense scenes (especially, the ones that took place at the night time). The acting was really good, very realistic.

Scariest film ever made,"Begins light and simple, unique style of filming as its from point of view. Katie and Micah get on with their normal lives with minimal problems.

Real life reactions and realistic acting help the suspense in each and every scene grow creepier and bone chilling.

Less is more for the HORROR,"A simple and extremely low budgeted film that will raise the hairs on the back of your neck. Shot with nothing less than a panoramic camcorder we take a voyeuristic ride into the spirited paranormal.A couple are terrorized by an unseen force. First, they try to film it - then they fight to stay alive.The one thing that stands out to me is over and over again they keep doing the same thing, waiting way to long to call ANY other demonologist or exorcist. I was tremendously surprised the film had solid editing and the two actors were amazingly realistic in their approach.Each time the film transitions from day to night the footage switches, not being hand held but to stationary on tripod, but to the same static bedroom shot. Because the camera never moves, you're encouraged to scrutinize every single shadow. Your eyes will pick up every sense of that room. When your senses are heightened to that extent, any sudden moves deliver twice the force.By any means this is not an OSCAR film but in sequence that relishes the mind and senses of horror. Next time you hear something go bump in the night, there's a chance - just a chance - that thoughts will turn to that static bedroom... and a hint of something moving. I give it a solid 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The unique camera angles, the moving of the camera, the constant placement, it's all wonderful.

Nothing happens, the characters are utterly annoying, I'm not sure about the acting, the situations aren't very realistic (the characters never turn the lights on after the mysterious event, but the entity does, though not all of them). In a way, I'm being unfair. It's an amateur movie, and this is how it should be treated, I guess. But it's been very well marketed by smart people who've understood they could make a huge bang for the buck by creating some buzz around it. And it's worked.

""Nothing's happening for 70 minutes, then it ends"". But that honestly didn't apply to that film at all if you actually watched it. But PA kind of feels like that could apply. I won't say that it's boring, but it's slower-paced and more suspenseful. Is that a bad thing? Not necessarily. And being the first in the franchise and establishing the style, it can absolutely get away with it. But there just felt like there was more that they could have done with it. Found footage is no longer a novel concept like it was when Blair Witch came out. And even at that, Blair Witch just had more rounding out the story.But where does it rank it for replay value? PA was good for what it was, and if you like that slower, creeping suspense, you might enjoy it. But I feel that it held back on its potential. What kept it going that first time is the mystery. You just gotta see what the next scare is going to be, the next confusing plot point that will shake the main characters. After you've seen it, I just don't know that it holds up as something that I would come back to a lot. I liked the pacing and story of the next two PA films better, and just feel that they stand on their own in that regard.Although I do want to say that the most enjoyable part of this film is Katie Featherstone's acting and characterization. This movie did well with its characters, and Katie is a great character, superbly acted. Had a lesser job been done, this just wouldn't have been any good.If you haven't seen it, I'd generally recommend it. I'd probably give it a 6.5 if IMDB allowed .5 increments. It's good, but a little overhyped for what we got.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Your Imagination Will Run Wild. (but not in a fun way!),"ALL of the reviews on here are phenomenal and I agree with them 100%! This movie was intensely terrifying! I can't say that I am one to watch and enjoy scary movies; in fact, I had ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE was this movie was about and I do believe that my boyfriend partly ""tricked"" me into seeing it because he didn't tell me what it was really about. I didn't exactly inquired either - but ""paranormal"" made me think of E.T and alien stuff. So that I can handle. MUCH BETTER THAN THIS.I was on the edge of my seat as things progressed. The credibility was amazing, its craft was great - cliché just in the fact that you have a typical stubborn GUY and a scared GIRL (legit, since she had dealt with this kind of ""stuff"" before) But that's part of the overall effect. Her ""transformation"" is awesome, and she really is a great (natural) actress.It's been a week almost and I still have trouble sleeping. I'm usually never the one to wake up during the night. But now, if I do, forget it. I can't get back to sleep. It's just the type of movie that messes with your head in such a way. I loved the fact that even KNOWING that it was all left to my very own imagination isn't helping, ha ha - I was still scared, although I am telling myself to consciously not be! It takes over your whole being - without any violent, bloody, gory scenes. We are just conditioned to believe that in middle/upper-class suburbia, to a twenty-something year old couple - these kind of things are just NOT supposed to happen. It hits close to home. The shock value is tied in with its environment and its unbelievable relatedness.So, there! I am a non horror/scary movie lover, yet I am recommending this to everyone! You will love if that much more if you are into scary movies and you will have a better understanding and appreciation for them if you aren't.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Expected a lot, got very little.","OK so Paranormal Activity....I did go in expecting a lot and what I got was very little, granted there was some genuine moments of tension and the actress playing katie put in a really good performance however the consistent douchebaggery of micha took away a sense of realism from the couple. A lot of the ideas were recycled and frankly not scary at all, the ending was one of two obvious choices and the whole premise of the film is based on cheap tricks which are ground out at such a static pace that the film never really picks up any momentum.Where the film lacks in visual splendor it compensates in its audio work some of the sound used creates a real sense of tension and triggers of more powerful imagery in the viewers mind than what the filmmaker could throw up on screen. However a lot of the incidents in the night recordings featured in the film could have been merged together cutting a good 15 minutes of the film which would have lessened or even completely taken out the rather stale periods during its 86 minute run time, granted this would have made it a much shorter film but it would also make it much tighter.Overall a good principle idea ruined by pretty poor execution.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This is supposed to be terrifying?,"After all the hype about this movie, I thought it was worth the $1 rental at Redbox. Boy, was I wrong! I was concerned about the ""film"" being like Blair Witch, Quarantine and Cloverfield. However, I was wrong again, IT'S MUCH WORSE! Statements like, ""You'll never be able to sleep after seeing this"", are a tremendous joke. I almost fell asleep trying to watch the ""movie"". There's an hour and a half I should have spent doing something better, like watching paint dry. I could easily pick a hundred horror or suspense films, which are much more terrifying. Other than a slight scare (to those weak of heart maybe) at the end, this was a real snooze-fest! Everyone raving over this ""film"" only confirms what I've known for a long time. People have become sheep, zombies and otherwise followers. If enough of your peers say you'll like something, then by damned, you'll like it or be an outcast. These would be the same morons that think RAP is music, that reality TV is entertainment and that wrestling isn't staged. I apologize to anyone too young to recall the story of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", but it describes the majority of people nowadays to a tee.

One of the worst films I have ever seen in my life!!,"I am not a horror film fan as I get really freaked out, but I was persuaded to watch this film with my boyfriend (who unfortunately also thought the movie was abominable). The film wasn't scary in the slightest (and this is coming from a person who does get scared by horror films), it actually got to the point where I wanted to be scared as it was such an uneventful film. There were about 5 attempts in the film spread out over 1 and a half hours that tried to make you jump, sadly they didn't.

A horror film done RIGHT.,"I saw this film earlier today, and I just want to start by saying that I also watched Haunting in Connecticut right afterwards; I wanted to see it and I had seen the two movies compared. The thing I noticed is mostly only people that disliked Paranormal Activity compared the two, calling Haunting scarier. Apparently those people don't know what makes true elements of horror. It isn't a bunch of unrealistic and quite frankly senseless plot lines and effects; it's SUSPENSE.This movie builds up like none I have ever seen. It starts VERY subtle, but it gains momentum. People calling this film boring must simply be void of senses in favor of mindless horror films with special effects. The name of the game here is REALISM. The acting is excellent; you really get a feeling that this is actually happening to them.The movie is shot as a mockumentary, and that's what makes it effective. Many things in this movie probably wouldn't be scary on a high budget film camera, but since it is real, even the most subtle thing is terrifying. The final 20 minutes of this film are beyond disturbing. It builds upon terror based on realism and as such is the ONLY horror film to stay with me after viewing besides Halloween, and that is one of the most effective horror films ever made. I'm not trying to compare the two as the film has its quirks (a few parts are really cheesy), but it does the job. The suspense grips you each night these two go to sleep, and by the next night you wonder if you can handle any more of what you are seeing. And the beauty is that that DON'T see very much; much is left to the imagination. And THAT, ladies and gentleman, is what a good horror film does. Again, it has that Halloween-esquire technique in terms of suspense and realism that keeps you scared after you watch it.Ignore the haters; they simply do not understand that it's a combination of SUSPENSE and realism and/or abstract visuals that are actually psychological. You won't get that from the lowly Haunting in Connecticut, which is simply not in the same LEAGUE as Paranormal Activity.This may sound strange, but I LOVE getting scared out of my wits because scaring me is a challenge. So, if you want to be disturbed, creeped out and afraid of the dark, watch this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It feels like it's trying too hard to be scary,"Paranormal Activity definitely has a creepy feel, but at times it feels like it's trying too hard to be scary.

Worth a watch, but don't expect Blair Witch quality.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Fills you with a sense of dread and helplessness,Regardless of it not being action packed it's extremely good at building tension and a sense of dread throughout.

so this is where it all began,"this is where the found footage genre really took off. as a movie, it's absolute crap. however, as a marketing gimmick, it's brilliant. How people are so gullible to believe it's real is beyond me, however my hats of to the filmmakers for taking advantage of the audience in a good way. the original is still the best, so if you are curious about this series, this is the film to check out first. the rest are just more of the same, without the novelty factor. just know that this isn't a film in the traditional sense, there is no cinematography, no actors giving any performance, it's more of a performance piece, a film social experiment if you will.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The 2nd best movie in the Franchise.,"One of those pictures where I am sorely tempted to say, just skip it and watch the sequel. You miss out on a couple of allusions but this movie is sort of the failed first attempt.I say ""failure"", it's not half bad. It begins with that terrible trope of bringing in the professional and then proceeds to have characters flat out ignore their council.But it's upfront about how its approach to horror (a dated one) so I don't want to be too hard on it.It's a slow burn (good), the cinematography is candid by necessity (sweet) and it doesn't abuse music (fantastic).It's a leisurely ride to an adequate destination but I feel those foot prints were a bad choice.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
o_o,"Paranormal activity is not one of those typical horror movies that give you periodic jolts but instead one that keeps you rooted to the spot with your heart clenched. It is only the grasp that tightens when you aren't fully prepared, and loosens when you're at your breaking point, just so that you can sit through it without having a heart attack.While it awakens memories of another horror movie, it can be interpreted as trying to glimmer in the shadow of ""The Blair Witch Project"". It was the director's intentions. Nevertheless, it is a shadow that exceedingly towers and then insolently looks down. For its meager budget of $15,000, I personally am glad that it grossed over $100,000,000 at the box office.Straightforward as it may be, its principal characters are played so effortlessly in the most naturalistic way, subsequently making them comprehensible. Micah and Katie, despite their idiosyncrasies, are both pleasant, likable people. Katie's enthusiasm from the day she moves into her boyfriend, Micah's house, gradually dies down like the hope of a cynic fading away with time. The movie keeps getting more and more ""freaky"", a term used endlessly to describe any kind of paranormal activity that occurs in the ""haunted"" house. Without exempting it of its nobility, there is one trivial question I'd like to ask. Why doesn't Katie move over to the other side of the bed? Wouldn't it keep her at a safer distance from the demon? Isn't Micah the adventurous daredevil? I cease to believe that it was a deliberate goof.This movie isn't just a must watch but must be watched alone with headphones in a dark room. But beware, once you've finished watching it, you're going to be stared at by every inanimate object from every corner in the room including the corners themselves. No, it isn't just me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Paradoxical paranormal chiller,"Paranormal Activity (PA) is a rare anomaly, the extremely small budget indie flick (15,000$, the price of a car) filmed in one week with one hand-held camera and unknown actors that ends up being very popular. Many will compare it to the 1999's Blair Witch Project, which is not a bad comparison but it's different in the fact it takes place in one location (a suburban home) and that I found it much better and especially scarier. I've seen lots of horror movies and I've grown rather blasé and hard to please. PA actually gave me chills and I don't think it was because of the air conditioning. It slowly instilled dread and shocked me a few times. The story alternates between daytime sequences in the house and nighttime sequences with one night-vision equipped camera stuck in the corner of the bedroom. I quite suspect many people will find the day sections boring and banal but without them the night sections wouldn't be so suspenseful. It's the art of creating tension, releasing it and recreating it again. If you have constant tension, then people get used to it and it's not as effective.So although it starts rather tame with nothing or little happening, I was soon dreading the nights and hoping for them to end quickly. The day-night routine cycle is one of the secrets why PA is so effective as well as the unnerving low-frequency bass noise used sparingly instead of a standard soundtrack. This is not special-effects oriented nor does it have professional cinematography. It looks amateurish and intentionally so. It relies on the Hitchcock philosophy that it's scarier to hear, glimpse and imagine than to see everything. I think it also works because most of the eerie stuff could easily happen in our homes. It's those strengths that will appear as weaknesses to jaded audiences. We can also expect the usual backlash seen with highly hyped surprise hits. You go in expecting one of the scariest movies of all time and you prepare yourself unconsciously for this so in the end you can brag that it wasn't that scary.Fright is subjective. For what it's worth, I'm not easily scared but I have no choice but to admit I became emotionally involved. If you're interested in seeing PA, then try to go in open-minded and preferably with someone else in a crowded theater. You run the high risk of having to deal with noisy undisciplined groups of teens (as I did) but hopefully the rest of the public will eventually placate them or the scariness eventually will. Rarely have I seen a movie-going public being so scared and tense, and not because of gore (none here). Seeing this in a crowd is a great experience if you're lucky enough but on the other hand, I can see PA being quite effective late at night at home with a significant other with the added benefit of not having the first part of the movie ruined by hecklers. Actually, although I rate this movie highly, I'm not sure I should recommend it because it's insidious. It does tend to get under your skin, linger in your thoughts afterwards, particularly before you sleep perhaps provoking insomnia and nightmares and it could make certain normal house occurrences much creepier. Avoid this film if you live alone and in a creaky/drafty home.Rating: 9 out of 10P.S.: I quite suspect this would be a great date movie. It would favor closeness during the show and your date (or yourself) might not want to sleep alone afterwards. ;-)",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Demon in the House,"The style of execution of 'Paranormal Activity' immediately reminds the viewer of 'The Blair Witch Project'. While this movie doesn't exactly match up to 'Blair Witch', it does come pretty close. Unlike 'Paranormal Activity', 'The Blair Witch Project' leaves a lot open to suggestion. Here the viewer already knows about the presence of some kind of demon. Additionally, while the original ending of 'Paranormal Activity' is more suspenseful, I preferred the alternative ending due to the high chill factor. As a stand alone movie, it does work very well in creating a creepy and claustrophobic atmosphere and the jump moments are well timed. The use of a hand-held camera adds to the eeriness of the setup. The special effects are brilliant. Oren Peli has done quite a good job as director and his actress Katie Featherston is impressive. I wasn't around during the hype surrounding 'Paranormal Activity'. I only heard but a few positive things regarding the film and that it was compared to 'Blair Witch' but overall I quite enjoyed it mostly because it succeeds in creating a chilling intense atmosphere.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Paranormal Inactivity !,"If you find the sight of grass growing freighting, do not watch this movie alone ! However, if you’re like the rest of humanity you’ll find this movie miles beyond boring. In fact, if this movie was available a few years ago I am sure the CIA would have considered it an extreme torture technique and suitable for use at all our fine concentration camps. I can imagine a press conference featuring the former vice president voicing his insistence that he did not order captured terrorist suspects be subjected to this film.The acting was amateurish, the dialogue childish, the production values nonexistent. The chubby female lead however was quite effective in her role as a nagging, annoying young women who seemed to be caught in a perpetual menstrual cycle. I found myself rooting for the paranormal presence, creature, whatever it was to finally seize her up and gag her mouth.

"Not as great as REC, but good enough!","To put myself on an objective plane before writing this review, I should admit that I consider 2007 Spanish zombie thriller Rec to be THE scariest movie I have ever seen. Now, contrary to whatever my co-watcher says, (who reportedly still has nightmares about a teenage Linda Blair scaring the whole world in 'The Exorcist') Rec scored over all other films thanks to its pseudo-original footage format, where a camera crew gets stuck in a zombie-infested Barcelona apartment building.Oran Peli's Paranormal activity, however, has a different premise; but here again, the camera is operated by a protagonist: an over- enthusiastic man (Micah Sloat) who is interested to find out the truth after a host of spooky occurrences in his house, that are somehow connected with his girlfriend's (Katie Featherston) past.Screened for the first time in late-2007 during the Screamfest Horror Film Festival, it took two years for the film to find a proper distributor. After a slew of incidents that included proposals to re- shoot and even a hassled Steven Spielberg claiming that the DVD of the movie was 'haunted' (but he ended up liking the movie too), DreamWorks and Paramount finally released the film, 11 years after the first horror pseudo-documentary film of its kind, 'The Blair Witch Project' hit screens.Even though my co-watcher decides to go to sleep each time I begin one of my history lessons, cinema-goers have been tastefully acquainted with this 'style' of film-making in 1998, thanks to 'The Blair Witch Project'; the success of which, however, did not generate a string of below-average films of the type (Thank heavens!). Rec came in 2007, its not-so-good Hollywood remake 'Quarantine' came a year later and in 2008 itself, a similarly shot 'Eco-terror' film (""What's that?"" my co- watcher asks. ""Films like Godzilla"", I reply) 'Cloverfield' took home a fair amount of dough.So is Paranormal Activity special, or different, or better than its predecessors? To put it fairly, it is a heck of a scary film. The amateur footage looks amateurish enough to make you believe as if you are really watching 'the real deal'. The slow (albeit, steady) curve of the story has everything from low-key titillating shock-effects like small sound distractions whenever 'the demon' is around; to nerve- wracking sequences where doors are closed with heavy bangs and protagonists are dragged away by a scary and invisible force. The acting is effectively natural, Katie is easy on the eye, Micah is effortless; the fact that Katie is called Katie and Micah is called Micah within the film boosts the authenticity factor as well.The real kicker is perhaps the ending which has the potential of a fairly harsh kick in the 'Courage Guts' of the more 'gallant' viewers (Like 'me'). But on a totally personal level, the original 2007 ending was much more 'complete' than the new one. (""We all know Hollywood. The new ending nearly guarantees a sequel."" my co-watcher explains. And I guess she is right. Paramount has already made public their plans for a sequel)So Oran Peli does strike gold in his first directorial venture. And maybe its not as good as the 'sleekly planned' and 'budgeted' Rec (Let me see Michael Bay or Peter Jackson pull off a movie like this with 15000 bucks!), but its sure to go down in the history of Horror as a really good 'Screamfest'. After all, a movie which boasts the presence of a talented screamer (Katie was good!), it's only fair that the movie gets a fair share of scared screamers from the audience as well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Things that go bump in the night,"This was a film that cost practically nothing to produce yet offered up a host of scary moments and a plot that kept the viewer on the edge of their seats right up to the wild ending. Kudos to the writers and producers who made this film. They struck gold and I'm sure they already have their next project funded and in the works.This type of movie is similar to ""The Blair Witch Project"" in that it's a documentary with the main characters filming themselves while attempting to prove the existence of paranormal activity in their house. Katie has been haunted most of her life by a ghost or demon, and the ghost follows her regardless of where she lives. Now the ghost resides in the home of her boyfriend Micah, with whom she now lives. Micah is initially skeptical but then comes to see that the ghost is a real presence. He isn't intimidated, but wants to show the ghost ""who's the boss"". A big mistake on Micah's part, as things later prove.This was a very good movie and as horror movies go, this is one of the more clever ones I've seen. There's not the blood & gore of the typical horror movies, but a very subtle type of tension in the development of the plot. The tension builds throughout and peaks at the films ending.The release of this film during the Halloween season was a smart move. I'm sure it will do fabulously well, as word of mouth gets around. I definitely recommend this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Almost a hit,"Many factors contributed to the overwhelming success of Blair Witch including marketing, writing, directing and the most crucial aspect, acting. Unfortunately the acting here is sub-par which isn't to say that the leads didn't do their jobs well but on more than one occasion, it felt like a college drama ad-lib class and having just one of those moments, let alone several, destroys any illusion that this is a real documentary. In real life, people talk over each other as they scream and argue. They do not wait for someone to finish speaking. Blair Witch knew and hit this aspect on the mark.Another real deal breaker was just the immaturity of the lead characters, not to mention any real character development. I honestly got fed up with them both for being both stupid and passive and began rooting for the ghost about halfway through the film. The fact is: no one likes a weak main character in a horror film. The only thing they are good for is fodder for the baddies.Finally, the pacing of the film was really poor. Sporadic moments of terror and fright that never really felt like anything was building up, especially with so much downtime and extraneous exposition in between the scares.All in all, a decently creepy low budget film with good effects but substandard writing and unsympathetic, childish characters.

Keeps you up at night.,"Alrighty, let's start things off by saying I'm not an emotional type, and scary movies are my favorite genre. That being said, I don't get scared particularly easily.

Did some mentally impaired child just fall down the stairs in the middle of the night?"" But, as silly as these sounds are, all in all it leads up to quite the scary ending.

Rent it definitely, watch it at midnight with all the lights off and you'll get the full effect when you try to sleep at night. However, I think constructive criticism will get the producers on the right track and I HIGHLY recommend seeing the second movie, which is supposed to be released this coming October 2010.

Objectively...,"Cons: - a lot about it has been borrowed from other films (from specific scenes to ideas globally, to camera angles...) - takes a bit of a while to get into the flow - seems just a tad bit slow in parts - needs to be taken seriously and to be gotten into to avoid boredom, staleness and feeling like it's repetitive images and recurring footage and documentary/study oriented. So requires attention and playing along, explaining the disgruntled crowd and their criticism.Pros: - well written - not a typical idea for the presence, a rather original take on the cause of the said paranormal activity - a frightening cause - well acted, believable in deed - overall buildup on the entire picture and ending climax really quite chilling - good management of the sound - unknown well managed, well interpreted, great concealed/displayed ratio.All in all: could have been scarier.

Worst Horror Movie I have ever seen -- not worthy of film school.,"Okay, well, you don't have to worry that I'm going to spoil this one for you. Almost nothing happens, so there's nothing to spoil. Truly, this is the worst horror movie I have ever seen which is saying a lot. The pseudo cinema-verite style -- so effective in Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield -- only underscores the lack of any real plot or believable leads. The schoolteacher here behaves like a stereotypical schoolteacher, the day trader like a day trader, right to the end -- nothing normal or paranormal puts some flesh on their shallow characterizations. Even the supposed entity was a cipher -- no face, no form, no motivation.

Boring as hell,"Yesterday we (2 friends of mine) saw Paranormal Activity in our small town Austrian cinema. After all this hype that came across the big one and the phenomenal box office success in the States expectations were running high to see the next good example in fright film format. I have to say that our small group consisted of hardcore horror fans. We have seen them all and were looking forward to be scared out of our pants. Instead we were bored out of our pants. So my advice is: Watch the film ONLY, when you are not a horror film fan. Some guys thought that they could do the Blair Witch and failed miserably in that effort. Cheap thrills, a very slow and uninteresting first half of the film sent me nearly of to dreamland (I was very exhausted, because I hadn't slept much in the last few days) and when the film started to become interesting it was over.

Still effective at some parts and in some ways.,"Just like ""The Blair With Project"" this movie its idea is better than the actual execution. Also the entire marketing campaign behind it was better and more effective than the actual movie, just like was the case with ""The Blair With Project"", which is the reason why the movie doesn't really lives up to its hype but you at least still can call it original and effective in some parts.Yes, in this age of modern horror this movie does definitely feel like a breath of fresh air. You could say that his movie is more old school horror and doesn't depend so much on its writing but more on its atmosphere and build up. But this only works for so long. You could say that the movie is being a bit of a lackluster as well, since you are constantly waiting for something to happen or develop. But as strange as it may sound, that was actually what I liked about this movie.It kept you guessing and constantly waiting. The movie didn't provide much information and it at its beginning does a good job at setting up the right required tension and mystery. It constantly makes you aware and ensures that you keep paying attention to the screen, knowing that something might happen, that you might miss when you blink. The movie at that point only consists out of the occasional weird sound, or a sudden falling object. That's old school film-making in its very essence and at its very best. But the movie is not consistent with that unfortunately. I actually began to dislike the movie when suddenly more and more paranormal activity start to happen, which was just too much to really take serious. The movie actually became sort of ridicules, which also made all of the events suddenly terribly ineffective and just not scary at all. This gets increasingly worse when the movie is heading toward its end.It also doesn't help much that the actors aren't much good. The movie really suffers from that. Because this is an extremely low-budget movie it only has inexperienced actors in it who don't express their emotions and fears very convincingly. The movie pretends like it consists entirely out of found footage (again, just like ""The Blair With Project"") but even those who are ignorant enough to believe this at first will soon realize it's all 'fake' once they see the actors try to act in this movie. Seriously, with some professional actors instead of amateurs this movie could had been still about ten times as effective to watch.Still I'm willing to give this movie plenty of credit, not just for what it achieved globally at the box offices but also for what it is as a movie. It's a movie with a shoe-string budget but it came up with a very creative idea that cost very little money and actually let its low-budget work for the movie and its concept. It also shows that you don't need lots of money to successfully create a horror atmosphere and can also manage without having to fall back on all sort of gore or effects.It's also a movie made with the viewpoint of only just one camera and only has an handful of characters in it, at just one location. This is not the easiest way of film-making but they did a very good job with this all. So I still have lots of respect for Oren Peli for making this movie but that all still doesn't make this movie a great one.I am still sure that with the right crowd and under the right circumstances this can still be a good scary movie to watch.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Such a Shame....,"This was originally an independent film that Paramount bought out. Even though Paramount bought it out, they kept the movie exactly the same. After finally being able to find a theater that wasn't sold out I prepared myself to have the hell scared out of me due to the media hyping up the movie so much. I watched trailers and people's recorded reactions to the movie and it seemed absolutely terrifying. Yay for me! Or so I thought.The movie was a total of 99 minutes long and the break down was this: 90 minutes of the couple sleeping 7 minutes of the couple arguing 2 minutes of ""action""The style in which the movie was filmed was unique and actually very well done and helped the audience feel as though they were there with the couple in the movie. The couple in the movie were the ones who actually filmed it and it gave such a realistic feeling to it. You saw everything they saw and didn't go out of their way to hide the camera in view of the mirrors to add to the realism. The special effects, even though there wasn't many, were very believable and nothing was computer generated. It used a very well done stop motion for majority of the ""action"" scenes. The acting wasn't bad at all considering this was an indie film.Beyond what I said in the above paragraph, this movie had nothing else to offer. There was a very underdeveloped plot to the point where Napoleon Dynamite looked like it had a more developed plot. The storyline was extremely predictable which isn't always what makes a movie bad but since this movie was so poorly developed it was one of the reasons why it failed to be a good movie. There was a complete lack of action scenes and I'm not complaining about the pretty much zero blood and gore content. You find more blood and action in your daily soap operas/stories. The language was mild so it is beyond me how this received a ""R"" rating. There were no scenes that made you jump at all and this isn't just from my opinion and experience. My best friend who is scared of her own shadow didn't even jump or find anything scary about this movie. Unless you are scared of breathing, then you won't be scared of this movie.This movie had so much potential and the only horror that I found in it was that it lacked so much for all the hype it got. Had this movie been developed more plot wise and action scene wise this could have been an amazing movie.My Rating: 2 out of 10",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good payoff ... but at what cost?,"The last ten minutes of this movie may be the creepiest ten minutes of any movie in at least two decades. That being said, ten minutes doesn't make a 99 minute movie a good film. The story was predictable and poorly told, and the first hour and twenty minutes were repetitive and truly boring. I read somewhere that people were walking out of the film because it was so scary, but that's not the case at all. People walked out of the film because it takes much too long to provide any sort of entertainment. I feel sorry for the people who lasted an hour and left, only to miss a very good payoff. I can't recommend spending the $10-$15 to see this film, but once you've sat through that first excruciatingly boring hour, you really need to stay and see the payoff.I wish the filmmakers would have found a writer who could have build a story and the characters so that the payoff left the audience feeling like they saw a great film, rather than feeling like ""it's about time"". Sure, if you are one to be scared by films, the ending will creep you out. But if you are looking for a lasting horror experience coming from a well made and scary 99 minute horror film, you will be disappointed. In my opinion, the ending was good enough to make me glad I didn't leave, but overall I wish I had seen something else. The sum of the experience is negative. This was a missed opportunity.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good movie following Blair Witch genre,"I really did not have great expectations from the movie. Lot of people I know had dismissed it by saying that they got bored in the middle of it. But, to my surprise the movie (though not a classic) is quite interesting and creepy in its own way. Its the hand held camera experience and not using CGI effects gave the audience a feel of realism. Also, fairly good work from the 2 main characters of the movie though the guy's act could have been a little better.It also had a few shocking moments for people who like 'jump from the seat' moments. Plus, the runtime was not too long which is good for a movie of such kind.But, I will recommend this movie for people who are fans of 'Blair Witch Project' genre and not for people who are more fond of mainstream horror flicks.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It's not very scary!,"Don't trust the hype. I was really scared to watch this movie, my husband bought the tickets and I was still hesitant to sit through this movie and that's because I'm a total wimp when it comes to horror movies. Anything related to the supernatural scares me for days and sometimes even weeks. It just physically affects me.So hearing, reading all the hype that came out of this movie, I was holding to my seat as it started. The first few minutes into the film, I did not feel relaxed, rather was building up tension thinking this is going to be it. But, but but, as the movie progressed I only felt calmer and more relaxed.Let me spill out some pros and cons related to this movie: Pros: 1. For the low budget cost of this movie, its pretty well done. 2. It's not really that shaky like others have mentioned, at least I didn't feel much of it. 3. This movie will scare young adults (13 - 17), but will be a good laugh for anyone over 20. 4. The movie has a lot of jokes and it's not that boring.Cons:1. It's not scary, let me repeat this. It was not scary. If you get scared by the slightest noise in your house, then you maybe scared. 2. I felt the movie was too short, it's almost as if I wanted a really suspenseful ending, but it wasn't good (something which I expected)! 3. I watched this movie, came back to my house, was sitting in my room and I heard a thud thud thud and lights flicker, and I know, I was just laughing like crazy! :-)I give it a 7/10 since it might scare teens, and it was pretty well done.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not nearly as scary or clever as it thinks it is!,"It would be wrong to say that Paranormal Activity is a failure on every conceivable level. If you watch it with really low expectations and for a quick, cheap laugh, you might end up feeling that you got your money's worth.But if you go and see this movie thinking that it will live up to the hype of being the ""Scariest movie ever made"" you will end up being severely disappointed! When all is said and done, this movie relies on cheap, obvious scare tactics that horror viewers have seen 100 times before! Creaking doors, eerie sounds and an unconvincing Ouija Board scene all try to trick the viewer into thinking that they are seeing something original! If you try not to let the awful performances and clichéd ending bother you too much, the film actually works intermittently, but not as a horror movie, but rather a comedy! Many of the scenes are unintentionally hilarious as they are so poorly scripted and acted, that it feels like you are watching a sketch comedy, rather than a scripted movie! The scene with the footsteps leading into the bedroom is the funniest scene in the movie, and seeing Micah and Katie overact to the extreme in response to it is the highlight of this movie! If you are in the mood for a poorly written comedy movie, then Paranormal Activity may be just the movie for you. If you want to be scared, look elsewhere.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The best $10 I have spent in a while,"I saw the midnight showing of this movie at my local theater for the obvious maximum effect of what I heard was ""The scariest movie of all time"" or ""The movie that puts grown men in tears."" The movie didn't draw me in at first, but that was the entire effect, to get you when your least expecting it.What makes this movie even more scary is how there is no music. In most movies the music builds up the effect and tells you something is going to happen. Also the 30 seconds of silence that just makes you tighten up in fear of what will happen.Not only was this a great film, but the actors and actresses had a flawless performance, especially being behind a hand held video camera the entire time. In most movies filmed by a hand held camera the actors overdo the acting and make the movie much worse, not in this movie.Definitely worth the money",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
wasn't scary at first,"A lot of the movie was hype, but it was still pretty scary. When you first watch it, there aren't very many things that make you jump. I watched it with my sister and brother, I probably jumped four times tops. I will agree with people that say they can't sleep. When you're watching the movie, there is no person in sight doing the things. That gets into your head that those things will happen to you. After I watched it, I looked back on the movie and realized that it was pretty scary and I might lose some sleep over it. It was a good movie though. The acting was good and the director did a good job of not letting you see the being that was causing the happenings. It could of had a lot more in it though. Overall, take a date and go watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Why r u so scared?,"Okay let me ask you all a question, for the people who were really scared and freaked out, why were did you feel that way? Are you really going to let the devil fool you into believing he can actually come to you in your sleep and hurt you? Believe me, he cannot. Jesus said, greater is he that it in me than he that is in the world. There is no pain, hurt or sorrow he cannot feel. People you must all believe that God loves you and is there for you even when you believe nobody is around. All the devil wants to do is KILL, LIE AND DESTROY!! All you have to do when you feel scared or stressed is call on the lord and ask him to rebuke thee. Ask him to give you strength because you are greater than some sorry ASS demon who has no authority or power over you!!!

I guess we will all find out one day when Christ comes back to reclaim his creations. THANKS!",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Not bad at all, but the concept is wearing thin","By concept I mean the way this movie was shot. I admit that I liked this perspective in earlier movies, and I thought Cloverfield perfected it, but right from the start of this movie I thought that the gimmick is wearing off now.Surprisingly this film is quite good. From the beginning I was worried that this movie would descent into cheap scares and other stupid 'boo'- effects, but luckily this is not the case with Paranormal Activity. The acting is one of the things that could have been improved on. Especially Micah can be very unrealistic sometimes and even obnoxious. But other then that it is a entertaining film that delivers what it promises. Its also kind of strange that the entire movie only takes place at a house, and I wonder how Micah payed for that camera when apparently none of them have a job...Paranormal Activity never really gets scary, but it does build up a lot of atmosphere and suspense, and the ending is surprising. Even if you are not a big fan of the home-video style videography Paranormal Activity is still worth checking out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"No monsters, No murderers yet as scary as any horror!","I watched this film recently and from start to finish i was so engulfed in the movie it was unbelievable, it may have been the fact of the story, being 2 people get haunted, simple classic, but this was different, the main cast was two people Micah and Katie and having such a small cast made me feel included in the story as if i was actually in the house with them.The fact that there wasn't actually physically any monster in the movie was an absolute stroke of genius your imagination runs wild every time you hear a footstep and the sounds in the movies, from the bangs to the slams and the bumps and the whispers everything makes you hide behind the cushion you have been holding ever so tightly every since the film started.the whole movie is shot through the view of a camcorder and this is very effective it makes you fell even more immersed in the story and the fact that it moves in the night when Micah has it walking is fantastic it really gives you a sense of danger every time the door slams and Micah looks with the camera i was hoping he would turn away, this proves the production and directing worked perfectly.final comments: success i have found a horror film that is actually scary without costumes or cgi, fantastic, i recently watched messengers with Kristen Stewart and the movie was amazing, but scary... no if you have not seen this movie do so immediately its very scary very well shot and memorable acting 9/10 story 8/10 editing directing etc.. 10/10 well done, very well done.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
...from a die hard fan of the genre - this simply wasn't a good movie,"Okay, first it gets a 2 because it wasn't awful... but it sure wasn't good! Our characters weren't set up enough for us to really care too much what was going to happen, and due to sub-par acting I wasn't convinced of anything happening. Conversations held in down time (as posted by another viewer) were particularly dull. When the ""scary stuff"" was happening my attention was drawn more to a timer on the screen than to the actual events taking place. Oh, and I mustn't forget the same old sounds starting each time our demon was about to do something - what drudgery. The handycam, 1st person shot footage was a mistake here - really, filmmakers - please don't do this if there isn't any real point to it! Splice your footage between it and what will be a more professional, watchable & effective production! So, so much could have been done with this great idea... but frankly I was glad when it was over. The genre remains my favourite, and my reason stands to be disproved. It is a very difficult genre to succeed in - thanks to Paranormal Activity for proving that point.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
well creepy movie,"I was very optimistic about watching this movie, because off all the hype there was behind it. and i really thought i'd be let down by the movie, but trust me i wasn't.rarely do i watch a movie that really creeps me out, this movie sent shivers down my spine, when i went to the toilet i had to turn the light on, Bad example i know but you get the jist. there's no great special effects in this movie nor gore, and violence, but thats what makes this movie so eerie.You have too watch this movie as if you were in this situation, if you prepare too watch this movie as if you were watching for example transformers, or saw, you will be sorely disappointed, you've got to remember that this has been made as close too real life events as possible, so there's no heroics or slow motion matrix effects in this little masterpiece.Id say if you're a fan of the blair witch project, this movie is right up your street.Besides recommending that people watch this movie, i also recommend that if your easily scared and faint hearted do not watch this movie alone, i know its only a movie but trust me its very very creepy and needless too say don't let your children watch this movie.10/10 brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"So Good, It's Scary!","Paranormal Activity is a very unusual movie even when you don't consider the movie itself. It was made in 2007, but is only just now enjoying a theatrical release. It took just a week to film, starred a couple of unknown actors who used their own names in the movie, and was filmed at a cost of only about $11,000 using the director's own home as the set. The director also wrote the screenplay, and it was the first time he'd done either. But because Paranormal Activity enjoyed a tremendous grassroots fan base which demanded wider release (the publicity campaign for the movie was also utterly inspired), we're now all able to see this little film.Paranormal Activity is filmed and told entirely from the point of view of a video camera purchased by Micah Sloat. He and his live-in girlfriend, Katie Featherston, have been experiencing some strange happenings in the middle of the night, and Micah wants to use the camera to see if there's anything really there. Micah and Katie joke about the camera and about whether or not anything's really haunting them. Even so, Katie takes things seriously enough to contact a psychic (played by Mark Fredrichs), but Micah even laughs at that.The psychic doesn't think the situation is funny. In fact, he tells the couple that he's pretty sure it's not a ghost that's their problem, but something far worse. Katie is terrified, but Micah is excited. What if he can actually prove something's going on? You can almost touch his anticipation as he sets the camera up to film in their bedroom every night. But then things start to happen, and that's when even Micah realizes that the paranormal activity going on in their home is no laughing matter.The story told by Paranormal Activity isn't entirely different from things we've seen or heard before, but the way it was handled was a stroke of brilliance. By letting us effectively be voyeurs in someone's home over the course of a few weeks, we're intimately involved in everything that happens. That intimacy makes every twist and turn all the more shocking.Even what appears to be home video, however, wouldn't give us the sense that we know these people and are experiencing what they are if the script wasn't good. Fortunately, the script is more than good. It's completely and utterly believable. The people talk like real people, and they react like real people. There are no geniuses or heroes here, but people very much like you and me. It sounds odd, but the truth is that it's a whole lot harder to write ""reality"" than it is to write something quite a bit more fantastic, and Oren Peli did a stellar job.In fairness to Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat, even a great script couldn't have saved this movie if the acting was either too stiff or over dramatic. It was neither. I swear it was as if we really were spying on somebody in the privacy of their own home. If either actor had been over the top in their performance, it would likely have ruined the entire ambiance the director was trying to set. Neither did; they were perfect.Oren Peli's direction was excellent. How do I know? I couldn't see his hand anywhere. Everything flowed naturally. Once again, the reality of Paranormal Activity was striking, and that can't happen without careful effort. The cinematography, while reminiscent of films that have gone before (The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield come immediately to mind), was nicely done with both stationary and hand held cameras. Finish that off with some solid edits, and you've got an independent film that's better than a whole lot of what's being put out by the major studios.BOTTOM LINE: I like horror movies, so I see a lot of them. The best ones have me jumping or cringing in my seat. But a rare and notable few have me scared not just in the theatre, but after I've left. So if you want to know if Paranormal Activity is genuinely scary, well, I'll tell you this: I did everything I could to take my mind off the movie after I saw it. I even went and saw another movie. But when I got home and got ready for bed, there was nothing I could think about or do that would convince me to turn off the light in my bedroom. Nothing. Now, how good a recommendation is that? FAMILY SUITABILITY: Paranormal Activity is rated R for language. I honestly think that it should hold an R rating for the very adult and genuinely terrifying subject matter alone! This is not a movie for those who are easily frightened, nor do I recommend you take the kids. Movie geeks and horror freaks (who know enough to realize that blood and gore does not necessarily equal horror), however, will love this one.POLITICAL NOTES: None.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Excellent Movie!,"I haven't experienced a night at the movies like this in I can't remember when. Paranormal Activity gave me chills, goosebumps, and made the hair on the back of my neck raise frequently and uncomfortably.We watched it in a crowded Manhattan theater and it was a fun, responsive audience, every one of us laughing nervously after every jolt. Much worthy of the price of admission, more so than anything I've seen at the movies in a long time.I totally enjoyed the pace of the narrative as it slowly built the tension throughout the entire film and broke it with the next encounter. The filmmakers brought back the 'subtle touch' completely missing from every contemporary horror movie. This approach sustained the creepy atmosphere and created a sense of dread that was almost, for me, unbearable to watch at the very end.The video visual effects were exceptional and seamless. Again approached with a minimalism that proved to be unbelievably realistic (oxymoron?). The filmmakers should be proud of their accomplishment as PA deserves all of the buzz, hype, and awards it's received since it premiered at a film festival a couple of years ago. Congratulations and thanks for bringing back great and effective horror movie story telling.I woke up in the middle of last night to the sound of movement in my house and again, even as I type this, the hairs raised all over my body because of how fresh PA was in my head.

Ignore all the hype; Paranormal Activity is a major let-down,"I'm a huge horror movie buff and it takes a lot to freak me out. So I was pretty excited when reviews said this movie would terrify even the most hard-core horror movie fan. Was I disappointed. The action is slow paced, and when there is something ""spooky"" it's not nearly as scary as the trailers lead you to believe. I'm not sure what movie that test audience was watching, but it surely could not have been Paranormal Activity.I also had a hard time caring for the female character.

"Tinkerbell, Anyone?","This is one of the best movies ever filmed on such a minuscule budget. Is it scary? Not really, but it does provide a satisfying adrenaline rush on more than a few occasions.I would have enjoyed it more if it had not been marketed to obvious idiots. If this movie had been about a guy buying a camera because his girlfriend had reported Tinkerbell sightings, would anyone ask if it was real? Living in this post-Ghost Hunters/Blair Witch Project world, the sad answer is probably ""yes.""The acting was very anti-Method. Stanislavski would have wept. However, as this film's topic already strains the limits of credulity, the natural, non-dramatic style of these young actors was particularly effective.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A groundbreaking, albeit flawed, film","Groundbreaking on its initial release, 'Paranormal Activity' still ranks as one of the best found-footage films, in my opinion. It's a pretty amazing achievement of the production team to make the film on such a tiny budget. Where this succeeds is where so many modern horrors fail: the ability to create a sense of fear and dread without relying on shocks and monsters. Don't get me wrong, we do have these in the movie, but there is more of the psychological terror that an audience would respond best to.It's not without its flaws though. The film is best during the night scenes, when the couple are asleep and the paranormal activities happen. Scenes during the day are pretty boring and not really worth much. The lead couple are good enough, but the several supporting cast are archetypal and dull. There is also a certain amount of suspension of disbelief required, which jars the film a bit. Why is the camera never put down during serious moments? Why don't they just leave? Obviously, these things remain for the sake of the storytelling, so you can let them off a bit. I only wish there was no need to.I haven't seen the sequels yet, but I've heard they're nowhere near as good. This, though, really was a good film. Despite its flaws, you can't deny that the film is genuinely terrifying at times.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Spooky Little Movie,"Paranormal Activity is a story told from the point of view of a home video camera, and entirely within the home of a young couple. So, like Cloverfield, it is a variant of the style of The Blair Witch Project. But it is original enough and clever enough to be well worth watching for fans of scary movies. There is no gore or ax-wielding monster. The tension comes from a story that becomes progressively more horrifying through thoughtfully choreographed imagery and sounds. The pacing is near perfect. It drew me in and creeped me out, just like it was supposed to. One warning: there are apparently three endings, reflecting the trend to keep tinkering with movies even after they are released.

When things go bump in the night,"*** out of (****)""Paranormal Activity"", Oren Peli's directorial debut, which first started out as an independent film, made on a shoe-string budget, was shelved for two years. After a plethora of test screenings, the hype started to flood. After the immense hype, the advertising campaign demanded audiences to make this movie worldwide. Now, Paranormal Activity stands as a universal prosperity and even some have compared it to the legendary ""Blair Witch Project"". I actually quite enjoyed Paranormal Activity. I'm a die-hard fan of the horror genre and typically, a majority of modern horrors are lackluster, but this was surprisingly fresh. I know many will beg to differ, but I was actually scared during this film. However, my definition of ""scares"" are having a feeling of discomfort that just won't let up and feeling uncomfortable in an atmospheric fashion. I think most audiences are scared by the cliché ""jump scares"", so obviously they were disappointed. Still, whether you think this is a great film or a disappointment, you have to give credit where credit is do. Finally, a modern horror film that side skirts clichés, resorts to some good scares, and overall just gives audiences a knockout.Paranormal Activity revolves around a couple who start to hear things at night. Kate gets frightened, so her boyfriend decides to record each night they sleep, to film what they obverse and hear.First off, the performances are simply terrific. The couple comes off as so authentic, that you can easily pour your shoes into theirs. The film boasts strong character development. Furthermore, the premise is great because it relies on subtlety and simplicity. Most horror stories are way too contrived and over-the-top to be taken seriously. Additionally, the way the film was shot adds to the creepiness and gives a more atmospheric look. ""The fourth kind"", which has a slightly similar story, is filmed with celluloid and it completely dampens the atmosphere. To add to that, I thought the pacing was excellent. No scenes feel too rushed or feel too tedious. This movie was very entertaining. Moreover, this movie was inclusive to a lot of ""money shots"". Money shots are basically scenes that kind of seal the deal and exude excitement.While this movie is recommendable, there are still some drawbacks. For starters, while the experience is very realistic, there are some scenes that are a little contrived, which detract the experience, but very slightly. Moreover, I thought the ending was a little too gimmicky and almost destroyed the fear factor. Furthermore, I thought some of the character decisions were a little questionable.Overall, ""Paranormal Activity"" is that rare horror film that's inclusive to great character development, a fresh script, and terrific pacing. It manages to crawl under your skin and it boasts of a very creepy, atmospheric vibe, which is highly significant for a horror film to do. This movie mainly works because it has the requirements of a great film and because of its simplicity. Paranormal Activity comes off as a recommendation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Indeed a scary film,"So to gauge my review, consider the other movies that have kept me up at night: Poltergeist (that &#$! clown); The Sixth Sense (imagery and suspense); The Ring (the well...). And now Paranormal Activity. If you've got an over-active imagination coupled with at least a slight trepidation over things that go bump in the night, you'll be more than a little indecisive over whether to leave the bedroom light on after you watch this.During the film, the screams of the younger crowd at the BUMPs or the door slams definitely broke the tension. I wasn't cringing or covering my eyes -- I was usually eyeing that empty doorway to see if anything was out there in the dark of the stairwell. I think that's what the creators were going for -- making you afraid of the darkness. Or at least genuinely concerned about it. And while in the theater I wasn't terrified, it was when the sun set that I had problems.That night I avoided the openings of dark hallways, didn't really want to go into the garage to turn out the light, and did indeed sleep with the bedroom light on -- when I finally fell asleep from nervous exhaustion around 3 AM after going to bed at 11 AM. The movie served its purpose -- it made my ears pound with the sound of my pulse as I strained to hear the slightest noise in the house: the breathing of the sleeping dog, the breeze in the trees, the click as the door handle to my bedroom engaged.Not everyone, of course, is bothered the same way. But certain movie imagery gets me wondering if something is indeed merely waiting for me to disbelieve in it, so it can prove to me it's real. Congratulations, Orin Peli, on completely freaking me out. Kudos to the actors who did a great job distinguishing their personalities -- taunting Micah, and not-wanting-this-to-go-on-any-longer Katie. Well done.The last second of the film was a wee too Hollywood considering the rest of the film. But the only real flaw in a simple, very scary, movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Good Movie but the Hype was a bit Overkill,"*Spoilers are contained*(I must note, i am a bit of a sceptic when it comes to the paranormal as I have previously looked into research around such subject which i must admit ruined the imagination of the film for me a bit :/ ) As an avid fan of all things horror, this was a good film to watch, as it gets away from the typical norms of the 'teen slasher' routine which is constantly appearing on our screens, time and time again.The general plot was good, the idea of there being a demon which has followed the female character Katie around since the age of eight. However, what i was disappointed in was the attempt usage sub plots within the film.The Ouija board scene was okay, however, i felt as if the story of Diane could have contained more of a deeper storyline compared to that of a simple website reference of 'oh yeah, the same thing happened to her'.Both scenes in which the photograph in the attic is found as well as the smashing photograph of the wall could have been developed a little further, as they just seemed to happen, the couple were like ""OH MY GOD"" and then that was it.Also, the night vision scenes in the bedroom were very well made, with the amount of tension and build up of activity happening over a vast periods of nights, however, it seemed as though in some parts, as soon as any movement was heard, either Katie or Micah woke up and reacted too quickly, loosing the scare element which i think could of been heightened much further.Even though i went to see this (this evening in fact) with a sold out cinema house, thankfully the rest of the cinema watching were all of an older, more mature audience, which eliminated anyone ruining the (you could call it) 'illusion' of the scares during the film.For me, I did like the ending (as i did find myself hiding behind my hands at one point ha) and i thought it was a clever way to end the film. I am intrigued to see what the original ending was though! Regarding to actors, i felt that both Katie Featherstone and Micha Solat had really good chemistry on screen and as well as acting incredibly well in these roles, they are what made the film. I think that if they had hired any well-known actors for such parts, it would have lost its appeal and seriousness almost immediately.Overall, I did enjoy this film. It was good to see it being filmed from a personal point of view, emphasising the realism of the movie, which, without a doubt was the key element in making this film work. The actors worked well, the scares were there, I just think that the mass hype that surrounded this film really did give me incredibly high expectations for it which were slightly disappointed at some points.But that's just me! I'd still say go and see it ha :)",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"What, are all you people who liked this HIGH????","Like many others, I was told by a friends and reviews online that ""this movie is amazing""...""horribly scary""...""gave me nightmares...etc..

Well, to be honest I gave the first hour a pass, even though it was extremely boring and amateur because I had been told to by other reviews that ""it's just building"". OK... fool me once. After sitting through another hour waiting for the untold HORROR that awaits me, a Ceiling lamp fixture is now moving. Scary -No. Finally I am watching these two kids bumble around their apartment going ""What was that""...""Did you hear that"".. and then run around the apartment with a broomstick. -A swinging lamp was the most exciting part of the movie.

this movie is the best,"I've never written any reviews for any kind of movie, but last night everything changed.Paranormal Activity is in so many ways the best scary movie I've ever seen. I also doubt calling it a movie, because I thought if it was a movie, it couldn't freak me out like it did. I call it ""the first"" movie in so many ways; Paranormal Activity is:-the first movie that has ever freaked me out to the point I felt I was losing my mind. -the first movie that I've ever kept saying ""It's just a movie"" during its playtime. -the first movie that combined reality and fiction very well. -the first movie that made a real horror without any kind of extraordinary stuff. -the first movie that regret watching it alone, in a huge, empty house. -the first movie that the things written on the label was true. -the first movie that made have trouble sleeping. -the first movie that gave me such a feeling I had never experienced before. -the first movie that made me want to congratulate and thank its film makers.Paranormal Activity is very successful movie in lots of aspects",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
ok,Found footage is generally all the same with this being slightly different. It's still not great the acting is the only true good thing other than the scares.

What happens when you sleep?,"(Not in typical Film Review tone as it is published on my comedy blog)Last night, I watched Paranormal Activity after everyone warned me not to. Hell with it, it made me want to watch it even more.It seemed so real. As far as ghosts and things that go bump in the night goes...I believe in it. What is up with the influx of reality-movies? Thought those Hollywood people would stop at Blair Witch Project. But no. Oh wait, but yes- people are naive enough to believe it is 'real.' The MOVIE was really good. Perfect execution of an intriguing narrative. The subtle sound effects was tidy and the acting was brilliant. Just look at the awards this picked up: click here. I was thoroughly impressed. It has been awhile since I seen a good scary movie (or it was a horror?) You can always rely on Independent filmmakers to supply and authentic scare. I read the synopsis which has an interesting alternative ending, read it after you watch it.Even though, I wasn't hiding under the proverbial duvet, I did however pulled my leg back under the duvet when slid out and woke up at 4am 'cos I heard a 'noise.' That 'noise' turned out to be my demon brother, who was playing DOTa until 6am.ps. I can't believe you made me watch it. :p",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good for what it is,"A low budget found footage film can only be so good. It was well directed and acted, and the build up was great, but it really wasn't interesting or scary.

What a crock!,"Don't waste any money watching this baloney. I've seen scarier paranormal activity (real paranormal activity) on ""Ghost Hunters"" broadcast TV show. I kept waiting for a scary part and finally the movie was over and I was still waiting. If this was fiction, they completely blew it. If it was ""reality"", it doesn't even measure up to ""Ghost Hunters"". A total crock of sh_t. Glad I didn't pay a red cent to watch it; but I did waste an hour and 36 minutes. If you want scary, watch the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" from 1974. That one was ground breaking terror in film and to this day is still scary as Hell. ""Goofanormal Activity"" couldn't scare a mouse. Any movie ""critic"" who said it was even a good movie didn't watch it (or was paid for his ""critique"").

Not for those lacking imagination,"I've read a few negative reviews stating disappointment in this film due to various elements- poor film quality, lack of suspense/gore, etc.Paranormal Activity is NOT your typical Hollywood horror film. You WILL be disappointed if you're going for a quick scare. Many of the scenes from this film stick with you, haunt you while you're trying to sleep at night. Whether you're a believer in paranormal activity or a complete sceptic, this film is going to have you on your toes. If you have no interest in paranormal activity, you'll likely take nothing from it.I hadn't heard much about this film before going to see it, just a quick (disappointed) review from a co-worker. Within minutes of being in the theatre, I'd put down the popcorn and my eyes were wide. Because of the way this was filmed, and because I hadn't been subjected to any hype, I thought this film was a true story. The characters were incredibly natural and convincing.The spooky scenes in this movie, like I said, are not typical Hollywood scenes. I don't want to give anything away, but when the character sets up his camera on the tripod, and the couple tuck into bed, your heart race increases. Time fast forwards, and stops, and you quickly catch on to the fact that something is going to happen. There's no blood spatter, no guts, and monsters aren't jumping out of closets. And that's what made this film for me. It suspends your nerves, and gives you just enough to leave you wanting more.I still have to re-assure myself that it was fictitious to get to sleep at night.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Ranks with Cloverfield,"Ranks right down there with Cloverfield. One of the worst, if not worst, movie I've ever had the displeasure to sit through. I fell victim to the ""Demand It"" website. Don't waste your money, the ""movie"" has already made more than it deserves. It wasn't the least bit scary, it was laughable. I normally won't comment on movies but this one was so bad that I believe that it only cost 15,000 to make (according to Box Office Mojo). Unfortunately we will probably see a sequel down the road..and if we do let's hope that more money and better special effects will be used. Take a look at another bad movie with good special effects (Haunting in Connecticut), maybe then it will be bearable. I found myself watching crowd reaction more than the movie and laughing at the gullibility of people that sat through this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
How horror SHOULD be,"I read on IMDb mixed reviews but decided to go see it tonight. AMAZING movie and then some. It was done on an (I think) $15,000 budget on a camcorder to beat all camcorders. It's the tale of a boyfriend and girlfriend who have a demon in their home. It's been following her since she was 8 from home to home. Anyway, they set up the cam in their bedroom while they sleep and he carries it around the house to document stuff.I'm not ruining the plot, but I CAN say that THIS is how horror SHOULD be. Alfred Hitchcock did the same idea of ""Will people be more scared seeing the man holding the chainsaw, or will they be more scared HEARING the man with the chainsaw and never seeing him?"" I full out think that Paranormal Activity did this angle perfectly. The viewer is at the mercy of the camcorder; they hear things; sometimes soft, sometimes loud... they always hear movement, footsteps, breathing, pounding, etc (and sometimes see things that will shock you to the core) but never do you SEE it. And that is what makes this so frightening. You know the evil is there but you don't see it, just like normal real life hauntings are usually.I jumped, I chuckled, I cringed, I mantra'd over and over, no no no no no oh god no..... and was VERY satisfied throughout the entire movie. I think those who give negative reviews are used to seeing the evil, seeing blood, violence, gore, cgi crafted ghosts and entities and so on. This movie gives none of that in the visual aspect - but it fully delivers in the 'hearing and the minds eye IS believing'.Go see it, folks. Google it up and go see it. You may think a movie that takes place 70 percent in the bedroom on a tripod and the other 30 percent walking around a house won't be enough scenes and so on, but that is so far from the truth. The beginning is a little slow BUT it paves the way to what happened to that point and what's going on as far as they know. We know as much as they do, they hear and see as much as we do, and THAT is what makes a top horror movie in my opinion.It's the whole 'what if' and 'what IS it' factor that does it. I'd rather have the mind set of not wanting to know what's doing the horrible stuff than see someone's idea of what it looks like and have it not ruined but not to MY own imagination, if that makes sense. I mean, movies like Freddy, Jason and The Haunting and so on are good in their way, but THIS.... this is TRUE horror in my opinion.Nothing is more scarier than ones own imagination, after all, and Paranormal Activity makes you use just that and nothing more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
THE hype of 2009,"I must admit, I bought it straight away when it came out on DVD. Due the lack of professional camera's I didn't want it on Blu Ray. The same with House Of The Devil. When the movie came out, again, everybody who knows I'm into horror told me, this is one for you, or, watch it alone...in the dark. Hee haw, here come the bone people. I waited until the hype was over to watch it, what about that, ey? The same with Avatar. I am not going to review it, the only thing I can say is, 9 out of 10 for the CGI, 5 for the story. For me it was Titanic in space. To much about a love story. I watched the theatrical and the unrated version of PA to see what's the difference. Well, it's all about an alternate ending. For me the theatrical ending was better. The unrated one is rougher. But is it worth the hype? I must admit, it's the Blair Witch of the '00. It was made real cheap, no stage settings, no special effects (almost none), no more than 5 actors, unknown so far. And a director who was unknown before the movie came out. It made a lot of money and, sadly, they are in pre-production for PA 2. Leave it please. And again, there are already some rip offs of the movie. For a horror geek, let's say, it isn't really that scary. It do has his moments but most of the time it plays with your urban fears. For non horror people out there this surely will give you goosebumps. Yes, I also got my share of it the last 5 minutes. It starts of real easy, and it builds his tension, slowly. Oh yes, it was all figured out pretty well, the editing, the fast forward and it works. Somehow, you care about Katie. It could happen to yourself. There isn't any blood in it, not to mention I mean, no nothing really. You just have to wait until the demon or entity pops up. But it is the decay of Katie that get's you. What would you do when it would happen to you? Little by little the movie get's rougher. I can agree by watching trailers that people really jumped in their seats. It clocks in just under 90 minutes and that's okay. There's a 99 minute version, way to long. The last scene really got me, the screaming of Katie. The off camera suggesting what's going on, the...well watch it for yourself. Do some activity, plug it in your machinery.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Paranormal inactivity,"In films like this your mind wanders. I found myself trying to figure out which comedy troupe came up with the name of the legal outfit: ""Terribly, Terribly, Boring and Dull"". All four of the associates would have been in their element here. I should at this point like to thank the hysterical females just behind my right shoulder who made me jump more than what was happening on screen in the final seconds, which were admittedly pretty spooky but didn't make up for sitting through 90 minutes of a boring no-score draw between two poor teams, to coin a metaphor. The rest of the film is tedium incarnate. How are we supposed to believe in these people? How are they meant to get to sleep after two or three nights of this? Impossible to believe in these poorly sketched characters. Any resemblance with the Blair Witch Project is entirely fortuitous (and a godsend for such a lame movie).",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"The movie that helped cement mainstream appeal of ""found footage"" is still an entertaining and frightening sit.","Katie (Katie Featherston) has been plagued by apparent hauntings in her life since she was a child, Katie's live in boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat) takes it upon himself to document their lives in the hopes of capturing these occurrences, but as more and more footage is captured the hauntings become more intense with Katie and Micah under increasingly intense psychological strain.Directed by first time feature director Oren Peli, Paranormal Activity's start was as a small scale independent film. Made for $15,000 the film's initial screening at 2007's Screamfest Horror Film Festival attracted the attention of Creative Artists Agency who accepted Peli as a client shortly after a screening. Peli then sent out DVDs to multiple people in the industry until Miramax saw the film and feeling it had potential helped re-edit it for Sundance (where it was rejected). The film was eventually acquired by Paramount for $350,000 and shelled out an additional $200,000 for a new ending only to be delayed due to ongoing issues with Dreamworks. Eventually a platform release was done for the film where screenings in 11 of the 12 college towns it played in had sold out screenings and eventually Peli urged viewers on his website to ""Demand"" it be shown in their cinema in one of the first times a major studio virally marketed a feature film. The film eventually escaped limited release and went nation wide generated just shy of $200 million worldwide box office gross and establishing a lucrative franchise for Paramount. Not only did Paranormal Activity become a household name, but its success inspired other studios and creators to produce other found footage films, many of which came from Paranormal Activity producer Jason Blum, and its legacy of scall investment high return horror can still be felt to this day. In the year's since its first release, some of the film's novelty has been worn down, but thanks to sure handed direction and tense atmosphere the film is still worthwhile viewing.Much like The Blair Witch Project, the film has an amateurish quality to it that helps sell the illusion that this is footage shot be regular people. Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat have a natural chemistry that comes through in their performances and you buy them as a couple in their interactions. The film does a good job of establishing character and situation, and the buildup of tension and release is masterfully handled with the scares well placed throughout the film and just enough clues dropped throughout to give the audience something to latch onto. While the ending definitely shocked audiences at the time, it has widely become a source of mockery (and not undeservedly), it's definitely the point where the film abandons its mostly grounded approach to its subject and goes to almost Vincent Price levels of ""Boo!"", but up to that point the film holds reasonably well together.Paranormal Activity while not packing the same punch in the years since its release, is still an effective exercise in maximum scares with minimal budget. With its camera work and acting that walks that precarious tightrope of being amateur enough to be buyable but also clear enough to see, it's obvious why Paranormal Activity became the phenomenon it was and helped expand the Found Footage genre to the high point of its popularity.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Pretty good Indie Flick Causes me to have nightmares,"All in all not too bad of a indie. When I first watched it I had to stop, due totally to the fact that Katie looks just like my ex wife. If you can imagine a beautiful woman like that on the outside, with a compilation of the Wicked Witch of the East AND West, Carrie, Mommie Dearest, Sybil, Lizzie Borden and Medusa, well you get the idea. Being a fan of almost every type of horror movie from the old B movies to the best of the best, I enjoy watching creative talent at work and I will have to admit that this was fairly well done for what little it did, Though the idea that the premise of the camera operations were taken from the Blair Witch, I think they could have done more while Katie was holding the camera to get Micah back for his lack of belief and basically being an a**hole.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A gem in horror movies,"I still remember the first time I watched this movie with my mother, and we really felt the atmosphere of the movie. I have never been so scared. After rewatch this movie recently, that feeling remains the same. Truly a movie that surprised me. Even back then my mother and I didn't know it was a movie, we thought it was a real event. And that's even scarier, when the way the characters develop psychologically is very natural. They even used their real names to act in this movie. The details about the photo in the attic seem a bit too much, and in the later part of the film, Katie's lack of hatred for Micah about the camera is a bit weird, as she always believed this was the cause of everything. Even so, these details have almost no effect on the story.

Not your typical horror movie,"When I first heard about this movie I figured it was another Blair Witch ripoff. But I must admit that it is actually a decent horror flick.This movie doesn't rely on blood, guts, gore, sex, and nudity to make itself a good movie. It relies on well-planned and placed scares, sounds, and reactions. I was very tense during this movie and many unexpected frights make the hair on your neck stand up. The actions of the paranormal entity mixed with the frightening sounds make for one frightful film. On top of this, the movie feels realistic. For being amateur actors, the acting is superb. It truly feels like this story could be true and be something documented.I'm not the sort of person who gets scared easily during movies. The last film that spooked me this much was the Ring. I didn't watch this film in the theater. I watched it from home which gives it more of a scary feel. Many complained to me that far too many rude teenagers come to these types of films.

"""Found Footage"" Scares Heck Out of Audience","(Originally appeared in Free Times, Columbia's Entertainment Guide)""Scary"" doesn't have to be expensive, as proved by maverick filmmakers like George Romero (Night of the Living Dead), Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and Wes Craven (The Last House on the Left). Their groundbreaking early films could not have been done within the confines of Hollywood. There's always too many associate producers, marketing flaks, accountants, lawyers and publicists deciding how you should make your film, so the key is to spend the least amount of money possible and not attract their attention.Still, I couldn't have imagined a viable film made for $11,000.00 (which wouldn't buy you five minutes' production time on a Hollywood feature), but that's reportedly the budget of Paranormal Activity, which makes possibly the best use yet of the ""found footage"" gimmick first seen in The Blair Witch Project. It wouldn't be entirely inaccurate to describe Paranormal Activity as Blair Witch in somebody's house instead of in the forest.Those somebodies are Katie and Micah, who are convinced there's a presence in their home that turns on/off lights and faucets, et cetera. The skeptical Micah sets up his video camera on a tripod to catch this nocturnal activity (or to prove Katie wrong) while he and Katie are sleeping. What we see are Micah's homemade videos, graciously ""donated"" by his and Katie's families after the camera was ""found."" There's not a single moment when you doubt the authenticity of what you're seeing. There's no musical score, no fancy camera work, no slumming guest stars (""Oh, look -- It's Woody Harrelson!"") to remind you that it's just a movie, not even any credits. There's just the relentless tension of knowing that, if humans were ever going to meet the unknown face to face, there wouldn't be any vampires, werewolves or zombies. It'd be like this.There's actually nothing in Paranormal Activity that you haven't seen before and probably seen much more explicitly, if not read in books, a thousand times. I'll bet you even know someone who claims to have had these experiences; I've known several, and while I hesitate to doubt the veracity (if not the sanity) of these friends, I can't accept that our entire science can be so wrong. But if it is, then Paranormal Activity, because of its complete lack of artificiality, may be the best cinematic representation yet of that wrongness.But the best thing isn't that the film may be scary or that it feels authentic. It's the fact that, despite ostensibly being shot on someone's home moviecam, Paranormal Activity is highly and impeccably structured, tighter than most A-list movies with a $200 million budget. Not a frame is gratuitous or wasteful. Ditto for the flawless Katie and Micah.Put this movie at the top of your Halloween list.

Its breathtakingly fresh and original atleast to my knowledge since i have watched a lot of horror movies.

In addition to that the ""home movie"" people are ridiculously unsympathetic, so that one would rather watch other random home movie material. When the scary stuff starts, one sees nothing and cannot possibly care. And still the random home movie stuff goes on and on, with random, unedited dialogue one cannot possibly care about.

Terrifying. Mostly,"I watched this in 2019 so there was minimal hype about this movie. I dont know if it was the perspective or what but this movie genuinely terrified me.....well only when it was nighttime. So half the movie was scary, the other half, not great.

Why is this scary?,"OK, well i love horrors and have been building up for this movie for about 3 months. I am disappointed, it wasn't scary was very predictable and was complete and utter tosh.The first thirty minute's i was still a bit hyped up, so i thought it was just boring but i had been warned that the first thirty mins would be boring so i wasn't too fussed. When it got to the first night time scene i was geared up for some full on screaming and a lot of gore or creepy stuff, where was the action? I thought as the movie wore on it would get at least a little bit scary but it was just more of the same, the daytime was boring the night time was over-rated, what ever happened to the day you could be scared by horrors?

"""Blair Witch"" goes to the next step","I knew almost nothing about Oren Peli's ""Paranormal Activity"" when I went to see it. It starts off a little confusing, focusing on couple Micah and Katie and their San Diego house in September and October, 2006. But then the horrific events begin, as strange, unexplained sounds appear during the night. The only clues are what the camera records as Micah and Katie sleep.Like ""The Blair Witch Project"", this movie is filmed with hand-held cameras to give an authentic sense of presence with the events. Needless to say, that makes the movie a whole lot freakier than the average horror flick would turn out. And as the movie progresses, you're certain to be more and more on the edge of your seat. Maybe the end is a little silly, but how they throw it at you really catches you.Anyway, I'm glad that I got to see ""Paranormal Activity"", and that it got to have a wide release. In a way, it's actually better than ""TBWP"", because it brings the terror into a suburban house, as opposed to the far reaches of the forest. I certainly recommend it.So just be careful the next time that you use a Ouija board.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Good film, but overrated.","I went to see paranormal activity with high expectations, the whole hype got me excited and I was looking forward to being scared to death; even the ticket lady said 'prepare to be scared' The film starts off pretty slow, which is nice because it gives you a bit of back story, but it seems to maintain a slow sort of escalation. The 'paranormal happenings' start off small scale and not very frightening, then they gradually build up to be more jumpy and scary; though I think this was a bad idea as it doesn't build up any form of a surprise and almost seems artificial...The main problem I had with the film was that there was no real mystery and it was pretty short. I wanted to see a bit more from the psychic and perhaps a séance. It's not like they could have made it more interesting by making it longer, they pretty much put in everything without pushing it.The acting was pretty good - which surprised me - as I thought with such a low budget the film would have had some cheap actors, but no, the acting was quite impressive. overall the film was pretty good, a decent flick and worth the money; I didn't find it scary and it didn't give me nightmares or keep me up all night with the light on, but maybe that was just me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The most frightening film of the decade!,"There has lately been a lot of hype around this film, and where a month ago I had never even heard of it, many people saying it was 'so scary' and that some people fainted really brought the hype higher. I tried not to expect something so scary, because no film has ever really physically shaken or scared me that much, but this came quite close. Similar to The Blair Witch Project, it starts off slow and slowly gets under our skins. It had some realistic characters and they did some realistic things, so that is a compliment that is rare in horror films these days. The direction is impressive, as is the camera-work, and very effective. The moments in the night are so suspenseful, and what makes the film truly scary is how some people have had things like this happened to them, and how everyone at one point really thinks about the things that go bump in the night and stuff like that. The film is simple, but very effective, and the experience of watching it was scarier than watching The Blair Witch Project, just because I saw this at a cinema and I saw Blair Witch in a TV screen. I saw it yesterday night, and when I got home, and was alone, I was very creeped out. Props to this film, easily the creepiest film of the last 20 years next to The Blair Witch, and one of the best.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
good for the genre,"It's hard for me to really compare Paranormal Activity with other movies, because these kinds of supernatural horror movies rarely meet my personal criteria for a Good Movie. That being said, this was still an enjoyable movie, which is something else entirely, and it was better than many in the genre.There's nothing really new about Paranormal Activity. It sort of mixes up bits and pieces of movies like The Blair Witch Project, Poltergeist and The Exorcist. But it still does it pretty well. I think the best part of this movie was that I was actually more unnerved by scenes where the camera had fallen or been set down or was otherwise being pointed away from the action, than scenes where some supernatural activity was being shown.The biggest downside of this movie to me was just the acting. The actors aren't terrible or unwatchable, but they're just not good enough to make you forget that you're watching people _pretending_ to be filming home movies. They do a passably good job going through the motions, but since their interactions with each other are basically the only focus of the movie, it just gets a bit stale, whereas I think two really fantastic actors could have made this movie feel truly realistic.The other thing that bugged me about the movie was the set. I'm betting it was probably the house of somebody involved in making the movie, but the whole time I just could not stop thinking, why is their house so big? A young professional and his live-in girlfriend who is still going to college don't need a house with 3 bedrooms, a home office, and a sprawling living room. Maybe it sounds silly, but the shots of two unused but perfectly furnished bedrooms just felt awkward to me...",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Nightmares Not Guaranteed,"The movie was just alright. That's it in a nutshell, really. I mean, this is one of those found footage movies that doesn't actually give you a headache while watching it, and also one that is worth watching more than once. But, the movie is just one big haunted house cliché after another. Footsteps, doors closing, sounds in the dark. In fact, you don't even have to watch the movie to know that happens. In fact, if you watch something like Paranormal Witness, you'll get pretty much the same idea there is in this. I actually prefer Paranormal Witness to this, though, because there is more of a variety. Well, it is a TV series though. Anyway, I watched this 2 days ago on FX and was compelled to review it, but I just never really got around to it until now. My mom watched it with me, because I wanted to see how scared she got. She didn't get scared. And if my mom doesn't get scared, then you know the movie isn't that scary. I wasn't that scared either. I believed the hype around this movie, and that was a mistake. I was bored pretty much the whole time. I might be sending you some mixed messages here, but there are good and bad things about this film. Believe the reviews about this movie, because they give an honorable rating to it. The critics are a little off, in my opinion though. Ratings from regular people give it an honorable rating, not the critics. Basically, it's like any other haunted house/possession movie. The girl is always scared and screaming, and the guy is always scared but goes to look at everything. The scary scenes were OK, when there were any. The real scary stuff only happens in the last ____ minutes. OOPS! Guess I can't tell you. What I can't understand is how this movie almost grossed 108 million, and only cost 15 million. That's almost a 93 million profit! That's craziness! Oh well. I'm really running out of things to say, uhhhhh, well, that was my review on Paranormal Activity. BOOP!",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
a masterpiece of horror film-making!,"""Paranormal Activity"" is one of those rare horror movies that can affect me to the point where I'm actually afraid to go to sleep. To me... if a film can do that, there's something very special about it. So I thought: what is it about PA that is so different from the rest of the so called ""terror"" that's released? And I came to the conclusion of... realism. This film is so real in how both Katie and Micah react to what is going on around them. The fact that there really was no script and it was mostly improvised blows me away. Most people complain how boring it is. Let me ask you something: in an average person's life, how interesting is a typical day? For the most part... not very. So this film is dead on with how these two normal people go about their normal routines and how, at night, the normal suddenly becomes PARAnormal. This film is a benchmark of horror and will go down as one of the scariest movies of all time (actually... it already has). 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Plot less but clever, and absolutely terrifying","What does it take to make a scary movie. If you were to reply by saying that Suspense is the key, I would ask you to be more specific. It is not what you DO see in a movie that provokes fear but rather what you DO NOT see. With the possible exception of Jaws, I can think of no better example than Paranormal Activity to support the argument. Following in the footsteps of Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity is a story told not from any character's perspective, but rather from the viewers perspective. We are practically inside the camera, which is a great feeling to have, but an equally terrifying one. Though the film is not without fault it is definitely one of the scariest movies of the decade.Ever since she was eight and her house burnt down, Katie is convinced that she is being followed by unnatural forces. Fifteen years later, she and her boyfriend move into a new house in San Diego. The boyfriend sees this as a good opportunity to document the supernatural activity in the hopes that he can chase it away. He sets up a camera in the bedroom and leaves it running at night. In eighty minutes, Paranormal Activity, covers twenty nights in the haunted house (although we don't see all twenty of them)This is a film that grabs you by the throat and squeezes. It is not a fun scary movie, it is scary scary. Repetitious as the story it may be, the film is never dull. There is nothing cheap or superficial about the shocks in this movie, it felt very real and I was indeed scared",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Unappreciated Gem in some respects.,"There are some rough patches, but overall, it's not a bad film. ""Paranormal Activity"" is shot in a found footage format, with believable acting and some effective scares. The film brilliantly capitalizes on the concept that what's scariest isn't often what you see, but what you imagine, and it does so effectively. However, that is about all it has going for it; it is not really terrifying, the story is as ordinary as it possibly could be, and the conclusion leaves a lot to be desired. If you have some time to kill, you probably will not regret checking it out, but I personally don't think it's worth going out of one's way to do so.Rating: 6.8/10 (Good)",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

My lowest rated film to comment on so far,"It's appropriate that the average rating for this is 7 (from the 9th of December 2009 stats), as I debated what to designate this box office triumph before checking the stats myself and then discovered my vote was right on the money. Millions of people saw this and thousands have voted. There are already over 666 comments (a nice, round, evil number!) so now I'll toss my stone in the agitated pond too.""Paranormal Activity"" has some creepy qualities going for it, but unfortunately, when this flick delivers, it's much too little, way too late. The two main characters are not the kind you'd want to spend time with. They complain, act like overgrown children and generally carry on like a ghost or thirteen should come along and give them the scare of their lives.I kept waiting for a certain person that is repeatedly mentioned to show up and guess what? He ain't a coming! (I didn't mention that person's line of work, not knowing if that would constitute a ""spoiler"" or not.) The alleged frights in this are more than a little hokey and I felt many opportunities to really get under the audiences' skin were wasted.I'm glad I saw this and am also quite disappointed in it. Part of me wanted to stand up at the end and yell out, ""I want my money back!"", if only to get a few laughs from others at the packed screening who agreed with my sentiments.Can we get any lower budgeted film that doesn't have shaky cameras all the time? And if they make a sequel, let's get a real aficionado of the paranormal like Dan Aykroyd to put on a silly costume and accent and come investigate! That's a bloody movie idea of real interest to me.

The distribution was mystifyingly limited but I found a venue nevertheless. Psychologically, the movie is extremely intense and children should not be allowed.

Boring But Authentic,"1 March 2010. Reality television meet horror acting. Reality is boring and the difficulty with making a film about boring reality is to keep in interesting enough that people actually watch it. What is likely even more difficult is to recreate boring reality and horror at the same time as an authentic performance. Never truly scary, uncomfortably boring but fascinating at the same time, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY seems to present one of the most authentic performances of horror on film. Unlike CLOVERFIELD (2008) that appeared to have been released in 2008 after PARANORMAL ACTIVITY but before ACTIVITY'S widescreen debut in 2009, PARANORMAL activity is genuinely almost completely more consistent in its approach to authenticity with strong elements from THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (1999) which remains more completely and eerily scary. Whether or not PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is an excellent horror film depends on the beholder and the riveting reality of it is where it presents its strongest case. Unfortunately, as a full feature film it remains boring, unscary, and mostly interesting in how it really seems to reflect what actually goes on behind the scenes in a relationship - a great pseudo-documentary reporting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I want my 90 minuets of my life back.,"Paranormal thriller similar to 'The blair witch project' and as just as boring, maybe even more so. This movie was incredibly slow moving, almost crawling at a snails pace, and over all not very scary. If you are particularly susceptible to ghost stories you might find this scary. I will say that the camera work was slightly better then blear witch, but not much. You basically wait 40 minutes before anything happens, and when it does it is no more then a small bump in the night. I can never understand why people would remain in haunted house. Maybe they feel their property value would drop if they ran out screaming into the night? and why did they keep sleeping in the bed room after each incident?

Preys on primal fears,"Is Paranormal Activity really that good? Is it worth all the hype? It achieves its goal and then some. That's enough to say it's at least worth a watch. I don't know if the acting is great, and neither of the leads are what we would categorize as glamorous. But does any of that really matter. This film is scary, and let me tell you why.Horror films come by a formula now. To me there are rules that are followed that work really well. The Hitchock idea of suspense - that we already know something terrible will happen. He builds it up - and then doesn't show us the act. So we've built this horrifying vision in our head. In Psycho, we see the knife, but not the act. We're then afraid of showers.Then there's another formula for horror that works. Isolation. This was mastered by George Romero. He imprisons his characters - be it in an old house or a shopping mall. That there's really nowhere to go keeps our characters hopeless. Again, we're waiting for the inevitable. It's the how that's got us spooked.So why spend a review talking about other films? Because Paranormal Activity successfully combines these two elements and ups the ante. In the Hitchock sense, the film begins with a title card thanking the families of the main characters, alluding to something horrible that has happened to them. We're just waiting to learn how. In a classic Hitchcock way, suspense is built. We never see what is actually causing the said activity, and the most horrifying things don't happen on screen. So we're left to imagine how horrible it is.Then there's the Romero element of isolation. This is where the film takes two clever turns. For one, it sets a rule for itself, that the characters might as well stay in their house because it doesn't matter where they are. That gives the director no reason to shift the characters elsewhere. So he keeps them in a place that by audience standards is the safest place in the world: their room. The scene of the camera videotaping the characters as they sleep as they hear things go bump in the night is horrifying because it preys on a primal fear of ours. We relate to this, and that the image is repeated, it keeps the audience on edge. This is the most terrifying form of isolation imagined, robbing us of our one safe haven. That's why the film is so scary.The interesting thing about this film is that you can't look at the traditional elements of film alone (ie screenplay, direction, acting). Is it gimmicky? A little. There's the sense that it looks real. But I don't point to the documentary feel. I think it's just that the director didn't need to come up with anything new to scare us. He just took those things that go bump in the night and put into a movie - which hopefully survives the hype that has surrounded it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Misjudged!,"I definitely misjudged this film. In 2009, Paranormal Activity decimated Saw at the box-office. I was not on PA's side as I found out the budget was a mere $15,000 (sorta like Blair Witch) I was unimpressed with the thought that this was dubbed ""scariest movie of all time!"" On a $15,000 budget, Paranormal Activity's gross was over 100,000x (in worldwide numbers) its original value. I figured, the special effects couldn't be anything to sneeze at.I finally saw this film and I'm pleased to say, on the budget and the lack of script writing this film is very good. Its cinematography is something to be hold. Lighting during the sleeping scenes are a very disturbing blue and really keep you drawn to the screen.Although the script wasn't complete and some scenes were given directions from Oren Peli to just ""talk about a certain subject"" this is well-crafted. It works very well and gets you interested in the movie.Perhaps my only dislike of the film, really, is the representation that the film is more of a documentary. It is actually all staged and fake. It's only based on a personal experience, but the fact that there is an alternate ending means that it's not real. I dislike when it's falsified.I was pleased with the original ending and the silence in scenes and anticipation buildup really makes for an intriguing ending. However, I wouldn't say this is a scary film in the least. The premise and idea is disturbingly freaky, but overall I wasn't scared.I would recommend this film to people who enjoy horror elements and movies that touch on paranormal stuff.

Terribly Overrated,"I saw this film completely unaware of its marketing campaign, so I can only evaluate ""Paranormal Activity"" based on its own merits. And thus, I have to agree with Mark Savlov from the Austin Chronicle: this is a sorry excuse for a movie, and it's hardly scary at all. The story is preposterous, and the acting didn't impress me at all, but the worst thing is that the thrills aren't many to begin with, and when the supposedly creepy stuff finally starts to happen, it's not so shocking. Some people might say that it's more realistic this way; I'd say it's mediocre and shows the lack of creativity from the filmmaker. Too much hype, in my opinion... I wish they had gone all the way with this idea and really scared the heck out of us, ""thrll-junkies"".",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Parnormal causes big hype but does not live up to expectations,"Trailers for Paranormal Activity claim it is the scariest movie ever made, but does it really live up to the hype?Paranormal Activity features a lot of first timers. This is Oren Peli's first film as a director and features first time actors Micah Sloat and Katie Featherstone.The film cost only 15,000 dollars to make and has currently domestically grossed 107,219,682 dollars according to boxofficemojo.com.Paranormal was filmed entirely using a hand-held camera. Peli most likely did this to give the movie a more realistic tone and he succeeded in that aspect. Other movies such as Cloverfield and The Blair Witch Project were shot like this. The camera work was done well, it really added to the character of the movie.Featherstone and Sloat's performances were not exceptional but could be expected from an actor or actress's first film.The movie features very little special effects with added a good touch to the movie. It lets viewers imagine instead of creating its own images. This is probably more because of the film's low budget than artistic direction though.The plot of the movie itself was only mildly interesting. It was difficult to like the characters. Most of the movie Sloat's character was trying to agitate the ghost most of the movie which didn't make his character very likable and Featherstone's character was annoyed or scared the entire movie which didn't give much for character development.The scares were good and well done but was it the ""scariest movie ever made""? I don't think so. The film wasn't quite on par with horror classics such as The Shining or Alien.All in all Paranormal did well with the budget and camera work but couldn't keep it going with the characters or plot.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Paranormal Activity: It's Like I Can Touch You,"When it comes to watching a horror movie in this decade, the average moviegoer has two things to worry about: cheap thrills or senseless gore. If you're lucky you can possibly get both, sinking you right in the middle of a subdued snuff film with a pacified plot. Yet, every once and a while a few films come out that give pause and at least try. Paranormal Activity, written and directed by newcomer Oren Peli, takes what humans find in the deep recesses of our subconscious and use it against us: the fear of the unknown.The ploy, which is in no means original or unique in any form, goes like that; take an overpriced camera, two twenty-something's that live together, and have them try and solve ""the mystery of their haunted house,"" in dilapidated Scooby-Doo antics. With the help of a ""The Psychic"" and blind stumbling, they go through documenting everything from each bump and creak, to their aggravation and paranoia.Again, this concept is nothing new. Go back into the crevices of your mind and think back to 1999, when The Blair Witch Project first flashed onto the silver screen. The irrational cuts, blurry and unfocused camera-work, to help ram home the idea that this truly happened to these pitiful kids. Now, fast-forward ten years and you have this movie with, more or less, the same M.O. However the differences are noticeable. Peli graciously and appropriately forgoes those troublesome camera antics, sticking to keeping that camera stable for around half of the film, while the rest is moving around in an amount that even your Uncle Charlie at family reunions wouldn't get sick over (something that people from Cloverfield and Blair Witch had serious issues with). What's more, since the main character Micah (Micah Sloats) is reviewing and editing all of the footage as he goes, it is cut and styled in a suitable manner so it doesn't look produced, having that ""do-it-yourself"" feel.As far as the cheap thrills and bumps in the night go, you are going to have those regardless of how you feel. The anticipation walking into a horror movie is going to amplify every breath and every creak, even if they weren't supposed to be there originally. Now I will say that when then first of the haunting starts, you can tell that Peli is purely trying to mess with your mind. Yet as the movie progresses, the psychological aspects begin to get to you, leaving you wading in tension a forearm thick.Which would leave would superb movie, if it weren't for the leads. Micah comes off as a narcissistic buffoon, only in this hunt to amplify his own bravado and to prove to himself and to his fiancé Katie (Katie Featherston) in a ""Me Tarzan, you Jane"" approach that says he can take care of anything. While Katie starts off on the right foot, only to flip- flops before spiraling down for obvious reasons that I will not mention (no spoilers here folks). The baseline is that their actions and motives throughout were so horrendous that you get lost in their idiocy. Even if that doesn't stop you, their actions will.Thus, it makes it hard to remember that this is a movie set three years in the past, making their ignorance of the unknown almost passable. Paranormal activity was just sparking interest, and hence the setting of the movie, and whatever they did, they were truly making up as they went. However some things, common sense can gently prod you in the back of the mind, and say, ""Get the hell out, you moron!""Again, this movie was watched and reviewed on the DVD release, and with that, I was able to see two of the three alternate endings of the movie, showing some of the better ways the characters ended. Supposedly, these two were picked because they were the best received out of the group, yet I cannot help but feel that the third that is missing was one of the better ones to see. I will say that for anyone watch the DVD, that the alternate ending is a much better end in terms of a subtler, and fitting end.Why Peli thought to only put two of the three, I can only speculate. Perhaps he figured he could do whatever he wanted, since truthfully when a movie with a $15,000 production budget makes over $200 million, you can. And it is easy to see why. After you place aside the awkward characters and other minor issues, you have a movie that people have not seen in years; a movie that scares you for being there. You don't see what is there, but you assume something is. There is no green screen or CGI, just well placed camera-work.It's a re-installment of something a decade past, but when done with a little work and forethought, it can be handled with fear and shivers. I myself can say I was a little tense after, wondering what would happen next, and knowing that the other nine people in the room felt the same. Some may scoff or throw it aside, but even if that feeling is there for an instant, then the movie did its job.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Do Not Believe the Hype!!,"Maybe I'm a bit jaded by all the horror movies I have seen in my life and it takes something really spectacular to scare me. Maybe I just don't get scared that easily anymore like I did with ""The Exorcist"" and the original ""Halloween"" or the original ""Last House on the Left"". I don't know. But I do know one thing -- this movie, to me, was boring. Oh sure, the last several minutes were not, but on the whole I found it not to be scary at all. As a matter of fact, I found it boring. It was so boring that my husband nodded off and I had to wake him and tell him it was ""getting ready to be good"". After doing this three or four times, I just let him sleep because I didn't feel it was going to be getting any ""better"".The girl in the movie, Katie Featherston, was a really good actress and we should all see more of her because she played this part with all her might and tried to be convincing. But even she could not save it. I've seen many movies where ""things go bump in the night,"" so the storyline was not new and, to me, the plot never really thickened until the last 60 seconds of the movie. Luckily I went to a matinée and only paid $8.50 for the ticket. I believe that if I had paid $12.00 for a ticket I would have demanded my money back.If I were you, I would wait for a better movie to come along like ""Shutter Island"" which will soon be released.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Well worth all the buzz. Damned Creepy.,"As a horror movie fanatic with hours and hours of horror movies under my belt, I was happy to hear that something new and amazing was on the scene. Sadly, I was not blown away as the lights came up in the theater after I viewed PARANORMAL ACTIVITY. It wasn't something super different and didn't manage to send me running from the theater in terror. And, while I wasn't scared silly, I was very uncomfortable several times. The movie stuck with me. The audience was blown solidly away hands down.I adjusted my experience and thought about what I saw and I have to say that I have never been in a theater where the audience reacted to the movie as strongly as they did with this one. Ever.I caught the midnight showing of ZOMBIELAND a few days before seeing PARANORMAL and audience members lingered around the auditorium entrance talking about the film. They seemed upset and happy at the same time. Like they saw something and felt something in a movie that they had never felt before. This wasn't the ""Oh dude, that scene was dope"" crowd. These folks seemed like none of them wanted to leave the comfort of the larger crowd and head back to their homes. Safety in numbers. But why? Strong characters, attention to detail, and some genuine scares that did manage to have me thinking about it into the night and through the next day.This is a simple film with a simple plot. A couple has something ghostly in their home and decide to try and catch the happenings on tape. Terror ensues and is relentless in it's building feeling of dread and horror as the poor couple is subjected to nightly happenings that continues to get worse and worse. ((all the while keeping the shaking camera to a minimum! Thank you!)) The film builds brilliantly and the view really feels the anguish and horror that the couple goes through. There are no cop outs like cats suddenly leaping through a room for a jump scare. There are audio clues that fill you with dread because they foretell nastiness about to happen. And worse of all, you believe the whole of it and feel the scares in your bones.Scares and thrills aside, the thing that really impressed me about this film is the reaction from the audience. People groaned and whimpered, they screamed, and they were not able to keep still as the film unfolded before them. When the screen text plate came up with ""Night 10"" etc, people moaned and were both excited and scared to move forward in the film. The groups of people that moved out of the theater chattered away about how disturbing the film was and how they would not be able to sleep when they got home. Jokers pounced out of the shadows and scared their friends. Huddled groups moved to the parking garage and stayed tight and together in packs.Yes, like I said, I've seen tons of horror films and am numb to them now for the most part, but this film had me thinking and smiling and talking about it for a long while after.

Seriously?,"Are people serious about saying this movie was scary? This had to be the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Worse than Glitter, worse than Bring It On, Bring It On Again, Bring It on Cuz It Needs To Be Brought One More Time,and the next 16 I'm sure we have coming out.Anyways the first half hour you realize hmmm this is pretty boring, then after an hour you realize wow nothings happened...Then about an hour and a half in you realize: Well hell something better happen soon because there's not much time left. And then it's over and you realize you have wasted 2 really precious hours on ""The Dumbest Movie Ever"".Just because it raked in the money doesn't mean it was good. I wish this entry alone would save just one soul from ever having to sit through it, but people are curious and will watch. I say screw the movie and go have a V8.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Never tries to be more than it is.,"By now, I am sure many of you have seen or at least heard of the ultra low-budget horror film that is Paranormal Activity. I must say that I found it to be not necessarily shocking but more disturbing and unsettling, which is I bet exactly what the director intended to do.Unlike most horror or scary films made today, it does not rely on obviously fake special effects or on making the characters stupid in order to get cheap scares accomplished. Many people have said they think the first hour or so is unnecessary because not much happens and there are no scares there. This is true, except it is important because it sets up the final 15 minutes that will blow you away. Taking a page out of Hitchcock, this film follows the belief that taking time to set up a sequence helps make the payoff more effective. We start out by seeing a young couple living in suburban San Diego. We learn very little about them or their relationship, which also makes it more effective, and we can only see what the camera will let us. Of course, part of the reason this film has become famous is due to the fact that it uses mostly a standstill camera method in order to explain what is happening. Never once do we see something without one of the characters actually taking hold of the camera and showing us.Part of the genius of this movie is in the fact that it uses very realistic and even funny moments to make the scary ones more unsettling. We see the couple argue, tease and love each other. We can relate to them and we fear for their safety. This is in no small part thanks to the two actors, Katie Featherston and Micach Sloat, who seem to not even be portraying characters but simply doing what comes naturally to them.As the story progresses, more strange things happen and thanks to Micah's obsession with trying to figure this out we get to see nearly all of it. The ending comes at a great shock and though some will complain that it is too over-the-top or Hollywood-ish, it does deliver the biggest scare and helps end the film on a most ominous tone. So, if you haven't seen this gem yet, do so. Just like its father, 1999's The Blair Witch Project, this is downright, bare bones effective film-making. If only others would pay more heed to this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great little indie horror film,"Saw this last night and it was a great little indie horror film, in the same tradition of other great, low-budget films like Blair Witch, Halloween, (Jack Ketchum's) The Girl Next Door, or the original Clerks. For the posters complaining about how the movie ""looks cheap"" and has amateur acting well...it was made for $15k in one week and features novice actors. If you go see this expecting the same level of acting and production values as in a typical, big budget Hollywood production, then yes, you may be disappointed.For what it is, it is quite well-done and is a hell of a lot better than a lot of recent horror films to show up in theaters in a while. I think most of the people commenting on how bad this film is probably have not seen very many (if any) such small, low-cost, independent movies and can only compare it to the blockbusters - hence they are disappointed in the final product because they are used to the big effects and top-notch production values (and I'm not being an indie snob, I don't think a film is automatically great just because it is an ""indie"". So, yes, if you think that films like ""Transformers"", ""G.I. Joe"" and ""Saw VI"" are great films - you will probably not like this.I saw a private screening of this and I will say I don't think I would have enjoyed this as much in a theater. In general, I tend to avoid theaters because I hate having idiots around me talking or playing on their cel phones during a movie. But this is a film that is tailor-made to watch at home, late at night, with all of the lights out.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
NOt Impressed,"I just seen this movie last night and i was not impressed now was I really frightened of it. I seen many other movies that frightened me. The hype over this movie is much overrated . The way it is imply ed that you are frightened right from the start,and no-way no-how is that what is I seen nor felt sitting there in the theater. I was quite bored with the first 1 and 15 mins. of the movie. There were some parts of the movie should of been more emphasized. The real scary parts came at the last 1\2 hour of the movie and even then from the follow up of the movie it still was not the impressive and scary to move me out of my seat. But again this is my opinion and think that this is the only opinion about this movie that is more correct then any other that I have read. People really really think of what you saw and you people that haven't seen this movie yet you really don't have to rush out to see it wait till the hype of it all slows down better yet wait till the DVD in a couple of months and rent it for a lot cheaper then going to the movie theater.

"Had the Makings of a Horror Classic, But Then That Ending....","Oh, why, why, why did the makers of this movie ruin what had been a hugely creepy little fright flick with a terribly stupid ending?In the tradition of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" ""Paranormal Activity"" is one of those gimmick movies, in which a young couple films themselves sleeping at night in an attempt to capture on screen the ghostly goings on that have been plaguing them. There's not much more to the movie than the pleasurable tension it gradually builds as the freaky happenings escalate in intensity from night to night. There are some hints at a traumatizing past for the woman and a sometimes strained relationship with her boyfriend (who she clearly wants to be her fiancé), but the screenplay doesn't go anywhere with these narrative threads. It's just as well, because the appeal of the movie lies in the fact that these are supposedly two ordinary joes filming themselves without pretense, and too much narrative would ruin the effect.For almost its entire length, ""Paranormal Activity"" is pretty scary, and proves how much horror you can eek out of doors that move by themselves and things that go bump in the night. How disappointing, therefore, that the film thinks it needs to cap itself with a hard-sell finale like something right out of a big-budget horror film. It really mars the effect of everything that's preceded it.The DVD version of the film offers an alternate ending that's much better and is much more consistent with the rest of the movie's tone. But the makers clearly thought they needed something grander to please the teeny-bopper crowd.Grade: B",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
ıt is a horror movie.,"First, I give credit to them keeping it real at first. They didn't use a bunch of fancy special effects to keep me interested. Things would move or slam and it would happen kind of the way REAL people would experience it. They even used certain techniques–the characters–to figure out what's going on. The guy sprinkles powder on the floor to catch footprints, or the girl calls in a psychic. Basically what happens in the first movie is Weird things start to go down and the girl just wants them to stop since she had some scary crap happen to her as a kid. (Which stopped and now, for some off the wall reason has started again). The boyfriend is a skeptic. He thinks its cool, and decides to antagonize the hell out of the UNSEEN FORCE, just so he can get stuff on film. He doesn't want to listen to any experts and does pretty much everything THEY say, don't do. So all hell breaks loose. Again, there were a few things that they did which was cool and I thought, how original this movie is pretty good until they lost the original and went right for lame.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It Works!,"Not sure exactly how they did it, but as some others here have said better than I can ""less is more."" Very low budget. Only a handful of actors, two primarily, none well known. Limited set, a house. Not much else.That this film does work, is a genuine scarefest, has as much to with the lack of pretentious trappings as it does the engagement of the viewer's imagination. The house could be almost any house or duplex anywhere in the USA, and many parts of the world. The protagonists could be any young people. They're not totally nondescript, they just don't have exceptional traits calling attention to themselves. The situation-- ----strange nighttime occurrences and sounds-------is the stuff of conversation anywhere you go.So why does the film work so well?Verisimilitude. It's all credible. The actors, the set(s), the scenario, the weirdness-----all credible. It doesn't stretch the viewer with convoluted plot detail. So the midbrain stays more involved in the action than the cerebrum . . . . . thoughts are kept at a minimum, while fears are played to. By restricting thought, viewers are brought into a heightened emotional state. The viewer's visual search for something out of the ordinary on the recording video when time passes and nothing has happened keeps the endocrine system in high alert. I noted that it was difficult to NOT look at the screen at such times, and I sensed that the same was true for everyone in the theater: The movie cajoles watchfulness. When we become so attentive, we move into a different internal state, a more alert state than regular waking consciousness. This movie lulls the viewer into that state gradually and convincingly. The final effect when the movie ends is that we are left in that state: ""Deer in the Headlights"" ---no one moves out of pure uncertainty, out of crippling fear.And isn't this precisely what a good horror film ought to do?I give the makers all the credit in the world. They either lucked into this one, or they're more genius than they realize. And from the profits this one is generating, they'll be able to explore their talent again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the Funniest Movies of 2009,"Silly. Just silly.Most of the film was just BORING. We were literally yawning while waiting for something to happen, and when something DID happen, the ""paranormal activity"" was silly, like the pranks my brothers played on me when we were kids. Perhaps the film would have been more interesting had the two actors been the least bit captivating, but alas, my husband and I found ourselves rooting for the ghost.For those who question how we watched the film, we rented the DVD and were home, alone, watching it in darkness but for the light from the fireplace. We even watched it with our cinematic surround sound, which DID actually enhance the experience as the deep vibrations signifying the ""presence"" were felt in our living room, but that was the extent of the film's effectiveness.We couldn't wait for the movie to end, and if I could get my $1.08 back from RedBox, I'd use it to rent something more entertaining than 86 minutes of what seemed like some stranger's failed attempt at making a ""scary"" home movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
There were real screams in the theater,"A ""found footage"" horror film along the lines of The Blair Witch Project, and the best of its type since Blair Witch. It may be even a tad better than it, though it certainly shares some of its central problems, mostly in that the characters aren't at all interesting. Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat play a couple that has recently moved in together into a large, empty house. Lately, they have been experiencing some strange phenomena, like appliances and faucets turning on by themselves and things moving around on their own. They've also woken to footsteps in the night. Katie has had similar experiences several times in her life before, and is, of course, freaked out that they seem to be starting up again after a long lull. Micah, on the other hand, is excited and comes home one day (as the film opens) with a brand new, super-expensive camera with which he hopes to capture some of the paranormal activity. He sets it up every night in their bedroom and records everything on his laptop. The couple also consults a psychic, who warns against the camera, saying that any attempts to communicate with the possible spirit might make it stronger. Sure enough, the occurrences grow more and more prominent. While the film is fairly predictable, it's great at building tension. Its stroke of genius is that, every night, the film returns to that static shot in the bedroom. It never rushes anything as we silently observe the open door to their bedroom and the darkness behind it, knowing that at some point something weird is going to happen. Every time it returns to that set-up, we know it'll get worse, and ultimately I didn't even want to open my eyes when it arrived back at night. The film is smart never to go over the top, always keeping things very small. Unfortunately, I think its own smallness is going to kill it when more people wander out to see it. Audiences wanting big reveals and in-your-face gore are going to be too dumb to appreciate something like this. I saw it with a great crowd, fortunately. Surprisingly, most of them were teenagers, but they were very respectful. As the film went on, whenever they got to the bedroom sequences the silence was audible. And this was the only movie I think I've ever seen where people actually screamed. Honest to God, there were screams! And then laughter, because it was very funny to hear that in a theater, but that was okay, too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Hype killed this horror movie, but there's something here to admire","First off, I'd like to say that all the hype killed this film. It didn't need to be built up so much. In fact the less you know about it going in, the better.While it's no Exorcist, as the hype says it is, it is however a clever little film that plays with your mind. That's only if you allow it to.Yes the build up is slow, but what follows is a great little exercise in terror and how fragile the human condition can be, if played out right. Doing a home video format film like this is always taking a risk in the credibility stakes and this film does have it's flaws.The performances are borderline good but not enough to carry the 'true terror'of what unfolds, but the female character 'katie' is almost realistic in the unfolding events, which is why the film works when it does.Go in with an open mind and as less information about the film as possible (which is hard considering all the hype) and you will go along for the ride. Otherwise, check out REC, the Spanish horror film, which in my opinion is much scarier.Props to the writer/director though, who clearly knew exactly what he was doing and wanted to achieve.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not bad.,"Katie made a big mistake telling her boyfriend about her past. She made an even bigger mistake moving in with him after revealing said past. But Micah, the boyfriend, is obsessed with catching this paranormal event on video and so he giddly purchases a heavily modified camera hoping to catch the haunting in action. What was his plan? From there he decides to ignore any and all advice given from a priest and instead chooses to taun the entity and eventually it answers back. What starts out as a novelty eventually becomes an annoyance and then to a dangerous bid for survival as the ""entity"" steps up its game and tries to claim Katie's soul.I was in Japan when this movie appeared out of nowhere and spammed heavily on any advertisement related to movies. Not being a fan of Blair Witch like movies, I avoided it like the plague. Two years later, I am in the US and people are still talking about it. Took a long time to choke the life out of this corpse but it eventually it did choke and a corpse it did become. Now in 2024, the world is a desolate graveyard of creativity, I come. Like a buzzard, I pick at those ripe old bones amid the maggot infested carrion, wondering if it ever actually had any real meat to begin with? So then imagine my surprise, when I found it wasn't alone. A whole generation worth of cursed fetid corpses, each one more desolate lifeless husk than the last... how can one consume so much of the same before getting sick of it? If there ever was an example of quitting while you are ahead, this series would be the perfect instance.If you are wondering why I write like that, the answer is simply because I can. And that is about the answer you will get as to why Katie is the target since her childhood. Don't worry, more of it will be answered in the later sequels but I must say though, for a minimalist haunt, this film manages to be entertainingly and fairly intense at points. Considering there is very little special effects used and most of the time it just plays with sound. I have to admit that I found Micah quite annoying at the start, blatantly ignoring advices to interact with the entity but eventually he realizes this thing is no joke and gets a little more reserved in his mockery. The Majority of the movie is mostly about loud footsteps and banging walls till it eventually culminates into something truly malevolent in the last 20 mins by viscously pulling Katie out of her bed. Noting gets actually resolved but you do get interested enough to the find the answers and invest into the sequels in hopes that it gives it to you in detail... which it won't.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This is a slightly above average movie that is just okay but worth a viewing,"Paranormal Activity (2007) is a movie I rewatched off the DVR that recently aired on STARZ. The storyline follows a couple who recently moved in together. The boyfriend picks up a movie camera to document events of their relationship.

The demon backstory is actually pretty clever and well written. I liked how that aspect of the story comes together. The film has a Blair Witch feel to it in that most of the movie is slow and the end is sudden and impactful...I just liked The Blair Witch a lot more. The noises and sound effects are good and it always cracks me up the boyfriend brought nothing to the situation but bad ideas. The ending is fantastic but it's debatable if the film is worth sitting through to get to it. 😂 This film has minimal rewatch value.Overall this is a slightly above average movie that is just okay but worth a viewing.

Also the movie has no real story, nothing develops and nothing made me want to watch more. Don't waste money on this garbage. Better off watching an episode of unsolved mysteries. on the flip side, i probably wouldve given this a 3 or 4 out of 10 because it had such a low budget but when i saw the ridiculous 10's i had to give this a 1. i still cant figure how anybody found this scary or even interesting to watch. horrible movie",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Scariest Movie of our Generation,"This is my first actual written review on movie and i have been a member on IMDb for a couple years now. The reason i am writing this is because i want people to know that this movie is indeed a GREAT film. It is not the greatest movie ever made, but this is in fact the scariest movie i have ever seen in my life. I am still trying to grasp the whole thing and i saw it a week ago. Me and my wife would pretty much refuse to talk about the movie for the first few days, but we eventually got over it and discussed our thoughts on the film. The main reason i am writing this review is because i am already noticing the IMDb rating going down, it started at a 8.9, and now it has plummeted to an 8.1 with only 2300 (ish) ratings. The reason i think that this is happening is because some people cant stand movies that are hyped up to be great and they get on IMDb and they rate it a 1/10 without even seeing the movie. Or they see it and think that the ""cool"" thing to do is to give it a low rating. In my opinion this movie DESERVES the top 250, it really does. From Start to Finish the movie taps into your inner child and scares you the way you were as an 8 year old kid after just seeing ""Halloween"" Or ""Friday the 13th"" for the first time. This movie is making ADULTS feel like that again. And that is horrifying. The last thing I want is for everyone to jump onto the ""Paranormal Activity Sucks"" bandwagon, and the movie drops to like a 6.0 or even a 7.5, it deserves more than that. If you are skeptical, please take my word for it, go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Haunted by the Blair Witch,"The comparison is inevitable. I think The Blair Witch Project is a better film. Way better. While Paranormal Activity was also shot as a low-budget mockumentary, the acting is so obvious that it makes it hardly believable. For instance, the trance-like state in which Katie is when Micah finds her sitting on the swing looks so fake that it is almost laughable. That is not to say that this indie flick lacks its merits, like the absence of pointless cheesy effects, but the overall scare factor is low and the suspense takes too long to develop. Also, there is no way the ""Rancho Penasquitos Police Department"" would have released the footage upon which Paranormal is based. Yes, I know we are dealing with fiction but, once the movie ends, even the more gullible should realize such impossibility.It is highly advisable for those who missed Blair Witch to watch it, then they might have second thoughts about Paranormal.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Boorrrrring!,"I have never posted about a movie before, but this stinker really prompted me to write. This has been such an over-rated flick. I respect the fact that they had a budget of $11K, but that is where the good ratings, in my view end. Guys, if you seriously held your girl's hand in fear while watching this bomb, please turn in your man card. The movie was slow, the camera movement becomes annoying quickly. This was almost as annoying as Blair Witch. Please, do not even put this snooze fest in same sentence as Exorcist. Not only did I not have a problem sleeping after this movie, it was this flick that HELPED me get to sleep. I looked over and my girlfriend was actually chuckling at some of the scenes. Seriously, this movie sucked, it was slow. That was 2 hours I will never get back",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good movie to watch alone once...,"I have not see a horror movie made so simple. As someone said this movie is worth for what it is made.I am not going to give away any spoilers, but i would give some advice to watch this movie. This is best when watched alone or with one company the most. Start watching late night may be after 11. Forget the fact that you are watching a movie, think as if you are watching a documentary in discovery or nat geo.The fact that there are lots of similar incidents happening around the globe is the creeping factor about the movie. All you need is patience till the end. Last 5 mins are the best.Thats said, this is a good effort. Effort that is similar to district9 (which is far superior than this).

Pure Crap!,"Those two words quite accurately summarize this ridiculous excuse for a ""horror"" film. Poorly paced, abysmally acted, and completely unoriginal, ""Paranormal Activity"" fails to deliver even modest scares. The film blatantly rips off other (better) entries in the genre, and even the ""lost footage"" concept (a cheap gimmick to begin with) is stolen from another similarly hyped, AWFUL movie. It amazes me how so many people seem to find this movie worthy of any praise, whatsoever. The marketing of the film was sensational, I will admit, but as a horror-film lover, it truly saddens me to think of how many folks were actually paid off to give good reviews of this piece of fecal matter.

Expected better. But it's not too bad,"Okay, since lockdown is making me go insane, I've made the sane decision to watch all paranormal activities since I haven't seen any before.I knew what the premise was and I knew it was popular but that's it. And I found the experience of this to be a little underwhelming. My biggest gripe with this is that the characters are complete morons, at what point do you go ""right we need to do something about this"" instead of just letting it play out night by night. Also, the female main character, Katie, says that this ""demon"" has been with her since 8 years old. So she's barely slept at night for that long? Kind of skips the back story of it all.My other main issue is that it becomes quite clear that there's going to be no solution to the problem they have. So I personally became a little disinterested.I will give it credit though. For an obvious low budget film it's done fantastically well. It's acted well and the camera shots are done wonderfully. The is some scary moments definitely, mainly jump scares, but the director does a good job of keeping the suspense.All in all, it's not too bad. 6/10 suits the film well. If you haven't seen it and you enjoy horror films then definitely give it a go. Definitely one of the better found footage films.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Not bad, Not Bad At All","I was reluctant to see this one for awhile, as I thought it would be more hype than anything, but last week my girlfriend and I decided to give it a try.There are people that will say it isn't scary, but I think it's all in the way that you view it. People seem to forget that the purpose of a film is to submerse the viewer into the emotions and actions of the characters. If you imagine yourself in a situation such as the events of Paranormal Activity, you mean to tell me that you wouldn't be the least bit scared? I doubt it.With that said, I have to say that I was impressed. I've seen a lot of horror movies (though this title falls under a psychological thriller more than anything), and I really liked the way the movie was done.The lighting and the camera visuals were just plain creepy. Imagine watching those camera recordings the next day and seeing these things? I think that was the goal of director -to add a sense of mystery and suspense, and I think they succeeded.The acting was decent (I've seen much worse), and I can even call it good for a horror film. They created a sense of realism which just added to the suspense, as you can tell that they were genuinely scared.There wasn't really any music to speak of, but again, this is supposed to be ""real"" camera footage, so it makes sense to be void of any sort of soundtrack. The sound effects were nice, with a few ""jump out of your seat"" kind of scenes.As others have said, it's a fairly slow-moving film, meaning that the suspense and stress of the characters builds rather slowly, but it works well for this type of film. Give it a try, and let yourself be immersed in the feelings and fears of the characters. If you view it that way, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Please do not see this film,The only thing that scared me about this film is that so many people are scared by it. After the first extremely boring half hour (and i love slow movies)I was still expecting a turn for the exciting. It never happened. This poorly shot joke was painful to watch and an embarrassment to the art of film. Buying a ticket to this movie will only encourage the destruction of modern cinema. If your going to see it at least buy a ticket to another film and hop into it. Please do not support the rape of film.I guess this film is proof that Americans are still naive enough that they truly believe in the supernatural. Please join me in boycotting this film and thus proving the movie going crowd is not just sheep being herded to there death by the only care about profit film industry.,1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"I don't scream in horror movies, but Paranormal Activity made me scream like a child...","This is a gem of a film, from the first second to final, utterly terrifying -- and, in my opinion, the scariest five minutes EVER made in a horror movie -- ending.'Paranormal Activity' is hands-down the only film to truly terrify me since I saw 'The Blair Witch Project' a few years after it came out. 'Paranormal Activity' is, hands-down, the scariest atmospheric horror movie I have ever seen, and is the scariest ""shakey camera"" film, having more thrills and chills than 'The Blair Witch Project'. In addition, I can safely say that this film is one of -- if not THE -- scariest movies ever to grace the big screen. It is right up there with 'Les Diaboliques', 'The Exorcist' and 'Psycho'.

This movie is REALLY SCARY....NO JOKE,"I never rate a movie 10/10 but this movie is the best in its genre. I have watched almost every horror Hollywood movie in the past 15 years,only a few actually did an effort to scare the audience,they play around with special effects and sound-effects.(You know when the camera is focusing something and a cat with a loud noise jumps at the camera.Pretty dumb..huh? they are supposed to scare us not test our reflexes) But this movie is a genuine piece of work. Its one of those unseen horror flicks like 'The Blair witch project'and pictured in the same manner. A sequential footage that scares the hell out of you. The best part is after watching the movie when you go to sleep in your bed.The movie is bound to haunt you for some time.If you sleep alone, please do not watch this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Paranormal hogwash!,"Give me back the hour and forty minutes I wasted on this tripe! You won't sleep after watching it? Well, guess what, this viewer almost fell asleep during the endless longuers of waiting for the sound of footsteps (again and again) or yet ANOTHER bump in the night that went nowhere. Ohmygod, a swinging chandelier??? Okay, so where's the monkey that set it in motion? Gee, must have been somebody with a long stick. The two lead actors do have good abilities but they're wasted in a non-story that really needed ramping up on the action and suspense. I don't care if the movie only cost fifteen grand to make, when I pay my money and sacrifice my time I want some degree of emotional involvement and this just didn't cut it. Major, major question: who on earth sleeps with their bedroom door open every night??? Nobody but these dopes. Doors creak (hinges need oiling), door slams (somebody yanked the dental floss), lights go on (who's out of sight flicking the switch?). Bits and pieces of so many other horror movies, snippets of conversation referring to the supernatural, the devil ad infinitum. Kudos to the studio execs who ran with this movie and put one over on the American movie-going public. Yes, a sucker is born every minute and this movie is proof of that.

Hype Kills,"After a few months of odd previews showing users' reactions from a night vision camera, and keeping this title under the wraps, I was intrigued by its upcoming. After it was 'demanded' in my city, the new trailers began to air, and I must say, it seemed interesting. After that, I began to hear how it was ""The scariest movie of all time!"", from several sources: Z100, BloodyDisgusting, AOL, Yahoo!, even my local news! I was pumped, it seemed awesome. I hadn't got around to seeing the movie until Halloween, which was near perfect timing, if not THE perfect time to see it. Went with two friends, and began to watch. After the film was done, I was left feeling like a donut: a huge, empty gap in the pit of my stomach. What happened to the ""scariest movie of all time""? I mean, I will get onto my detailed section, but it was way over-hyped on the scare factor. Personally, floating bedsheets, loud noises, and a man thrown into a camera (all shown in the trailers), seemed to, well--bluntly: suck. Now, let me explain the movie more before I get to the point. The acting was real, I must admit, it did seem like this was real. From start to finish, the movie does authenticate itself into feeling real. The viral filming in a first-person view of the camera from either Micah or Katie, mostly Micah, was interesting, and reminded me of Copperfield, which I liked for a similar reason. The 'paranormal activity', no pun intended, was very interesting, but as I said: that's all it was. The bottom line was: this movie is great; a very good THRILLER. I personally don't classify it as a horror movie, simply because it doesn't scare the true fans of horror. Sure, it well scare the general population, and it did, a la the huge amount of hype. But please, let me expand on my comment. It is great, because the story is so rich and deep, and above all: 'real'. From the filming style, to the 'paranormal activity', and even to the characters genuine and believable acting, this film delivers. Not to the standards of ""the scariest movie of all time"", but it definitely is extremely interesting throughout, and will want you begging for more as the credits roll. But that has been answered; a sequel in 2012. And before I close, I do want to say: I hope this does not become a franchise of a different couple or person each and every movie, experiencing different things. I can look that up on YouTube or use my imagination. I personally think the sequel is unnecessary, but I do hope it clarifies certain things in the film.THE BOTTOM LINE(Pro's) Interesting throughout. A solid, B-list (always good to see) movie. Filming is done very well. Actors aren't acting; they are 'real people'.(Con's) Over-hyped. NOT the scariest movie of all-time, I assure you this. Too short; really wanted to see more, but not in sequel form.Overall: 6.8/10; 3/5; ****The verdict? Go see ""Paranormal Activity"".

Really annoying boyfriend gets dumped perminantly,"This movie is getting on now, but it's still a superior found footage spooky movie. I do find the Boyfriend Micah so annoying and unlikable that you just wish something REALLY nasty will take him out of the human gene pool. Luckily the Heroine is much more endearing even if she stretches belief too far with her tolerance of her idiot partner's lies, ignorance and arrogance. I've seen this movie three times so I have to say that the spooky bits are cool, but I'm writing this review the day after the third watch and my overall all feeling is that Micah's parents spoiled him and he grew up in serious need of a slap.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Less Is More,"I'm sure most of us have heard the term ""less is more."" Alfred Hitchcock helped bring this term to fruition by keeping the forces of evil hidden from us, but obviously with us, near us, and trying desperately to get in.First time writer/director and renaissance film-make Oren Peli took the ""less is more"" to heart and decided to do his own version of a Blair Witch Project, but with much greater success in my book.I am not an easily spooked guy. And I've seen my share of horror films that did absolutely nothing for me. Although some of them I still love, they didn't give me goosebumps. One of my favorites, INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1956), was creepy and it made me think, but it never made me jump in my seat. The same could not be said for PARANORMAL ACTIVITY. It is, without a doubt, a true minimalist horror film that strikes at the heart of our psyche. And when I say ""minimalist"", I mean minimal. Made for roughly $15,000, it's first week out in theaters it grossed over $9 million. I can't even imagine how many tens-of-millions its made now that its out on DVD. Peli took the minimalist approach on time, too, as the entire film runs only 86 minutes. And they filmed it all in ten days. And in Peli's own house! The best thing about the film is that it gradually builds tension, never letting us in on what it is that's stalking Katie. This unknown is frustratingly freakish, and we can really feel the stress Katie and her boyfriend Micah are under as they lose sleep, hear doors slam, see footprints appear out of nowhere, and helplessly watch as more and more ""things"" begin happening to them.Those who hate the hand-held camera movements of The Blair Witch Project and CLOVERFIELD, will want to avoid this one, as it, too, uses a hand-held. But if you love to feel your heart beat faster, your breathing speed up, and to cover your eyes when you know something really bad is about to happen, then by all means please watch this.I heard rumor that a sequel is in the making. Hmm. Let's hope they don't ruin a good thing by trying to make a big budget block-buster with M. Night.Let the shrieking commence.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It's a PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER more than a HORROR flick!,"I'm not going to repeat the gist of what most of the other posters have already stated about this ""mockumentary"" film. I'm not going to agree with the comments about not being able to sleep after seeing it or that it was the scariest movie I've ever seen.I AM going to say that the hype is DESERVED because this is another one of those cool indie films that follows the adage ""Less is More"" and that no place is scarier than one's own imagination.Go watch this film with an open mind. Don't expect stellar acting, a full-circle storyline, or things to be dealt with ""appropriately"". Humans RARELY deal with stressful situations ""appropriately"". I myself came away from the theater (last night!) thinking of what I would've done differently, would've changed, etc., and I'm no film student, but this movie stands on its own because it scares you WITHOUT over-the-top gore, violence, tragedy, or needless extraneous romantic couplings. If Hollywood could produce more ""scary"" films without all those things, I'd actually go to the theater more than three times a year again.Go to a matinée if you don't want to pay full price for a ""blockbuster"" caliber movie, but I wouldn't recommend going alone.

Blair witch project effect,"The movie is similar to Blair witch project, the camera, the realistic aspect and the tension to the final scene. I started to watch it changing channels on TV and I thought it was a documentary, if it happens to see it that way, if you think that the story is real, it is scary, it is shocking. I really don't know which would have been my idea if I knew since the first moment that it was just a movie. Most likely it should have been slow and the characters would have been a little weak. The movie is about a young couple who tries to catch a presence in their home shooting everything by camera. The things go worse and worse until the scary final. My advise anyway is to watch it, just to see something different.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A superlative example of how to do more with less.,"I found out about this movie before it even had a page on the IMDb, so I've been waiting a LONG time to see it.I was afraid that after having anticipated it for so long I would be disappointed. That was not the case.Paranormal Activity is one of those rare movies that stays with you long after it's ended because the storytelling is so deftly handled. Very simple elements, almost bordering on clichés, are used in a way I can only describe as virtuoso. The sound of footsteps proceeding and receding, seeing a light turn on & off down the hallway, the slight movement of a door in the context of the plot take on a significance way beyond what you would have thought possible. My fears that I would be underwhelmed were unfounded.The biggest surprise to me was the amount of humor in the movie. The best scary movies have elements of humor in them to prevent them from being too grim to enjoy. The humor in Paranormal Activity not only served as a contrast to the intensity of the more frightening scenes, but also helped the audience to empathize with Katie and Micah, who were a likable couple, even though Micah was some what of a horses ass at times.My only complaints are minor ones. There was a low hum - almost like a contra-bass note, that clued you in something was about to happen - it was unnecessary and distracting. Also, it is well known that the ending is not the original and involves a little CGI. Even though I liked the ending and found it especially disturbing, the fact that the effects went beyond the reality of the entire movie to that point took the movie out of character a little and made it less believable. I certainly hope the DVD release contains the other endings as bonuses (I have heard there are three different endings).To be honest the closest any other movie has ever come to getting under my skin and gnawing at me after it was over was REC (not the useless and unnecessary 'Quarantined' remake). While REC was more like a roller coaster ride, Paranormal Activity is more like an intense nervous breakdown.I've seen a lot of scary movies, and Paranormal Activity is right up there with the best of them, if not on top, certainly within spittin' distance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Mostly a waste of a movie,"I've begun to question the pathetically weak perceptions of people being ""terrified"" of this ""brilliant"" movie. The reason this even got so much attention, was because of an experimental marketing technique of making people in each state 'vote' to have the movie viewable in their state. Those who believe in the ""horror"" of this movie lower my faith on humanity.In retrospect, I was talked into watching the movie by a friend as compliance with it being her birthday. I had never heard anything about it beforehand, either. The only thing that made the movie worthwhile, is the comedic quality of the audience. Other than the laughs they gave me, this movie was a waste of a part of my life I would much rather have spent doing other things.Spoiler warning (if there is one). The movie was completely pathetic with all of its ""scary"" moments. ""OMG!!! MY KEYS ARE ON THE FLOOR AND NOT THE COUNTER!"" ""OMG!!! THE DOOR SWUNG MENACINGLY!"" ""OMG!!! BABY POWDER FOOTPRINTS!"". The movie had two good scenes: When Katie gets dragged out of bed (which is anti-dramatized by the demon doing nearly the whole thing in slow motion) and when Katie throws Mica's body at the camera at the end. By including those two scenes and a little bit of other material, you could create a 10-15 minute video that has the same effect and would actually be better, because people wouldn't get so ticked off about the movie wasting their life, the pathetic quality of the movie's horror, and the feeling of hopelessness that builds up in us as we are brought aware of all the antsy 10-year-olds who were scared by the movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Laugh Out Loud Riot,"It may sound a bit weird, but unlike most people who see horror movies for the thrill of being frightened, I go for the laughs. I find horror movies to be funny, I can't help it. So when I say that this movie was I laugh out loud riot, I mean that you will come pretty close to wetting yourself by the time you have reached the tension soaked finale. This movie is frightening, creepy, but above all it feels real. It will make you afraid to go to sleep and more afraid to date.

How Come some People Really Like This?,"Well, the acting is quite good, I guess. Given that the protagonists are amateurs more or less. It is definitely not their fault that this movie almost put me to sleep. This is uniquely the achievement of the writer and the director who both fail to transport any suspense or even thrill. It is a short movie, only 86 minutes, but during this time, there is nothing that quickens the viewer's heartbeat the slightest bit. This movie is basically one and a half hours fighting the feeling of falling asleep. There is just nothing that happens on screen. Doors opening magically are not enough for me to feel satisfied by this movie. Unless anyone has children they are trying to put to sleep I recommend not to watch this movie under any circumstances.

Paranormal Success!,"Paranormal Activity is a landmark in the horror genre in the subgenre of the ""found footage"" style, the movie tells a story of the couple Katie and Micah that decide to film the paranormal activity in their house using a bunch of cameras.The movie was a huge success at the box office making more than 20 times the budget of the movie becoming a powerful franchise for Paramount Pictures that even spawned four more sequels with a fifth in pre-production.There is no doubt the quality and the originality of the Paranormal Activity movie, the acting mimics what a normal person would do and the characters are very relatable, most of the horror and scariness of the movie doesn't come from cheap jump scares but from the atmosphere of the house.Watching with a limited POV (Point of View) of the cameras make you feel uneasy and transports you to the scene of the movie, the silence and waiting are the key features to deliver the scariness of Paranormal Activity.Katie Featherston acting as Katie is very good and is one of the highlights of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The fear in this movie comes from the suspense, the feeling that something might happen any moment; in short, rather than just displaying a horror scene to you point blank, it simply provides a few hints and then lets your mind do the rest.If you wanna truly enjoy the movie, I repeat, don't watch it in the theatre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

It is amazing what this director did with a mere $11,000 budget and a weeks time that many multi-billion dollar directors can't do with their ridiculous budgets. Go see this film. Support the unknown directors and the up and coming actors, because their performance in this, Katie and Micah, is spectacular. My friends and I were all walking out of the theater asking ourselves if this movie is clipped from real footage.

The weight of huge hype,"Unfortunately, the first time I saw this was after I'd been given a massive build-up from the guy showing it to me, promising that it's the ""scariest film you'll ever see.."" which inevitably led to my disappointment when it wasn't quite that.What it is, however, is very effective at subtly amping up the nerves, with the supernatural entity gradually becoming more and more intrusive.Although for the life of me, I can't see the point of a demon spending 20+ years grooming Katie just for ... that!!?",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Gunning for the Reality TV audience,"If you're really excited to find out who was kicked off the bus, out of the house, or off the island on whatever Reality TV show you're into, then you'll love Paranormal Activity. You'll also love it if The Blair Witch Project was too complicated to wrap your head around.I can see spending, maybe, five minutes on an idea this one-dimensional if someone e-mailed me a link to it from YouTube. Unfortunately, I sat through the whole thing hoping that it would show some depth at some point, or at least that my friends were enjoying it more than I was.It's a fallacy that a no-budget film can't be based on a decent screenplay. Kevin Smith and Robert Rodriguez both directed no-budget films that make Paranormal Activity look like a 90-minute flipbook. The people who spent years working on and pushing this movie could have made it a horror film to be reckoned with if they'd simply asked for help on the screenplay.If you know someone who puts a lot of thought into the existence of ghosts and demons, then point them toward Paranormal Activity. No, strike that. If you want a funny, scary film with depth of character and plot, track down Lars von Trier's The Kingdom.

Things would move or slam and it would happen kind of the way REAL people would experience it. They even used certain techniques–the characters–to figure out what's going on. The guy sprinkles powder on the floor to catch footprints, or the girl calls in a psychic. Basically what happens in the first movie is Weird things start to go down and the girl just wants them to stop since she had some scary crap happen to her as a kid. (Which stopped and now, for some off the wall reason has started again). The boyfriend is a skeptic. He thinks its cool, and decides to antagonize the hell out of the UNSEEN FORCE, just so he can get stuff on film. He doesn't want to listen to any experts and does pretty much everything THEY say, don't do. Soall hell breaks loose. Again, there were a few things that they did which was cool and I thought, how original this movie is pretty good until they lost the original and went right for lame.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Paranormal Activity is a relatively original, raw, frighteningly realistic portrayal of a cinematic haunting.","Paranormal Activity follows a young couple, as they become tormented by an evil spirit. The instant allure of this film is, of course, the 'super original' pseudo-documentary format otherwise famed in 'The Blair With Project' (1999) and 'Cloverfield' (2008). While I can agree that this approach to horror is a nice break from the usual gore-fests we're terrorised by in modern horror, 'Paranormal Activity' still feels ragged and radically uninspired. 'Cloverfield' offered a stagnantly boring yet realistic point of view in the event of a monster attacking New York (which we know is a tired scenario). 'Paranormal Activity' is doing the same, getting a concept as old as death itself and filming it with a crappy camera. That's OK with me; I admire the film's moments of frightening intensity and tense entrapment yet for most of the 86 minute running time, I was left bored by the predictable story and shallow script.The desperate state of modern horror doesn't translate financially; 'Paranormal Activity' cost a measly $15,000 to produce while it enjoys profits exceeding $100,000,000 since release. This astonishing financial success is backed up by an ample plethora of positive critical acclaim, yet that doesn't leave me convinced. Nor could I ever imagine that this would really be a horror of true quality measuring up to the classics. So in that respect, the film met my expectation.The quality of the film was largely two-fold. On one end, there's the psychological ferociousness and suspense of the night scenes yet on the other end, we got a bold disparity of archetypal characters and lame script-writing. The man of the couple, Micah (Micah Sloat), is more of a terrifying microcosm of Christian Bale, Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise than a striking male protagonist. His goofy, alpha-male persona was an annoying distraction – even more so than his wife, Katie (Katie Featherston), who's plainer than Leona Lewis in a coma. The script was disappointing, unoriginal drivel, increasing the film's pivotal reliance on the somewhat dynamic format most obviously displayed in the night scenes. These moments had a great atmospheric nature; creating unbearable tension, entrapping the audience in a state of suspended inescapability. These snippets impressed me, showcasing a multitude of psychological horror that the genre has been starved of in recent years. As you can probably notice from my contrasting words, the quality of 'Paranormal Activity' is about as temperamental as a bipolar woman on her period.While the pseudo-documentary format pioneers the moments of heightened terror, it simultaneously shoves the film down the road of mediocrity. Such a style demands short running times, which left the film feeling bare and undeveloped whilst the solitary camera use felt restricting at times, almost leaving too much emphasis on what we don't see rather than what we do. Of course, this restriction creates the suspense, but I felt there were missed opportunities for more climactic shocks that doesn't really come until the very end. I was left wanting more at the conclusion of the film, the immense night scenes wetted my appetite but I wasn't given the opportunity to take a bite. The film teases you with an intriguing point of view and dangles various semi-scares for the audience yet it doesn't deliver beyond that. That is where this horror slumps.The independent, perhaps revolutionary transcendence of 'Paranormal Activity' is something to embrace – horror being a dying genre, I respect attempts to refresh it. But, this attempt is futile and lagging. Its junctures of great quality only frustrated me as it shot itself in the foot with lame casting and script-writing. I can't help but wonder how the $15,000 budget was spent...6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Episodes of ""Ghost Hunters"" are more scary!","This film is dreadful, boring, schlock! Say what you will about the shows, I have seen episodes of ""Ghost Hunters"" and ""Paranormal State,"" that are way more scary than this. I will state a theory that I came up with, that is the only explainable reason why this film is getting good reviews. This film, is not an ""indy"" movie. This film is a corporate creation made to look like an ""indy"" film, and given rave reviews in order to knock the SAW series off of it's Halloween pedestal. Just kidding, but really, this movie is sooooo baaad, I could not come up with any other explanation as to how it is receiving good reviews.

Psychologically Terrifying,"Let me begin by saying that I generally hate horror movies. I view them as stupid, gratuitous wastes of time that are recycled time and time again.Having said that, I've seen quite a bit of them. This movie is the only movie I have seen in the entire genre that has legitimately scared me. As someone who loves movies, I can honestly say that this is the best horror movie I have seen, simply because it is absolutely terrifying.The movie premise is simple. Micah and his girlfriend, Katie, have recently moved in together. After a few months they start noticing strange happenings around the house, IE lights turning on and off, faucets turning on when no one is around, keys falling to the floor randomly, etc. After things get worse and worse, they determine it is no normal haunting of a house...It sounds like the same old thing done again, however the key here is all about how the events unfolding are executed. The movie is done in the same presentation as The Blair Witch Project, or more recently Cloverfield, in that everything is filmed as a home movie. As cheap as it sounds, it does not skimp on the terror factor. The effects of when the ""activites"" happen are subtle but very very effective. From a simple humming sound to air blowing on someone making hair move, everything is done very professionally.I can not overstate how suspenseful this movie really is. Get through the beginning. As the movie progresses, it gets more and more terrifying. If you let yourself really get lost in the movie-- as a movie should make you, you will truly be scared for what is happening on screen. This movie stuck with me days after I watched it, giving me strange dreams and second guessing sounds in the middle of the night if I was awakened. This is what Horror Movies should be. This is what horror movies should accomplish! I highly recommend this gem of a movie to anyone who needs reassurance that there is still a proper horror movie out there.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

You can't be scared if your laughing at what the actors are saying when they are trying to be serious. It was a waste of time. Jerky camera movement, poor cut up editing and unbelievable dialog. It's a groaner. The film is short but feels like it drags on. I did find one blooper at the end of the film.

Great movie to watch by yourself,"Paranormal Activity is definitely one of the creepiest movies I have seen in a while. I watched it alone at night-big mistake! I took a nap on the couch afterward and when I woke up, I was sure that I was hearing movement in my kitchen. It got me that bad. If you're looking for blood and guts, or overdone special effects, don't see this one. It's more of a psychological horror. The only reason that I didn't give it 9 stars was because sometimes Micah's personality didn't stay consistent. While he seemed like a smart and nice enough guy at the beginning of the film, his reactions during some scenes led me to believe that he was a stupid jerk. Don't get me wrong; I thought the acting was excellent throughout the film and would blame the writing more than the acting for these inconsistencies. I thought that Katie being played by a ""real"" looking girl added to the reality of the movie also. Overall, a great movie that you shouldn't miss.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Shadow People,"I'm going to give it a 6, because I didn't find it very scary and I hated the ending (don't know which one I watched since there is an a alternative ending). However, this movie is possibly the first of its kind to approach the subject of Shadow People. I don't have any problems talking about it, but many like me do. All that is said by Katie (except the burning house) is in fact real, maybe based in someone's testimonial. There are three kinds of entities, the ""hat-man"", the ""hooded-figure"" and the ""demon from the trees"" (as I call it). Ever since I was a little boy until I was about 25 I used to see this shadowed things. However, unlike the movie, this things don't interact or speak to us, except the ""demon from the trees"", which may try in several occasions to attack us, and yes, its screams are very similar to those in the movie. I used to be scared to death of these things, until I noticed that fear is what drives them (the movie also brings this up). However, no possessions ever occurred and no photos were ever stolen. It's difficult for me to talk about this, because I always fear that they can come back. Believe it or not and I don't care, but these things exist. Others like me will watch and see themselves in this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Whoever is the director of this movie should watch more top rated movies and not something ridiculous like the Blair Witch Project, which this film reminded me of.The use of a Handicam can make the movie more powerful to make it seem more realistic but in here, its just plain out not well done.I would not recommend this film to anyone not because so many people were saying it was extremely scary and people had to be brought out in ambulances at the screenings, but because this movie is horribly directed and edited, over-acted to the point where you could easily tell it is fake.The director doesn't draw in the audience well at all, I did not feel as if this were realistic or even probable.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Things that close doors and be a nuisance at night,"Paranormal Activity is not your typical horror film. There's no killer, no CGI, and thank goodness no Michael Bay. With a mere budget of $15,000 that will seemingly get you nowhere, Paranormal Activity proves wrong.The story concerns is a young dating couple ""played"" by Katie Featherson and Micah Sloat. I put quotes around ""played"" because they are themselves in the film, and they occupy their own names. There's one flaw in their relationship. Ever since her house burned, Katie has been haunted by demons. Mainly in the late night hours. ""Ghosts"" slam the doors, looks of creaking sounds make up for the lack of music, and so on. The little things that make you flinch or jump in a horror film are now put in the foreground. They are the main scares of the film.Jump scares are those little instances where one of the characters turns around or something moves really fast, usually in the night time for added effect, and you hear an effect and a loud chord from the music. Normally, I'm against them. I, however, am not against suspense. In many current horror films, jump scares come seconds before an actual murder or something along those lines. The main flaw with jump scares is now that you've jumped up and flinched two or more times, the real murder will not seem as scary.Here's a scenario - a woman walking alone in an eerie forrest in the middle of the night. Nevermind why, but imagine she turns around once and you get a jump scare that makes you flinch. Imagine afterwards she looks the other way and you get another huge jump. Then finally, the killer comes out and attacks her. The murder doesn't seem as scary as it would with no jump scares because you clearly saw it coming. No film would deliberately tease you with loud, obnoxious jump scares if nothing would happen in that scene.But in Paranormal Activity, those jump scares are what we are waiting for. The suspense comes from the silence and the lack of music - we are waiting for something to make a loud noise so we can jump. Only in maybe two scenes I recall something actually happening that goes beyond a jump scare. It was the equivalent to a murder in a slasher film.The way the film is shot too does nothing but add to the creepy vibe. I've always been a huge fan of shot-on-video horror films, meaning the film is shot with a hand-held camcorder and no tripod. Someone in the film is holding it and filming it first person style. The same thing worked in 1999 when the horror film that shocked many The Blair Witch Project came out. While mocked now, the film is without a doubt eerie and is still filmed very realistically.The less you the better about Paranormal Activity the better, which is why I tried to shy away from major plot points and discoveries. I assume that maybe in ten years this will be looked seen as ""silly"" and ""stupid,"" but frankly, if you think about the realism, the quality, and the acting in the film, it's all believable, captivating, and powerful. It achieves many goals in elements that can easily be ruined in films like these. It at least deserves credit for that.Starring: Katie Featherson and Micah Sloat.

"Simple, edgy and an adrenalin shot for the horror genre.","Empire magazine reviewer Simon Crook hit the nail firmly on the head when he proclaimed that Paranormal Activity is only as scary as you make it. With that, the film is sure to prove a most divisive piece amongst the horror faithful. For Oren Peli's film deals very much in the ""what you don't see is what truly unnerves you"" line of shiverdom. The premise is simple, young couple move into a new house and the lady of the house is being ""haunted"" by a demon {crucially not a ghost}. Trying to get to the bottom of the matter, the male protagonist sets up his new boy toy camera to record what exactly is making things go bump in the night as they try to sleep. What unfolds during each night is hold your breath in anticipation cinema.Those that know a little about the subject at hand, re; the difference between a ghost and a demon haunting, will quite possibly benefit far more from Paranormal Activity's experience. More so if the thought of incubus/succubus type demons are the things that have been known to render sleepless nights. It's the basic fact that it's the person, and not the property, being haunted {tormented} that Peli is revelling in. With a slow build sense of dread, Peli plants us in a one room scenario, at first it's a noise here and there, a moving door, was that a shadow? Until nerves are frayed to such an extent one finds the eyes darting from side to side afraid of not just missing something, but afraid of actually seeing something! Quite a trick from the first time director. It all builds to a shattering climax, regardless of the ending one has witnessed since there's three known endings out there!If one invests fully into the mood of the piece the rewards, and scares, are bountiful. It's not a film for the Hostel and Saw crowd, it's one for those who were chilled by the likes of The Entity and The Haunted, only this is infinitely far better than both of those film's put together. With it's one location set-up-two earthy unknown actors and stunning use of audio, Peli's $15,000 piece is a pant filler of a movie. Simple in structure and execution it may be, but the result for those inclined is one of this decades best horror movies. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Great movie, just not for this generation.","Truly a great movie. I'm 15, and everyone I know that saw this thought it was lame and wasn't scary at all, except for the ending of course. But this generation of people have grown up with lame slashers, ridiculous gore movies, and other jump out and scare you movies that really don't leave an impact.Lets face it, unless its a killer clown that eats people with excessive gore and jumps out at you every 5 seconds, there isn't much that scares this generation of people. We are hard to scare now, I blame it on stupid 'horror movies' that are supposed to scare you for life. Paranormaly Activity uses old styles of scary movies, styles that will impact you for literally years to come. But thats whats NOT scary about this movie, is that it uses 'old styles.' While it definitely left an impact on me, as I hesitate to find out whats scratching at my door or whats the knock on my wall (kitty at the door, painting hitting the wall from the fan's air), the movie itself just didn't deliver as much as it was hyped up to. Because it didn't jump out at you or throw blood all over you, it wasn't scary. This generation has lost what scary is. To me, movies like Alien and The Shining are scary and impact you, they use suspense and the fear of not knowing. Paranormal Activity does the same thing and it would have been the scariest movie 25 years ago, but unfortunately, it was made now.Don't go to this movie and expect to be crying due to how scary its supposed to be.

You're constantly wondering what type of scary dealy is gonna go down next, and that mixed with the setting of a night-time bedroom being the main area where the haunts are going down, it makes the horror that much more intense. Unfortunately the flick suffered a wee bit from stupid-ass decision making, and an arguably weak ending. Honestly, with the decision making, I would have been screaming bloody murder from the roof-tops if even a tenth of what was happening to them was happening to me. I'd be on Oprah, Jenny Jones, Donahue...all the talk-shows in a heart-beat.

"Movie, shmovie, it still looks like a home video","It's a perfectly ordinary suburban house, and when Micah and Katie move in they seem to be a perfectly ordinary young unmarried couple. However, their nights are disturbed by things that go bump. There is an unseen presence in the house that seems increasingly malevolent. Then we learn it's not the house that is haunted, it's Katie. Apparently she has been stalked by this presence for about ten years, ever since she was fourteen. Or is it just the imagination of a disturbed young woman? Micah, brash and reckless, decides to investigate matters by making a movie of it (it's called ""Paranormal Activity""), Either he or Katie is behind the camera, filming almost everything. There is a stationary camera in the bedroom that keeps them under video surveillance while they sleep. For all his puffed-up bravado, Micah is actually thoughtless and self-centered: He is less in love with Katie than he is with having a live-in girlfriend, and as Katie becomes increasingly frightened, Micah withdraws from her emotionally, becoming increasingly determined to finish his film. What to Katie is the threat of demonic possession becomes to Micah a project. The bedroom camera records bizarre, inexplicable phenomena while they sleep, which are all the more chilling because they occur in silence and stillness. The inevitable climax nevertheless unfolds suddenly and unexpectedly.""Paranormal Activity"" was ""filmed"" with a digital video camera held by the actors themselves, or fixed on a tripod for some scenes. It's meant to look like a home video much of the time, and it does, although the special effects, though minimal, are really quite effective and scary. Unfortunately, the filmmakers make the mistake of assuming that because it COULD be made that way cheaply and quickly, it SHOULD have been made that way. Forty or fifty years ago, ""Paranormal Activity"" would have been an innovative experiment in cinéma vérité. But in the age of YouTube and ""America's Funniest Home Videos,"" with television sinking ever lower into the fetid ooze of banality under the weight of relentlessly proliferating reality shows, and with billions if not trillions of hours of home videos filling closets all over the world, a film made this way is just niggling. A number of scenes are also spoiled by the intermittently totally illogical behavior of the characters. However, one objection by other reviewers is unjustified: Why didn't the couple just up and leave when spooky things started to happen? Because, Katie explains to Micah, there's no point in leaving the house because the entity that is threatening her will just follow her wherever she goes.Like a lot of reality shows that pad 10 minutes out to half an hour, and like a lot of home videos, the film is slow and draggy a lot of the time. I've just watched ""The 4-D Man,"" a moldy oldie sci-fi movie from about 1960, and I noticed that the pace of the film was much slower than films made today. ""Paranormal Activity"" runs, or crawls, at the same slow pace. The filmmakers could improve it considerably if they hacked about 20 minutes out of it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"In my opinion, one of the scariest movies ever made.","So, the reason why I'm writing this review is because I'm seeing way too many bad reviews given about this movie. It makes me really wonder, how many of those reviewers did really EXPERIENCE PA, not just SEE it.Sadly, I have noticed that one of the main reasons people don't like this movie is because they didn't ""watch"" it properly. Yes, I'm talking about people who download it, then watch it from their computers and wonder why it was so boring and not scary at all. If you watched it like that, no wonder you hate PA.I saw PA in the cinema, and if possible, do the same thing yourselves. If not, grab the DVD/Blu-ray (or computer if you downloaded it, but I'd recommend either DVD/Blu-ray) and be sure to watch it with proper audio, not some silly computer-stereos or similar. A quality home-theater with at least 5.1 audio should do the trick with the volume at MAXIMUM. This movies tension is so much based on the atmosphere the sounds create, and thus watching it with low-volume will only ruin it. I'd prefer watching it in dark too.If you saw it (or will see it) at movie-theaters or watched it at home in ""the most movie-theater mimicking environment"", and still didn't like it, there's no helping it. People tend to like different kind of movies, different kind of horror etc. For example, I liked this movie a lot, and the movie I hate the most is Martyrs, which many people seem to like and which is a big-piece of crap in my opinion. PA and Martyrs are horror movies worlds-apart from each other. Note, my point is not to say that Martyrs is ""the worst movie ever"" nor that PA is better than it. My main point is that people like different things.There is one aspect still left that can make this movie a scary experience for you and that is: the less you know about the plot and happenings, the better it is. My tip is not to even watch the trailer or any similar media about it. I'd be stupid if I said that ""the better PA is the less you know about it"". Why would I be writing this damn review then?I you have already seen PA, I highly believe it won't be scary anymore on the 2nd watch, even if you liked it the 1st time or not. At least thats what happened to me. I found it scary only the 1st time I saw it in theaters, and after that it hasn't been that scary though I've watched it several times at home, volume maxed out and at night (had the volume so high that things started falling because of the bass, lol). It scares you to the bone only the first time you watch it.I didn't focus on certain things in the movie, like acting and stuff, because everything that matters to me in a movie is the entirety or ""big-picture"" it creates.I personally recommend this movie to any horror fan or average-Joe, but under the circumstances that you watch it in the PERFECT atmosphere and environment this movie deserves.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Pair's Normal Activity,"How Paranormal Activity can be listed as a ""horror"" film worthy of distribution or even attention is mystifying. It can be more accurately compared to being a security video of a home. As most people know, watching anyone but your own personal home videos usually drags on to the point of being frightening when forced to watch, but to pay for that kind of torture is haunting. This ""Pair's Normal Activity"" drags on even more, as you desperately wait for something, anything to happen, which sadly never arrives.Paranormal Activity tries to build on the same recipe of hype, genre and style as the Blair Witch. They both play on the premise that if you believe hard enough while watching, you may get just what you wished for. But with Paranormal Activity you have to force yourself to try to be intrigued to get some kind of drama. Which really means you are abnormally doing all the activity. Unlike Blair Witch, this film has no originality, drama, tension or suspense, and is of far worse quality.They carry a camcorder around, trading off filming each other, followed by using a tripod during their sleep. After an hour of seeing nothing, you start to go to sleep yourself.Human nature often invites us to slow down at traffic accidents to possibly view something unexpected. When horrible stuff actually happens we wish we had not looked at all. This movie has nothing unexpected or even entertaining to see, but you still wish you had never watched it.I would normally only recommend to NOT SEE a horror film to avoid the costs of your possible psychological counseling. For those great films, that is a compliment. Even the worst horror films are so bad they are at least fun to watch. However for this home movie, ""Paranormal Activity"", should be retitled, ""A Pair's Normal Activities"". In any case, I would still recommend a NOT SEE, but only because it is horrible.SUMMARY1) The trailer is scarier, and has all, yes all of the suspenseful shots from the movie anyway.2) There are so many other real entertainment choices on IMDb to pick from, hopefully you will go elsewhere.3) Remember ""The Emperors New Clothes"", well with this film, despite the hype, the king is naked!",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Is this what they're calling scary these days? Biggest load of tripe ever.,"Seriously, this is the crappiest movie ever. I cannot garner enough words to describe the contempt with which I hold this film. I have just lost an hour and a half of my life that I will never get back. Add to that the 10 minutes or so it takes to write this review. Yes, it is that bad.Who on earth, except for 5 year olds, can be scared by this pathetic excuse for a film? I hate horrors, for the simple reason that they fail to scare, but that's my beef. I loved horrors as a child, but then I grew up. They're not real and for that reason they never scare me. However, I can see why some may be scared by them or just enjoy them for thrills - although I think the point of horror is to scare. My daughter is terrified when she watches horror movies. She gets so completely wrapped up in them. For instance, Haunting in Connecticut scared the living daylights out of her. To me it was laughable, but I could see that it was well done and capable of inducing fear in people. However, my daughter and I have just sat and watched Paranormal Craptivity together, and she has just asked the questions: ""Seriously, is that it? Who hyped this film? Utter gash, absolutely dreadful"". It has to be really really bad for her to say that. It is completely unentertaining and remarkably dull. Perhaps the point, some may say, but it has to have something of interest if it can't be entertaining. There is nothing to hold your attention whatsoever.I actually liked the way it really did feel as if it could have been filmed in your own home. It did feel like the people were just having normal conversations like you and I would have, so I think they got that part right, but that cannot excuse what is an utterly dreadful film. That's really the best I can say about it and it definitely doesn't justify having to sit through it. I'm truly glad that I never listen to movie hype, because 99 times out of 100 the hype always lives up to it name and is just that - hype, or perhaps just tripe.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Fantastic Independent Film,"I would highly recommend reading the story behind the making of this film. It is great to see how this has become such a success for something done with a mere $15,000 budget.The movie was good, but I can't say I got scared until the last 15-20 minutes. That is when it really amped up and scared you. I don't watch many horror movies because 90% of the time they're plot less and stupid. This did have a plot and had some meaning and wasn't focused around gore to make it ""scary."" This was a film that used genuine scare tactics to frighten the viewer and I commend them for this.The last bit of the movie is worth watching the whole thing because I guarantee you won't expect what is coming.Also, something else ironic, at the very end, you'll notice them mention a date of October 11th, 2006.

Huh???,"I'm almost suspicious that the film company hired professional ""screamers"" to visit local showings of this film and scream at least three or four times at random moments. Because when I heard screams in the theater when I watched this film, I quite honestly didn't see or hear anything worth screaming about. The screams were all coming from the same people, too. Perhaps they're part-time theater employees (grin).Sadly, this isn't even a new movie. It was first shown at the ScreamFest 2007 horror festival - where they probably ALSO had paid (or volunteer) screamers planted in the audience. I suspect that Paramount was short on horror films this year (2009) and canvassed the ""indy"" scene for likely films they could buy up on-the-cheap. Then, they over-hyped the film in such a way as to attract people most likely to see a horror film. Mea culpa. I fell for the hype, too, just like everyone else.In any case, this movie left me flat - and $7 poorer, not counting the popcorn.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Brilliant blows Blair Witch out of the water,"Well what can i say about this film except OH MY GOD!!!! it was a casual Sunday afternoon when i saw the trailer for this film and immediately i was gripped by it, i have search for ages to find a horror film that will actually scare me to the point where i think twice about before i go to sleep. but this film ticked every one of my horror boxes. at first i thought it was going to go the way of Blair witch and basically be a lot of talk and no action but i was quickly mistaken. i love the actors who play the leading couple they just convince the audience that they are a really couple and all these events are really happening. the high light of this film for me has to be the bit where the demon basically drags Katie from the bed and down the hall, and this is the part that has stuck with me, the way she screams as she get dragged down the hall made shiver all over. I mean who wouldn't freak out if these events were happening to you. The films is slow in places but this just adds to the anticipation of the film, the slow bits are the bit you have to watch as this explains why these events are happening. I have also seen the alternative ending of this film and i think this is the ending which they should of kept, basically it show Katie standing over mika and then goes downstairs as she does in the original all of the sudden you hear the scream and mika running downstairs to find her, all of a sudden there is nothing and sudden you hear heavy foot steps coming up the stairs and suddenly the lifeless body of mika is thrown into the camera followed by a possessed Katie crouching over his body. sudden she looks into the camera and her face turns into a demon and bites the camera. well this is much better than the ending they have with her basically getting shot by gun happy cops!!!So well done to this and i hear they have already lined up for a sequel so please invite me to the premiere so i can be the first to see it",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

This movie does have some scary parts but come on, would you stay 3 weeks in a house that's so obviously haunted? Yet these people did. That and no budget or script or plot make this eighty six minutes and four dollars and ninety nine cents I can never get back.Truly AWFUL!

The Threat Began to Follow Me,"At first I found this about as tedious as anything I've ever seen. It was, of course, a home movie from a pretty much stationary video camera. The people do the things people do on a daily basis. It's one boring thing after another. However, as time goes along, we begin to be pulled into the nuances of the unfriendly spirit that haunts the young woman and her husband/boyfriend. What happens is not really life threatening or seriously significant through most of the film, but at some point, there is an overwhelming threat that permeates every scene and we begin to watch the two lumps in the bed, waiting for the next action. I will not spoil this movie. I will say that considering most of what goes on is cerebral and left to the imagination, I found myself staring at the screen. Neither character is very likable or even kind. His obsession with his camera would have driven most women out of that marriage. There is no compassion or concern for her well-being. Nevertheless, we don't have to like characters to profit from their experiences. Suffice it to say, they become caught up in their own shortsightedness and inability to overcome inertia. It's a fascinating little film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

When does the horror start,"After sitting through this 90 minute film, I was keen to read what other people thought of it. I am VERY surprised that people can actually rate this as good or say that it scared them! I found it tedious to sit through and was left feeling rather swindled by it. This is most certainly a case of a film been over-over-over hyped. The ending itself is absolutely ridiculous! It is the kind of ending that makes you think the writer/director or whomever suddenly thought: ""Where can we go now? How do we end this?"" I can see where the idea came from for this movie: MOST HAUNTED, GHOSTHUNTERS and all those other 'nightvision' ghost hunting extravaganzas, but for me, this format does not transpose to the big screen. I would not recommend anyone to spend money watching this in the cinema, save your money and go and see something better! In all, the film for me, lacked any atmosphere, likable characters and in fact, I couldn't have cared less what was going on by twenty minutes in. Since I had paid to see it, I was staying until the end, despite leaving the cinema feeling ripped off and totally disatisfied. Sorry to anyone who thought this was scary, personally, I find the original Amityville Horror more scary and Poltergeist more spooky.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Chilling, you will be shakened!","Just saw Paranormal Activity and it blindsided me with its effectiveness, jolts, sheer terror that I was literally shaking towards the end. To be honest the first couple of scenes didn't impress me and I was thinking great just another overrated The Blair Witch Project but as soon as they put the tripod in their bedroom to film these supposed hauntings while they try to sleep things change from ordinary to truly frightening that will have you grabbing your seat or someones arm in fear and it catapults from there on. I was impressed what they accomplished on such a small budget that puts high budget horror films to shame, Hollywood take note! See it in a packed house on a cold fall night or better yet wait for the DVD and watch it with your girlfriend or boyfriend in your own home and turn off all the lights and get ready to be shakened! Folks forget about The Blair Witch Project this is true terror and it is less shaky! I give kudos to the director and the two leads for displaying believable performances and craft, great job! We all should pat ourselves on the back for demanding this gem of a film and putting our voices out there which lead to a wide release and hope that this opens doors for other deserving films waiting for a release and has yet to be seen, so maybe they will finally release In Memorium a film that seems similar to this one. Overall it lives up to most of the hype but go in with low expectations and appreciate for what it is and what it accomplishes. What it accomplishes is how to build suspense and fear and it did one hell of a job which I can't say about most horror films and horror remakes these days. I rate Paranormal Activity a 4 out of 5! Another thing you need to know is that the less you know about this flick the better so stay away from reviews and let you be the judge and see it already!

Nothing happens,"The only thing I got out of this film was buyers remorse and disappointment. I sure as hell wasn't frightened by it.

Most of the movie is about this couples domestic problems. Nothing even interesting happens until the final 15 minutes of the movie, the rest of it is just filler. The theater shouldn't even be charging full price for what ever this is supposed to be. They need to prorate the ticket prices. Either way, times are tough.

Don't See It Alone,"Katie and Micah are a couple who've just moved into a new home. Katie believes that malevolent spirits have been following her since childhood, though Micah is not so easily convinced. However, after several nights of loud noises and strange happenings, Micah starts to agree with Katie that some sort of ghost may have followed them to the new home. Micah decides to take control of the situation and sets up a battery of video cameras so that if a spirit manifests itself, he can capture its behavior on tape.PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is a small, little horror movie that is getting a lot of buzz lately similar to BLAIR WITCH ten years ago. Let me start off by saying to not keep your expectations as high as the hype because the hype makes the film out to be the scariest film in the last decade and even the scariest film of all time, which is really ridiculous. Setting your standards based on the hype does the movie injustice. However, saying that, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY IS a good, scary film, which we rarely see in Hollywood these days. Oh, wait. This was PICKED UP by Hollywood. My mistake. Like BLAIR WITCH, the film starts off as if everything is fine which makes the scary scenes much more terrifying.Hitchcock once said that suspense is the ANTICIPATION leading up to the explosion of a ticking time bomb and the scare is the bomb explosion itself. The former part of that statement describes PARANORMAL ACTIVITY perfectly. Like BLAIR WITCH, the film is all about the build up of fear, starting off very subtle but slowly escalating as the story progresses and by the end, you're almost killed by the tension! No, the movie doesn't rely on cheap gore effects, gratuitous violence, or useless nudity. No, it doesn't rely on CGI or make-up effects. It relies heavily on your sense of imagination, which, ultimately, is the cause of your own fear.The film also has a real authenticity feel to it, especially the exchange between with actors Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat, whom both pull off very fine and realistic performances. Oh, and when you go home after the movie is finished, and when you get in your bed to sleep at night, good luck with that. This film not only makes you afraid of your own home, it effectively strips the securities of where you're suppose to feel the safest in the entire world the most: In your bedroom. A movie that makes you feel this vulnerable probably makes you want to see more of these films...or maybe less.However, if there's one thing I don't like about the film, it's the ending. The movie builds up so well that the ending ends up feeling very abrupt and so very disappointing because it almost comes out of nowhere. There was no catharsis. But other than that, the film is scary. I'm already starting to feel the after-effects. If a film can manage to scare you and the audience with creaks from a door and footsteps coming from another room, you know the film succeeded. See the movie because I'd rather see an inventive, clever movie like this do well than SAW 57...oh, AND because it's scary.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Paranormal Activity sucks balls.,"Take the Blair Witch Project, add in a little Exorcist, shake it around in a paper sack with equal parts bad MTV reality show and bad TLC haunting show and voilà! ... crrrrrrap.

Paranormal Activity is the movie The Blair Witch Project wanted to be and Cloverfield didn't even try to be.,"So, is Paranormal Activity any good? The movie was slated to start at 10pm on a Thursday night. On a hunch, I decided to show up at 8:30 just in case there was rush, and ended up being about 75th in line. Yup, lots of people in little college towns like free movies.Once they let folks in, every seat had a butt in it ""the little movie that could"" (with the help of a healthy dose of marketing acumen from DreamWorks) had sold out the house. The air was abuzz with electricity teenage girls were giddy with nervous excitement teenage boys had their chests puffed out and their swagger on. Everyone was ready for ""an experience"". Would it be a self-fulfilling prophecy? A few trailers for upcoming horror/thriller type movies ran ahead of the film, each one eliciting wild screams and hoots and howls from an audience so adrenalin pumped you'd think we were waiting for a prize fight to start. We could tell this was going to be a crazy night.When the film finally started (easy to tell, as per the choppy hand held home movie image) the crowd let out a scream as though The Rocky Horror Picture Show was rolling.And then the next ninety minutes were spent listening to teeny bopper girls squeal and scream and teeny bopper guys yell ""Oh sh*t, oh sh*t, oh sh*t!"" about every 90 seconds. Now I get it, it's a scary movie, screaming will happen. But seriously, screaming when a character turns out a light? Narrating the film with ""Oh f*ck she just went outside!""? Please. Grow up.But was it scary? In a word, yes.In more words, it's very scary. I had anxiety and adrenalin pumping through me like hasn't happened in a long long time. The film does a great job of building tension, of offering cues to impending action in the form of a Jaws-theme-esquire rumbling baseline as something ""paranormal"" is about to happen. It does a great job of developing characters, their relationships, and the destructive effects the growing threats have on them. And it does it all in a way that does probably the best job of any movie employing the ""auto-chronicled narrative conceit"" (yes, I believe I just coined that term, tell a friend) has done to date.Paranormal Activity is the movie The Blair Witch Project wanted to be and Cloverfield didn't even try to be.

"The Rare Quality of Quiet and Anticipation, Even Nothing Going On.","Paranormal Activity is a cunning little horror film, so well made it's authentically creepy, that comes insisting it's the real thing. Without any sort of traditional opening or closing credits, it opens by thanking the families of the two central characters and closes with one of those Current Whereabouts Unknown title cards and a screen of copyright notices. This was ostensibly a film made without a director, a writer, a producer, sound, catering, grips, makeup orwell no it does have a cameraman. All of the footage is shown like it had been found afterward.As in Blair Witch, Rec, Quarantine, Cloverfield, et al, the plot gimmick is that one of the two characters recorded it himself. There isn't a single shot that defies that premise, even if certain ones appear practically unfeasible without other hands on the camera, but I may be wrong. A grad student and a day trader who've been together three years have now moved into a house in San Diego that doesn't look much occupied. It's well enough decorated, yet everything seems recent and there's no untidiness. Micah meets Katie out front one day by filming her on his new video camera, which she finds bulkier than his other one.They've been disturbed by auspices of some kind of ghostly goings-on in an upstairs bedroom. Micah's brilliant spark is to film in the house, leaving the camera rolling as a quiet watchman while they sleep. Like any man with a new toy, he grows consumed in this idea, the bottom line, for him, isn't Katie's despair but his movie. After one significant shock, she asks him doubtingly if he indeed went back to pick up his camera. One advantage of the plot gimmick is that for extended stretches of time the camera is apparently left on with no one running it. It's on a tripod at the end of their bed while they sleep, and we watch occurrences while they're sound asleep. Some of these things are considerably minute, and I won't outline any of them. The basis that they occur anyhow is the key. That they appear to occur by themselves, observed by a fixed camera, makes them scary, particularly because there are some shots that look beyond the bounds of possibility without special effects, and there's no discernible sign of any, looking as carefully as one can.He is usually off camera. She is in front of it in nearly every shot, and for all intents and purposes you could say that this is a predominantly one-woman show, and of Katie Featherston's performance it's sufficient to claim it is excellent for the aim of this film. She's not Emma Thompson, she's a young woman who looks and talks completely like she might be an everyday college student who has newly moved in with her boyfriend. Micah acts, well, precisely like a man. The sort who still has a rock band at thirty. Katie has been disturbed by some kind of ghostlike apparition since she was a child, and now she's gravely bothered, and Micah's reaction isn't much concern but a resolve to get it all down on camera. Nearly all horror movies are about teenagers for purely commercial reasons, and this film has the quality of showing us completely and totally relatable young people.I of course know thanks to IMDb that Paranormal Activity does actually have a writer-director, Oren Peli, and naturally other technical credits. Though akin to The Blair Witch Project, with which it's of course likened, it goes near and far to look like a film found after the fact. It succeeds. It demonstrates that quiet and anticipation can be more engrossing than machine-gun fast-cutting and manic effects. For long durations here, not a thing is going on, and trust me, you'll be paying strict attention.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
So scared I couldn't move after wards,"I went to see this movie tonight,and to tell you the truth i thought it was actual footage the entire time. The story was very convincing, yet very realistic. It lacked all of the scary costumes, and Halloween b.s. yet still kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end. I think what scared me so much, is that this movie could happen to anyone anywhere. I'm a horror fan, yet often times i find movies either over the top, unrealistic, or not entertaining, and not believable. Let me just say that, i do believe in ghosts, as well as demons, and i spend a lot of time watching ghost hunters, paranormal state, and things of that nature. I think if you're a fan of ghosts, or have ever seen one, you'll be a fan of this movie. If you don't believe in that sort of thing, or can't consider ghosts or spirits a possibility than it probably isn't for you.

I personally loved how it was more horror than gore, since most movies these days hide gore as horror. It leaves it up to your imagination, and you're really on the edge of your seat throughout the movie wondering what happens next. I loved it, an absolute classic that must be watched by all horror fans, and I don't trust anyone who says otherwise. My only complaint was that the ending was rather funny.

Im waiting for a refund!!!! i loved true romance and pulp fiction.they were scary even Michael Jacksons thriller was scarier than this movie. i think this guy just bought his camera and didn't know how to use it,he should have made a funny movie, because this was a laugher.the teenage girls sitting in front of us were laughing most of the movie. i wanted to leave the theater-and would have if it weren't for my grandson being there",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Perfect movie,"One of the best horror movies I've ever seen. It contains everything that describes a perfect movie: growing tension, climax, resolution. While watching it you will never know what's ahead. It's totally unpredictable. And that's great.Two great actors made astonishing work in convincing us that everything what they tell is true.The whole technique of filming this movie just helps to convince the viewers in the reality of the events.This movie can and must be stand along with Blair witch project, among those greatest horror/thriller movies. It's not one of those primitive horror movies, this is a masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Boring as hell, 1:40 hours wasted completely.","I respect movies that are made with no budget and great ideas. This film is not one of them. It features more than an hour of two people bickering and doing daily boring stuff. After that even the demon gets annoyed and acts out. Does that mean that the last half hour is a gruesome blood fest or something that is so scary that can keep you up at night? No. I actually tried to stay awake and failed.So let me save you the trouble. There is this couple thinking they may be haunted so they prepare with a camera and a laptop to document whatever is going on. Almost nothing does go on until 1 hour and 10 minutes into the film. Maybe watching it from there makes some sort of sense.Bottom line: I can't (I am trying hard right now) imagine any situation where I could be made to like this movie. If I were in a cinema, I would probably leave or snore half way through. Stay away from this over-hyped poc.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Pure Garbage for the ""Youtube Generation""","Testament how degenerated today's movie audience is. The ""youtube"" generation makes it possible to leave out all elements which otherwise would make a movie good. Good times for movie makers. Now you can make a $500 movie and make millions with it. Just don't forget to hype it up enough on ""teh internets"". Hype is always good, especially if it goes viral.People will buy it.Testament how easy it is to pull people's money from their pockets - and it doesn't' even need actors who can ACT - all it needs is a camera and some string to move doors.I had to laugh reading some reviews stating that the acting was ""100% real"". It was not. The acting was as fake as the whole, cheaply made movie, as fake as the trailer.The only think NOT fake about the movie is the effort which went into making the movie go viral online, to appeal to a ""youtube generation"" which does seem to accept anything, even if it totally lacks any movie quality standards or (acting) skills.This movie is a testament how over-saturated the current movie-watcher generation is - how easy it is to manipulate and hype, a testament that intelligent PR and viral marketing can literally make millions if done right.

Largest waste of popcorn I've ever seen.,"How on earth this movie has been hailed as the scariest movie ever is beyond me. There wasn't one point in the movie that I ever thought about being scared. It was nothing more than a pathetic attempt at a horror movie. Think back to the Blair Witch, because that's all this really is. Now remove the darkness, the screaming, and the 1 or 2 suspenseful parts and you have this movie. The camera work is a little better, but that doesn't say all that much. If the Blair Witch scared you or even made you jump a little then definitely make sure to waste your money on this garbage.

Sleepless nights,"I almost feel guilty about giving a 10 especially for a low-budget movie, but the world knows by now: This movie delivered all there is to be delivered in the horror genre.Or actually: like most horror movies there's a big divide here in the audience - it always seems to be even bigger when it comes to the so called found footage movies.I can hardly believe that a 6,3 is all this movie got on IMDb. But I guess that's just it: A lot of viewers don't get anything at all out of a movie that was cheaply produced and doesn't have a lot of special effects, gore or monsters.Then there are the others like me: In the back of my head I seem to believe in demons, because this movie left me with the deep conviction that I'm not safe in my own house and in my own bed anymore. I didn't sleep well for a number of nights after having seen it. That's all I have to say because most of the rest there is to be said about this film is common knowledge. Don't trust anybody who says it was boring: See and decide for yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Two marks for effort, zero for everything else...","Whilst I have to admire the fact that Oren Peli made this film for around $15,000, and is now, very probably on his way to becoming very, very wealthy as a result of the films current box office performance in the US, this does not mean that the film is actually any good. Usually, a key factor to liking a film is having some kind of emotional link to the characters - you like them, you don't like them, you love them, you don't. With 'Paranormal Activity', and Katie and Micah, there is simply no connection. What we are presented with are the two biggest half-wits ever to grace the cinema screen. Within five minutes, you are almost willing the entity (or whatever it is) to harm these people so that it can all be over and you can leave. Unfortunately viewers are then made to sit through watching two wooden, unrehearsed actors giving unrealistic performances in a situation than should be striking real fear in their hearts. Eventually there IS a bit of excitement, but by this point I was past caring - it was far too late into the film, and very anticlimactic. True, the new ending (showing in the theatrical version) is better than the earlier one, but only marginally. There is much more that I would like to say, but this would give away spoilers, and I don't wish to do that. Believe me, though, that if I did, it wouldn't spoil your enjoyment of this movie, because there is no enjoyment to be had. OK, people are throwing around comparisons to 'Blair Witch' and 'The Last Broadcast', but those two films were skillfully made and this one simply isn't. Very dull indeed.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
childhood fears,"This film took me back to my childhood when I was sometimes allowed to stay up and watch the 'late film'. Everything in this film depends on your imagination, the understanding that what you can't see, what you don't know, is potentially the most horrifying thing you will ever experience. It is not a horror film in the modern sense (modern being the blood/slash/kill/scream films), and I can understand those who will dismiss this film as over-hyped. Now I can sit through the saw/hostel paint by numbers horror/torture porn, appreciate what they have done and have a good nights sleep, but Paranormal Activity played on my mind as I turned out the lights and therefore it has worked. Of course there are moments that don't work, that make you think 'why don't they just...', but there are in every film. The true horror of this film is that it makes you think of what might be lurking outside your bedroom door rather than showing you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Simple but good,"I mean to be honest - this movie is really good.Look at it: It has 2 main characters, 1 house (1 location), 2 other characters, 1 camera and thats it! And if you look at these circumstances a movie with this ""equipment"" couldn't be better. I mean only 2 main characters and they lead the story by over 90%. It is really good. The acting appears to be quite natural like if it had really happened which raises the tension quite good. Their whole behavior and the situations are quite realistic in their ways and make that whole movie really enjoyable, more like a documentary about a spooky house - but longer and not that artificial. I liked it because its different, because its simple and it proves that good movies don't have to have a big budget or anything.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Don't believe the hype. Extremely disappointing.,"When I was buying my ticket for this movie, there was a kid who had just seen it at the counter asking for his money back. I figured he was just a crank, but I walked out agreeing with him.I don't understand the hype around this extremely forgettable, not-very-scary movie. Somebody out there is obviously a top notch marketer, because this film doesn't deserve any sort of buzz whatsoever. I'm fine with low budget/low production values - I loved Blair Witch Project - and even very slow, subtle horror films that work more by what they don't show than what they do. But this movie is mostly long, drawn-out sequences of absolutely nothing happening. There's a lot of scenes of a couple arguing, though, if you find that scary.There are a tiny handful of quick ""jump out and say boo""-type scares, most of which you can see coming long in advance. No suspense is built, unless showing a stock campfire ghost- story trope every twenty minutes or so is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat for an hour and a half. I certainly heard many more people in the theater laughing at this film than sounding frightened. I was not scared or entertained, at all. It's just a poorly-told story.I'm looking at this and hardly believing I find myself writing such a negative review, about anything... I love movies, and I really love horror movies. I have almost never seen a movie that really I thought wasn't worth paying money to see. But this was one of the most disappointing, least rewarding movie-going experiences I've had in a long time - and given the buzz, it was bad enough that I really felt I wanted to spread the word. If you're a horror buff, and heard this was the ""scariest movie ever"", prepare to be very disappointed.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It's one of the best. Don't listen to the haters.,"I don't know what people are so peeved about that they even create accounts just to down vote this. If this doesn't scare you, I think you should stop bothering. I'm not saying everybody will get as affected as I did but if this movie really does not scare you at all, which one does? Seriously, message me and tell me.I'm not a huge fan of horror movies because there usually is a killer, zombie or some lunatics involved and that does not touch me at all. Like some said before: It's so scary because you cannot see it.You need the right mindset for this. First of all (as you should always do) keep your expectations low. Don't expect to get shocked every time it seems to happen. I think a lot of people couldn't handle the very slow increase in suspense (and some are probably just those guys, who start making fun about everything that's happening on the screen because they don't want to get scared but look like the tough guy instead).P.S. The 2nd one is really good as well, 3 & 4 kinda do the same thing but with dull endings.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A very clever and creative scare-fest.,"Well, Paranormal Activity. This is an interesting film to talk about because I didn't even go because of any hype. In fact, I had never heard of it and only went because I happened to be in London one day and discovered that it was on in a cinema near to where I was. Being better choice than Full Moon, I decided that it was the only decent thing on and went to see.The general story follows a couple in San Diego, Katie and Micah. Katie has been followed by a ghoulish entity for a long time, and it has inexplicably re-appeared. Micah decides to record the goings-on at night and bravely - but foolishly - tries to see if he can fix the problem. Gradually because of his recordings and attempts to communicate with it, the creature - revealed to be not just a ghost, but a demon, ups the ante and increases it's terrorising actions in the night, until...well you'll have to watch the film.The film gets a bit boring in between scares, and sometimes you know the demon is coming in the night shots when you hear a slow rumble you know something is going to happen, though some things that happen are scary enough to still freak you out. With only a couple of characters, the acting is far more intense, and unlike many others, you find yourself giving a (beep) about these characters unlike most horror films where they are just meat for the grinder.The true strengths that this film is built on are not so much what happens, but the ideas that are portrayed, that tap into your primal fears. From something that goes 'bump' in the night, to more extreme noises, violence being done on you while you sleep, being stared at for long periods of time while you sleep, someone you know, love and trust turning on you all of a sudden, and the fact that it happens in an ordinary house like, say, for example, Yours!Very little is shown until the end - although that largely depends on what ending they show you - and that is what makes it scary. For me, I found that the scariest thing about the movie was that many of the things it showed involved the imaginary night time scenarios that I've always feared in my darkest nightmares!Of course some people don't find it scary, but it depends on what floats your boat. If you're a gorehound, don't bother because there is almost none, otherwise, take a look! Sleep tight!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Complete Garbage,"I have never in my life hated a movie or a video game or anything so badly that I gave it a ZERO out of 10. Paranormal Activity changed that. (Well okay, technically I gave it a 1, but in my mind, I just gave it a zero because there is nothing good about this movie.) The movie was absolutely terrible. I was bored out of my mind for the entire movie. Half the scenes in the movie were the two main characters (a couple) bickering (and no one pays for a horror movie to see people bicker--unless they die as a result of or shortly after they bicker). The other half of the scenes (the ones that were supposed to be scary) was just sitting around for a few minutes waiting for something to happen. And then something incredibly lame (on the order of furniture moving by itself) would happen. I actually found myself checking my watch every few minutes to see how much longer I'd have to suffer through this. (30 minutes into the movie, I considered walking out of the movie as a result of the excruciating boredom, but I decided against it since I was here with friends and they needed to give me a ride home.) The ""scary"" scenes themselves were pretty underwhelming. Aside from the fact that they were so few and so short and so lame, they were completely predictable, completely cliché. Every ""scary"" thing that happened I could see coming from a mile away, and my reaction was more of ""seriously, that's the best they could come up with?"" rather than one of fear. The sole exception, the one time when something happened that I didn't expect, it actually amused me to the point that I burst out in laughter. Only the most sheltered of people would find this stuff scary. Either that or people who come in with the mindset of wanting or expecting to be scared. But someone in that mindset could also be scared by your friendly neighbor saying ""hi"".The movie has been described to me by multiple sources as ""weird sounds in the middle of the night"". Yeah, I hear weird sounds at night every frickin' night, and I'm still not scared. Maybe if a monster jumped out and dragged me out of my bed, then I'd be scared. But I'd be scared of getting dragged out of my bed by a monster with or without this movie.Maybe all of this garbage would have been worth it if there was a nice payoff at the end. But no, the payoff was literally in the last few seconds of the movie. And to top it off, that payoff was something I'd already predicted as soon as the movie began.Now don't misunderstand me. I love horror movies. I even enjoy the really really bad ones. But even I hated Paranormal Activity. It was painfully boring, predictable to the point of cliché, and simply not scary at all. I'll even take a page from the book of Comic Book Guy and call it the Worst Movie Ever.I don't regret it, though. I actually love writing reviews about grossly overrated pieces of entertainment where I just completely trash them. And Paranormal Activity gave me that opportunity.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
what a let down...,"when i first found out about this film i was so excited to see it. Upset that it wasn't playing at any local theaters in my area i did what the site wanted. I demanded it. I read all of the comments on IMDb and was really impressed that it was rated at an 8.6. wtf? really? an 8.6? i understand that people might get scared because it looks like it could happen. Some people even think it is real because of rumors, much like those of the blair witch project. This movie was SLOW! Even when there would be some action it would last for about 30 seconds and then cut to the morning and again it would be slow. This movie could have been much better. little things thrown into the movie made it less believable. Examples: the picture in attic, them not leaving, the boyfriend being completely retarded.The movie had its moments, but overall save your money and wait until DVD.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scares Aren't Everything...,"""Paranormal Activity"" starts off with the two protagonists, Katie and Micah, living a happy life together in a nice home in a pleasant suburban neighborhood. Getting a good night's sleep soon becomes difficult as Katie explains to Micah that something has been haunting her. Shortly after, Micah buys a rather expensive video camera to see if he can catch some sort of video evidence of Katie's haunting. For the first few nights, Micah captures some startling noises and shadows occurring in and around their room. Throughout the day, Micah discusses the events that occurred that night with Katie. As more nights pass, the previously happy couple learn that they are not only being haunted, they are being very closely watched by something more sinister than they ever imagined.Although saying ""Paranormal Activity"" is the scariest movie of all time may be a bit of an exaggeration, it is certainly a very good movie. True to old Hitchcock movies such as ""Psycho"", ""Paranormal Activity"" relies more on tension and suspense than actual scares. Saying that ""Paranormal Activity"" is the most suspenseful movie of all time may be more appropriate.Just when you think something scary is going to happen, absolutely nothing happens (sometimes). This is part of the beauty of ""Paranormal Activity."" Oren Peli doesn't need CGI or intestines getting splattered all over the walls to make, for example, my very manly friend cover his eyes.The acting Katie and Micah (their actual names) is so top notch that it makes you feel as if you are watching a real life couple. This adds to the creepiness of the film.""Paranormal Activity"" starts off a little slow, but it eventually picks up pace. Throughout the first half of the movie, there is some really superb character development with some surprisingly funny dialogue. For all you people that want to see a scary movie, fear not, ""Paranormal Activity"" gets very scary, especially within the last 30 minutes.With a budget less than 15000 dollars and shooting the entire film within a week, Oren Peli has achieved an outstanding accomplishment. Highly recommend. 9/10 Stars",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Wait for the dollar theater,"Me and my friends, true horror nerds to the core, could not wait for this movie. Much like with Cloverfield, we saw the advertisements and viral campaign on the horror blogs and youtube, and were crazy in love with this movie. Also much like with Cloverfield, we left the theater with a cold feeling of hatred deep in our hearts -- hatred for the mainstream turd that is the modern horror.The movie itself was wonderfully presented. The ""less is more"" approach to this movie -- both in special effects and in scripted dialog -- is exactly what most modern horror films need. The ""acting"" was well enough (if improve really can be considered acting), and the tastes of comedy during the daytime portions of the movie truly amused me.Good production, good comedy and acceptable acting only make a mediocre film at best. The idea of demon possession has been done before, the fauxumentary approach has also been done before -- and with the Exorcist and Blair Witch Project as obvious comparisons, one needs to perfect their pizazz in order to compete.This is where Paranormal Activity fails.The pacing was unbearably slow. Knowing that the movie was just outside of an hour and a half, I was expecting a lot more supernatural and lot less ordinary. Instead, I painstakingly awaited a scene where anything happened. Once it came, it was another long wait for it to have any significance on the plot whatsoever.The characters were unlikeable. When you present a victim in a film, you're supposed to make the audience feel connected to that person so that they have an emotional stake in the outcome of the film. Micah comes off as nothing more than a big immature jerk; the girl (can't even remember her name) comes off as whiny, controlling, and helpless. Neither one of them contribute to the story in any way, and when you sever the feeling of ""this is me"", you get an audience that doesn't care what happens to them. Or somebody who starts cheering on the bad guy, which really ruins that feeling of tension all that slow pacing was trying to build.Oh yes, and a tried and true trick of the trade? Your lead characters are supposed to lead your audience's emotions. When your lead characters respond to a haunting playfully, indifferently or by goading it, then your audience is going to fall into that mindset. ""This is a game; this is fun; this is not scary."" Paranormal Activity will probably provide some cheap scares for the timid, unexperienced (with horror movies in general), or those with pre-existing phobias to darkness, close spaces or hauntings. I would not recommend this film to anybody else.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Terror of Demons,"There's a scary feeling with a psycho killer on the loose but what if there is no killer just an evil spirit or demon it's truly terrifying.Katie has been terrorized by demons ever since she was a child and now having moved in with boyfriend Micah things have begun getting creepy once more therefore they bought a camera and set it up in their room. However the opening scene is boring and gives the sense of a true story. But strange things occur and loud bangs and noises are heard during the night.Micah appears eager to stop this by connecting with the demon. Katie however wants to contact a doctor, psychologist or an exorcist for help. Katie gets possessed by the demon and cannot control her actions or thoughts during the movie.DONNOT WATCH IT ALONE AT NIGHT!!!!! Watch it with subtitles to hear all the noises. The ending shown is better than the alternate ending (shown in Special Features) as it is creepier and leaves the viewer in fear especially as the viewer gets the impression it's based on a true story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

44 of the 62 Pages of Reviews RATE THIS A 3/10 or LOWER...Real HORROR Fans will find it BORING!!!,"So, this film showed up on TV & I watched it....FOOL ME (i'd heard & read some of the hype & reviews at the time but something niggled me about it which is why years later this was my first viewing of it)I am a HORROR fan & wondered if it was something different & unique? I guess in a way it was but not in a good way although the hand held camera-work had been done before in the slightly better ""Blair Witch Project""This was NOT for me or I would guess true Horror fans, it's slow, boring & not in the least bit frightening.Now I know this was a low to no budget movie so kudos to the makers for making it and somehow making this a solid hit & probably making themselves tons of money but I just don't get it!!!In the Cinema maybe it had some kind of collective experience? I think there are 3 sequels to this film!!! and even though i'm a Horror fan I think i'll be leaving those alone.I shall be sticking with the likes of ""The Fog"" (Original 1980 version ONLY) which has real style, atmosphere & chills & even though this too had a low budget just look what John Carpenter did with it.If ever a FOG BANK happens around your area then you simply have to watch ""The Fog"" Blu-Ray or DVD as it gathers around you...Look outside at around 10 minute intervals & I swear to god it will give you ALL THE CHILLS & SCARES you need...Now that's quiet an experience you won't forget, unlike this!!! And that chance might only come around once in a lifetime but YOU MUST DO IT.I was lucky enough to be watching ""The Fog"" on TV whilst a Fog Bank drifted in over our area & I swear to god it's like a scary fun fair ride... Unbelievably Atmospheric & Chilling (Also, I dare you to step outside while it's on but look out...BLAKE is out there somewhere)Sorry to focus on ""The Fog"" so much here but that was real classic SCARY movie making this sadly was NOT. Credit must go to the distributors though for marketing this film, it looks like they did a unbelievable job (3 sequels!!! really!!!)I'm amazed it rates above a 6 and that it got these sequels made (probably because of the profit margins)My Rating is a 1/10 NOT for the film itself but the fact that it got made by low budget filmmakers and was then actually accepted for cinema release & somehow made tons of money.The film itself is seriously a 0/10 I never thought i'd rate a film a 0I'm not one for BANNING films and this has no serious problem scenes (if only) that would disturb anyone but it does have ONE major problem which is....It's INCREDIBLY BORING!!!So I propose that ALL TV STATIONS (in ENGLAND at least) NEVER EVER SHOW THIS FILM EVER AGAIN on TV.Oh and I find it amazing a film can rate so high when 44 of the 62 Pages of Reviews actually give this film a rating of 3 out of 10 or less (most of these are 1's and 2's)That's approx 72% of Reviewers think this is a STINKER...72%!!!Just 18 of those 62 pages had reviewers that rated it a 4 or higher.This film gets an Oveall rating of just over 6!!!But the math is stacked luckily in it's favour It's real average rating is probably around the 3 or 4 as some crazy minority give it a 9 or 10...Who are these people???

Orijinal idea,"I do not know why most of the movie fans judge horror films unfairly. They claim that the most of the horror films have a same subject and not very effective, but the demons,genies and spirits are accepted by most of the common religions so producers are choosing these subjects to make films very effective.Paranormal Activity could have a same subject either,but the most important thing with this film is the idea of the ""amateur camera"". I think this makes the film very effective and original. Paranormal became my second favorite horror film. I offer everyone to watch it ,especially for the horror film fans.

I can't believe I sat through the whole movie.,"Look, I get that character development is important, but this was a little excessive. I'd estimate that 90% of that movie was just an in-depth look at the relationship between the couple. I get it, he's a good boyfriend. Him making fun of the situation was the only thing keeping the movie going. I will admit that the acting was good - they were pretty believable.However, although the concept has potential, it is not novel and they did nothing to make it any more interesting. I kept expecting the movie to take a turn and become more intense, but it never did. I'm curious about how much of that movie was just them sleeping in bed.I'm just really disappointed. If anyone is freaked out by paranormal behavior, it's me... but this movie was slow and didn't play on my fears enough. I feel like it's a huge scam. The whole ""demand this movie in your area"" thing, and some of these comments, it seems like someone was paid to write positive things about this movie. I saw this tonight and the movie theater was packed - and more people were making fun of the ""scary"" moments than actually being scared by them... but those moments were so few and far between that it's kind of hard to say.I'm upset that I paid $10.50 to see that movie when I imagine it cost them practically NOTHING to make.

B*o*R*i*N*g  B*o*R*i*N*g  B*o*R*i*N*g  B*o*R*i*N*g,"In short, the movie is 90 minutes of painfully boring build up with no pay off. When it started I was thinking, OK this is how a good horror movie starts: slow, boring, and normal. Then stuff is supposed to happen. The problem with this movie is nothing ever happens. The characters talk, and bitch, and moan, and groan, and knit, and read, and bead, and watch TV, and sleep, and walk, etc etc. Occasionally, a door will move on its own, or a blanket will blow, or the woman will sleep walk...ooooo scary stuff. It's like watching a film of a normal person's life: deadly dull. Which would have been fine is something happened near the end.Trust me, if you watch this movie, it will end and you will think 'well that was disappointing'.I suppose if I had liked the characters, and found their conversations amusing or interesting in some way, the movie may have been worth my time. The characters are completely unlikeable though, and very boring. The man is an a-hat, and very dumb, and thinks way too much of himself. The woman is completely humourless, acts stunned most of the time, and spews inane dialogue. She lets him use her back door though, so I guess shes not all bad.Oh, and the production values are abysmal. If you have any problems with shaky cameras, stay far away from this movie. It made my wife sick and gave me a headache. She actually stopped watching half way through, but I kept thinking something cool/scary is about to happen. There were virtually no special effects, unless you think having a door move by itself is special.I am also thinking that these 8/91/10 out of 10 reviews have all been astroturfted, and it makes me reconsider using IMDb as a guide for movie reviews.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Much Better Than I Anticipated,"I just watched this from Netflix and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. It is a very very simple movie. It is basically an episode of Ghost Hunters or Ghost Adventures that actually has stuff happen. The characters are fairly likable. I did have issues with the boyfriends stupidity. Egging on the demon, bringing out a weegie board... The night scenes were very creepy and I had a strong sense of dread every time they went to sleep and set up the camera. There is nothing scary looking in this film, it's all noises and mysterious goings on. This kind of scary may not work for you, many may find it lame. But for me, letting myself go, the demonic footsteps creeped me out. If you're one to over analyze or can't get past the fact that'it's not real, that's just a crew member thudding in the hallway' then this isn't something you should see. As I said, very very simple. Bumps in the night. The ending is sudden, I wasn't expecting that to be the ending. Creepy. Fun, simple creeps to be had here.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Deserves an Oscar for hype,"Sorry to say I believed the hype and blew 8 bucks. I shoulda gone to the cinema next door and seen THis Is It with Jacko. Paranormal Activity was an absolute piece of crap... predictable, slow, slow, and slow. The scariest thing about this movie is that so many people have bought the hype and gone to see it. I've seen student films that are much better. My fault - I'm too trusting in reviews. What are these people smoking? I've seen scary movies before, all the way from the original The Blob to Blair Witch. Scary should be an emotional reaction, a complete involvement with the characters, the story, the premise. And every movie needs a story and a premise, not a one line summary like ""this couple is in a house, the guy's a geek about video cameras, and his girl friend is possessed."" Out of the 90 minutes, 80 of it seemed like they were sleeping, as I was. There should be federal guidelines on how much you can fool the public, kind of like the financial meltdown when rules were broken and ignored. If that were the case, everyone who worked on the publicity for this film would be doing time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An incredibly surprise,"I knew this movie was good from the start. A movie that starts with a camera guy filming his girlfriend can't be bad. To be a movie that has spent approximately 15k dollars to make it, it's an authentic masterpiece of the horror movie story. The movie could be not such interesting in the first time, but you must wait until the very ending, where all changes, but not in a way that can ruin the movie, no no no. It changes in a way that makes you to stand up from the sofa, couse it's very very scary. I repeat, for me it's a master piece of the horror movie story, and everyone has to take lessons from this guy about how to make a great horror movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A-Hit-and-A-Miss,"Paranormal Activity and its further installments are, without a doubt, despicable creations that shouldn't have existed or continued down the line. Unfortunately, that was and still is the case as the fifth sequel was released just last year. Paranormal Activity, alongside its predecessors, claim to be derived from true stories. Yet the directors seemed to have absentmindedly inform us that their films are loosely revolved around real paranormal accounts. I couldn't stomach the other one-third of this movie as it is rather bland and stale in taste. I couldn't relate to the characters and they weren't likable in the slightest. Character development was severely lacking as was the thin and recycled plot line. No scene convinced me that any of the proclaimed footage was actual evidence. I don't understand how people enjoyed this film or the sequels.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Boring at times and not scary,"I really didn't care for the long drawn out random video surveillance footage in which there was no activity. Then when there was any activity it was so painfully obvious that it was fake and phony. Their acting was terrible too. It doesn't even seem like a real family so much as bad actors hamming it up. I actually never really watched any of them series until now and just really disappointed in this film. I think this movie might interest very young teens but even they see cheap tricks like this on every day television. Also a lot of their reactions to activity doesn't seem like anything real people would do. I can't give any spoilers but there is one scene where one of the girls ran up stairs instead of out of the house. In real life someone that scared in a house alone would naturally run outside. I also resent how the TV trailers all made these films seem like they were real to trick people into going to see these stupid films. I wouldn't call them stupid if they hadn't played up how great they were. I mean they are mildly entertaining but the hype is what has made this series so popular because these CGI gags aren't anything people don't see each and every day on TV or internet clips. I'm seriously surprised that this terrible movie has been turned into a series of movies. Anyway as someone who does believe in the Paranormal I feel that silly films like this make anything supernatural seem laughable. I'm very dismayed that the American movie industry the last decade has leaned heavily on CGI as a crutch and there is a serious lake of anybody that can actually act. All I can think of is the movie Idiocracy when the fake movie called ""@$$"" was the top film of the year. ha ha ha",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I want my 86 minutes back!,"A friend of mine that haven't seen this movie just asked me about it since he had heard that it was supposed to be great. I of course told him that it's absolutely awful.

I see a rating of 7.0 and a bunch of comments praising this piece of garbage, seriously WTF is wrong with you people? I even saw someone comparing it to ""the exorcist"", jeez, that's called blasphemy..I didn't buy in to all the hype surrounding this movie, I knew it was low budget, similar to ""Blair witch project"". But on the other hand I thought I'd enjoy it since I usually find the paranormal both really interesting and scary.I watched it at home by myself late at night because I really wanted a good scare but I actually fell asleep about an hour into the movie and I never, ever fall asleep while watching a movie. I have no problem with the lack of special effects, psychological horror is by far my favorite, but this thing is just awful. Nothing really happens during the entire movie, the plot is practically non-existent, the mindless and annoying dialogs seems to go on forever, and there is absolutely no suspense or scary events whatsoever.

I simply cannot imagine how so many people not only thought this was a good movie, but that it was actually scary! Have you never seen any ghost movies before?

Top notch,"I rented this film on Itunes, to my surprise, it starts straight away, no opening credits or producer graphics. I'll start with the acting, perfect, I've never seen such great acting from fairly unheard of actors, it made you feel that they were just normal people which is exactly what the film was wanting you to feel. They both had pretty good camera skills as well as the film is recorded as though Micah was filming from his own HD camera. The storyline was fairly typical, but still kept me hooked on it. The special effects were subtle, mainly good, but sometimes were a bit simple, but in many ways that helped this film get it's 'feel'.I loved this film in the end, I was genuinely scared when the night scenes started, and really wanted the morning to come in the story. By the end, I nearly stopped watching it, my heart was pumping and of course, no credits, no music, no pictures, just a summary of what 'happened' afterwards, and a small disclaimer.

A Lesson in Minimalist Filmmaking and Captivating Storytelling,"""Paranormal Activity"" is a testament to the power of captivating storytelling and minimalistic filmmaking. From the outset, the movie grabs your attention, holding it firmly even if skepticism is your natural stance. The film's strength lies not in elaborate special effects or exotic locations, but in its ability to weave an engaging narrative with what seems like very little.The actors deliver solid performances, portraying characters that are at times foolish, misguided, and frustratingly human. This portrayal makes them relatable, allowing viewers to easily identify with their experiences and reactions, despite the supernatural context. Their authenticity adds a layer of investment to the suspense, drawing you deeper into the plot.What is truly remarkable about ""Paranormal Activity"" is its ode to creativity. It's astounding how the film manages to entertain and maintain interest with such a pared-down approach. The setting is simple, the effects are minimal, yet the impact is significant, proving that ingenuity can triumph over budget constraints.However, the film may not satisfy those in search of genuine terror. Its predictability and the fun, rather than frightening, nature of many events, dilute the potential for real scares. While there is a buildup of tension towards the end, it lacks the disturbing edge that defines more intense horror movies.In conclusion, ""Paranormal Activity"" offers a refreshing cinematic experience. It showcases how creativity and a compelling narrative can create an entertaining film, even with limited resources. While it might not leave you checking under the bed at night, it's a pleasant and intriguing watch that celebrates the essence of storytelling in film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A horror film at last thats actually scary,"When this film came out at cinemas i ignored it based on the fact that it seemed a bit simple and thought that these films are never scary, i don't believe in ghosts and if i was caught in a house with one i wouldn't run scared becoz they're only ever a bit of wind that could never cause you any harm. Anyway i rented it and i am so glad that i did. ITS BRILL. I've said Scream is my favourite film of all time but this film is scarier, esp if you let yourself an inch to believe that there are things we still don't have control over, that can't be seen but are there all the same. I'm not very easily scared but some of the stuff is genuinely frightening (i'm 22 and i've seen loads of horrors and never flinch) and it nearly made me want to pull up behind my duvet. The originality and imaginative dialogue from the two main actors gives it even more of a realistic feeling, particularly the guy, micah, who behaved just how you wouldn't expect in a horror film, he confronted the spirit, didn't take it seriously and when the spirit was seemingly in their presence stepped up and confronted the damn thing.

True story: I have tried to see this movie 4 times!,"I started watching it in the morning one day... and fell asleep 15 minutes into the movie.

It was painfully boring and cheesy.I *really* fail to understand what all the fuss is about.

Terrifying.Eerie.Good acting (surprisingly).Good story.Ambiguous ending.Good ending.Effective jump scares (though rare jump scares).Shocking.Good improvisation.The found footage style makes it even scarier.Etc...:Cons:
Not as good as the blair witch project.The found footage style might be annoying for a few people (not me).A little too short.Conclusion:
Scary movie that will certainly frighten you. Enjoy!!!!!Extra characters: 40

Psychological horror goes back to basics,"BWP-style chiller horror affects at a deeper and more cerebral level than the likes of Friday 13th.The hype: Paranormal Activity wasn't released in the UK till late 2009, but the blurb surrounding it was that it was a horror movie on a new level from the more traditional Hollywood fare. Furthermore, there was the 'do not see it alone' warning which only added to the reputation it was gaining.Shot in a Blair Witch 'real cam' style, Paranormal Activity likewise smoothly passed itself off as a documentary about individuals being caught up in haunting or terrifying environments, and the subsequent danger they found themselves in.The passage of text at the start strongly implies this is real footage of what happened when a young couple moved into a new house, aware the female protagonist had a history of being haunted. This move was 'an experiment' to lure the entity out and get hard evidence of its presence and a consequent cure.However, like Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity uses simple horror techniques, also seen in the Japanese original of Ring; it's not so much what is on camera which terrifies you, but what isn't.Much of the fear is left to the imagination - save for a few bumps in the night and the odd special effect, the majority of scares are inside the viewer's head.And that's the most effective method to really scare the watcher - who wants to see gore all over the place when you can terrify watchers purely by suggestion.There's also the 'is it or isn't it real' aspect, whereby the viewer, who knows nothing about the movie's origins, half suspects what is happening is real, and really was captured on camera. To this end the acting is more than adequate, and the bumps and sounds (and effects) are extremely effective.Paranormal Activity is a movie to watch knowing as little about it as possible, and preferably on your own.It is also the first movie for years to actually scare me, and achieve a 'watching through fingers' moment, for which it earns my respect and praise. And yes, that again was a 'what isn't on the screen, but is in your head' moment.It's not the best horror you will ever see, but it is a very, very good attempt and deserves praise for its simplicity and effectiveness at what it does.Recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The fact that this movie was regarded ""the scariest of all time"" must have been a hoax because everyone in the movie theater was laughing.

A creepy film with a superb build up of scares,This movie was excellent. It starts slow and has a bit of a low budget budget feel but as the movie progresses I was more and more drawn in by the atmosphere of the movie.By the end of the movie I could almost feel the panic anxiety which the characters feel and this is what a good horror movie without gore or abundant special effects should do.The acting is good enough (I'm not a purist who analyzes every move of the actors) because I was never really put off by stupid reactions or card board performances. Some actions of the movie characters remain questionable but I guess thats inherent to most movies.I recommend you watch this in a dark an quiet environment and I assure you'll have a great time.,8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"""Paranormal Activity""","""Paranormal Activity"" presents an unsettling and uncompromising reality. Without the context of a hype-fueled theatrical release or reviews like this, a believer in the supernatural could easily perceive the found-footage aesthetic as honest documentary. After all, it was made for only eleven thousand dollars, features one location, and a principal cast of two. The print that ran at the Bridge for last weekend's midnight screening was even bereft of credits. Nothing betrays the internal logic of the film, which is pretty cool in a decade of increasingly glib, grandstanding splatter flicks usurping the once-credible horror name.Comparisons will inevitably be drawn to ""The Blair Witch Project,"" or indirectly, ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" which are suddenly hot commodities in genre film-making. Among the most successful viral marketing campaigns of the last few years are those for ""Cloverfield,"" and ""District 9,"" both of which experiment with docu-narrative hybrids, and have, along with the recent DVD release of Spanish zombie film, ""REC"" (and its North American remake, ""Quarantine""), paved the way for ""Paranormal Activity,"" which distributor Paramount has apparently been sitting on since 2007, to finally see the light of day, figuratively speaking.But ""Paranormal Activity"" deserves to be seen on its own merit, and it delivers because first- time director Oren Peli has an intricate understanding of his audience. He establishes an intimately suspenseful atmosphere for his gradual exhibition of the paranormal, but anticipates the inherent silliness of the ghost story as well. The protagonists are live-in girlfriend/boyfriend Katie and Micah (Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat), the former of whom has had recurring encounters with the otherworldly, and the latter representing the audience as a giggly, playful skeptic. It's Micah's idea to purchase a camera and document the ghostly goings-on (along with some not-so-noble, good-humored alternatives for the bedroom- mounted recording device), and it goes a long way in creating a convincing scenario for the audience.Watching the couple sleep has a voyeuristic creepiness in and of itself, but the repeated use of a single brilliant angle, almost like CCTV footage, which places the camera over the foot of their bed, with a clear view through the open door into the shadowy hallway, with a digital time readout ticking away into the small hours of the morning, and with the occurrence of exponentially spookier incidents, viewers' eyes are left darting to every dark corner of the frame in taut anticipation.I don't intend to part with any hard details about the film, as even its trailer can't help but give away a little too much of what is best experienced with a clean palate. The precognition of certain scenes may unwittingly trigger a subconscious calculation of the structure by what has and has yet come to pass, and that sort of spoils it. As for the conclusion, it suffices to say Peli saves his most genuinely frightening moment for last, and again, the more surprises you leave for yourself, the better.Despite the excessive praise the film has received from the press and bloggers, insofar myself included, there are two minor issues that keep ""Paranormal Activity"" from receiving the fullest extent of my recommendation. First, the film is too long, with tension-killing exposition of relationship minutia that admittedly prevents the scares from growing stale, but wears out its welcome early on. The second is the occasionally questionable performance of Featherston. Neither issue has any serious adverse effect on film's accomplishments, but deserve mention nonetheless.Ultimately, ""Paranormal Activity"" is a film that lives up to the hype as long as you don't buy into all the hype. It's a genuinely creepy, crawly little film that will likely disarm you if you're not bracing yourself for it. It's a terrific haunted house spook-out that will probably see wide release in time for Halloween. If not terrifying, ""Paranormal Activity"" settles for shivery fun that'll give you goose bumps. And that's something I haven't gotten from a film in far too long.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Excellent bedtime movie,"If you're looking for a movie that puts you to sleep faster than a Michener novel, this will do the trick. It reminds me of the movies Mystery Science Theater liked to use.

Loads more ads than usual with the usual soundbites such as ""Scariest Movie of the Year"", and ""Completely Disturbing! You won't be able to sleep""2. Trailer featuring some potentially interesting premise.3. Trailer also featuring a covert cam that recorded the reactions of a cinema audience.4. A curious number of IMDb ""Comments"" that praised the film, and actually used the exact same soundbites as the ads! I mean, I must have been really really stupid to have expected a frightening film after all that. I was suckered in, and I am hoping that this review of the movie might in some way prevent someone else from falling for the same mistake that I made.If you're into the whole 'reality/shaky-cam' Blair Witch type of film, you might enjoy this, despite the fact that ever since the Blair Witch Project, you've had several copycat movies that rely on shoestring budgets and internet hype to propel them into the mainstream.Personally, I generally don't enjoy the shaky-cam genre. I give props to Blair Witch for the originality, & the viral method of extending the film onto the internet. Cloverfield was more satisfying movie, and the puzzles & cool hype building the movie up was well-thought. Paranormal Activity on the other hand is nothing more than a load of empty words, and an aggressive ad campaign. Honestly! It is exactly what I felt when I read some of the reviews here, and wondered if I had watched the same film.My main problems were these.The couple in the movie were very bland &unlikeable. There was absolutely nothing of interest about them. It's one thing to want to make a horror movie as real as possible, but at the very least, put some characters with a bit of charisma.The couple act stupidly. - At what point did the male have his common sense gland removed, and decide to stay with this drab woman who seems to be the centre of this haunting, instead of just dumping her and finding someone without any demonic issues? Why do they act either like loons, or completely blase about the phenomena?The demonic source - One of the things that drove me crazy about the whole Blair Witch thing was that people were saying how scary it was because you NEVER GOT TO SEE THE WITCH. - Ermmm...I must be missing something here, because I was under the impression that a horror film needs a good solid protagonist. Ultimately, I felt that this film just didn't have one.The usual jump scares. - If you've never watched a horror film, you'll definitely jump. If you've watched a few horror movies, you'll see them a mile off.The ending - I won't spoil it here, but the 'twist' is really poor. It borrows heavily from another movie I may have mentioned a few times in this review *ahem*, and it doesn't even do that very well at all. There's no psychological head-game, or campfire-tail twist. Just a bit of screaming, a predictable (and terribly handled) denouement that most movie buffs would guess anyway, then a blank screen & the mercy that it was all over.Honestly, I would like to say something redeemable about this film, but I wouldn't even bother to watch it again if it was on TV and I had nothing better to do, let alone pay good money for tickets.Please please PLEASE do not fall into the hype & soundbite/slogan-riddled ad campaign. Don't trust the trailer, which must have found the 100 most timid & sensitive souls in the world, & recorded their reactions to the movie. Don't waste your time & money on this wannabe copycat.

Brilliant minimalist chiller,"This is one of the scariest films I have ever seen at the cinema. As someone who liked The Blair Witch Project, I was happy for more of the same. But this film is a lot scarier. As each night of video taping approaches, I felt myself tensing up in my seat, dreading what might happen, knowing something would. The filmmakers very cleverly amp up the tension each night. The acting delivers just enough to support the story. The director knows what is truly frightening - those surreal moments when reality seems to be suspended - without resorting to the usual CGI overkill or Pirates-of-the-Carribiean-style ghosts jumping out at the camera. This is a terrific lesson in budget film-making that many multi-million dollar movies would do well to take heed from. A very effective fright machine from start to unforgettable finish.

Movie-making as scam artistry,"This is the first movie I've seen where I wanted my money back. If you haven't seen it, relax, you're no missing anything.

"It's The Hype, Stupid","I learned long ago when a film approaches release and you may have an interest DO NOT READ/LISTEN/ OR WATCH THE HYPE OR REVIEWS. I would rather go into a film knowing NOTHING about it. The more the hype the worse the film. They (producers) want a huge opening weekend. That is all they want out of a U S release. They make all the cash worldwide. This film was made for 200K but has returned an astounding 183 MILLION! That figure may even be without counting rentals and sell through. I have always dug scary films. I found 'Quarantine' on Netflix and was very very surprised by the film. It was a favorite until this one came along. I am glad I watched this film during daylight hours and not just before I went to bed. I would have heard every creek and moan with no sleep.I am susceptible to these type films cause I believe all this stuff does go on. So this film scared the bejesus out of me in my darkened media room (O K, living room). Once I have watched the film I will go back and then see what the reviewers I like thought of the film. To my surprise Ebert loved it. The film had no production values only what it did NOT show us. Plus it was made to look homemade by using video tape. This was a jaw dropping film with some slow spots yet you sort of built opinions about the two actors. The guy was a jackass as his girlfriend suffered. She was on the money and the creepy demonic voice was perfect. i suggest you see ""Antichrist"" by Lars von Tiers if you did not like this and want to step up to a thoughtful well made HORROR film with only two actors.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"You bet , its paranormal !!!","Awesome movie !!! Scary stuff !!! Fear , fear , fear !!! This is what I have been waiting for this entire year. For a movie, that really blows your mind. And the movie is done so well, and it gets exactly the feeling that it wants out of the audience.The movie features a young couple who are regular people just like us. Staying in a regular house just like the ones we always see. Speaking , talking , fighting, all habits just like us. Overall , you can imagine yourself there.Apparently the girl thinks that she hears some noises etc, and the guy decides to record everything on camera to find out what it is exactly. He does not believe it ( just like most of us ) , and his comments are quire funny ( just like our comments :-) ) Slowly , but surely, we start discovering what it's all about. And the entire movie is shown through their own video camera which is held sometimes by the guy, sometimes by the girl, else it's on the tripod.This is a definite must-see movie for any horror fans. Even if you are not a fan, you should definitely check this out, because it's a classic.When we were watching, the entire audience was totally into the movie, and jumping out of their seats at times. Yes , we were scared !!! Since it is shot with a hand-held camera, people who can't stand shaky movies might want to take it easy on this one. You can still see it, because when the camera is on tripod , it is fine. And those are the best moments.This movie is ten times better than Blair Witch. Do not think about waiting for the DVD . Check it out in the theaters , because you don't want to be at home watching a movie about a couple at home with creepy things happening. You HAVE to see it in the theaters !!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I got goosebumps-literally,"I got goosebumps while watching this and that NEVER happens to me. I've sat through many, many horror films and have relished every scary minute. I am so glad I'm in a condo complex with people above, below and beside me at every wall! Literally, I am so glad I'm not in a big house-especially alone. If I was I wouldn't be staying here tonight. True, the film is low budget but we knew this going in. True, there aren't many characters and it is low tech but does any of that matter if it scares you? No!

"Let's face it, not THAT special...","Very disappointing after all the hype it received and all the brilliant reviews. The people I went to see it with, were disappointed too, and thought it was completely awful.The film is put together quite intelligently, I like the home-video idea, builds up well, starts off with little things which then lead to actual physical 'damage', but it doesn't stop it from being quite boring most of the time. I sat there thinking 'ok, something seriously scary will happen now and I will feel the need to swear loudly'. I was just getting my hopes up, unfortunately. I did not jump once. I just sat there looking at the time in the corner of the screen. Waiting. I think it needed more tension. I know that the footage from the everyday life was a key part to the film in a way, but I just felt that even though the everyday life/peaceful night footage was shown, and the sense of vulnerability was present, I also had to question myself why the characters made some of the decisions they had made. Why choose the worst possible option? Ouija board? And again, at the beginning you do feel the tension. After a while, the footage is just repetitive and you are not on the edge of your seat anymore.Micah and Katie are very believable asthemselves in the film. They're not actors trying to play OTT characters that feature in most horrors, they are just a young couple with the exception of Katie being haunted by a demon. I think the fact that it wasn't scripted helped greatly-it really feels like a documentary.Yes. I did see the ending coming from quite early on.SIt wasn't too good. I have to say, I didn't mind watching it, it was mildly entertaining. But I didn't get what all the reviewers and critics promised me-the scariest film ever made. If there wasn't such a hype about it, and people didn't get so excited about how 'great' it is, maybe I would have enjoyed it more.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Would be scarier if we cared about the characters,"First thing I want to say is that although it is cheaply made, the effects are very well done. Way better than I expected, the film actually looks pretty good.The idea is good. The script is however half-baked. I didn't like the characters. The female character reacted pretty believably, but the male character, despite the acting being pretty good, was so unbelievably written. Honestly, I wanted to yell at the TV it was so bad.There is also no character development at all - we never discover anything about the couple's life apart from a) they have a sexual relationship (duh!), b) he bought a camera and c) she hates the camera.I mean what do they do during the day? What are they doing about the weird crap that's happening? Or even simple things like: what do they do for a living? where did they meet? What bonds them together? I can't answer any of those questions... which is pretty big holes in the writing.As for the ""paranormal"" character, practically nothing is revealed except for identifying what it is (thanks to the token appearance of the ""psychic"" - what that has to do with spotting paranormal activity is beyond me).After it is identified, there is no information about why it's there or what to do about it. And they make no further effort to find out anything or even do anything about it (oh let's just go back to sleep) - it's so stupid that I want to scream at the TV.So that means that every scene outside the scary bits is just a bunch of completely irrational, stupid behavior and conversations between the two leads that go nowhere.So honestly, the only interesting bits are all the frightening scenes at night when the two characters are mostly asleep. That is where my 4 stars come from, because the idea and events are pretty creepy and really well shot. It's just the rest of the story has no substance - unlike Blair Witch for example, where we see very little, but learn a lot about the witch from the other character's research.I enjoyed half the movie, but I unfortunately can't recommend it. I will not touch the next 3 (3???) movies that have been made since.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"So Many Flaws, Its Scary !","I'll begin with the snail's pace. I asked myself ''am i watching marathon on talking ?1?!?!? ''. It sure did feel that way. Truth be told, it wasn't my idea to go see this. I can 10000% place the blame on my girlfriend. She is, as most women are, easy to scare. For me, ghosts/invisible entities movies don't usually scare me. Being a trooper, went along.Story~Found footage of a couple battling an entity.Knowing that this took place entirely inside the same house and involving 2 main characters really made me want to stare clear. How much horror could be expected ? Maybe Micha and Katie would have a slew of guests and/or relatives over ?!?!?!? Would have been nice but no....We're stuck with 2 annoying people. That means 1 thing; TONS OF LIP FLAPPING ! HUGE FLAW ! Reasons for the lip flapping, only way to stretch the movie out. Not enough characters for the demon to snatch or invade. We get the next be flaw, PREDICTABILITY. Daytime, they yap endlessly. At night, we get the prerequesite noises. Cue me yawning.Fans harp on this ONLY costing $15,000. BFD ! Nothing happens for 80 odd minutes. How much money is 15-20 minutes of night noises suppose to cost ? 2 ''stars'', 1 location, no MTV soundtrack, minimal equipment....any more than $15,000 and the producers would have gotten ripped off. I can't think of any reason why a true horror fan would sign off on this boring NON HORROR lazy effort. This is the epitome of a ''love it or hate it'' flick.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I am immensely happy to see something like this get made today,"I do not believe in the supernatural. Not in the least. I watch films(or read stories) that have such elements in them only when I expect the piece of fiction to be well-done. That is the reason I gave this a chance... and I do not regret it for a second. As is always the case, this works the best if you do allow yourself to be convinced by it. Criticize it based upon its merits. There is no way for you to be unaware of what it's about... it's right there in the title. And I am thrilled to see this, such a recent movie, be done in this manner. The build-up is key. Atmosphere is carefully established and maintained, suspense gradually increases, and the minimalistic approach to the effects is perfect(think The Ring). I hope that the majority of audiences have not forgotten what horror is about, and what it can be. Violence, gore, torture... if the director possesses sufficient skill, none of those will be necessary. With a cast of half a dozen no-names(that can act rather well, and come off as quite natural), this manages to be scary and unsettling, proving just how little is required. The faux documentary style, currently being used for every cliché of the genre, is utilized well here, and things like the camera being put down and left still, the focus being slightly off or the light being a tad unflattering really help make it seem real. I suppose you could argue that the plot is simple. The storytelling is great, with some hints as to what goes on that we don't see(because it isn't recorded), and the delivery of exposition being smooth, not forced. There is humor in this, but it doesn't detract from the mood. The characters are credible and fleshed out. This is not for everyone. The ending is surprising without being one of those irritating out-of-nowhere ones that distract the viewer in an effort to make them forget the lesser parts of the picture. Editing and cinematography are excellent. The hand-held shots do not render you dizzy, and the way this uses sound is masterful. There is relatively infrequent strong language, a little blood and continuous disturbing content in this. I recommend this to anyone who can imagine themselves enjoying it from reading this review. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Creative but not worth the time,"I had heard nothing good about Paranormal Activity and I must say that remains to be true. I am not a die-hard horror fan but I do enjoy a good suspenseful scare.And that is not what Paranormal Activity is, interesting yes, but scary no. While the acting was sometimes good it was mostly bland and it didn't seem realistic at all. The few exceptions to this were a couple of the ""action"" scenes in which I could actually emphasize with the characters.If you want a good scare then in my opinion try Signs, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, or The Village. While they aren't the blood and gore type they did make me cringe on more than one occasion.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Plain boring,"""Paranormal Activity"" is one of those movies that you either love or hate I presume. It has amassed a huge cult following over the years. But to me personally this movie just didn't deliver. It was, dare I say, the most boring movie I've ever seen. Most of the time nothing happens and you're basically just watching a couple do mundane things. I guess one could argue that it makes the movie more ""realistic"". As the movie progressed the acting performances didn't quite attest to the supposed realism of the movie. What I mean by that is that there were a handful of scenes where the protagonists seemed to hold back a grin. As if they realized how ridiculous certain scenes were. Just to be fair about it; the acting wasn't the worst I've ever seen but it surely wasn't the best either. More on the weaker side of things.The finale of the movie aka the ending did spook me with two consecutive jump scares but still. By that time I've already given up on the movie since it made me feel like I just wasted a significant amount of time (that could've been invested in a more meaningful way).Final Verdict: The Blaire Witch project is apparently the only good movie that ever emerged from the ""found footage"" genre.

"It's exactly what you should expect, if you have a brain.","When I saw previews for this movie, it looked like it had some potential. Then I heard it was pretty much the same idea as the Blair Witch Project. Well, I watched it anyway, despite the *glory* that was the aforementioned film.In case you somehow happened across this review without any prior knowledge of what Paranormal Activity is about, here it is in a nutshell: It's about a couple experiencing strange happenings where they live, mainly while they are sleeping. They decide to film what is going on in the house and the movie is meant to give the feel of watching a home video.Although I didn't predict everything that would happen in the movie, nothing was unexpected. Just because this movie isn't a cheap scream-in-the-camera fest doesn't make it an original concept. In fact, I would go out on a twiggy little limb here and say that there was practically no originality, just a lot of reasons to compare it to The Blair Witch Project (sorry I brought that up again).I've seen much scarier movies than this, scary movies that made me pee all over myself because I was too afraid to get up to go to the bathroom. Paranormal Activity didn't make my heart skip a beat or make me jump even once and it left my undergarments clean enough to wear for at least another day.Seriously, though, Disney's Pinnochio was scarier than this. Remember the donkey scene? Terrifying! This... not so much.Paranormal Activity does deserve some credit, though, since I did actually get through the entire movie even if it was just to see if anything exciting finally happened.

A great psychological horror,This is a great film. The techniques used by the director and camera people have the desired effect. This is the quality of filming that the makers of The Blair Witch Project should have been aiming for.What makes this film a masterpiece is the balance of techniques used. Suspense is used at the correct times and the timing of the stingers in this film is immense. Also the sounds used in the film sends one's imagination wild. When a film can get inside your imagination there are no limits or boundaries to how much that film can terrify you.The cinematographer deserves applause also as the lighting in this film creates a lot of suspense and sets the audience up for many frightening stingers.This is what Drag Me To Hell could have been and what Blair Witch should have been. To summarise this is a must see for horror fans especially fans of the Fourth Kind which is similar in quality and similar filming techniques are used.

A Ho-Hum Pretend Documentary,"First question: did the world really need another haunted house style of movie? I don't think so, although I suppose I can't argue with the fact that this movie has had decent reviews. And in fairness, given the very small budget it worked with it does what it does reasonably well. Still, I can't honestly describe this as a particularly good movie. To be blunt, the gimmick is getting a bit stale. It's filmed like ""The Blair With Project"" or ""Cloverfield,"" a pretend-documentary shot with a hand-held camera (or, for the night scenes, a stationary camera) supposedly documenting the strange things happening in the house where Katie and Micah live. Katie has apparently had a history of these experiences, Micah inherited them so to speak when he moved in with her. I liked both of the afore-mentioned movies, so I can say that I have no particular problem with the style. This movie does little to draw the viewer in, though. For the first half hour very little happens, we spend a lot of time watching video being shot and then fast forwarded, there's a few mild chills - but nothing really exciting or frightening or shocking happens until the last fifteen minutes or so. I won't give the ending away, except to say that the very last scene struck me as silly, and it sets us up for a sequel that is apparently to be released in the fall of 2010. Frankly, the idea of a sequel doesn't get me enthused. This one was quite a disappointment.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The the woman playing the main character was annoying, and you could tell she has limited acting experience-I guess you have to start somewhere though. This movie does not come close to being a horror film, or ""scary"" movie-so I'm not sure how they could advertise it as so. I will say it was ""ok"" to watch, but the script was dry, it needed more of the ""scare"" factor throughout the movie-not just the last 20 min or so. I especially liked the tag lines for the movie-Don't see it alone, and Don't go alone-you're kidding me right.

A monumental bore!,"After so much ado, and though I am not an habitué at horror movies, I went to see it, and I came out convinced that if such a monumental bore has had such success it must be due to the times of great emotional distress and susceptibilities we are going through. The movie is essentially a monumental bore, dull,filmed in the way of 'cam on hand' type,a couple trying to film the alleged paranormal phenomena taking place in their home. These phenomena are indeed quite sparse, restricted to a few thumps and footsteps,and one or two other minor effects,which I don't reveal in order not to reveal spoilers which might spoil those few unaware of the film's boredom that might want to go watch this monumental barbiturate of a movie. I couldn't really go into further detail, since I slept through the last third of the picture.By this I don't mean it doesn't have a good starting point: taking advantage of the subconscious fear of the dark, those noises we hear in our own homes, etc. But the final product doesn't work: what really diminishes and mines it's credibility is the way it was filmed,with the camera jolting all the time, and the absolute ineptness and inefficacy of the actors, of whom I read great reviews saying they are allegedly natural, but to me of amateurish awkwardness, especially the female character, of the young hysterical type of woman during her menstruation, and whose performance robs the movie of any of it's credibility. So little is the movie credible, that when I finally woke up at the end, because of a final major thud, I laughed my heart out, since the epilogue is the major joke(no one seriously believes that what is written on the epilogue really happened!) One of the worst films I've ever seen, and frankly, by the reaction of those in the room, I was thoroughly convinced that most of them agreed with me; besides I didn't hear in the room any reaction similar to that shown on trailers which included images of the spectators reacting to the film. I can't understand the success of this picture other than caused by an excellent marketing campaign, and because of the times we are living,when everybody seems to be emotionally unstable and impressed by these lacklustre stories or those of vampires with very little interesting points other than the bodies and alleged physical beauty of the young actors and actresses peopling those movies. My final advise is to go see something else and spend your money in something far more interesting, or if you want to overcome a sleepless night, just go get there and sleep all through this monumental bore!",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Every minute of this documented film will keep your skin crawling. I was so freaked out after watching this film, I did not want to step foot into my house thinking there might be something I can't see waiting for me. This film is a series of documented hauntings. A young couple suspects that their house is haunted by a malevolent entity. They set up video surveillance to capture evidence of what happens at night as they sleep. According to Ryan E. Buell, Director of the Paranormal Research Society of Penn State University, most paranormal activity happens around 3:00 AM because it is considered the anti-Christ hours for it is said Christ died around 3PM.

Horror Hoax,"I heard so much about Paranormal Activity, the movie that so many listed as the scariest movie ever. There is even few sequels made. I tried to watch it when it was released, but gave up after few minutes. Meanwhile, after huge marketing campaign and all of the boom how scary this movie is I give it a try for a second time. After approx. an hour of watching I could not stand it anymore. There is more lame and dumb scenes in the movie than scary one. Those scary moments are too short and there is more stupid and boring scenes with two for me very repulsive characters than interesting one. Just when I was hooked during night scenes it rejects me to a boring state, an awful daytime scenes. It is like someone puts you in a tension of one genre, and then cut that in a different kind of genre. By that action whole concept falls apart. It is all related but awfully connected. Like some bad amateurish work. Horror at the night scenes, soap opera through daylight. And horror part is not actually that uber scary. Yes, the characters is very repulsive for me, especially the girl. The storyline is not original, it is like repeating well known cliché from many established movies about ghosts. The camera work is awful, yet it is supposed to be kind a footage type. There is also so much unlogical and dumb actions, for example: during the scariest moments those two experience, the male character grabs his camera and tried to record it. I suppose the logical reaction would be panicking and be too scared to grab the camera for recording, even thinking rationally. Nothing realistic. Overall it is very bad movie and I would not recommend it to anyone who are experienced horror fan. For bunch of kids that wants fun and have no experience in movies at all might be good for watching. Otherwise waste of time. I am glad I did not buy this DVD or ticket i the theater I would probably sue them for selling horror hoax.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Very Scary movie,"This movie is terrifying. At the theater you will probably be jumpy every time night falls. After the movie you will be on edge for a few hours, especially if it is at night. When you try to fall asleep, be prepared to jump at ever creak and crack that your house makes. The movie itself was brilliant in its own right, even if it wasn't scary. Using a completely steady camera you can see everything that happens with no distractions. Whenever the camera goes to its ""night vision"" you will sit on the edge of your seat to see what happens. The acting is also exceptional. The two leads have a great chemistry between them and are very natural. They each react in different ways to the haunting, and the audience member can decide which way he or she would react to the same situation. Overall this was a fantastic movie, but not for the feint of hear. Those who believe in the paranormal will be especially scared,I don't believe in ghosts or demons, and I still was scared by this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It was funny..,"I finally got the time to watch Paranormal Activity last night. I've been wanting to since I first heard about it cause I'm super into all that paranormal stuff. All my friends said they couldn't sleep after watching it, I was rather disappointed by the fact that I COULD. I thought the movie was predictable and I literally laughed at the end of the movie. At one point I even started dozing off, they could've done with the first half of the movie. I watch a lot of paranormal shows so maybe I'm desensitized to all of this stuff, but I wasn't scared by any of it.

Scary as hell.,"I walked into this movie knowing that it was going to be scary, because I had read all the reviews. But I never get scared of horror movies. Or any movie. NEVER. So I just walked in thinking this movie wouldn't affect me at all.I was dead wrong.I went to see it with a couple of my friends, and after the first half of the movie, we were holding on to each other practically crying. Don't get me wrong, we all loved the movie, but I texted one of them when I got home and she said that she could not fall asleep. I didn't either. I couldn't. I was so terrified.This movie sticks with you for hours, possibly even days, after you see it. It leaves an imprint on your psyche that's very hard to get rid of. It's possibly the scariest movie I've ever seen, even scarier than Texas Chainsaw Massacre or High Tension.I'm probably one of the few people that loved the ending, probably because it scared the hell out of me. But it's just so disturbing. How they shot this movie for $15,000 I'll never know, because the effects are so convincing and are just absolutely brilliant.I'm seeing this movie again this weekend with more people that are dying to see it, so hopefully I won't get scared again... which I probably will.See this movie. It will blow your mind, and shatter your senses, and fry your nerves. Guaranteed.10/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The Ouija board scene,I was digging this movie all the way to the Ouija board scene. Why in the hell wouldn't that couple be calling the news telling them they had ghost activity on film? Why would the gf deny it happening then refuse to watch it? Because of that scene alone I will never watch anything related to this movie. The sequel looks worse to no surprise. The average horror fan will like this movie. The hardcore horror movie fans will laugh at it. If your thing is ghosthunters than you're in for a treat. People say don't compare this to blair witch. I say why not? It has about 2 minutes of interest in it. The budget is about the same. The only thing is BWP had some scenes that actually scared me.,4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
paranormal activity review,I watched this movie last night and i have to agree this is without doubt the most frightening movie i have ever seen and i watch lots and lots of scary movies. This one plays on everything that would frighten you about the paranormal.There are many boring bits near start but once this gets going i guarantee you will get so involved you will think its happening to you.A real fright fest for those with a good imagination. Well worth seeing and worth every penny. I highly recommend that you watch this with friends. I watched on my own in the dark and when i went to my bed i could not help thinking about what i had just seen. If your easily scared then DO NOT WATCH ON YOUR OWN,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Documentary style movie, like Blair Witch","I was weary about seeing this in a movie theater b/c of hecklers and the rude, inconsiderate types. But, I was amazed that in a fully packed theater, I could have heard a pin drop throughout most of the movie. I believe in people again!! Yeahh ;-) So anyway, I did'nt read any reviews and only saw one TV commercial advertisement about this Paranormal Activity movie. I am not crazy at all about documentary style movies, and I did'nt think I was going to last the first 10 minutes without getting dizzy in my seat from the camera footage. It's the type of movie that is boring in the beginning, but the couple are cute and their home is awesome, and it keeps you wondering ""what the heck is the deal? or, what is gonna happen?"" I thought I was going to fall asleep, and that is probably where the negative feedback will come from. But, it is a must see movie because I never seen a horror movie made this way before. It's in the style of Blair Witch, but sooooo much better. I feel sorry for you if you have a bad crowd in the theater. Thank God at Lynhaven Movies in VA Bch, the crowd was really cool. Of course, I had the main highest schrilling woman screamer right behind me, but, she was alright b/c the parts that made her scream made everyone friggin scream or jump. I was scared. It felt like it was a real story happening, but, I do not know if it was real footage yet b/c I have not searched about the movie yet. A skeptic will always remain a skeptic, but, this movie will open up their mind more than any television series about paranormal activity will ever do. If it is a made up story with actors, then this movie gets a 10+ from me. I walked out of the theater wondering ""damn, what the heck did I just watch and was it really real?"" I guess because the actors real names are used it throws everyone off. It's a good movie. It will definitely scare you as long as you be patient, listen, and just hang tight and watch the whole entire flick. I don't know if I would rate it as the scariest movie of the decade, but, it is so different from anything else I've seen cuz it did not appear to be fake, unless your a skeptic who has to ruin the whole mood. Skeptics will complain they wasted their $11.50 even if they got scared. Fake or not, it's scary!! This is a must see for paranormal buffs. Definitely a not see for people scared easily.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Possibly the scariest film I ever seen,"When I first watched this back in 2010 when I was 12, with my twin brother and sister, we had no idea that this was all staged. We literally believed it was real. It scarred the s*** out of us. I got to meet both Katie and Micah at Astronomicon in 2019 for the 10th anniversary of Paranormal Activity which they attended the screening and panel afterwards. Very cool and nice people, I told them my story and they were completely surprised and glad I loved it. It has that factor like The Blair Witch Project. This is absolutely one of my favorite horror films and a definite must watch yearly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Puts many main stream horror films to shame,"This movie is certainly a companion piece to the ""Blair Witch Project"", but it is a much better film for two reasons: (1) everyone can relate to it due to the fact we all have to sleep at night and what might go on around us while we're sleeping puts us at our most vulnerable; and, (2) the climactic scene is a much better payoff than the ending to ""Blair Witch"".The film also puts most of the more recent Hollywood horror films to shame because its plot is simple. It's not trying to remake ""The Sixth Sense"" by providing you with an unexpected twist ending or convoluted plot that ends up making no sense at all. You know at the start what's going to happen at the end and much of the movie's suspense comes from that sense of dread as well as from small, mundane occurrences filmed in a very sinister way.There is a little too much comic relief from the banter and squabbling of the two main characters which becomes annoying after awhile, but this is a minor complaint.Definitely a horror movie worth seeing, which stays with you after it's over, which makes it the best kind.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Extremely disappointing and over-blown.,"What a huge disappointment. There I was, expecting a scary film which would stay with me so that, when lying in bed, I'd ensure my feet are under the duvet and worry about 'bumps in the night'.How could it fail? It's a simple idea, a haunting recorded on camera. What could go wrong?Well, for starters, it had the feel of an over-produced amateur effort, maybe by a film school student. Secondly, Katie Featherston is a terrible actress, completely unable to convey any sense of empathy with her character and I wouldn't be surprised if she was reading her lines from the underside of cups, etc, in a subtle effort to hide the fact she couldn't remember them. And, in a film which only features 2 people (the parapsy is hardly in it) that is a real problem - there's no hiding for her. Thirdly, they obviously shot too high. A plain, old fashioned haunting was called for. All this 'demon' stuff was pointless and tacky. Fourthly, in dealing with a film about bumps in the night SUBTLETY is called for. It's all about the imagination doing the work. THe crescendo through the film is OK, but the final scene just wasn't scary, I'd had enough by then. Fifthly, WAS the end supposed to be scary? He runs downstairs into the pitch black but she does away with him without a fight? . And 'She's still missing'. Right. And that's immediately before the screen telling us it's all fictitious. Tacky, clichéd and boring. We know know she killed him with a knife, right? So THANK GOODNESS she didn't rip his face off with her teeth, or pull his heart of of his chest with her hand, etc etc, all those other things that would have been EVEN WORSE...And, while I think about it, what the hell is that about the powder and what looked to me at least to be hoof-marks?! As if the 'demon' is just invisible, but otherwise has a physical presence?! It's the kind of story a child would come up with.Which is not to say that the plot worked anyway. In a film where the answer is staring the participants in the face - the Church - the whole subject of exorcism is all but ignored. Instead they draft in a parapsy who is of no use and, even more sadly, the only other person who could help them is away. Right. The only other person. There's no one else, is there? A Priest? Or just look in the phone book? Equally, the protagonists persist in doing things which are contrary to common sense but necessary to drive the story forward.So disappointing.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Don't watch it on your own,"I have just recently watched the 2009 version, and oh my god it was scary. the film it self was excellent the only reason i gave it a 9 rating is because it scared the living day lights out of me.

Hype! Hype! All Hype!,"This movie sucked! From the opening scene until the last 10 minutes, nothing frightful happened. It had more humor than suspense, and even that was iffy. The acting was shallow and the storyline was undeveloped. Scene after scene I found myself waiting to be scared. Circumstances that occurred would and should have been addressed... if not by the script, at least by the characters. Their only search for help was to call a psychic? To be frank, the trailer was more interesting, yet very misleading. There were about 40 people in the theater when I saw this movie. Everyone of them walked out mumbling. Some even ran! Save your money... or better still, go check it out if only to see some trailers for some other good horror flicks being released soon. The fact that this movie has been hanging around for 2 years is evidence enough that someone, somewhere, was skeptical enough to hold back on it. Suddenly, someone must have came up with an idea... Hype! Hype! All Hype! And like trained trained puppies, we all go running. This is one of the worst movies I ever saw.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
lots of hype......nothing else...,"As an avid movie buff i hardly say that i wasted my $12, but in this case ... The only thing driving movie goers to the theater is the ingenious marketing done by Paramount, kudos to them. Some people are calling it the best horror movie made in a decade. Common fellas, is this really the highest standard we can set? Honestly, I had more laughs than scares, all thanks to the Micah. He was the only reason I could sit through this ordeal. Katie's acting was woefully artificial. Cinematic suspense is a tricky thing, you stretch it too long and tedium starts to creep in. And here it went so long that when the good thing started I wasn't even interested. It will just give you a few scares and nothing else. Don't waste your money, and if you still want to see it wait for a DVD, you might and I say might receive a few more scares on your BOSE headphones..",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Brilliant,"Paranormal Activity's poster recommends that you don't see it alone. I'm glad I did though. I also watched it in a dark room whilst wearing headphones.I had heard a fair bit about the film and there was a great amount of hype surrounding it. I wasn't let down. The film follows Katie and Micah as they try to record bizarre events that are happening around their home.Maybe it was due to the fact that I watched it on my own or maybe it was because I used headphones. But Paranormal Activity made me jump and shiver more than a few times. The strange events get more intense as the film goes on and as a result the tension is built up brilliantly. I never thought I'd actually be scared of a shaking light fixture, a shadow or a door. But I was.I've seen all three endings to Paranormal Activity and I have to say that it really doesn't matter which one you see. All the endings are effective and chilling in their own way. I'd have to say I prefer the original version the best, it's the most unexpected ending of the three.The movie was actually made in 2007, but didn't get a release until 2009. I'll never understand why it took so long to find distribution. It's one of the best horror movies in recent years.http://ukmore.tk/",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Proves you don't need millions of dollars to make a great film,"It makes me happy to see a film of this sort get such an audience. This is what a film should be about. Not huge effects. Not millions of dollars. Not big names and huge studio backing. It should be about effective film-making. And that's exactly what Paranormal Activity does right.What worked most effectively for me was the sense of dread that permeates throughout. The film has an incredible use of negative space. You constantly feel as thought something horrible is going to happen. Most of this occurs while the couple is sleeping. Unfortunately, the dread over shadows what DOES happen most of the time, which typically involves some minor incident involving a noise or a door. There are a few disturbing scenes involving some sleepwalking. But the majority of what makes the film so effective is the fact that nothing happens.That being said, the film loses its steam a bit when dealing with the ""real"" issues, such as the couple bickering and such. It bothered me that the bf would continue to record despite the pleas of his gf. I would think any other dope would turn it off. It does add some drama to what is happening, but otherwise distracts. Certainly the use of a camcorder is effective, but the film quality was a little too good for me. Surprisingly, I think a less quality camera here would have been more effective, as the home made film quality would have been upped.Luckily, the film sticks to what works well here, and that is its minimalist approach. By not showing a whole lot, we get a whole lot of dread and creepiness. It's something the filmmakers seem to know very well and it definitely pays off.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Con Is On,"Paramount just played another con on the film-going public.It has taken a poorly-made, no-budget piece of cinematic nonsense and hyped it in hopes of fooling enough people to replenish its empty coffers.For that purpose, Paramount is publishing box-office returns that are aggressively suspicious (do you realize that box-office figures are made up at the studios with no checking by the press?) and tells us that this film is doing great even though it is getting awful word of mouth.Paramount has been doing this for the last few years (if you don't believe me look at the financial results of Paramount after two ""record years"" where they made no money!! Makes you reconsider those BO numbers for J.J. Abrams' universally panned Star Drek and Michael Bay's hideous Transmongers, doesn't it? In any case, this is an amateur hour movie that was produced by a bunch of Hollywood insiders eager to pull wool over the public's eyes.They were playing the usual ""little movie that could"" card (not a bad idea given the dreck that the studios are producing these days) and deliver nothing except poorly framed shots and a complete lack of film-making knowledge (the filmmakers proudly stated they didn't go to film school... They should have).In other words, another film that will turn people off from going to the movies. Thanks Paramount...

I want a refund for two adult tickets,My husband and I were so excited when we heard a new horror movie was out. We are so tired of watching remakes and slasher movies and remakes of slasher movies that we thought a new and different idea would be a real treat. We were so very disappointed to find that this movie is basically a rip off of the Blair Witch idea with there being no real substance to the movie. The special effects were not special at all and I could have produced these same effects myself. The suspense was not there as every action was predictable and right on cue. The only thing that startled me at all was when other people in the audience (teenage girls) would scream out when one of the predictable occurrences happened. I would say this is only a movie for teenage moviegoers who have not yet honed a real sense of what horror should be but even some of the younger couples who were exiting the theater with us were complaining that they wished to have their money back.

Too much hype about the hype of this movie!,"Okay here it goes. My first movie review on IMDb. And I'm so glad it happened to be this movie. I've seen too many reviews trashing this movie, saying that it's not scary, that it doesn't live up to the expectations/hype... I have only one question for them: Why would they build such lofty expectations from a movie that they know cost a few thousand more than a Birkin bag? For sure Paranormal Activity (PA) was not made to satisfy the CGI-spoilt, gore loving, severed arteries craving crowd that would excitedly place the 6th rendition of the rehash factory called Saw on their collectors' mantle and happily spend another $10 on the re-release of the first edition the next year just because it is in 3D!! I request you to stay away from PA, this is not for you.This movie is all about atmosphere. The eerie silence of the night that crawls under your skin, making you nervous in anticipation. The classic horror style of walking its viewers the slow measured journey that builds tension and nervous anxiety with such method and to such an extent that the final outcome becomes immaterial, and the mere survival of the journey itself becomes the reward, the memory for the viewers. PA's characters, the setting, the story - all seep into your life so seamlessly, leaving you with empathy for the characters and a very tangible realization that this could happen to you.Having said that, is it a perfect movie? No, it has its flaws. Where the actors react in very realistic, very believable ways, are those Oscar-worthy performances? No. Where the plot is simple and gripping, does it leave you with an empty climax? Yes.But all said and done the movie delivers a punch on what it's set out to be: a horror that, every time you hear an unrecognizable 'thump' in your house at night, will leave you holding your breath uneasily, straining your ears through that eerie silence, hoping to hear the slightest sound of reassuring familiarity. It is for this reason alone, it deserves a commendable 9 stars!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A total mess,"This movie doesn't deserve the hype it gets at all. The plot is, as is oft the case with horror movies, rather trite and unimportant, but as long as its genuinely scary, it's all good. To say PA falls flat in actually being 'spooky' would be quite the understatement.The 'spookiness' (which I'm putting between 'sarcasm' tags for a reason) takes a page from the Blair Witch Project style of suggestion. Unfortunately, PA suggests very little and what it does is just plain cheesy, predictable and completely cliché. We get some doors moving and some curtains ruffling, but for the first half of the movie, PA is simply a borefest. By then the mysterious shady assassin who we - of course - never really get to see, has stepped up his repertoire of douchebag tricks to slamming the door shut. Wow. ""What a tweest!"" would M. Night Shyamalan say, if by that he meant 'what a load of crap!'.The characters' stupidity is only matched by the sheer amount of annoyment they instill upon the viewer. Cheap drama and impromptu bravado go hand in hand as the plot advances like a trainwreck to the nearest clichéstorm while the viewers stops wondering 'who or what is the demon torturing these people?' and 'when will these morons actually die?' While this movie may not deliver many chills, it will certainly give the viewer a sense of relief when the credits at last, mercifully, roll.In short: this stuff wouldn't scare a toddler. Some would say this movie isn't for the faint of heart. These people are right, but seek their refuge in an understament: this movie isn't for anyone with half a brain.

"Marketing: 10, Suspense:6, Horror: 0","Read Andrew (ash2)comments first, as this was one of the highest views.

I enjoyed this movie solely based on the fact that it has some element of originality which, in the era of pointless remakes (who in his right mind would want to make a remake of Psycho?), is highly sought after.This film is a testament to the fact that you don't need a multi-million dollar budget with gallons of fake blood to make an effective horror movie.

You will sit or lie waiting and waiting and waiting thinking ""when is this film going to scare me?"" when it eventually gets to the juicy bits you are left saying ""Is that it?!""If you are the type of person who gets extremely frustrated at how stupid people can be in films then please don't watch this film. You will spend most of the film saying sentences starting with the words ""why don't they.... You can see they tried to make an original film, but borrowed too much from the Blair witch project which is miles better than this as the acting is greater, very believable and quite scary.I did not watch this film with expectations that it was going to be one of the scariest films i would watch, but i did expect to be a bit scared at least seeing as it's advertised as a horror. The one thing i don't understand is why oh why they have made a second film. I find it hard to believe that after this film they decided that the story must continue. So be ready to experience more moronic common sense, black and white film footage and feeling raped if you paid money to watch it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
They don't make horror movies like this anymore!,"This is simply a great movie. But it's something nobody understands anymore.Today, people don't appreciate what true horror is anymore. Today movie makers take brilliant, timeless classics and squeeze all the juice out of them. Then they make them into remakes with popular actors, special effects and loud noises and expect it to be suspenseful. The prime culprit of this crime against horror is Michael Bay (A Nightmare on Elm Street).However, Paranormal Activity is suspenseful by actually working to make it scary and has a very low budget, and most important of all, it isn't made by Michael Bay or some other idiot.The story is about a young couple who has just moved to a house in the suburban parts of San Diego. The girl, Katie, has been haunted by a demonic presence since she was 8. the guy, Micha, is obsessed with carrying around a camera to record his, and Katie's life. When things begin to go very weird overnight, the couple set up the camera in the bedroom to record what happens when they sleep. Sounds pretty creepy, right? Well you'll have to find out what happens by watching it for yourself.To summarise, don't deny yourself the opportunity to see this. If you're a true horror fan you won't regret it. This may be the first horror to actually scare anyone in a very long time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Boring!,"I do not understand what people see in this movie it was so completely boring the only good part in it was the end, that was seriously like the only scary part in the whole movie. The hot chick in it was nice to look at but that was the only good thing about this movie and it just bothered me to no end that they tried to make it realistic but their is no way this is believable if this was really happening to someone I doubt they would be sticking around in the relationship with someone that was haunted by daemons, the guy in this film was a total moron trying to provoke this daemon further just so unbelievable even if they tried to make it look like this was a realistic scenario I was done with this film half way through, what a waste of time and now I see another waste of time probably boring second movie to this coming out.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Paranormal Activity Review,"Micah has just found out that Katie, his long-time girlfriend, is being haunted. She's been followed by a disturbing presence since she was young, and it appears to loathe anybody who gets too involved in her life. This happens to be a serious relationship hurdle for Micah to deal with, and he feels that he must do something to fix the situation. So, he decides that he'll attempt to catch the haunt on film.There is a common theme in horror movies in which the main characters ignore advice that turns out to be vital to their survival. Micah and Katie are warned by a psychic in the beginning of the film that whatever force they are living with feeds and grows off of negative energy. All they must do to keep the being at bay is to ignore it and remain content with each other. Bringing a camera into the mix doesn't help either of those things.The movie incorporates a steady buildup, but is well worth its time for the lasting scare it provides. Having been made to look like uncovered footage, there are no musical cues or ominous tonalities. In avoiding most of the common horror mainstays, Paranormal Activity denies cheap scares and uses another method: to frighten the audience members by disturbing them at an ethereal level. Fear is induced through subtle, unnatural oddities rather than the more common ""jump"" moments in today's thrillers. Because of this unique method, the film will affect many of its viewers differently.Believers in actual demons, ghosts, ghouls and such may want to shy away in respect of the supernatural nature of the plot. While many people have reported having nightmares (if they were able to sleep at all) after seeing this movie, more fantastical claims of actual hauntings have also been made. Steven Spielberg is even said to have returned a home copy to the studio in a garbage bag after believing it to have permeated ghosts into his home.Oren Peli has created a very inspired work from his own paranormal experiences, and the genuineness shows itself off in his writing and direction. The expected screams and ramblings of most characters in these types of situation are replaced with tears and arguments over responsibility for the events. Peli writes the characters into an inescapable situation, but it is their arrogance and pride that ultimately worsen it. Both of the main actors (who use their real names in the film) do a great job of emoting their fright without exaggerating it, lending visceral honesty to their reactions.Even though a good amount of information surrounding the phenomenal situation in the film is revealed by the end, there is just enough mystery left keep it strange and terrifying. Those intent on getting sleep after seeing Paranormal Activity have been warned.Actual Rating: PG-13 While anybody who happens to be afraid of supernatural forces is probably too young (at any age) to see this movie; there is no actual adult material in it beyond ""foul"" language.For updates regarding future movie reviews and the other shenanigans I get into, follow my page at http://twitter.com/ross667 you lovely person, you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Can't Understand People,"I have no idea why there is such a big hype over this POS?? This movie was neither scary or good. My wife Hates scary movies but is a big Paranormal investigator. She is still waiting to be scared.. I didn't expect this movie to have good production/quality due to the fact i knew the cost to produce. That was not the reason why i thought it was a POS... I thought it was a POS due to the ability of the actors to NOT act for one... and secondly for the Plot not to go anywhere... the third reason i really disliked it... was due to the fact that i found it hard to stay awake during the movie... the last movie i couldn't stay awake for was the ""The Tigger Movie"". *sigh* Please I wish Spielberg would have bought the rights to this movie before i went to see it... simply due to the fact that i would have had a better chance of not wasting any money actually going to see it.......",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Please someone explain the poor comments.,"My opinion is that this is, so far, the best film to come out this year. It was an original horror film that used traditional methods in a whole new way.I saw the movie and as always wanted to see what the public thought of it so I came here. After a couple of minutes of browsing I was seeing an increasing amount of 1-4 star reviews. How?! I am trying to think of what could be going through the minds of those who leave these comments and have come to blame it on bad television and movies.People these days are so accustomed to modern horror movies, so that when something brilliant like this comes along all they can say is ""What the hell is this?"".I also think that this movie was too late. Had it come out before all of the sub-par point of view movies (e.i. Blair Witch, Cloverfield) I think it could have been a movie to change all movies. Un-luckily though its predecessors set a bar so horribly low that people now ignore anything that manages to go over it. For the people who think this is the worst movie ever you watch either too much T.V. or are unable to actually get into a movie.I also get the feeling that most people go into this movie, sit down, and before the movie even gets going, start making snide remarks. Why do you do that to yourself? I can walk into any movie and make fun of it if I have the right mindset, trust me I do it with all Nic Cage movies.If you go to see this movie, I beg that you go in with the least opinions possible.This movie reverted to the thought that the build up is far more important than the actually scare. The fear slowly mounts on you throughout the movie, and by the end my heart was pounding. I had to sleepover at a friends house after because we were freaking out whenever we were alone And to those of you who didn't like it, feel free to contact me and voice your opinion, because, frankly, i don't understand you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Had trouble sleeping...,"Yes. I had trouble sleeping after this movie. And that says it all. Although we had almost no real scares in this movie and more of what was happening was in you imagination than anywhere else the film itself creeps you out with noises, situations and the fact that it basically delves into the primordial fear of the dark, which almost every child has. And the memory of this persists making well made ghost or demon movies much more frightening than any gorno movies.Shot entirely on a HD semiprofessional camera, which is either wielded by one of the two main characters of the movie or is shooting whilst on a tripod set in the bedroom. The plot is sinisterly simple - a couple haunted at night by weird noises and small unexplainable occurrences decide to purchase a camera to film what is going on at night...I must say that in terms of general impact I haven't had my childhood fears so well triggered since watching ""The Exorcist"". Which is saying a lot. I must also congratulate the two main actors who always feel sincere and real to the bone. That adds an additional punch of reality, which helps you forget you are watching a movie.The end scene apparently sticked on by Paramount Pictures after they purchased the movie and as such it seems too clichéd and banal in comparison with the rest of the movie. The two alternate original endings are much better.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Excellent Movie,"Well I will have to disagree with ""Claudio Carvalho"" on this movie. He is so busy breaking down and looking so deep into the movie that he didn't take the time to just watch it and enjoy it. Just like the Blair Witch Project, which I loved when that came out also, I love this movie. This movie really shows how the average person could deal with a ""paranormal"" event. Unlike other paranormal movies, this movie gives a view as if you were there behind the video camera. Now I admit I am not the biggest fan of First Person Filming, such as ""Cloverfield"" etc. But this movie didn't make me feel like I am on a roller coaster. I can see what I want to see and that is what makes this movie good. So before anyone goes bashing on ""How anyone could be scared by this movie"" just remember to relax and watch the movie and just watch it, Don't break it down like a damn science experiment. Its just a movie, made for enjoyment. Relax, and watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
1 out of 10 isn't low enough,"I got a DVD copy of Paranormal Activity today (With the original ending) and decided to sit down with my subway sandwich and a friend and watch the film. I have to say, it was a good attempt at a scary film, but non-the-less, needs some work.The story focuses on Micah and Katie, a couple who have moved into a home together and discover that Katie is being followed by a demonic entity. First off and foremost, I will give credit to both Micah and Katie (Yes their real names are the same as their characters) for an outstanding performance. Not exactly Marlon Brando, but a lot better then Christian bale and most actors out there. As for the crew working behind the camera, this movie needs some work. I went into this film expecting to be frightened to the edge of my seat, but instead just kinda sat there going ""Wow what is the director thinking??"" and ""Hey I can see the stop motion animation there!"". Honestly, were talking about the film that scared Steven Spielberg so much he left the theater. Really? Maybe Spielberg should stick to blues clues.The movie does have its strengths though, for example throughout the whole film I felt as if I was watching a home movie or some old footage filmed from a family trip (Which I'm hoping was intentional by the filmmakers, otherwise I retract this statement). Also the actors/actresses did a good job improvising the entire script (Yes, the whole thing was improvised). Also in the beginning of the film, a psychic tells the couple that the demon is fueled somewhat by anger and frustration, and the more the couple argue, the more violent the demon became (Sort of like Katie's inner demon), which I thought was a good use of symmetry.Still, the movie got too much hype. During the first ""Night scene"" my heart was racing because I was expecting something to have me quaking in my boots, but after it failed to scare me, the rest of the movie I just kind of sat there going ""Oh hey look the sheets moved.... aahhhh?""I appreciate the film for trying to scare people Alfred Hitchcock style, as opposed to just gore fests (Like most mediocre horror films today such as Saw), but this movie failed to deliver. When I order pizza for delivery and its not here in 30 minutes, its free. Your 30 minutes is up Paranormal Activity, wheres my money back?Oh and before I forget, If you want a scary movie that REALLY gets your blood pumping, but uses suspense as opposed to mutilated bodies, try renting Psycho, trust me its worth it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Frcking scary,"A couple decide to document their nights while they sleep, after they hear strange noises that they believe to be a haunting.I respect this film, for the fact that it was shot for less than 20,000, had absolutely no marketing campaign and has become a huge success based on word of mouth and the audience demanding to see it. If only other studios would follow suit and listen to people demanding to see movies they want to see, maybe there wouldn't be so much crap out there.Paranormal Activity is shot like Cloverfield, Blair Witch Project, REC, Cannibal Holocaust, etc. If any of those films gave you motion sickness, you might want to skip this one. Half the film is shot while they sleep, so the film is on a Teri-pod, the other half is them walking around with it. So if you've never been a fan of those films, skip this one. Second, the film is not as scary as people make it out to be. Instead, it is one creepy and suspenseful film, that seeing in a theater, only heightened my enjoyment of it.The audience I went with, all had a collective ""Oh My God"". I could hear it every time something creepy happened. You could literally feel everyone in the theater holding their breath every time they went to sleep. Again, if you are the type of person who wants to watch a film and not hear a peep out of anyone else, skip this film.Now the film itself, shot in one week, small (very small) budget and every penny of it went towards the special effects. The special effects are what sell the film, if you don't buy them, the film will not creep you out. They looked real and impressive enough to push the film into a successful goal, which is to scare people. If you are already afraid of the dark, this film will not help you. Every creek, thump, noise you hear in your house will now have you thinking twice.Less is more, The Blair Witch Project uses this, as does Paranormal Activity. The two leads, are haunted by a demon, one we never see, only hear. Whenever you go into a horror film, as a kid you would close your eyes in fear. Big mistake, because it's the ears you need to be covering. The sound is what makes you jump, hear nothing, fear nothing. The sound design behind this film is what is scary people, accompanied by the visuals (memorable scenes with the powder and bed sheets).As the film progresses, the haunting gets worse. I don't want to give anything away, and I urge you to not watch the trailer. I watched the trailer and was waiting for those things to happen, it took away from the general fear. Not knowing what to expect will make this film that much better, that much creepier and that much more entertaining. I didn't expect it to be as funny as it was either, the lead male had some comic relief dialog, the ease the tension.The couple are believable, the hand held camera angle works here and the fear will set in. I applaud Paranormal Activity, for not only becoming an unheard of success, but for being one of the creepiest films I've ever seen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
come on kids don't be so easy to scary.,Frankenstein (1931) shows that you had make an effort to scary people 2 generations older then me. The exorcist show that you do no have to make as mush of an effort to scary people 1 generations older then me. But mine you. You still had to make something that would count as big effort. And this movie show my generation gets scared very easy. Just put it one a home movie and turn off the light. That will do it. Most of this movie is mostly just bad actors screaming in the dark. Good special effects. But by the time you see anything there is less then a minute left. It was a week script and is badly acted. Come on kids don't be so easy to scary.

Believable and Beautiful,"Having been a fan of the Blair Witch Project since its release I was very excited to see this movie. After watching it, one thing struck me. All the critics who said its just the same as Blair Witch, or a rip off, or trying to be Blair Witch are wrong. Two similarities occur, a hand held camera and there's humans in it. Get over it! If this is the case then every movie in the world that uses standard film cameras are trying to rip off one another. Beautifully written with a brilliant cast of unknowns, this film really does hit you hard. You never see the 'demon' but the director flirts with the imagination of what it actually looks like and what its mission is. The less detail, the better. Now I'm a 22 year old who used to be scared of horror films and refused to watch them. But then I grew up and wasn't really scared no more. Having watched this once in the company of my girlfriend I found it fascinating and wanted to view it again. So, the next night, I did. But my girlfriend fell asleep after a hard days work. So I turned it off because it became to scary to watch. The only fault I have with this film is that it took 2 years for it to become bigger. Also, I'm not to sure about a sequel, because the irony is I don't want it to end up like Blair Witch 2: The Book of Shadows.If there's a shadow on my door, I wont sleep.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Sitting in a pumpkin patch doing nothing on Halloween night would be more interesting than watching this,"If you want a scary experience, see a dentist instead. It's scary (which this film isn't), and you might get better teeth. As for this film, all you'll get is asphyxiation.

I can't think of a more suspenseful ""scary as hell movie"" than ""Paranormal Activity"" because there is not. It may have been over-hyped to some but it a movie can draw you in so close that you can hear the characters heart beats and yours, I say see it. Yes, I was disappointed and the reviews but not the movie alone because it was terrifying and made me think all night while sleeping with the light on. PEOPLE CUT IT SOME SLACK you make a movie under $11,000 and see if it's as brilliant as this one. Brilliant! characters= believable Scary= yes, but more creepy Plot= unpredictable, suspenseful",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
You must watch this film,"This film has loads of hype and its for a reason, just watched it last night and has easily become one of my favourite films. People compare this film to Blair witch Project but I feel it is an insult to the film and the actors. Although the film had only a $15000 budget and unknown actors, the acting and the special effects were much better than most Hollywood films. This is because it is kept simple which makes it much more realistic.Basically the film is suppose to be recorded by a camera bought by Micah to try and record any ""bumps in the night"", which has been edited by unknown producers as a documentary of what happened to Micah and Katie and as a is it real or fake movie thing. It builds the characters up well and gets you familiar to the location of the film which is Micahs house. It is slow to start with only minor Paranormal activity's happening early on but this builds huge suspense as you keep asking your self ""what next"". There are three alternative endings, i watched the original which I enjoyed.To sum it up if you want a nonstop unintelligent scream fest with lots of blood and guts watch some silly Hollywood film. However, if you you want to watch an intelligent, high suspense, nerve racking thriller/horror this is it.If you are after a film with nonstop screams and blood and guts, this is not it. However, if you are after an intelligent",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hype and marketing. Nothing else.,"First of all, let me say that every great thing that is being said about this movie is completely understandable. I love the camcorder horror format--REC and Cloverfield are good examples of the genre, as is The Blair Witch Project. In all three films the writing is believable, the characters are likable and the suspense is drawn out.Paranormal Activity has none of that.""Filmmaker"" Oren Peli uses the strengths of the genre (realistic hand held shooting and the feeling that the characters could easily be you) as a crutch for bad, bad writing and a lack of any camera work whatsoever. This couple is supposed to be so ordinary that we're drawn into a sense of realism, but the dialogue Katie and Micah have is so banal I was annoyed immediately, and throughout the film.The fact that Peli had to shoot this film in his own home due to the constraints of an $11,000 budget opens up plot holes that are patched over, actually with single lines of dialogue: Why can't they move to a new, unhaunted house? Because the ghostdemon has been visiting Katie for her whole life and follows her everywhere. So they must coexist, but why can't they? Because the psychic whom they meet with tells them they might be killed. Why can't he expel the ghostdemon? Because he just can't--after the haunting escalates and when they need him most he actually tells them he feels overwhelmed and can't be in the room with it, and also that he's very sorry. He says he will try to help them later, but he just can't be there right then. That must mean it's time to get scared, everyone.I could have forgiven the extremely annoying characters and plot holes if the spooks were delivered with any sort of timing or suspense, but as has been explained in many other negative reviews, the ghostdemon comes in the middle of the night, immediately after the camera footage is fastforwarded directly to the events which we're supposed to have been startled by, completely ruining it. But this is what must happen if the film is to take place in the couple's home and the supposed terror must come while they are sleeping. We can't just wait all night for stuff to happen, right? Oh, and after each event the couple simply goes back to bed, and the the next day comes where they bicker about the haunting exactly the same way they do every other day. This is the whole movie, and then it's over, thankfully.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Worst Movie EVER (next to Blair Witch),"Save your money and time that you will never get back! I can not stress it enough not to wast time and energy on this movie when there are so many out right now the would be better to watch.The ending was the worst ever as well, I tell scary stories to my kids better than this movie showed. The only thing this movie could possibly scare is someone who does not watch scary movies or is easily amused. My kids and I watch A Haunting (tv show) about true haunting and it is far more scarier than this movie. This movie might have been a better movie if it weren't for the poor filming, horrible ending, and obvious 'hockey' acting.Again, I can not stress it enough....SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the scariest films ever!,"Fear. One of the most essential and loved emotions ever in the movies. Does Paranormal Activity bring the fear? It sure does. Paranormal Activity is one of the rare horror movies that is actually scary and that makes you afraid to sleep. Many horror movies these days fall the way of Sorority Row and the Final Destination series-full of clichés and lacking scary material. In fact, in a day where the horror movie is not actually scary, it is hard to even call it a genre anymore. Paranormal Activity disobeys the standards for the new horror movie genre and brings the old version back with good film-making and great thrills.This spooky little film starts out easy and almost a comedy. It's about a couple, Katie and Micah (pronounced Meeka), who have been experiencing what they think is a haunting. The two quarrel while remaining hopelessly in love with each other. Micah decides to set up a camera system to appease Katie who is hoping to give Micah a glimpse of a ghost which she believes to be in the house. The heart of the film is its night scenes which depict the couple sleeping in bed while the ghost (it's actually something slightly different) ""attacks"". The film is made in the ""shaky cam"" style, but the camera is not very shaky and audiences concerned about nausea should not be.Paranormal Activity works primarily for the reason that it continually mounts fear. As I said before, the beginning starts out comedy-like, gradually transitions into horror, and then just goes wild. The night scenes are scariest because they prey on one of our most common fears: the unknown predator. The viewer knows what it is that is haunting them, yet they never get even a quick look at what it is that is doing this other than its shadow. The night scenes begin with shutting doors, banging noises, and booming noises in the background. This may not sound like anything new, but after this phase is done, the film just keeps getting stranger. By the end, the film is so scary that the viewer just hopes that there isn't another night scene coming, that everything is going to be okay, that the movie will be over so they won't have to endure any more fear. No, Oren Peli, the director, does not give up. Once you've gotten into his trap of this movie, you can't leave. Peli has made a film so scary that even I, a person who really doesn't get scared by horror movies, might have trouble sleeping for the next few days.This film is absolutely one to catch in theaters. Part of the fun of the movie seeing the audience's reaction. The film was so scary that during a screening in Montreal, a person fainted and was carted out of the theater by the ambulance. Alright, nothing that exciting happened to me, but yes, the reactions were very interesting. However, it was so scary that one woman sitting behind me kept murmuring to herself ""Ohmygod, ohmygod, ohmygod!"" during the night scenes. Later, the ""ohmygods"" turned into a scream which, at the very end, changed into her crying because she was so scared. Many people didn't have as intense a reaction as this, but almost everyone was gasping when scary things happened. I even found myself gasping at the screen at certain parts, something I have never found myself doing before at a movie.It's hard to believe that Paranormal Activity was made for $11,000. It brings the scares of a $20 million-ish movie. Oren Peli takes the audience and scares them until the very end which is easily one of the most jolting endings to a movie ever. Don't watch the trailers! They spoil the ending! Anyway, Paranormal Activity is one of the scariest movies ever and will definitely spook any horror fan. It's a must see for people who care about movies and even for people just looking for fun. I know that I've never had as much fun watching a movie in theaters before. Paranormal Activity is not only one of the best films of the year, but also one of the most frightening films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Wasn't worth my time and money!!,"What i thought was going to be a great movie, came out to be worse than anything i have ever seen. This movie dragged on every single minute, never did i hear one scream in the audience, many were upset coming out saying things like ""worst movie"" ""didnt live up to the hype"".I watched this movie the second week it came out, at night in The Alamo Drafthouse in Austin TX. I wasted my time and my money, went right to sleep that night. DO NOT GO Disappoint YOURSELF FOR WATCHING THIS MOVIE!!! The only way you would get scared is if, no wait there is no way you can be scared in this movie. I've been trying to stop my college buddies from going to go watch it telling them that they are going to regret spending money on that piece of trash. They end up going, and end up coming back to me and telling me that i was right. WoRST AnTiCipated moVie OF ALL TIMMMEEE!!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Most hilarious movie ever!,"I found that ""Paranormal Acivity"" was one of the funniest movies of all time. A movie that stands a chance against it is ""Zombieland."" Even though this film was meant to terrify the population, I found that there was nonstop comedy. Granted, I have a twisted sense of humor and find ""The Exorcist"" hilarious, but nevertheless, this movie was hilarious. I will admit that this movie was intense and extraordinarily frightening, but simultaneously, it was hilarious. I normally do not care for video camera movies like ""The Blair Witch Project"" (in which I have not seen) and ""Cloverfield,"" but it was very well done. Question remains whether the events were real, but I definitely give this film a ten out of ten. I also found the reactions of the audience in the theater to add comedy to the movie. To conclude, I will fall asleep easily, but most people will not.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A stupid creation,"Well I just don't understand why this movie have this high rating. It is the most boring movie I have ever seen. It had wasted 90 minutes of my life which I will never get back. First of all I just don't consider it a movie. It is like a small child who is afraid of the dark, started to film what he have on his mind about the night. People here giving this boring stuff a high rating cant even explain what makes this movie fall in the horror category.Well for me this movie has nothing which terrifies even if you are watching alone in a dark night.

I was waiting to be scared, but a few doors banging, and powdered footprints didn't do it for me, did I also mention, it is the most boring film I've ever watched, sorry but if you where scared of this load of rubbish you must be scared of your own shadow, please don't pay to see this, in fact don't watch it for free, truly awful. It is not on par with some of the really good ghost story,The The Changeling 1980 staring George C. Scott now that is a truly scary film, makes the hair on the back of your neck stand on end. The Haunting 1960 another classic,these where good ghost story's, now people grab a camcorder and film any old rubbish and the sad thing is people enter into the hype they hear people saying its the scariest movie ever,don't watch it alone,i'd let my five year old granddaughter watch it, in fact Scooby Doo is scarier than this so called movie",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Is the world playing a joke on me,I went into this movie not expecting too much i love horror movies and by what everyone was saying this was a good one. Man were they wrong. I sat threw this entire movie not even jumping once. now the entire time this movie was going on it seemed like 97% of the movie was just the two characters arguing especially the girl. I would not recommend this movie to anybody out there. In fact this is probably the first movie I've seen i wanted my money back since alone in the dark.\ If you like to blow away money and not enjoy what it was used for then go ahead but once again I'm not happy with this movie at all and felt all the critics in the world played a joke on me.,1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A quality horror movie!,"Just like Insidious, this is just a great horror movie, it does it's job of really scaring you, and without showing any blood or guts in the process, which is rare these days. This movie doesn't show a lot, which means it'a left up to your imagination, and that is powerful when it comes to a horror movie! The actors are unknowns, and they did a great job with their roles. The found footage style worked for this film! It really made it extra-scary. I was just left feeling very scared and shaken, and the ending was gold, just like Insidious! 10/10 for Paranormal Activity!

Its just pure hype. Expected a lot from it by watching the trailers, I was so prepared to watch this movie and was all set for one hell of a scary ride but it turned out the other way.

Truly terrifying,"Let me start by saying I don't scare easily. I've seen nearly every famous horror and slasher film, but this movie got under my skin more than any film since The Exorcist. When a horror movie actually prevents you from getting sleep the night you see it, you know it's done its job. This film has been compared to Blair Witch, and rightly so. Like Blair Witch, the build-up is gradual and hand-held cameras are used. And like Blair Witch, the main characters are not Hollywood good looking--they're real and appealing. And they become absolutely unglued as the movie progresses. This is a ""minimalist horror movie making"" at its finest. The movie tips its hat to past classics, like the original The Haunting and Poltergeist, but also reminded me of Open Water in its depiction of a typical American couple thrust into an extraordinary situation, and how that impacts their relationship. I hate to use the cliché of ""don't see it alone,"" but in this case, seeing it with another person may ease the anxiety. And you will want to talk about this movie afterward. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I am two hours older.,"I can tell a horror story to you it begins with a duped and placated audience that has paid 10 to 25 bucks to sit through this slow moving poorly developed piece of relentless fodder. The characters are one dimensional, no real growth of any kind. The ""Scare"" of this film is the fact that there are reviews telling you it is ""Scary"". A true believer in shaky-cam filming does not have to be shown the cheap theatrics of wire tech ""special"" (as in education) effects. this may not be a politically correct statement but come on! This is community college level film and less than high school writing. Where acting is done by the audience and not the film actors.You duped me into watching this film on line.

I can honestly say I've never been more terrified.,"Paranormal Activity - Micah and Kate are a couple with a large house and a camera that they will not turn off. This is not a haunted house. Kate is the one who is haunted and has been since she was a child. She is haunted by a ghost so malevolent it is known as a demon. She and her husband are never alone, never safe, and never at ease.And neither are you.Brrrrr....This film brings to mind the most primal sense of fear and never stops hammering away at your sense of personal safety. If you've ever had paranormal experiences or just unexplainable ones, this film will bring them all back to the present. It does not stray far from the realm of possibility, unless you count how spacious a home this couple has, and one particularly dim-witted (well several, but what would you do in the situation?) mistake made by Micah. The biggest fear we have is not zombies or vampires, but a conscious malevolent unknown. Bottom line, you never see ANYTHING.Without giving much of anything away, nor building you up with false promises, I can say this is the scariest film I have ever seen. It's a slow build, yet I felt like I was going through hell at points. It just never ends. And then it does. And it stays with you. I have never been so scared by a film in my life.This film does it's job brilliantly, and was almost thrown away by the Hollywood folk. It proves just how ineffective the current horror industry is at producing genuine terror like what this film offers. This is eons better than Blair Witch, Cloverfield, or any of the other shaky cam films. It gets a well-deserved A, and is not recommended for people with heart conditions, weak constitutions, and my parents.A.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
wow,"Why does everybody say this is such a good movie?? I don't get what I'm missing. Everybody coming out of there after the movie was saying ""that was stupid"" or it was boring, and i totally agree with them. The scariest part was the end, but it was still pathetic. Nobody screamed, cried, gasped, or ran away, like the clip shows. It was BORING!! There are movies SO much better than this, it makes Napoleon Dynamite look good. The Exorcist is a good movie to see, Phsyco, Nightmare on Elm Street. But this?? It's just doors opening and closing, and a boyfriend and girlfriend messing around with a demon until it gets mad and possesses the woman. Scary!

Watching this movie is probably what purgatory is like,"Wanna save 9$ and two hours of your life? instead of watching this movie just stomp around the house, slam your door a few times and yell a lot; you'll get about the same experience minus the skull-numbingly boring 2 hours of sitting around. I had hope for this movie, i thought ""this indie horror flick could actually be pretty good"", but for all of my hope in this movie it juse spit in my face and ran off yelling ""OOOooooOOOOHHHHhhh!I'm a Scaaaaaaary ghOOOOoooOOOOst!"" and making airplane noises while flapping its arms. This movie is like that ugly kid in grade school who sat by himself and ate his own boogers that you thought might actually be a cool guy if you gave him a chance and when you do; you find out he's just a booger-eating freak and that's why no one likes him. The absolute worst part is that this movie is so bad its past being so bad that it's unintentionally hilarious; it's so bad its awful to put it in TV Tropes terms. So please, for the sake of movies being legitamately entertaining, don't pay to see this movie. In hindsight I wish I had burned my money before it paid for this movie.
