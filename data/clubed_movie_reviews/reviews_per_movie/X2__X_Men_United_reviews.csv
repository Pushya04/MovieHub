Another X-ellent movie!,"Some people would tell you that X2 is more conventional and mainstream than the first movie and to that I can only say: What a load of rubbish! Not only does X2 continue in the style set by the first film but it also improves on it greatly. This is achieved by adding more characters, making a deeper story and making the ever expanding universe even more chaotic so as better to capture the essence of the comic book. Two thumbs way up! The story picks up after the events of the first film in a way that pleases the viewers of the first film and is satisfactory to new viewers. The story is still well written and the pacing has improved a lot from the first film. There are no real slow points during the movie and the director takes special care to cram many of the scenes with breath taking visual effects so the audience will never lose interest. The dialog is once again both very sharp and witty and intelligent and allows for adequate character development. The character development is something some people have seen fit to criticize as they claim there isn't enough of it and except for only two characters I whole heartedly disagree. The character development of the main characters happened pretty much in the first film and therefore it is only necessary to add a bit more depth to the characters instead of repeating the character development from the first film. I did feel, however, that the film seemed somewhat rushed at times and that is a shame as it definitely had potential to be a 2½ hour film.The acting is still sublime and I, of course, have to emphasize Hugh Jackman who is still absolutely brilliant as Wolverine. Both in bringing out the animal sides during the fight sequences but also in keeping the character human like in the comics. Ian McKellen returns as well and further fleshes out his character of Magneto and makes the character every bit as devious and charismatic as in the previous film. Patrick Stewart returns as well and does what he did in the first film and he is still the only one who could play Xavier. Among the new actors are Brian Cox and Alan Cumming. Cox does what he does best and plays the new villain with the exaggerated style he usually does. Cumming on the other hand shows remarkable depth as Nightcrawler and is in spite of his appearance one of the most human characters in the film. I will miss him in the third film. Lets hope Beast is any bit as good as in the comics. Some have had their characters lessened in the sequel. Most notably James Marsden while Famke Jansen's character is developed further. Halle Berry's character Storm is still kept in the background but I'm sure she will get more screen time in the third film. Aside from the ones I have now mentioned the acting is quite good all round.Action wise the film took a major step up from the first film and many of the action scenes are quite simply awesome. We get to see more of Wolverine's feral rage which is always worth a look. All fights scenes with Wolverine are awesome and some of the most entertaining I've seen. Also we get a brief glimpse of Collosus kicking some ass and he does look cool I must say. In fact many of the individual mutants' powers are fleshed out in X2 and like in the original X-Men film they look absolutely beautiful. My only concern regarding the effects and action scenes is how on earth they are going to top them in the coming third X-Men film.In regards to music and sound the film improved upon the first film with a much more catchy soundtrack and more audible effects. For example the sounds of Wolverine's claws shooting out and retracting have been amplified making him even more menacing than he was in the first film. Very well done.All in all X2 is an excellent continuation of the original film and we are nearing something that is more like a saga than a series of films. I'm really beginning to see Bryan Singer as a master director after these two brilliant films and I am a little sad he opted to do Superman Returns rather than finish what he started with the X-Men films.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Better than the first film,"Not that the first film was bad, because actually I still found it good, well-made fun for all its flaws. It's just that whereas the first X-Men film did feel like the beginning of a franchise that was yet to properly find its feet, it was found with X2. X2 isn't perfect either but still a very good film that is bigger and darker than the first and all the better for it. Again X2 is very well-made, with the dark visual style still maintained yet with a slightly grander look. The photography is beautiful and atmospheric, and the special effects are better here too, they were good in the first that they're slicker, bolder and eye-popping in the way that the first film didn't quite but almost did achieve. Whilst Michael Kamen's score in the first was fine, John Ottman's score here is an improvement being more in tune with the atmosphere and what's happening in the story.The script is even sharper here and with more depth, the humour and comic one-liners are witty and genuinely funny, they are not cheesy or out-of-place nor are they too much. There is a melancholic tone too that is dark and quite poignant and the romantic elements are sweet but never too soap-opera-ish. The story is where the darker and bigger terms most apply, apart from a couple of parts that could have slowed down and explained themselves more you are glued to your seat almost the entire time and emotionally connect with scenes and characters too. The assault on the White House sequence is exciting and a brilliant way to start the film, and it is true that the climax here puts the climax of the first in the shade, it's not contrived in the slightest and you are biting your nails. X2 does a great job mostly with the characters, where they are more complex and relatable.Although once again Storm and Cyclops are underdeveloped, otherwise Wolverine is a gritty and identifiable anti-hero, and of the other characters Nightcrawler was most effective. Though once again credit is due for making Magneto much more than a stereotypical villain. X2 is very well played by the cast, with the standouts being Hugh Jackman's charismatic Wolverine, Ian McKellen's menacing Magneto with shades of melancholy, Alan Cumming's camp yet affecting Nightcrawler and Brian Cox who plays Stryker with relish without falling into cliché territory. Also good are Rebecca Romijin-Stamos who continues to be sexy and icy, and her transformation sequences are among the visual highlights of the film and Patrick Stewart still is cool and fun though his screen time should have been longer.Only three cast members don't quite work, and they were James Marsden who's even stiffer than he was in the first(not helped by his character not been used as well as he could have been), Halle Berry who looks bored and Shawn Ashmore does look awkward at times. Other than a couple of rushed, under-explained parts, a couple of characters given short shrift and a couple of performances that didn't quite make the grade the film is a touch overlength, but the film on the whole is very good and lots of fun in its own right. It compares extremely favourably to the first film and manages to be better than it. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"""Sometimes the mind needs to discover things for itself.""","2000's smash hit X-Men certainly deserved a sequel (or two, or three), especially with all the cash it made and how the first one ended. Now the X-Men are back together once again, and this time they've got some new friends, including Nightcrawler and Pyro, and as well as some new enemies like William Stryker and Lady Deathstrike (his personal mutant ""assistant""/slave). This time the X-Men find themselves locked in an unlikely alliance with Magneto and Mystique (their nemeses from the first film) against an evil military scientist named William Stryker, whose main goal is to eradicate the world of mutants once and for all.X2: X-Men United is in many ways an improvement over the first film. It's more psychological, it's longer, there's more action, more mutants, more of Wolverine slicing it up and like the first film it's never boring or drags, right from the get-go X2 is fierce and exciting. In fact, X2 is almost the perfect comic book film almost. The one little, weak link in X2, for me at least, was Nightcrawler. Now, I like the character of Nightcrawler, but I honestly didn't care that much for Alan Cumming, he came off as a bit weak, and kind of ""dorky"". The character of Nightcrawler really just seems like a huge convenience to the plot; like the scene where he rescues Rogue in the X-Jet, which was oh so very convenient. But the one thing I liked about Nightcrawler, besides that awesome opening sequence in the White House, was his religious side, which I thought was interesting and made me sympathize with the character a little more.Pretty much everything in X2 works perfectly fine, which I attribute all that success to the amazing cast (Jackman, McKellen, Stewart, Marsden, Janssen, Berry, Paquin, Cox, Romijn), and the fact that the film was written and directed by the same people who clearly knew what they were doing back in 2000, and here they show us once again they still know what they're doing, and they aren't afraid to up the ante and take it up a notch. If you liked the first X-Men there's really no reason at all why wouldn't enjoy or like X2 as much, or maybe even more than the first film. It still has those surprising moments of humor, and plenty of action, maybe even more so than the original. And like the original, X2 sets itself up for a third film; let's just hope it turns out (at the very least) as good as the first two films, if not better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"After Watching This, Roll On X-Men 3","Absolutely happy! That is the only word I can use to describe my feelings after spending my hard-earned money to see X-Men 2. It was worth every penny.Firstly, the makers of superhero films such as this have an unenviable task. They have to please hardcore comic fans and casual movie fans which is no easy task. And The X-Men-with their forty years of history and continuity-are perhaps the hardest heroes to put on the big screen. Well, I've spoken to many hardcore X-fans and casual movie fans and they all enjoyed it too.I won't go into great detail about the plot. Let's just say that The X-Men and their enemy Magneto have to join forces to combat an even bigger threat. I enjoyed this movie so much because for the first time in years, I didn't read ANYTHING about the plot or any reviews prior to viewing it. That is why I'm not going to go into great detail about the plot. Just enjoy it.All the favourites are back including my personal favourite Hugh Jackman as Wolverine (I hope Wolverine gets his own movie franchise one day). The makers of this movie have done a great job in making sure various characters get the right amount of screen time. We'd all love our favourites to get more screentime but with so many X-Men (and women), the producers have to do the best they can; and they do indeed.There are a few really great special effects in this movie but unlike some special effects laden movies, the plot is more important in this movie. Furthermore, the movie is much deeper and really makes you think. Marvel comics (and movies) have always been deep and many of the issues have reflected real life. This movie is about persecution and intolerance of mutants and reflects many issues from the past and the present such as Hitler's treatment of the Jews and the different ideologies of Martin Luthor King and Malcom X. In fact, many longtime X-fans have compared the X-Men's Professor X to Martin Luthor King and the evil Magneto to Malcom X. Seeing a movie like this cannot only provide a couple of hours of entertainment but make you view society in a totally different way.This is the best superhero film since the 70's (when we saw gems such as Superman The Movie) and the 80's (when we saw Tim Burton's Batman). It was a fantastic film but it begs one question-how are they ever going to top this?",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A few problems in an otherwise excellent film,"They've done a hell of a lot right. That's my response to Singer's X-Men films; they're slick, funny, emotive and a real blast to watch. Without overdrawn character introductions and explanations, X2 launches right into seventh gear and doesn't let up.Admirably, the film allows the majority of its characters a genuinely engaging storyline amongst the bigger picture, and although the story is not without its fault (using Cerebro as a major plot point two films in a row is like building the second Death Star in Return of the Jedi; been there, seen it before) it is certainly worthy of high praise. It's amazing that in just two films we already have a real appreciation for the relationships between such a considerable group of characters, and it is for the continued development of these relationships - and not the cool story line and action sequences - that makes me look forward to another X-film.I would love to say that it's the casting that makes the films so brilliant - and it's true, the casting is great - but a couple of these characters have been woefully miscast. Iceman stood out for me, bringing an uncomfortable Backstreet Boy vibe to the role, and although his role in X2 is small, James Marsden just doesn't seem to have it in him to hold a commanding and authoritative position among the X-sters as Cyclops. In the first X-film he managed to at least stand beside the Wolverine with some great gags, but he's been left in the gutter for X2, and in the single scene toward the end of the film where Marsden is allowed to genuinely act, his emotional response feels awkward and forced. I am sure he is capable of more than this, and hopefully when X-Men 3 comes around he'll have more to work with. I've never been happy with Halle Berry as Storm, and she looks bored out of her skull in this film. I hope not to see her return.Thankfully, most of Singer's new cast are admirable. The recast Pyro is great and Nightcrawler is fantastic. In fact, Alan is the only actor in the film who comes close to matching the quality of Jackman's Wolverine and McKellen's Magneto. These wonderful actors all appear to genuinely revel in portraying their characters. Janssen steps her performance up a notch too and it helps the film no end. I really hope to see her in the next film.Ultimately, there are just a few slip-ups here in an otherwise classy and supremely entertaining film. With such an established canon of characters everyone is going to have their own opinion on how particular character should be portrayed, and for the most part X-2 does the job. Hopefully the bugs will be ironed out and we'll see a sequel of equal or greater quality in a few years. I'm certainly excited at the prospect.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the best sequels to date!,"The X-Men has always been my favorite comic book, without a doubt. Spider-man is probably in second place, but The X-Men take the cake.  Ever since I heard a sequel was going into the works and Bryan Singer was still on board as director, I had faith that he would do the sequel justice...of course I couldn't help but have that looming fear that something would go wrong.  In the end, the film was released and of course, I wasted no time in getting to the theater to see it on opening day.After seeing the film, I can definitely say it's been a long time since I've come out of a movie theater as happy as I did for this film.  The story was absolutely brilliant and was told in the perfect manner to keep you interested.  ...And of course, there are plenty of new characters and action to keep the audience in awe as well.Nightcrawler was a truly brilliant character to bring into the sequel of the film.  Nightcrawler (Kurt Wagner) has always been one of favorite X-Men characters, perhaps even more than Wolverine...but that's up for debate. Teleportation has GOT to be one of the coolest and most interesting ideas for a mutant ability!  I was incredibly stoked to see him brought to life on the big screen, Bryan Singer and Alan Cumming did a FANTASTIC job!  Next to Wolverine, Colossus has also got to be one of my favorite characters.  I can't even begin to express how happy I was to see him in the film...although not NEARLY enough was done with him when there was so much potential for his abilities in the film.  Oh well, there's always X-Men 3 right?  The other two new characters, Pyro (John Allerdyce) and Lady Deathstrike (Yuriko Oyama) were very well done as well, although not much of their character histories were explained...which is ok, there is only so much time in a film.  The rest of the characters already had a firm basis from the previous film and were all executed extremely well in this sequel, my hat is off to Mr. Bryan Singer, ""Keep up the good work!""The entire cast was absolutely perfect for the film.  Ian McKellan, Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Brian Cox, Alan Cumming, Bruce Davison, Anna Paquin, Kelly Hu, Aaron Stanford, Shawn Ashmore, and Daniel Cudmore all did incredible jobs with their roles and should be proud of their work, truly fantastic.The story in this sequel is great.  I love the idea of the good and the bad having an equal threat and being forced to work together in order to save them all.  The chemistry and the relationship between Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto) and Professor Charles Xavier is so bizarre and interesting...and very thought provoking.  There are so many interesting and well done relationships between characters in the film: Logan (Wolverine) - Scott Summers (Cyclops), Rogue - Bobby Drake (Iceman), Jean Grey - Scott Summers (Cyclops) and Jean Grey - Logan (Wolverine) to name a few.  I love just watching them all interact with each other.What it all boils down to is this, if you liked the first film, then you should definitely like this film.  I'm not sure I could say I liked X2 better than the original, but I'd definitely feel comfortable saying it was just as good...and better in certain aspects (but not as a whole).I would definitely recommend seeing this film in the theater or at least rent it when it's released, it's well worth your time.  This film isn't all about super-heroes, action and fantasy, there is a lot more to it than just that and I hope you can see and appreciate that.  I do hope that you enjoy the film as much as I do and thank you for reading my review, be sure to read my review for the first ""X-Men"".-ChrisP.S.  They better start crackin' on a X3 right away!Also..here's some interesting trivia for ya.  In the scene where Mystique is finding out where Magneto is being held she is scrolling through a bunch of names, the name above Lensherr, Erik (Magneto) is LeBeau, Remy...aka ""Gambit""...nice little touch there, I didn't get a look at the other names there, but there might be more allusions there.  Another cool thing is in the scene where the security guard is in the bar, there is a TV on in the background with a guy named Hank McCoy talking...Hank McCoy later becomes known as ""Beast"".  Pretty cool huh...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Not as Keen About it as Most,"Unlike many others I didn't enjoy this sequel as much as the first film. I found the story here to be very underdeveloped and mutants powers needed to be sort of edited along the way to make the plot go the way intended. In other words it felt a lot like patchwork. I didn't really learn anything more about the characters than I did in the first one, which you really should with a 2 hour plus film. The Wolverine, cyclops , Jean , love trio doesn't really work for me. None of them are very good at acting it out and it just feels extremely forced. Professor Xavier's role is minimized and I just wish he could be used more .Magneto of course is an excellent villain played by the perfect actor. He's sneaky yet subtle and delivers his lines brilliantly. Stryker on the other hand is kind of a run of the mill villain and not particularly memorable.Overall this movie is still so much better than a lot of the Marvel stuff we get now, but that really isn't saying much.It still certainly encourages you to watch the next one in the series.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
X2: Mutation Moves On,"After the success of the first movie, Bryan Singer brings the X-Men back to the screen. He has stated X2 is the X-version of The Empire Strikes Back. He's not totally wrong: like Empire, X2 is darker than its predecessor, characters are developed and dealt with in a more mature way, and the foreboding climax is quite shocking indeed (there's even a ""I am your father""-style revelation concerning Wolverine's past, which is given more space here than in the first chapter). In fact, the movie could have been named X2: Humanity Strikes Back.That's right, this time it's the ""ordinary"" people who are raising hell, in particular William Stryker (Brian Cox), a military scientist who takes advantage of the increasing paranoia surrounding mutants and has the POTUS himself approve his plan to take down the ""monsters"" once and for all. The war is about to begin, and with Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and Cyclops (James Marsden) gone, the only X-Men left to face Stryker are Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Storm (Halle Berry) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), with some help from Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Iceman (Shawn Ashmore). They are eventually joined by a former employee of Stryker's, the blue-skinned teleporter Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), as well as the most unlikely ally around: Magneto (Ian McKellen), who has managed to escape from the plastic prison he was locked up in (the break-out plays like the Marvel version of Hannibal Lecter's escape in The Silence of the Lambs, and yes, that is a compliment).The plot is loosely based on the famous graphic novel God Loves, Man Kills by X-guru Chris Calremont (the villain and the alliance with Magneto are explicitly taken from that story), but Singer makes it all much more apocalyptic (Stryker was simply a preacher in the comic-book), while also having the time to take a look at some of the first film's subplots: the Wolverine-Jean-Cyclops love triangle is taken to a new, unexpected level and the Canadian mutant's forgotten ""origin"" starts getting slowly unveiled (Wolverine: ""Who are you?""; Stryker: ""Don't you remember?""). Jackman is the standout in this movie, as we finally get to see everybody's favorite X-fella lose it and make the bad guys regret they showed up in the first place. Those sequences are a treat for those who have grown up loving Wolverine and his dual, conflicted nature. Another actor who leaves a memorable impression is Cumming with his portrayal of Nightcrawler, one of the mutants people fear the most (he looks like a demon), but also the one who's most willing to forgive mankind for its mistakes.So, with all the great acting, good writing and clever direction, no wonder X2 was voted the greatest comic-book movie ever before Spider-Man 2 and Batman Begins were released. This is one superhero opus you won't want to miss.9,5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining but a little chaotic,"I did enjoy this sequel I admit, but I think I'm the minority when I say that its not quite as good as the first film. The first X-men introduced us to a handful (Or two) of mutant characters and we learned about each one of them. The focus of the story was aimed at one thing but here in the sequel they have added so many more mutant characters that the main story is almost forgotten in a windstorm of action scenes. Anna Paquin as Rogue has hardly anything to do here except be frustrated at not being able to be intimate with her boyfriend. This film is definitely geared at a young audience with a lot of the characters being of the teen variety. Halle Berry as Storm is another casualty where her big mission in this film is to get children out of a tunnel. She is absolutely wasted and didn't director Bryan Singer have a better written character for this Oscar winner? The things that I think help the film for me is the mutant Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) who is so sexy and strong that even when she's just standing there doing nothing you can't take your eyes off her. If they ever do a film with just her, I'm sold! Their is two performances that stood out for me and the first one is by Famke Janssen who plays Dr. Jean Grey. Its the best written role in the film and she shows real human complexities, she's not just a comic book figure. She's having problems with her telekinetic abilities because of the dreams she's been having and she's also torn between her relationship to two others. The other performance is by Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier who runs the school. He doesn't just posture and allow special effects to run his character, Stewart is too well trained an actor to allow that. In a scene at the end of the film his character is staring out a window reflecting on what has happened and what the future may hold. Even with all the impressive special effects in this film, that scene of Stewart leaves the most indelible image for me. I hope if or when they make another sequel that they try and keep just the main characters as the focus so the overall point of the film doesn't get lost like it seemed to in this film. Of all the new characters introduced here the one I liked the most was Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler played by Alan Cumming. Entertaining film but has way to much going on in such a short amount of time. Lets hope they tone everything down the next time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
why all the underrating?,"A lot has been said about this movie, as is the case with many recent Hollywood comics adaptations. While I truly respect everyone's opinion, I really don't see the point in some criticisms brought up against this movie.(Definitely NO spoilers ahead.)First of all, we must realize that X-men comics have been around for decades. They existed before many of you were born. Still, the producers had to assume that the average audience had little or no idea about the mutant phenomenon, but Bryan singer did a very good job (as always) in the first film, and introduced the audience. Besides, adapting such a story with so many characters to the screen is no easy job, and is also risky, considering it's Hollywood and it must return all those millions. So the mutant phenomenon was well explained, the characters and their abilities introduced, and the plot (which actually had a story, unlike many action flicks) was carried out smoothly. All in the running time of one film. good job.The second film, however, had to concentrate (naturally) on more characters and a more thorough story. This is why I object (in the title) to people criticising this film for ""lack of character development"" etc. Many of the characters WERE developed in the first film. If you never read x-men comics, and did not even see the first movie, and see this one right away and still expect the director/writer to spell things out for you, well, you'll be disappointed. ""Where did Colossus take the kids during the attack?"" someone asked. To hide them somewhere, THAT'S where he took them. I don't think people would like to see the director spell out everything, such as Colossus' inner voice saying, ""Well, let me take these kids somewhere beneath this multimillion dollar facility, to hide them from the bad guys.""And the newly-introduced characters were introduced well enough. You see their abilities, you see whose side they're on, you even learn more about their personalities as the movie progresses. What else do you need to learn? Which team he supports?The highlight of the film was definitely Mystique's transformation scenes, very well done.The movie had many shortcomings, of course, the pace slowed down more than once, some main characters, especially Cyclops, were almost lost, but the plusses were way more than minuses. Especially Nightcrawler, who almost stole the lead from Wolverine. I must also add that Wolverine is much more violent in this film than the first, much more like the original comic character.As for the people who complain about the abundance of characters. Well, bad news for you. X-men is not a story of a couple of guys and their girlfriends. There are much more characters, hopefully to be seen in the next sequel(s). Jubilee, Pyro and Colossus were all hinted in this one. Though I'm eager to see Gambit also, I can't wait to see how they will do the Beast. Of course, I can see the ""no character development"" people asking each other, ""Who is Beast?""In short, this movie does what it's supposed to do: Gives us entertainment, and shows us our favorite characters on screen.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"A Darker, Deeper Dive into Mutantkind","X2: X-Men United is a significant escalation from its predecessor, trading the exploratory tone of the first film for a high-octane thriller with profound thematic depth. Director Bryan Singer masterfully expands the X-Men universe while delving deeper into the characters and their complex moral dilemmas.The film's narrative is driven by a ticking clock, as the X-Men face a formidable new threat in Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox), a ruthless anti-mutant zealot. This heightened stakes approach elevates the action sequences to a new level of intensity, with the climactic showdown at the Weapon X facility being a particular highlight.However, X2 is more than just a blockbuster spectacle. It explores mature themes of government surveillance, human experimentation, and the blurred lines between hero and villain. The introduction of Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) adds a poignant dimension to the story, as his character grapples with questions of faith and belonging.The ensemble cast delivers outstanding performances. Hugh Jackman's Wolverine continues to evolve, showcasing his character's vulnerability alongside his ferocious fighting style. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen's dynamic as Professor X and Magneto reaches new heights of complexity. Halle Berry's Storm emerges as a powerful and independent figure, while the additions of Alan Cumming and Shawn Ashmore as Iceman bring fresh energy to the franchise.One of the film's strengths lies in its character development. Wolverine's backstory is partially unveiled, offering glimpses into his tormented past. This adds layers to his complex character, making him even more compelling. Nightcrawler's introduction brings a refreshing dynamic, his faith-based struggles providing a unique perspective on the mutant experience.While the film's pacing is occasionally uneven, and some plot points feel rushed, X2 remains a thrilling and thought-provoking entry in the superhero genre. It successfully builds upon the foundation laid by the first film, offering a richer and more complex exploration of the mutant world.The relationship between Professor X and Magneto continues to be a core element, but their dynamic shifts as they find themselves on the same side, albeit for different reasons. This unexpected alliance adds complexity to their characters and provides opportunities for intriguing character interactions.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"""X2"" (""X-Men 2"")-  Arguably the best of the series.  Thoughfull, exciting and exceedingly well-constructed.","With nine films thus far and at least two more on the horizon, all released over a near-twenty year window, 20th Century Fox's ""X-Men"" film franchise is something of a wonder in today's world of near- constant reboots and remakes. While it has by no means been a smooth ride, the fact remains that the long-running series has been a widely beloved and infinitely important one, especially when placed into historical perspective. Director Bryan Singer's original entry was one of the first major comic-to-film adaptations that convinced studios and audiences alike that comic-book movies could not only be mature and enthralling, but could be certified hits once again after the genre seemed to die-out in the 90's. And thus, a franchise was born and has stuck around ever since, through thick and thin.It's almost a surprise, however, that one of the best entries in the entire saga came so early- 2003's follow-up ""X2."" With Singer once again at the helm, the film is in every conceivable way an improvement over his excellent first film- it's more thoughtful, more daring, more exciting... I think one could even reasonably say that not only is it arguably the greatest film in the franchise- it just might be one of the best comic-to-film adaptations of all time. Yes, it's that good.Some time after the original film, a brainwashed mutant called Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) is sent on a mission to try and assassinate the President of the United States under the guise of being a martyr for Mutant Freedom. Despite the mutant being stopped, the troubling event gives Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox) the political edge and backing needed to get approval for an ""investigation"" on Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters- but his investigation is actually an invasion, as he storms the school, taking many students hostage and forcing the remaining X-Men to flee. At the same time, Storm (Halle Berry) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) are sent on a mission to collect Nightcrawler and learn his motivation for the attack, Cyclops (James Marsden) and Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) are captured by Stryker's mysterious bodyguard (Kelly Hu) and the shape-shifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) helps her former leader Magneto (Ian McKellan) escape from his high-tech prison. Soon, the remaining mutants (including Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Anna Paquin as Rogue and Shawn Ashmore as Iceman) are forced to team up with their former adversary to try and stop Stryker's scheme to use Charles and his powers to wipe out all of the mutants on Earth.Given the film's nature as an ensemble piece, it's near-impossible to discuss the performances of each actor individually. But to keep it brief, everyone returning from the original is great in their respective roles. Special commendation goes to Hugh Jackman and his continued excellence in the role that helped to define him as a superstar and to Famke Jannsen, who gets a lot more attention this time around. They are by far the stand-outs of the returning cast. I also highly enjoyed Stewart and McKellen, who bring a sense of class and elegance to their roles and are incredible as always. The newest additions are also outstanding. Brian Cox is one of the greatest actors of our time, and his turn as Stryker is quite remarkable. He gives the character both an easily- ""despiseable"" sense of threat and dread, yet also a nice and subtle sense of pain and pathos. He's a cruel man, yet he has a past that might explain why he is the way he is. Alan Cumming is just magical as the frightened yet also amusing Nightcrawler, and there's a lot of great moments in his performance. And Kelly Hu makes for a fun and furious adversary as Styker's second-in-command ""Lady Deathstrike.""Singer returns to direct from a script by ""X-Men"" scribe David Hayter and the writing duo of Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris. Singer got his start with hard-hitting thrillers like ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Apt Pupil"", and I think that's part of what gives him an edge with the storytelling. He plays the stories straight and gives them a sense of real and honest threat, while also maintaining an emotional core that feels realistic despite the outlandish nature of the story and heavy Science-Fiction leanings of the material. He's also a very gifted visual artist with a slick and savage sense of composition and flow that lends itself well to the needs of high- concept action. His work on the series has always been nothing less than stunning. The script is very tightly written and juggles the plethora of characters well- everyone has their moment to shine, every major player has a clearly defined role and arc and the pacing is superb. Some wonderful work is done with the writing, and it's an honest shame that neither Hayter nor the writing partners of Dougherty and Harris were involved in the third entry.The rest of the production is just marvelous. (Pardon the bad joke) Composer/co-editor John Ottman shapes some wonderful and memorable musical themes that compliment the tone and style perfectly, and he weaves together shots and sequences with a masterful touch. Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel's visual palette is cool and visually arresting, and his work is just stunningly gorgeous. Some wonderful visual flair is given thanks to his talent. And production and costume design courtesy Guy Hendrix Dyas and Louise Mingenbach respectively is just fantastic. The film is made with nothing but top-notch work from top-notch artists.As it stands, ""X2"" is easily one of the best if not the single best entry in the long-running series. Its phenomenal direction, sharp and thoughtful writing, beautiful production and outstanding cast weave an enthralling and thrilling cinematic experience that still stands tall well over a decade later. It's up there with the best of the best in terms of comic-book movies.There's no other way to look at it- ""X2"" easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Fun, but very overrated.","I'll keep this short and to-the-point. I am a life long reader of comic books. I love them and passionately anticipate and enjoy most of the recent motion pictures based on them. DC and Dark Horse comics have always been my favorites, and aside from The Punisher and Ghost Rider, I do not care too much for Marvel. However, despite that, I enjoyed the original X-Men very much. I think Bryan Singer is one of the most talented directors of his generation (see The Usual Suspects.) Yet, I was really disappointed by this sequel. Don't get me wrong, X2 is a very well done comic book adaption when compared to shameful misfires such as Hulk and Elektra, yet I do not believe it to be nearly as wonderful as everyone says. The whole film just feels so muddled and pointless to me. The ending drags on forever, and doesn't really have much of anything new to offer. Perhaps I missed something, but other than the addition of the awesome Nightcrawler character, this felt very routine and meaningless. I can't say I have very high hopes for X3 either. I do highly recommend the original X-Men, but I don't feel either of these films come close to the real masterpieces in the genre, such as Batman Begins, Hellboy, V For Vendetta, or Sin City.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
DULL,"After a good opening sequence,the movie follows the route of a big budget remake of the first. Only i found this less than exciting infact i found it boring. A film should never cost this much and be dull. But i have to say the movie is tedious. The dam scenes look poor compared to ones in Force Ten From Naverone. The action is lukewarm at best. Patrick Stewart might as well be playing Picard,spot the difference. Only Hugh Jackman and Alan Cummings deserve any credit. All talk and no action. One Boring Movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Re-watching this in 2024!,"I decided to rewatch all the X-Men movies and Deadpool movies before the release of Deadpool 3. Pyro in this movie is in Deadpool 3 so seemed like a good idea and I gotta say after rewatching this movie in 2024, 21 years after it came out, I am still blown away by how good this movie was. This movie straight up looks better than almost every marvel movie that comes out these days. Everything is CGI garbage these days whereas X2 actually looks like a film that was made by people who gave a damn. The story, while nothing too complex or groundbreaking, is great and very entertaining and interesting. I also think the first X-Men from 2000, apart from some dated effects is also still a great film but X2 blows the first movie out of the water. X2 is still one of the best marvel films ever made to this day 21 years later. If this movie was ever gonna be dated it would have happened by now. It's a damn shame Brett Ratner had to ruin X-Men 3, what a disappointment that movie was after how awesome X2 was.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Better than the First,"X-Men was a good movie, but not a great one. It had a number of deficiencies. The most crucial of these IMO was the story itself. It never really engaged the viewer all that much. X2 OTOH has a much better story line. It is perhaps a little too obvious for the viewer but it is nonetheless more interesting.X2 contains many action sequences laden with special effects. The movie hasn't been bogged down too much by all this and most of them are fairly original and well done.The movie also continues the attempts at characterisation, especially of Wolverine, and for the most part seems to try too hard. The ""chemistry"" between Wolverine and Dr Jean Gray seems too forced. It would also be nice to see Rogue given more of a job than simply being an ornament, but a rather nice one at that :) Perhaps if there is an X-Men 3 she'll get to do more.The comedic elements of the movie are once again well done with Jackman delivering some great dead-pan one-liners.Overall, X2 is a fun and enjoyable movie but it must be remembered that it really isn't trying to be anything other than an action movie. It's perhaps a little long also.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Best X-Men in the franchise!,"X2 (2003) is the best sequel superhero of MARVEL comic book films! In my opinion X2 is the best superhero in the X-Men film franchise. This film is the bomb and it is my second favorite film alongside with X-Men, X-Men: Days of Future Past and X-Men: First Class. The effects are a lot of better than in other X-Men movies. The movie itself is great. I liked all of the X-Man trilogy a whole lot, but this one is by far my favorite!This was the only movie that I watch the last one of the X-Men trilogy, it is really awesome movie. I would say by far the best one of the X-Men movies far way better than First Class, Origins Wolverine, The Wolerine, X-Men and X-Men: The Last Stand, the third X-men movie. My favorite fight scenes were fight between Scott Summers Cylops and Lady Deathstrike the Asian chick. She way played by Kelly Hu, she was really hot. William Stryker played by Brian Cox was fantastic he wanted to find and kill all the mutants by using Professor X. This time Magneto escapes from jail he and Mystique join forces and team together with the X-Men to bring and stop common enemy together. This time battle begins in Canada. After Wolverine left for Canada at the end of the first movie to find answers about his past. Here he did not find anything about his past, in stead of that he found an underground that was Stryker's secret lab for torturing Mutants.In the first movie the final battle took place on Liberty Island in New York. In the second movie takes place the finale battle in Canada Alkali Lake. The third movie takes place the finale battle in San Francisco Alcatraz. The attack on Xavier school mutants academy was fantastic and how Wolverine killed most of Stryker 's men. Fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike was fantastic. This movie was really the best one. Wolverine did defeat Deathstrike at the end. I love this movie. Patrick Stewart is the best Professor Xavier.One of the best X-Men films ever made and my favorite team one, sorry Avengers but you got nothing on X2. The themes here are so awesome and are perfectly in line with X-Men, the character stuff is fantastic and the action was bad ass. The scene where Wolverines cutting through dudes in the X-Mansion was classic Wolverine. I loved the Nightcrawler in the White House so cool! I wish that I would go in the theater watching this film in 2003, by that time I just wasn't interested watching an X-Men movie, because I didn't understand the first movie, but I do now and It is my favorite superhero film now! I love Wolverine! he is a bad ass! Hugh Jackman is a great actor.X-Men set the standards far as how a great comic supposed to be. This movie is the best out of the 3. Entertaining, fast paced, great storyline. Even if you're not an X-Men fan you will enjoy this. X2 is the movie X1 should've been. The action, storyline and CGI were all improved. Just an overall better, more complete movie.I love this film and it is a bad ass film forever!!!The plot about this film is: The evolution continues in the next thrilling adventure in the X-Men saga. In the wake of a shocking attack on the President, the X-Men face their most dangerous mission ever. They must stand united with their deadliest enemies to combat a menace that threatens mankind... and mutantkind.X2 (often promoted as X2: X-Men United, or internationally as X-Men 2 is a 2003 American superhero film, based on the X-Men superhero team appearing in Marvel Comics, distributed by 20th Century Fox.

BETTER THAN FIRST ONE,X-Men 2 is a good sequel. I think it is better than first movie with one step. Its action and visual effects are better. New characters are cool and Mystique is still surprising me. But I think both of these movies had more potential.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"""You picked the wrong house, Bub""","""X-Men"" is responsible for reviving the once dead Super-hero genre of movies. Since then, we've seen Spider-Man and Daredevil protecting the streets of New York while accomplishing box-office success. But 'X-Men', to me, is still the best Super-hero movie since Batman. So it will be rather difficult to achieve the same kind of success with a sequel, right? This is the first 'part 2' sequel from the super-hero genre since Batman Returns. So it's sort of testing the waters, on Hero staying power. 'X2' continues right where the first left off. Wolverine arrives back from his trek in Canada,at Xavier's school for mutants. Magneto is still in a plastic prison for his attack on Liberty Island. And all is right for the mutant world. But not for long. A mutant named 'Nightcrawler', attacks the president by infiltrating the white house with his teleportation powers. Which causes civil unrest in the country. Gen. William Stryker finds out about Professer X's mutant academy, and uses the attack on the president as a means to invade it. Here groups of mutants are seperated, but they find out about Styker's plan to destroy every mutant on the planet using Professer X, and a secret weapon. This situation calls for the X-Men and Magneto's (you may have guessed, he escaped) Brotherhood to unite to save the mutant population. While not exactly better than the first, it is better than most original movies. It starts off wonderfully, like the first movie never ended. The production design was consistant with the first movie, unlike the Batman franchise. And the action was superb and top-notch. My only problems are some characters dont get as much screen time as they should, Cyclops for example is only in the movie for about 20 minutes. But he does make the best of it. And the character 'Lady Deathstryke' should have been more developed. She hardly spoke at all. But the biggest problem (while still small) is the movie is a bit anti-climactic. It does have a climax, but a bit toned down for the X-men. Just a bit. Other than that, its an exciting story with a very brave ending. Everyone gave a good preformance. Most notably, Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Alan Cumming (Nightcrawler) and Aaron Stanford (Pyro). The movie progressed the X-Men storyline very well (unlike the Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers.

Why don't the X-Men movies get more respect?,"Beastly movie, great story and elevation of the action sequences. Good addition of characters.

Best Out of the Original X-Men Trilogy,"They did some many things better than the last. The stakes are much higher, the action is actually fun and cool to look at. Some of the dialogue in here was great, the writing was also miles better than the last. I've also come to care for these characters a lot more, thanks to the first one. The relationship between Xavier and Magneto is still interesting and still has me hooked. Cyclops continues to be wasted potential 😕.

A dark past catching up,"There clearly is more material here than in the previous film. It raises the stakes and explores some of the main characters' histories. The visuals are also stronger. What's clearly weaker than the last time is the music. Beyond the opening and the ending credits, there isn't much to speak of. In general, of course, ""X2"" from 2003 is ""more"" than ""X-MEN"" from 2000. But more does not necessarily mean better. Piecing all the elements together here isn't as careful as the last time, and even though the runtime is longer, the movie seems to be struggling to keep it all together. The editing may have something to do with that. But again, as for the good things, it is a sequel that follows in the original's footsteps. That alone can be viewed as a luxury a couple of decades after ""X2"" was released. It looks better than the first one. The sounds, however, don't beat the first one. The contents have more but could have been organized better. A good sequel, for sure, but whether it is better than the original can be rightfully questioned. And a good piece of entertainment that, again, is not all fun but also matters of life and death.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
More Of Same Eye-Popping FX,"Since the first movie, ""X-Men,"" was famous for its great special effects, this sequel knew enough to deliver the same kind of eye-popping effects to please its fans....and it did! There are absolutely tons of stunning special effects, both visually and audibly. All of that means very few lulls in this 134-minute film.Having said that, I do think the film needed some lulls. At over two hours of pretty intense action, it needed more breaks. It's just too much. Either that, or shorten the story.Rebecca Romjin-Stamos, in her skin-tight outfit, is still a feast for us male eyes and Halle Berry and Famke Jannson aren't bad, either! Other familiar names from the first film are still here, such as Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Anna Pacquin and Ian McKellan.It's a pretty interesting story and although they state evolution ""as a fact"" early on once again, they do have something unusual in today's films: a Christian character who was a good guy.All in all, if you liked the first film, you'll like this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Like any good sequel, it improves itself well and continues the story nicely","A more detailed and engaging plot and a rather epic and smash ending, especially when comparing it to the first film.

The X-Men group together again with Magneto and Mystique helping out for the first time. Will the two ever officially be apart of them? As expected, they're not just on another rescue mission, but a mission that could potentially save their growing species as well as humanity's. I could almost add another 1/2 to this rating for the usual good sequel achievement. What happened to Magneto is certainly one question that remains.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Better than the first.,"This movie was great--much better than the original film, which was pretty standard as far as summer blockbusters go.  X-2 skipped all the awkward and unnecessary attempts at a backstory (and I'm speaking as someone who knew next to nothing about the XMen when I saw the film) and went straight for an intelligent route.  The characters were fascinating and the special effects were truly pretty good--and that's saying something, since I'm usually bored out of my mind by that kind of thing.Some of the acting was absolutely wonderful.  Rebecca Romijn Stamos, Ian McKellen, Alan Cummings, Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, and Anna Paquin more than made up for the mediocre attempts of Halle Berry and Famke Janssen.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
X2,"X2 takes what the first film did and improves upon it. The story is very interesting and it's cool to see the heroes and the villain from the last film working together. This film is also darker then that first which I liked. There is more action, with the Wolverine in the school scene being a standout. The cast is really good again and there are some great new additions. Night crawler was probably my most favourite new addition. The villain was quite good as well.

Big mutated head and shoulders above the original,"I was mildly impressed with the first X-Men, simply because it was a comic movie that didn't completely suck, but its sequel is far better than that. It's impressive because its good. It captures that combination of high end action and meaningful plotline that most action films miss but ones like The Matrix and the original Star Wars capture. X-Men maybe isn't in that league yet, but it's getting there, and the third instalment is already at the top of my hotly-anticipated list.The big strides X-Men 2 makes are in storyline and characters, with both becoming more complex the second time around, thus injecting a bit of meaning into all the explosions and stuff. Famke Janssen as Jean Grey, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique, and whoever the guy is who played Nightcrawler as Nightcrawler are the breakout performances this time around, each being a dominating presence on screen, while Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Anna Paquin and Patrick Stewart are again solid performers. A sweet feature of the sequel are all the little mutant kiddies at the Xavier's mansion, who get to show off their powers, which goes beyond being mere eye-candy to being an enriching touch -- you get a real feeling for the extraordinary nature of the school. In addition to all this heartwarming emotional stuff, of course, are the special effects.

A Fair Movie with a Good Ending,"4 May 2003. Mix together a good ending, with numerous weak plotpoints and warmed over cliches for most of the movie, add an attempt with a more serious human relationship element and you have X-2. In one of the most outlandish superhero plot outlines with unbelieveable attacks on the White House, a super-secret prep school, and the easy capture of our superhero gang, X-2 falls victim to plot devices ask to much of the intelligent audience to make us believe this movie. While the movie going audience can suspend their disbelief some of the time, X-2 gives us an attack on the United States President as its beginning opening scene, but come on really must we have to accept how defenseless the President is, how superheros are so easily left defenseless? This sequel really isn't that original for most of its running time. The scriptwriter just really wants play with the audience's mind and screw up the frustration factor until it wants to burst without consider some of the logical elements of the movie.What really saves this movie is the ending...in one of the more powerful statements of societal responsibility, the climax of X-2 has many of the trappings of other movies, including Indiana Jones and Die Hard, but with a soul. The weaker attempts in X-2 at including the obligatory human dimension are laudable too.So besides yawning and squirming in the seat from pent-up frustration at how should have happened throughout most of the movie, X-2 barely makes it tolerable by the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
X2 review,"I was lucky enough to manage to get a ticket for a screening of X2 at London's Odeon Leicester Square at 10:00 am this morning.  I enjoyed the first film immensely but agreed that there were some flaws in it.  This film however totally blew me away.I was wondering how they would top the opening of the last film with its clever and dramatic retelling of the Magneto origin but I am pleased to say that they managed to provide a stunning and heart stopping sequence to open the film that will have fans and non fans gasping in delight.The film is superior in almost every aspect to the first.  All of the characters get extended screen time and seem more settled in their roles. Halle Berry has thankfully dropped the dodgy accent and left us with just a slight twang that works far better than her attempt in the first film.  We see a much more complex side to Storm than before and it works well. Hugh Jackman continues to develop what must be a very challenging role and manages to pull it off with a charm and flair that IS Wolverine.  He, as ever, gets pretty much the most screen time and we get to delve a little deeper into his past.  Alan Cumming's nightcrawker was something I had reservations of before I saw the film, but I can honestly say that he is fantastic.  Every scene he is in he steals and I nearly died of excitement the first time I heard a 'BAMF'.Famke Janssen is excellent in the film, her character Jean Grey is used very well indeed and fans will be pleased to see how Jean develops in this movie.The effects are superlative.  No dodgy glowing white balls of energy this time.  All powers are rendered superbly and are used very well indeed. The set pieces are mind-blowing and received rounds of applause in the cinema, something I am not used to seeing over here in Britain.  I can't wait to see this film again and it is a definite must for my DVD collection.  Now I only have to wait for the third instalment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Yep, it's as good as they say it is...","My older brother and his friend decided to go and see X-2 on Thursday night, since I had nothing better to do I decided to tag along (but believe me, I didn't go for the company). I think I was going to see this film at the weekend anyway as my friends were talking about it but I wasn't really excited about seeing it. I have seen the first X-Men and I thought it was fine and maybe a little overrated, my Dad, when he was little, was a big fan of the X-Men and he has a big dusty cardboard box filled with their old, mildewed comics. So one boring summer when I was up in the attic I had a little flick through them. I didn't know a lot about the X-Men but I discovered that I knew more than others. This is my first time reviewing a really big film still in the cinema, so don't mind me if I sound a little bit nervous at times, what with all your big, top quality reviews floating about.Anyways I'll start with the acting. They cast for this film is incredible and they really make this film just that bit more excellent. Some of the actors that really stand out are Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Famke Janssen (Dr. Jean Grey), Patrick Stewart (Professor X) and Sir Ian McKellen (Magneto). Thank god Hugh Jackman was chosen to play Wolverine. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing the feral gentleman, Jackman was excellent in the role, switching between berserker rage and gentle and dry. His relationship with Jean Grey is also quite intense, Jean Grey's character is wonderfully acted by Janssen, and this lady seems good at playing deeply troubled yet sophisticatedly sexy roles. Then McKellen and Stewart give an electric performance, the terse conversations, the familiar yet totally obscure relationship between them and their unsurpassed wisdom is excellently pulled off, together they're a wonderful combination. The rest of the acting is really good, I won't name all the actors but Alan Cumming (Nightcrawler), Halle Berry (Storm), Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (Mystique) and Aaron Stanford (Pyro) execute their roles perfectly, bringing the film to life to an even greater extent. I was also glad to see Romijn-Stamos' role exploited more, she plays Mystique brilliantly and her character seems much more human with much more character than before. Kelly Hu gave a great performance (if you can call it that) as the silent but deadly Deathstrike. I also liked the inclusion of some of the other, younger X-Men, Collosus, Siryn, Jubilee and Kitty Pryde (however I hope, if there is a sequel, they will have much MUCH more screen time).The film was basically story integrated with a lot of action. The action sent my already quivering spine shaking all over again. The opening sequence with an assassination attempt on the President's life played out with some excellent classical music was amazing. Other parts of the film such as the storming of the mansion, Mystique's invasion and Wolverine's cat (tiger) fight were all also astonishing action sequences. The dialogue in the film was quite good as well but it doesn't really stand out in a film with amazing special effects such as this. The special effects were delectable; they made the film seem much more realistic than it could've been. I especially liked Bobby Drake/Iceman's (Shawn Ashmore) mutant abilities as well as some others. Again I have to applaud Mystique as one of the most enjoyable characters in the film; her shape-shifting skills are brilliant to watch.The story wasn't as intelligent as the first X-Men's but I still enjoyed it, there weren't many heart-stopping twists in the storyline until near the end (of course I'm not going to tell you), a real tendon-tweaking moment. A lot of the characters aren't fully explored either. I think the director should've tried to incorporate the use of flashbacks more often. I thought for a moment we might've delved deeper in Lady Deathstrike's past (when she starts to get all fidgety when she is with William Stryker and Professor X) or Pyro's past (when he sees all the happy family' photographs on the wall in Bobby Drake's house), but we didn't. These characters were likeable characters but just weren't explored enough for me. Also I think Lady Deathstrike had a past with Wolverine right? This wasn't even touched on in the film, either. The theme of the story was colourfully highlighted. I think basically they were trying to display the intolerance of the human race, how we are always looking for a scapegoat and how people shouldn't be afraid to be themselves:- `Then why not stay in disguise all the time? You know, look like everyone else.' - `Because we shouldn't have to.'Besides the lack of character development I found the pace was a bit off at times (this is very minor) and also that some things could've been explained a littler clearer but overall it was a brilliant film. Once I sat down in the cinema time just slipped through my hands like sand, I didn't even notice it go past. It was a truly brilliant film and I'd recommend it to anyone. It's an improvement upon the last film and I hope another sequel is made. I think the director (Bryan Singer) and the cast all deserve a round of applause. Watch this film; really, you won't forget it!Grade: A- Milla.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Great sequel, Great story","Like the first movie, the point of view seems to focus on Logan. I love that the story revolves around my favorite X-Men Character. I must admit that the first time I saw this film I wasn't very impressed. I did enjoy the special effects, but had hoped to see the Sentinels in this film. After watching the film a second time I rather enjoyed the flow of the story. This movie finds Wolverine starting to become more and more a part of the team. It does do a little background into the Weapon X program, but it really stands out by humanizing the characters that we all know as ""super-heroes."" I was also happy to see some of the characters get to shine by using their powers a little more than the first movie. I was very happy with this film.

"Of X2 and Reloaded, Matrix is clearly the better comic book film","So many rave reviews that I just have to add my bit, cause frankly : I *didn't* like it.Okay, so Matrix was not adapted from a comic book. Still, it is clearly a comic-book film : exact same style, approach, feel and substance. It *could have been a comic*, and a good one at that! Another thing : I never was a fan of the original X-Men comic. Then again, ol' Supes or Batman never gave me shivers either, and still I loved the first Superman and Batman movies, so that don't mean a thing.So : what's so wrong with this movie? Well, basically, I think it's just... DUMB. Yeah, that's the word : dumb! The scenario, and everybody in it is just so dumb it makes you cry. Hell, with prof. X's supapowers and Cerebro, I'd have fixed the Magneto problem in no time! Being Magneto and having co-designed the thing, I would have killed all those pesky norms in a sec too (which it is clearly able to do according to the film)! And then the army guy... with an asset like Mastermind, couldn't he really think of a more, well, intelligent way of fighting the mutants? Well of course, he *is* an army dude so maybe that's asking too much. And then the regular guys, like in the scene where Pyro blows up a load of cop cars, ""You heard about those big bad mutants guys?""-style : being one of the soldiers, I would go like, ""**BANG** - Yeah, I heard. I also heard most of you guys aren't BULLET PROOF!!!"".That's one more thing : haven't they invented the gun yet in the X-Men universe? Most of the mutants are not power-protected in  any way from bullets (except when Magneto's around of course), still none of them ever seems to think of wearing some Kevlar, let alone a *gun*. So, okay, I know it might have been a problem in the comic because of CCA regulations, but still, couldn't they have changed that for the movie just to make it less dumb? It would change the whole dynamic of the thing.So, are there qualities redeeming the lack of basic intelligence throughout the movie? Not many... most of Wolverine's dry humor is gone, and Wolverine as a character seems less interesting than in the first X (though this does not seem to be a problem with the acting - see below). The fight scenes are just boring, sometimes even offensively so (Deathstryke could have killed Wolverine a thousand times in that fight, and still she lost it in the lamest manner imaginable - what a bummer). The other action scenes don't get a lot better (that plane chase for instance - there were a thousand ways they could have made that one tons more exciting than by just using YASP, Yet Another SuperPower).The acting is very good for some, awful for others. Ian McKellen shines, as always : I bet he could even make a Coca Cola ad look exciting.  Patrick Stewart also does a very good job at it - he really CAN do something more than Trek, and I really look forward to seeing him in better fares than this. And Hugh Jackman is still a good Wolverine, though he didn't get half the chances to show it that he got in the first movie. Even Romijn-Stamos did a pretty good job, a lot better than in the previous film. The rest of the acting though ranged from the simply lame to the excruciatingly bad. Nightcrawler made me crawl up the walls, but not in the funny way it was clearly intended.And finally, there is  the whole soap-factor : who isn't having an affair with whom in this movie? I remember this being one of the things that hit my crap-o-meter in the comics too - but just because it's crap that's in the comic, that don't mean you have to keep that crap for the movie!All in all, I feel like this movie could have been a lot better, which is a pity. I had a negative feeling about the first X movie as well, but the more I thought about it and the more I saw it, the better it became. In the end, it finished about side-by-side with the original Matrix movie. X2 started out as just boring in my book, however : it only got worse each time I thought back about it, and the second sitting of it was just torture.This movie will be a must for lovers of the X-Men comic as it quite faithfully reproduces its feel, all of the crap in the original books included. For those who do not fall into that category however, go see Reloaded, or if you have already, go see it a second time : you will be the better for it.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Most ""X""-Cellent!!","X2: X-MEN UNITED (2003) ***1/2 Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Brian Cox, Alan Cumming, Bruce Davison, Anna Paquin, Kelly Hu, Aaron Stanford, Shawn Ashmore, Cotter Smith. Superlative sequel and a boost of hyperactive energy in the franchise's arm in the second chapter of the Marvel Comics' cult classic this time with good mutants teaming with bad to stop a bent human military advisor (hissable Cox) out to wipe out both types at any cost. Far-out special effects, new characters (particularly winning is Cumming as the blue-skinned Night Crawler) and non-stop action packaged with kinetic infectious giddiness. Jackman continues to amaze as the tormented Wolverine, Berry is given more to do as the tempestuous Storm, Janssen's Jane Grey is perhaps the most nuanced in her suddenly advance telekinetic skills and McKellen is wellmagnetic as Magneto. Fun tongue-in-cheek screenplay by Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris (w/ David Hayter, Zak Penn and director Bryan Singer getting story credits) keeps up with the multi-layered storyline encompassing class welfare, social strata and in general to accept one for who they are and not what they are. Well done!",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
X2,"I think this is better than the first film though I still find Patrick Stewart's ""Picard""-in-a-chair character really irritating. Anyway, this time we have a good baddie in Scotsman Brian Cox (""Stryker""). He is a determined military man who manages to get the US President to give him carte blanche to take on and eliminate the mutants after a failed attempt to assassinate him in the White House. ""Magneto"" (Sir Ian McKellen), meantime, is still locked up in his plastic prison but his shape-shifting blue protegé ""Mystique"" (Rebecca Romijn) concocts a cunning pan to free him; and just in time too! ""Stryker"" has discovered the existence of ""Cerebro"" and determined to control it, attacks the ""Xavier"" school neutralising many of the students and leaving only ""Logan"" (Hugh Jackman),"" Scott"" (James Marsden) and ""Rogue"" (Anna Paquin) to lead what's left of their team to extricate the now captured professor. Needs must, as they say, and an unlikely alliance forms with ""Magneto"", but will it hold and as we build to quite an exciting denouement, we realise that there is still plenty of scheming and plotting going on. Cox is not really a very versatile actor, but here he provides a solid fulcrum for a story that has plenty of action. There is much less emphasis on the moralising, hormonal, frat-style storyline of the 2000 version; the characters are older and better developed and can control, therefore use, their powers to more dramatic effect for those watching. The story is still a bit thinly predictable, but the visual effects team pull out all the stops keeping this 2¼ marathon moving along surprisingly effortlessly. I'm now very much in team ""Magneto"" - bring on X3!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The best comic book movie I've seen,"X-2 is alongside the first batman movie in a class of its own compared to all the others comic book movies out there. It has smart script that doesn't make you groan because of the stupidity of the screenwriters half the time as most of the other superhero movies do. It's really entertaining, lots of humor, magnificent fighting scenes(the opening sequence will forever remain a classic in that department IMO - astonishing combination of creative special effects, fight choreography and totally fitting great classical music), actors who  are really good and concentrated on their job(especially Ian McKellen, who is once again awesome as Magnetto) and even some actual message behind all the fights and superpowers, that really works. It also has what is always most important for a good movie and that's a smart director who knows his job. Bryan Singer is showing his talent here, getting good performances from all of his actors despite the CGI scenes being aplenty(but they are  really well done, much better than Spiderman 2 for example) and also creating a visual feast and an unique feel to the movie. And I've never even read the comics before, but I really felt close to the characters and easily got engaged in the X-Men universe.Lastly, but definitely not least important, is the fact that this movie has one of the greatest looking female cast ever assembled in a mainstream movie. Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, and the ultra-gorgeous Rebecca Romijn Stamos(who even has a short, but memorable appearance without the blue paint that goes with her Mystique part) - it doesn't get better than that. And all those lovely ladies can act pretty well too. Not that their parts were difficult, of course, but in comparison with the pathetic failures we so often see by the pretty actresses in the blockbuster movies it's really refreshing to watch a bunch of pretty women who can act decently enough.I highly recommend this movie to pretty much everyone. It's even better than the excellent first part.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
May Have Been Left Behind By Time,"This one didn't age nearly as gracefully as I'd hoped. I remember adoring it in the theater and later at home on DVD, but by today's standards it's hokey and hard to take seriously. I'm not sure if that's a symptom of the better comic book movies being released as a direct result of this franchise or a simple case of the old rose-colored goggles, but either way it wasn't nearly the tour de force I had remembered. That being said, the sheer amount of acting star power in this film is still astonishing from top to bottom, and it remains a quality action flick. Xavier's first sequel remains a fine moment; it's just been surpassed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
X2 is a stronger movie than the first.,"They say this is the summer of sequels.  The more cynical feel this is going to be the summer of recycled ideas.  Some say Hollywood producers are chanting, ""If it isn't broken, why fix it.""  Whatever your viewpoint is, it is possible for sequels to be entertaining and well written.  Such is the case for X-men 2: X-men United.We are able to see our favorite characters from the last film.  We have Storm (Halley Barre), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Professor X/Xavier (Patrick Stewart), Magneto (Ian McKellen), and so on.  There are a couple of new ones, Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) and Yuriko Oyama (Kelly Hu).There are also some cameo's of other favorite mutants from the comics series, including Collosus and Shadow Cat and Henry McCoy (Beast).  The returning cast seemed really comfortable in their roles.  There was a chemistry between them, you felt they had a history together, they knew each other for years.  These characters are mutants, the next step in human evolution.  They have a special power, i.e. telekenisis, teleportation, telepathy, accelerated healing, shape-shifting; I'm sure you get the idea.The cynics might be disappointed to know there is an actual plot.  This is a story that continues to deal with a struggle between mutant and human, mostly with one man's hatred for them and his unquenchable desire to destroy any and all mutants.  His name is Stryker, played by Brian Cox, who is a military scientist, apparently brilliant enough to develop a plastic prison that can hold the mutant Magneto, who is able to control magnetic fields (I know I would've never thought of that).  The movie also reveals part of Wolverine's forgotten past.  We see unlikely allies, old enemies, new alliances - all of which are neatly tied together throughout the movie. The story keeps moving.  There are a number of subtle references to things that might happen if there is a next movie.  I will admit - I was a little surprised by the ending.The special effects are well done.  They were pretty flawless.  For example, the effects for Nightcrawler, a mutant who can teleport -without the help of Patrick Stewart's Enterprise- were stunning and, for lack of a better description, believable.  In line with the effects, the fights were well choreographed.  The big fight for this movie is between Wolverine and Yuriko - both are mutants who have some how had their skeletons infused with a rare, indestructible metal, adamantium.  And if you ever wanted a reason why you shouldn't get in a fight with a woman with nails, this is the best reason yet.Again, to the disappointment of the skeptics, there is character development.  We particularly see this in three young mutant, Bobby ""Iceman"" Drake (Shawn Ashmore), Rogue (Anna Paquin), and John ""Pyro"" Allerdyce (Aaron Stanford).  These are three teen-aged mutants attending Professor X's school for the gifted, a school dedicated to educating mutants in not just their abilities, but in the three R's as well.  We see them each dealing with their mutant ""condition,"" and how it affects them personally.  This brings substance to the film, bringing a more day-to-day dealing with their mutant powers and how it affects them and the ones they love, and to whom they ally themselves.This movie does not religiously follow the comics books.  Some liberties have been taken.  Obviously the costumes aren't like the ones we see in the comic books.  No problem with that; Spandex is so 80's anyway.  Some of the history and origin of various mutants and non-mutants have been modified (i.g. Yuriko was not a mutant, but a cyborg, and she was known as Lady Deathsrike).  However, the overall concept of the story stays true enough to the comic book.  My only beef is Mystique's lack of clothing.  Granted, when she fights, the style is very serpentine, and she is seductive by nature. However, put some clothes on her!  She was able to morph into some sort of dress in the comic book, they could at least do that.  No, she's not really naked in the film, but the white dress with the skull belt in the comics added a certain flair to the character and some modesty.It is hard for a sequel to top it's predecessor.  It's even harder for a film based on a popular character(s)/story to meet the expectations of it's original fan base.  This movie succeeds at both.  The story has more meat. The characters have more flesh to them.  The writing was well done (I'm still scarred by Storm's last words to Toad in the first movie); good whit, timely humor.  This movie is able to stand alone, though there is more to appreciate if you've seen the first movie.  Brian Singer did a good job directing.  The story flowed.  I didn't find myself squirming in my seat, looking at the time.  This is not Oscar material, but it is entertaining. The movie came to a conclusion but still left room for a third (now the ""true"" film critics are about to throw up).  Over all, it's worth seeing on the big screen and worthy to open the summer movie season.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Really??????,"I saw this film in the summer and was really underwhelmed. I quite liked the first film, for style and tone if not the afterthought plot, so I was expecting good things from this film as the introductions had been done in the first film and we could crack on with a really good story.Maybe I need to see this film again but I don't see where on earth all these great reviews came from. I could see how people might think it was okay, or diverting and entertaining but no more. I left the cinema pretty cold. More characters were introduced, more background needed filling in and Bryan Singer seemed to not know how to handle it. Maybe it was the story/script at fault, maybe the editing went astray but I thought this was a lesson in how not to handle an ensemble film that an X-Men film is always going to be. He lost control of all the stories, especially near the end, it seemed like we were jumping between plotlines in a quite unplanned way.As in the first film I didn't rate the main storyline much either. I hope that when X-Men 3 (or X3, or XXX or whatever it's going to be called) comes that the less is more approach is taken and we get a more structured narrative round the interesting characters, new characters are limited, and we get a good central storyline that is is more than a subplot for the ongoing humans versus mutants story. I think this franchise has potential from what we've seen but has been let down so far by weak story and weak characters.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"less cerebral, more conventional than the original","`X2: X-Men United' is the widely admired sequel to `X-Men,' one of the finest movies ever to be derived from a comic book series.  The original film, in addition to being a superb piece of action cinema, dealt with such weighty issues as prejudice and alienation, showing how groups of people who are seen as `different' from the norm are often ostracized from and mistreated by society as a whole.  By creating an entirely new set of people to serve as its outcasts - in this case, mutants endowed with extraordinary physical and mental powers - the film was able to strip the issue of bigotry down to its barest essentials and to make us see anew just how great a part `irrational fear of the unknown' plays in determining the ways we treat others.  Quite an accomplishment for a film that was designed, essentially, to be little more than a commercial popcorn entertainment.This second entry in the series, though it has generally received more positive reviews than the first one, seems less concerned with message and theme and more concerned with action and plotting.  Part of the reason for this may lie in the fact that the initial film, because it was introducing both the characters and the concepts to the audience, was forced by necessity to deal with the theme in a more direct and comprehensive manner. Perhaps when it came to `X2,' director Bryan Singer and writers Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter simply felt that the theme had been explored sufficiently in the first installment and that any further concentration on it would appear redundant.  The problem is that, without that added intellectual and sociological dimension, `X2' starts to feel an awful lot like every other comic book action film - heavy on adventure and special effects and weak on character development and point.  In fact, even with the added bonus of almost 30 extra minutes in this episode (it runs an overlong 134 minutes), many of the characters in the film do little but stand around and look helpless while a select few run around saving the day and getting all the valuable screen time.There's a wonderful scene about halfway through the film in which a teenage mutant boy `comes out' to his genuinely astonished parents, informing them that their `ordinary, average' child (whom they had just considered `highly gifted') has been harboring a deep dark secret within himself, a revelation that no parent would ever want to hear and no child would ever want to have to make.  The reaction of both stunned disbelief and reluctant acceptance (`We still love you no matter what you are') on the part of the boy's family speaks to anyone who has had to face a similar situation in his own life. `X2' could use more scenes like this one to help the audience connect better with both the characters and the events taking place on screen.   And it was scenes like this one that made the original `X-Men' soar as a movie, for that film really seemed to be able to zero in on universal aspects of human nature.  `X2' doesn't do nearly as impressive a job in this regard.Every so often, `X2' feels as if it too is getting ready to expound on one of its potentially intriguing themes - as when the President of the United States has to decide whether to take draconian action against what he believes may be a `terrorist' organization among the mutants - only to have the concern fizzle in a welter of action movie clichés.  After all, what could be more pertinent, timely or relevant to today's world than the threat of terrorism and the potential for civil rights abuses arising from the fear it causes?   Instead of making this premise the crux of their movie as they should have, the filmmakers drag all the characters over to some secret underground complex next to a snowbound lake to do battle with a pretty conventional villain and have them indulge in all the explosions, gun battles, kickboxing fight sequences etc. that are the standard accoutrements of any self-respecting modern day action film.People seem to be enamored of `X2,' even more, perhaps, than they were of the original `X-Men.'  I wish I could count myself among them.  But as one who genuinely loved the original, I must say that I am less than enamored with this particular installment.  I may be a minority dissenting voice in this regard, but I view `X2,' for all its special effects wizardry, as a disappointing missed opportunity, a film that fails to develop on a deeper level the great themes that were laid out for it in the original.  I have my fingers crossed for `X-Men 3.'",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Has the most depth of the trilogy,"I think the X-Men films have been so popular because the X-Men dare to be different. The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.The unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant ""X"" gene. Two mutant leaders, who are also old friends, take highly contrasting positions. Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. His attitude is positive and his goal benign. Eric Lensherr or Magneto, on the other hand, is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants. He starts a ""Brotherhood of Mutants"" with a clear attitude of superiority. And, as they say, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.You could say that Xavier takes the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. while Magneto goes the route of Malcolm X, an interesting comparison.Although everybody has their favorite, I feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality - ""X-Men"" (2000), ""X2: X-Men United"" (2003) and ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (2006).""X2"" is generally considered the best of the three and goes deeper into the conflict of Xavier's school, Magneto's Brotherhood and the US Government's increasing involvement, as laid out in ""X-Men."" More mutants are introduced. On Xavier's side: Nightcrawler, Colossus and Shadowcat. On the villain side: Lady Deathstrike and Government agent William Stryker.""X2"" has the most depth and features numerous interesting character-defining moments along with great action scenes, like the one between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike near the end. There's also a particularly notable clash when Wolverine and others are forced to confront Federal agents as they storm Xavier's school. In other words, the US Government becomes the proverbial ""bad guys."" Take note how Wolverine shows no mercy.Unfortunately, the film overstays its welcome and goes on and on well after Wolverine's fight with Deathstrike, but I'm not complaining. I like the emphasis on character and the way the film eschews moronic ""blockbuster"" conventions.GRADE: A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Good follow up,"The group is back. Magneto is still imprisoned. This time a mutant called Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) tries to kill the president. In response, the government under the help of William Stryker (Brian Cox) institute more draconian measures to control the mutant population including attacking Professor X's school.Alan Cumming is doing a fun character. The plot gets complicated with double dealing and cross currents but still easily followed. It's a good sophomore follow up in the franchise.It's almost a prerequisite to have all hell break loose after the happy ending to the first movie. So the first half of the movie is to bring everything down. Once the whole lot is destroy, then they can come back to save the day. This time the bad guy is Stryker and even Magneto is there to join the fight. It's a perfectly fine follow-up.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"""Wolverine: Origin: The First: Can't Go Home Again""","Good watch, might watch again, and can recommend.Again, horrible ""comic book movie"", good stand alone movie.Wolverine was the most interesting thing about the last movie, and this is a surprising instance of a studio realizing audience feedback and basically just made the first Wolverine origin movie, because that's what this is.Comic continuity aside, and Wolverine aside, the war of the Brotherhood of Mutants is fairly compelling angle to take, and it is refreshing they did it from the human's side, but if you look at it closer, then we're just looking at another race war. It sort of takes the fuel out of the fire when you realize how ""real"" your super power problem story is.While this has a slightly better premise, and good plot skeleton, there is a lot of ""(mostly Wolverine does) something cool here"" stuff, but there are at least 2 large exceptions with multiple mutants working together that end up being a ""lot of cool stuff"", but also add some significance to the story and heavily progress the plot.I'd honestly recommend anyone watch this over the original.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Overstuffed and not as resonant as the original,"I think I am in the minority here but I greatly prefer the first film. It is more streamlined and focused in its story. This one tries to do too much-especially setting up the Phoenix Saga-and the film would have been better served cutting some stuff out. It is not only that the final film is unwieldly but the film loses much of upon inspection. Xavier's walk to Cerebro 2.0 seems to take like 19 hours but that makes little sense. A whole bunch of choices don't gel together and can add up to unintentional comedy, i.e. Logan carrying the kid while confronting Stryker. The film's analogy-or allegory-around mutant equals LGBT identity is a lot less graceful than the more generalized marginalized people in the 1st film. The ""coming out"" scene is tacky and has dated badly.With that said the film has several bright spots. The opening scene is one of the best action scenes of the aughts . Indeed, Nightcrawler's inclusion was more than welcomed and his story still resonates in spite of the larger issues. The following films in the series-generally-never returned to this level of engagement but this film has a lot of the problems the later film have as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Are you kidding me?,"I have a couple questions about X2:1. If you throw enough money at the screen, is that a movie? and, 2. If you put enough characters on the screen, do you have a franchise?Plenty of people liked X2, so I guess #1 is true, and I'm certain the studio is banking on the second holding true as well.  Though I liked X2 better than the first X-Men, I was more overwhelmed by the lack of character development and story progression than the effects.  It's unfortunate, because the X-Men backstory offers a unique take on the superhero milieu, but how can you develop characters that will keep the viewers coming back when you're contractually obligated to give over a dozen people screen time? I have a feeling the answer will be to throw more money at the screen, and I think that will get old after a while (see: The Matrix).",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Certainly a Step Up From the First One,"X2 (2003)*** (out of 4)After a mutant attempts to assassinate the President, the X-Men must unite to try to defend themselves against a military attack. There's really no point going into great detail about the plot because does it really matter in the end? There's certainly an entertaining story being told here but at the same time there's no question that it's best to just turn your brain off as the movie starts and sit back and just have a blast. There's no question that this sequel is a major step up on the previous movie for a number of reasons. For one, this one here doesn't need a lot of character introduction and instead we're just given one great action scene after another. Whereas the first movie had some good stuff, all of the action scenes are made ten times bigger and ten times better. This includes a wonderful sequence where the mutant school comes under attack from the military. This is preceded by an excellent opening where one of the mutants sneaks into the White House and takes out a number of men trying to reach the President. I'm certainly not going to give away the ending but it too is pretty exciting and full of wonderful effects. Oh yeah, just check out the sequence with the police to see another perfectly directed scene by Bryan Singer. There's no question that the director is much better here as all of the scenes contain some real power and manage to be quite original as well. The actors are all at the top of their game as there's no doubt that the casting was perfect for these roles. This includes Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Halle Berry as Storm and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique. X2 is certainly an above average summer blockbuster that's only real flaw is that it runs on a tad bit too long.

Better than the first and Rouge is HOT!,"Tonight I saw Xmen2. It was fantastic. The story was a little shady compared to the comics and the cartoon but it was still a sight to see. Jean Grey is hot and lets not forget how hot Rouge has gotten. I think she lost a few pounds because she seemed lighter in this one. A few things that are way better this time around would definately be cyclops glasses, storms hair, and how cool it sounds when Wolverine says ""BUB"". Lets go one at a time.Cyclops and his visor- First movie it was huge. I think what happened was, Bryan Singer watched the cartoon and thought it would be cool to emulate that. Bad idea Bryan. And at least he recognized it. The visor this time around was immensly smaller than the first. Big difference and much better look. Cyclops actually looked like a badass this time.Storm and her crazy hair- Halle Berry would not be my first choice for Storm but she tried hard this time and lost that pathetic accent, or at least didn't show it. Her hair was under control this time meaning she looked as hot as she normally does. Too bad she's married, and at least Billy gave her a good rogering. Go Billy Bob!! There is another stupid line she gives but I wont give it away so you can experience the dorkyness as I had to. It's much better than what she said in the first movie...:""Do you know what happens to Toads when they get struck by lightening? Same as everything else!""cue shock sounds and lightning...God what a stupid line. It's one of those that sounds good on paper but when Halle says it, it sounds dumb. Kinda like the ENTIRE move Monsters Ball but that's another story.Wolverine saying Bub- This time Wolverine says Bub a few times, and it's totally cool. The first movie they threw it in so the comic geeks like myself would be pleased...and I was...but anyway, they had a few more ""bubs"" this time and they were perfect timing, funny yet: Oh he just stabbed me and that really hurt...yea kinda like that...By the way Jean is not old and unappealing...she is gorgeous...For the record...I apologize for the portrayal of Scott Summers. Jason Marsden is not fitting. He's too short and he's not a leader at all. Both movies are lead by Jean and Storm. How about some Cyclops taking some charge here? Seriously, If Jason reads this, I'm sorry but I don't like you as Cyclops, your not able to fit the role. But his performance this time around was better that the first. And I wouldn't get rid of him for the third installment for the sake of sequels.I HATE IT WHEN THEY REPLACE AN ACTOR WITH SOMEONE ELSE FOR SEQUELS. EVEN IF IT'S GOING TO BE BAD HAVE SOME DECENCY FOR LEGACY!!Batman...need I say more?OK Quick batman rant...Michael was the best at bothVal was a good Batman and a pretty good BruceGeorge ruined it.

The evolution of the event movie has begun...,"Finally I've seen it. And now I want to see it again. I wouldn't judge it against past efforts just yet, but, and only time will tell properly, this is probably the best comic book adaptation to date.Bryan Singer has done a fantastic job, giving the characters space to feel but also remembers to let them kick some ass, and what a way to kick off proceedings with Nightcrawler bamfing through the Whitehouse. What makes that scene so fine isn't just the action packed thrill of it. Well that helps but the scene is also integral to the plot, making it more than just eye candy. It's a great way to introduce a new character, and means that when we find out about his tragic past, our attention has already been won.The rest of the film runs in a similar vein, building upon what we already know and adding to the characters personas. Inevitably with such a large cast some don't come of as well, mainly Storm and Cyclops. This is a minor gripe though as the characterisation elsewhere is spot on.Iceman and Rogue's almost tragic relationship, with Iceman unable to kiss her is well played by both Shawn Ashmore and Anna Paquin. Iceman's coming out to his parents demonstrates more ability on Ashmore's part and he seems to be a young actor with some emotional range. The exchange with his mother where he is asked 'Have you ever tried not being a mutant' captured the adolscent-esque awkwardness of his situation.Aaron Stanford conveys the burgeoning hatred of humans, that his Jon Allerdyce/Pyro feels. The glee with which he attacks police officers sent to arrest the mutants is well played. As the viewer we know there is something distinctly dark about this boy. His exchange with Magneto where he is asked 'what's your real name?' by the magnetic master is the moment he knows being human is no longer an issue.Then of course there is Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. Jackman has real presence, and dominates whenever he's on screen even when faced with the similarly adamantium pumped Yuriko Oyama, or trading words with Brian Cox's sinister Stryker. He certainly had the acting chops to carry the first film and is excellent whenever given the opportunity here. His improvised answer of 'Art' when asked what subject he teaches brought a cackle and his ability to deliver such one liners is often in evidence. He can do the emotional stuff too though, with scenes involving him chasing after the unattainable love and looking almost apologetic after he dispatches Oyama after their climactic fight. That actually made the fight better for me, as after all the hype it never quite had the required impact on me, but Jackman's understanding of Wolverine's reaction to killing one like himself shows.Both Ian Mckellen and Patrick Stewart as the mutant elders give solid performances. Famke Janssen is good value as Jean Grey and Rebecca Romjin Stamos cuts loose a number of times as Mystique, ironically turning up as 'herself' to entrap a prison guard in a bar.Overall I really did like the movie. It develops well, splitting the characters and re-uniting them in a steady flow for the finale. The plot resonates with the zeitgeist of the world with parallels being drawn to many recent events. Ignoring these it's still a kick ass bit of entertainment, so if you want to be bothered with the themes of acceptance and hatred of those that are different or just want to see an F-16 get knocked out by a tornado there is something there for all.Mutation has allowed X2 to leap to the top of the pile of this year's blockbusters and allowed it to plant a very firm foot there.

"Great movie, but not enough action","Following the failed assassination of the president of the United States of America, the X-Men hunt down the attempted killer, and end up uncovering a plot beyond what they could have ever comprehended.All sequels have to be better than the previous movie otherwise people would be disappointed with them, and X-Men United didn't disappoint. In my opinion the movie was good, but it could have been better. The action scenes are mostly about 2/3 into the movie, there are a few in the beginning and middle of the movie but that is about it. There really was not too much excitement in between the action scenes, mostly the movie used those spots to explain a conspiracy or set up for a big battle. If i could have changed anything in the movie it would have been more action in general. There was just a couple times that it started to lose my attention, but other than that it was a great movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Have you tried not being a mutant?,"Brian Cox plays mutant-phobe William Stryker who plans on eliminating all of the world's genetic aberrations with the unwilling help of Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his amazing Cerebro machine. In order to defeat Stryker, the X-Men must team up with the villainous Magneto (Ian McKellen)—but can they really trust him? (answer: of course not!).I've got to hand it to director Bryan Singer: even though X-Men 2 was apparently intended as an allegory for the gay community's struggle for acceptance, there's nothing limp-wristed about its execution, the film more than delivering in the thrills department. Upping the ante in terms of jaw-dropping action set-pieces, but not at the expense of an intelligent, well-written script, this super sequel manages to be both bigger and better than the first, a hugely entertaining box-office belter from start to finish.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for the sexy trio of Halle Berry, Famke Janssen and Rebecca Romijn.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Totally watchable, but nothing special...","This movie has a couple of plot-holes, but the biggest of which is that Mercury (the element), is completely non-magnetic AND mercury can be detected by a metal detector. If the movie avoided those 2 plot-holes and took them into consideration instead, then this film would have been quite different. The fact that they allowed these two plot-holes is a sign that they either didn't care about being scientifically correct, or that they simply were too lazy to avoid plot-holes like this and just took the easy way out when they were writing the plot of the movie.Anyway, besides those issues, the film is OK. It could easily have been an 8/10 film if they took these plot-holes into consideration or if they actually cared about the canon of the X-Men franchise, but instead it results in an OK 7/10 rating.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One x-men fan who doesn't love either of the films,"I can appreciate comic books as much as the next guy (although I'm not a reader), and the X-Men, I have to admit, are probably the best team out there, if not the best superheroes, period. That said, the movie versions do not live up to mutant standards. Its okay, we can be honest, no one will hurt us here.I think the only thing making these flicks so popular is the fact that comic book fans get to actually see live action interpretations of what they had only previously been able to catch in 2-D rendering--and not the quality of the films themselves. Why the special treatment?I think all comic-to-screen attempts are hindered in one way--the filmmakers concentrate too much on the visuals and lose sight of the characters and the story. Those latter two qualities suffer as a result. There have been many movies that have done a good job of alleviating this obstracle (Superman and Spiderman, even Batman and Daredevil), but X-Men and X2 fail miserably. With as much criticism that the Star Wars prequels receive regarding their scripts and dialogue, you'd think more people would let the X-movies have it.Furthermore,  do they really do anything visually innovative? I like alot of what I saw in X2, but overall it was nothing on par with, say, The Matrix. I'm not asking for a Matrix ripoff by any means. What I am saying is that I would have liked to see the same level of quailty and commitment. Maybe it was just that the F/X were not effective because of the weak plot and character development; they were sort of wasted. Either way, they don't save the  film.Its not just me, the casual fan, that dislikes these films. I recently had an eye-opening discussion with my friend, the die-hard comic book geek. He confessed that he felt compelled to be a big X-Men movies fan because of its comic book roots. In actuality, however, he hated much of what they did to his beloved mutants, and was quite dissapointed in general.So let all of us X-Men fans stand up, and speak our true feelings--the movies are not that good! There--no longer should we hide in disgrace. We are free, free at last!",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Flawed but better than the usual no-brain summer blockbusters,"Following an assassination attempt on the President of the USA by a mutant, General William Stryker is ordered to take action against the mutants. Using information gleamed from Magneto, he attacks the X-mansion, taking some prisoners and scattering the rest.  Wolverine, just returned from the hunt for his past, escapes with Pryo, Iceman and Rogue and sets out to meet up with Storm and Jean.  As the full extent of Styker's plan becomes clear, the X-Men have no choice but to join forces with Magneto to defeat him.I have to be honest I say that every year I get sucked in by the hype machine that surrounds the summer blockbusters.  Most of the time I am let down (Jurrasic Park 3, Planet of the Apes  the list is long).  This summer looks different with this and the Matrix films to look forward to and X2 was the first one I came to.  I enjoyed the first film and immediately noticed that it's strength had been lost in this sequel.  Here the running time is over two hours and the central plot includes a lot more side issues than the first.  In one regard this is good because there is much to hold the interest.  However it also means that the film doesn't all work  most of it does but a lot of it feels abandoned or incomplete.  Wolverine no longer is the focus as he was in the first, and this is a loss.  His story is the most interesting to many people but he isn't allowed as much as he deserves. However he fares better than Rogue and Cyclops who barely have anything to do.The central plot is good and has enough twisting to keep you entertained  only the odd subplot appears to be on a hiding to nowhere.  The action scenes are good on the whole.  The opening assassination attempt is very exciting and the storming of the mansion is solid.  The climax of the film with Wolverine is a little disappointing thanks to MTV style editing making the fight unclear.  Although some people have complained about it being action light, I think that is missing the point.  The film is more about the plot and the characters than just the action.  So we do have lots of dramatic scenes without action but they still work as they are building a wider story.The film is a lot less funnier than the first and hence a little less enjoyable on a surface level.  Mostly this is due to the shift of focus off Wolverine and his lines.  There is still some humour but too much of it is ill-judged (in the middle of Iceman `coming out' to his family  an emotional point  his mother says `have you tried NOT being a mutant'  didn't work for me).  Happily the darker side of the film is stronger and makes this change of tone feel deliberate rather than a loss of humour. Singer directs well overall and uses his budget well  only the fight between Wolverine and Oyama was one part where I felt he had over stretched his reach a little.  He has nice touches as well  like including stuff for the harder core comic fans (eg Colossus at one point).  Also there are modern day parallels to be had in the script that are a little bit less than flag waving.The cast really help this film though.  Jackman may not be the central focus for this film but he is the centre of every scene he is in.  Stewart and McKellen both do very good work here and really contribute to the feeling that this is more than a dumb blockbuster.  Berry is OK but on at least one occasion her breasts seemed to be used to greater effect than her character. Janssen comes on a lot and her struggle with her changing powers is well portrayed.  Romijn-Stamos has a much bigger role and her character is used well.  Paquin and Marsden are AWOL even when onscreen but Cumming is a good addition.  Cox is the film's greatest addition and he doesn't allow Stryker to become a carton bad guy at any point. I really like Kelly Hu and was sad t see her have little to do.  In fairness she manages to make a good impression without more than a line in the whole film but her final fight is a little disappointing.Overall this is a superior summer blockbuster.  The way it tries to carry so many subplots and side characters causes it to become very weak and times and not all of it works very well but it is still good for what it is.  The change in tone from the first film will put some off but I enjoyed it and found the story to be well supported  however for X3 I hope that this ensemble feel is cut back a little and a smaller core of characters allowed to develop well rather than a lot of them developed a little.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A triumph for Singer and Co.,"The second in the x-men series has a lot to give, continuing right from where we left off at the end of the first film (which seemed to end pretty prematurely, so the new beginning makes up for that). With a similar feel in themes and shooting technique, but noticeably larger budget and more production time, X2 rocks! In the action/adventure sequel tradition the action scenes are bigger and better, with great Wolverine claw waving moments and even big sequences for the younger members of the x gang. This is perhaps what makes the film, the students of Xavier's school both old and new feature heavily, with good character development on screen and dialogue. The well scripted dialogue of the film fills in x-men1 gaps and leaves you thinking about further development and adventures.On the negative side, the film doesn't seem balanced enough, heavy on the Wolverine story lines, perhaps a more flashbacks for other characters like Magneto in X-men1 would have been a better use of sections of the film. Also, greater explanation not just implication of smaller characters and their motivations e.g. Pyro could be well placed despite resulting in a slowing of pace.Generally X2 is head and shoulders above the average comic book film adaptation, despite the rumoured set disputes and constraints Bryan Singer and the cast have again produced an excellent, and intelligent big box office hit!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Basic,"I remember the times when I was so into X-men and I basically followed everyone else's opinion on the movies. People said (because of the comic books) X2 is one of the best movies because it built the Phoenix Saga and all that, and X-Men: The Last Stand was horrible and so on. But I have to admit, I'd rather watch The Last Stand. Mostly because that movie simply looks better, and also because I want to watch a movie and not just judge it based on the comics I haven't even read.The dialogue in X2 is annoyingly clumsy, and the writing isn't too special in other ways neither. I get that superhero movies aren't usually very original, but the plot structure of X2 is so basic it's annoying.The most intriguing thing about this film is the metaphor of mutants and the moral dilemmas, but compared to the first X-men movie or The Last Stand there's really no way to choose a side in this film. Superhero movies are usually extremely black-and-white: you know who the good guys are, you know who the bad guys are. Magneto sometimes brings the moral grey areas into the mix, but because he isn't the main antagonist of X2, the movie doesn't offer that anymore. Everyone watching X2 knows Stryker is horrible, it's not even up to debate.X2 is an alright superhero action movie, but doesn't offer anything interesting to the viewer, but were you expecting anything other than the usual stuff superhero movies throw our ways?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
so nice,"In the plot, both the front and the back are good enough, and they break the traditional duality of righteousness and evil, and they also do a few turns well; in special effects, they also completely serve the story; the personalities and experiences of several characters also give Detailed explanation; in the comic adaptation film is really top quality.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Good incomprehensible nonsense,"The plot is incomprehensible, the special effects superb and the imagination unbridled, (though some may say it could do with some bridling). Bryan Singer's follow-up to the first ""X Men"" movie has the characters already established, (though newcomers may find it hard to figure out who's who), so he gets straight down to the plot. Thematically that could be written on the back of a postage stamp, so it's action all the way. The problem isn't so much that it doesn't make sense but rather that there is so little to make sense of. And we have the right to feel cheated that potentially serious themes like racism and ethnic cleansing are given such short shift, (am I reading too much into this nonsense?).However, for most of it's length it's highly entertaining in a baffling sort of way. It moves at a cracking pace which unfortunately means that characters are never long enough on screen to develop. This is particularly true of Wolverine who this time round is reduced to a cypher. On the other hand, Alan Cumming's fallen angel is a blast and Cumming is the best thing in the movie. The fact that Ian McKellen's Magneto disappears before the end is an obvious indication that ""X Men 3"" was already in the offing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Mindbogglingly bad,"How could such a piece of drivel get such a high voting score at IMDB?This typical example of Hollywood's present-day empty-headedness has absolutely nothing going for it. Even compared to other superhero offerings it is disappointing.If lately you've had the experience of choosing a Hollywood blockbuster based on hype but no first-hand info from friends, and then left the theatre disappointed and sorry to have wasted your money, then... you'll have a pretty good idea of what you're in for.In X2 you'll be fleetingly presented with around ten superheroes, see them perform a trick or two each and then recede into well-deserved oblivion. You will also see a super-car and a super-plane. None of these entities will manage to awake any emotion whatsoever, since there simply isn't enough time to get acquainted with any of the multiple protagonists. Then again, that might not be so bad.The boring and unimaginitive script contains not a single instance of wit or humour. All is dead-serious and self-conscious, which is rather amazing given the sheer ridiculousness of the superheroes and their abilities. There are fleeting attempts at discussing the place of mutants (""illegal aliens""?) vs. humans in society, but these are halted and overshadowed by computer-generated tricks. The times when movies would only need a few of those to entertain audiences are over, but the makers of X2 didn't realise.The film even manages to make Halle Berry look bad (white 1960's hair).

"Still just a comic at heart, but an intelligent one.","The basic idea of the 'X-Men' series of films is a good one: humans seek to exterminate a race of highly evolved mutants, who themselves plot to take over the world. Meanwhile, a second group of mutants attempt to broker a compromise. Although there are obvious villains, the fact that compromise might not be possible, and the understandable motivation of the warring parties, add some interest to the scenario: Ian Mackellan's evil Magneto, for example, is a far more complex character than his Gandalf in 'Lord of the Rings'. The films are still based on a comic book, which means, in a film, lots of special effects and extended action sequences that can grow tedious; but if anything, this sequel is superior to the original, because there's less need for exposition and the role of Magneto is more ambiguous: as a self-contained story, it works better than the second parts of 'Lord of the Rings', 'The Matrix', or 'Star Wars', to give three examples from other trilogies Ultimatelty, it's all hokum; but mostly entertaining, and far from brain dead.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
United we falter,"Everyone seems to think that X2 is superior to its predecessor, merely on the account of its larger budget.How unimaginative and superficial we've all become.  X2 is a bloated, noisy, action-oriented sequel to a more thoughtful, far superior film.  Special effects aside, everything about X2 is weaker.  The massive cast prevents sufficient character development, the film is edited like an MTV video, and the plot meanders terribly.The most interesting characters from the first film - Rogue and Magneto - are sidelined here.  Ian McKellan is wasted in a minor role, and suddenly his morally ambiguous character - who was so fascinating in the first X-Men - is just evil, to the point where he taunts Rogue after having tortured her, and advocates the total destruction of humanity.  Rogue, meanwhile, gets to have a poorly developed romance with Iceman - every bit as thin and unconvincing as Wolverine's romance with Jean Grey.  Why bother hiring such talented actors as McKellan and Paquin if they must take a back seat to digital trickery and junior high school-caliber ""romance""?Alan Cumming makes a terrible Nightcrawler (I can do a better German accent - ""my name eez Kurt Vagner,"" indeed!), and Halle Berry is once again a totally flat Storm.  Brian Cox makes a cheesy villain (his name is Striker, for goodness' sake!), and his human troops are so outmatched by the mutants that he never provides a credible threat.  In fact, the conflict is so imbalanced that I have to root for humanity - we're going to get our backsides kicked!On the plus side...well, I liked Jean Grey, and Magneto's escape, but they weren't worth the ten bucks.

X2: 6/10,"For a while, X2: X-Men United was called simply X2, until Fox decided to add X-Men United. Even in the opening credits (which seems to have been stoles from Spider-Man), it was simply X2. This shows for the rest of the movie, also: it's indecisive. Is it an action movie, romance, comic book, comedy?This second installment of this popular comic book franchise has Logan, aka Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) coming back to Xavier's School for Gifted Youngesters, run by Xavier (Patrick Stewart). Wolverine has claws and can heal himself, while Xavier has extraordinary telepathy. Other X-Men (mutants) include Storm (Halle Berry), with weather controlling powers, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), with telekinesis, Cyclops (James Marsden, with a smaller role this time around), with laser vision, and Rogue (Anna Paquin), who can suck the life out of anything. New X-Men include Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), who can disappear and reappear, Pyro (Aaron Stanford), who can manipulate fire, and Iceman (Shawn Ashmore). On the other side of the law are Magento (Ian McKellen) and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), who can change forms.General William Stryker (Brian Cox) is going against mutants, and tries to kill them all. To go against Stryker, both good and bad mutants have to team up and defeat Stryker. That's how the X-Men United got in the name.Put simply, X2 tries to be too many things. It has a psuedo-love story, but ultimately doesn't seem to have one central goal. There was a love triangle between Cyclops, Jean, and Wolverine, except it's only talked about a few times, and didn't add anything to the plot. Also, Rogue and Iceman have some sort of relationship that adds humor but little more. In fact, if some of the subplots would have been taken out, this 140 minute movie could have been under two hours, such as another mutant like Wolverine.Special effects dominate this movie. Obviously, they looked fake, but there were very cool. However, there weren't that many fight scenes, and many of them were just Wolverine killing people. If some of the original X-Men were doing their schtick, such as Cyclops, then it would have been more interesting. Although it isn't boring, it's just not heart-pounding or exciting. The special effects were very cool, though.Jackman does another job of covering up his strong accent, and he clearly had fun with his role, not taking it seriously. McKellen puts in another great acting job, as does Stewart. Berry and Janssen both looked hot in skintight outfits, as did Romijn-Stamos (although she was wearing nothing at all). Paquin didn't have much of a role this time, nor did Marsden. Cox, who is now almost as ubiquitous as Amanda Peet now, was good, although I think he was coaxed into this role.X2: X-Men United is a special effects piece that isn't as fun or entertaining as other comic book movies, but overall you probably won't be disappointed.My rating: 6/10Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action/violence, some sexuality and brief language.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"This movie *is* X-men. The first one should be renamed ""X-men -1"" or an introduction to the X-men.","The 1st X-men was a very solid work for what it aimed for, but not quite accomplished.Well it was good enough to deserve a success, good enough to please the spectators with managing to put on screen the X-men in a debatable but solid adaptation, but not accomplished. It was solid, not cheesy, and it resisted multiple views much MUCH more than the overpraised Spiderman. You could say it was too short for the material. Or just too short overall (unconfident producers? come on not even 1h30?), and much too short to all together introduce the characters, raise a bunch of unresolved issues, open for a sequel and make a few things happen. So yeah X-men seemed to me liked unfinished (good) work. The most solid superhero movie since Batman 2 though. Or a promise to make the most solid superhero movie since Batman 2.Now seeing X2 makes me feel like i was right, by bringing much good stuff that was announced by the first, but kept out of it. Dozens of mutants fighting in a tornade of kick bottom special effects. Histories, ambiguities, a good progression and a good rythm. Dont mistake me though. It's not a Tim Burtonesque variation on the theme of superheros. It's just a very honest and very good big dollars work under huge constraints. The hardest kind of film making, some would say.I think the beginning of the movie shows how much X-men is a very unique comics series. The multiplicity of characters and powers just blows you away for the 1st hour. I'm still feeling that the rythm of the movie is awkward though, because of this ""so many characters, so many powers, so many stories"" thing that must have made the script just has hellish to do as those of the LOTR trilogy. Maybe what this movie lacks, though, is 1 character to really focus on, and the focus on Logan is probably is even shyer than in the 1st movie (god i was relieved that the use of the unexpected stardomship of Halle Berry remained in marketing campaigns only and did not seem to interfere with the film).Anyway, a weird rhythm due to hard adaptation, but all the expectations are satisfied.

Hugh Jackman's talent should be taken up in first rate films,"I enjoyed X-Men very much but X-2 excelled in all parts but particularly Hugh Jackman. This multi talented actor can bring all the action, pathos, anxiety, happiness and sorrow to a character of fantasy just imagine what he can do in the real world.The film held my attention completely to the end. All the characters had moved on from the 1st film particularly Wolverine who is now the top character in the series.The action scenes were outstanding - I bet there were quite a few cuts and bruises before the climax of the film and make up and wardrobe really made their mark, But the commitment and hard work of the cast, back stage and the fore sight of Brian Singer really made this a film far more worthy in the ratings that we gave it. Everyone worked together to make it work and the all got on very well - what more can I sayThere is room for another X-men film particularly the many unanswered questions in respect of Logan/Wolverine. He convinced me that although he could not remember what had happened to him or why, that behind this lay a very profound and misused good guy - even though he was told 'he was a wolf and only had the claws added' but then the bad guys do try to destroy good men. Interesting concept as to where it would go and how. Needs far more imagination that I can produce -bet there is a hell of a story yet to come either in the X-Men 3 and/or plus a spin off of Wolverine. I could not imagine X-Men 3 without Wolverine it would not work. Although I would not like to Hugh Jackman stuck in a rut he is capable of so much more and I am sure he would want to do much. He has it to offer and deliver. So come on you top directors don't get in a rut get the multi talented Mr Jackman before you miss him. He has more than proved himself on the stage - there is no reason without a good director and particularly an excellent script an Oscar would be on the way to him and a very rewarding film for all with awards to all concerned.

X2:  X-MEN BORING,"This film is a total bore.  You can follow the outline of ""Empire Strikes Back"" all you want, it doesn't guarantee a good sequel.  The action is second-rate, the characterization non-existent, and the whole thing stale, small, ugly, and tedious.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This is good...,"X-Men.  The first one was by far and away the best comic adaptation I've seen for a good long while, but X2 blew me away.  A problem I had with the first movie was the fact that only Wolverine and Rogue had any real character development, but it's been made sure of that everyone (except, for some weird reason, Cyclops) gets more involved roles in the movie this time round.As if the characters in X-Men weren't cool enough (Toad!!!), the second outing has offered up some really choice mutants.  There's Yuriko Omaya (Deathstrike), who couples good looks with slice-and-dice claws to rival ol' Wolvie's, the flame-controlling Pyro (some pretty decent torn-between-good-and-evil acting from Aaron Stanford) and finally the unbelievably awesome NIGHTCRAWLER!!! The blue-skinned teleporter steals the show with his acrobatics, and it's one of Alan Cummings' best performances undoubtedly.  Then there's the old faves, by which I mean the delicious Halle Berry as Storm, the always-pleasing Ian McKellen as Magneto (the same goes for Patrick Stewart as Professor X) and the brillian Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.  I don't know how they found him, but I'm bloody glad they did!",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
About as good as the first one,"X-Men 2 is a cool movie. The effects were just awesome! Nightcrawler adds depth to the movie, it is more humorous than the first one, and it's just cool overall.

Everything you would want in a comic book adaptation,"X2: X-MEN UNITED / Starring Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, Halle Berry and Alan Cumming / Directed by Bryan Singer / Written by Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter / Rated PG-13 / ***In the year 2002, the summer blockbuster season opened theaters with Sam Raimi's comic book adaptation of the web-slinging hero SPIDER-MAN and also opened a record-breaking weekend. In the year 2003, Marvel strikes again with the sequel to the popular 2000 film, X2: X-MEN UNITED. After a fun yet ultimately uninspired first installment, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Storm (Halle Berry) Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and many more mutants return for which could quite possibly be the best comic book adaptation yet. The movie gets so many things right that I can't see anyone being disappointed.The film opens with an impressive action scene, with mutant Nightcrawler attacking both the White House and the President himself (he even looks a little like George W. Bush). We then learn that a military operative known as General William Stryker is planning a secret battle between normal humans and mutants. As Wolverine and others try to protect the school they call home, mutants Storm and Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) look the mysterious Nightcrawler somehow tying into the plot. Professor Xavier must also confront his arch-nemesis, the dangerous yet imprisoned Magneto (Ian McKellan).The first X-MEN, while usually enjoyable, was merely nothing more than an introduction to the world of mutants, though not really made to tell it's own interesting story. However, all that exposition is thrust aside in X2: X-MEN UNITED. This movie is probably twice as good as the original. It has the pleasure of being a sequel, where character introduction and backstory is irrelevent. This helps the film greatly as we witness spectacular action scenes somewhat lacking in the original. What's probably the movie's greatest strength is that the FUN switch was turned on to full throttle. There are action scenes I have only seen in my dreams. Not only that, they seem to have much more of them here.Though, maybe, there is still one flaw in this movie that even it's predecessor had possessed: There are a touch too many characters. It doesn't mean that it was difficult to keep track of them all. It wasn't. That there are so many characters the film does not have time to go very deep into them is it's only glaring flaw. Like the first, X2 is still a bit Wolverine centered. I was much delighted that Halle Berry had more screen time than before. I have never read any of the X-Men comics, nor seen the television cartoon series that I fell in love with Storm the first time I saw her on screen. Jean Grey I am also happy got more screen time like she deserves. But like last time, the acting falls to the two greatest performances, veterans Patrick Stewart as Xavier and Ian McKellan as Magneto. They seem to have kept dead on with their characters from the last movie.Director Bryan Singer also seemed to have grown in touch with the characters. While the first spent time with introducing characters, X2 spends time with character interactions. There's even a little romance between Mystique (Rebecca Romijn Stamos) and Wolverine. The chemistry between experienced mutants Professor Xavier and Magneto in the prison was also great to watch. Though I am left a little cold that the character of Cyclops, played by James Marsden, is almost completely shunned from this movie like Halle Berry was of the last movie. Maybe Singer is just not interested in the character enough to give him more screentime.There are flaws, yes, but this is probably the best comic book adaptation yet. There is alot of things to absorb and enjoy in this movie, and proved to be a much smarter and better summer action flick than the extremely hyped and deeply flawed THE MATRIX RELOADED. Heck, it's everything you would ever want in both a comic book adaptation and a summer action flick. The film opened with an impressive $85 million in it's first weekend, but was completely forgotten the nearer RELOADED came to hitting theaters. And after seeing both movies twice, I can easily tell you that you will enjoy X2 more. Just have some fun with it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Superheroes save the world...again,"I really enjoy these sci-fi action flicks, especially when they include my favorite characters. For this reason (and the fact that the first of these movies ROCKED!) I was expecting a little more from this. Instead of a good story line, we get a mediocre one which, thankfully, still makes for an entertaining watch. Here we see the introduction of some new characters (go Nighcrawler!) and a quick view of things to come (Rogue and Iceman seem to have made it to the ""grownups table""). Though not as good as the first, this was still entertaining and I can't wait to see what havoc Magneto will cause next!8/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Very, very good","There's not a lot I can add to what's been said about ""X2"", but I did want to kick in my short personal take on the movie.  Even though I'm not an effects maven, the variety and sheer visual wonder of the effects in ""X2"" bowled me over.  They wouldn't have been as worth watching, however, if Bryan Singer & co. hadn't balanced them off with effective character sequences as well.  Though these aren't necessarily up to the level of those in a good movie for grown-ups, they make the film come closer to capturing the ""soap-opera"" appeal of the X-Men comic than the first movie did. Superhero movies seem to be steadily improving, so to call this one ""the best in the genre"" isn't exactly an original tactic.  Except maybe for last year's ""Spider-Man"", though, ""X2"" is as close to a classic film as the superhero genre has produced.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The trailer almost convinced me not to see this...,"Odd that a trailer would convince someone _not_ to watch a movie, as its purpose is the opposite. This movie's trailer makes it appear as though it is nothing more than senseless violence from two seconds into the film until the closing credits... The reality is that this movie has a very well thought out plot, and it was also very well executed. As a sequel, it certainly helps that the original movie had a very open ended conclusion, but also, this movie refers in meaningful ways to the original, giving people who have seen the first insight into what exactly is happening, while not simply embellishing on the original plot. The plot branches off the first one, while creating much of a new plot. That having been said, if you want to see this movie, you would be well advised to watch the first one first, although it is certainly not a prerequisite.The special effects were implemented in such a way that they are a very major part of the film, but by no means do they dominate it! They are never used gratuitously, instead, only when it contributes to the plot. Other Sci-Fi/Fantasy movies could certainly take a lesson from this film. Two minutes in, the effects will have you utterly stunned, while still introducing you into the plot.Onto another certainly shocking item: the acting. It can honestly be said that these actors were doing this film to make a great film. I take that back... not just the actors.... everyone remotely involved in this film was doing this to make it the best. Again, a shocking truth for a Sci-Fi/Fantasy film.I finished watching this movie just an hour ago, and I can still hardly believe how well it was done. As a rule, sequels are generally thought of as being lesser films, with less plot, and more for thrill than anything else. This film is in near perfect balance. Not just as a sequel, but as a true film, X2 is in a league of its own.I give this film a very well deserved Five Stars *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Oh Hummm,"I went into see X2 with very low expectations, I was not very impressed with the first movie so I expected more of the same.  After the first 90 minutes I was sure I was wrong and X2 was a good movie, however after the movie ended I was back to were I began.  X2 is not a bad movie, it just isn't brilliant or exceptional.The Producers, writers and Director(s) did a very good job at making a sequel, the provided a few simple facts about the first movie (and the X-men story) rather than retelling it in a condensed version.  They put time between the movies, with younger actors they do grow up.  And so on and so forth.  And while not the most interesting storyline it provided a decent foundation for special effects.But in my opinion the negatives really hurt the movie, I like to think that a few problems can be overlooked but in this movie they all just stuck out. It appeared that the movie was re-written during filming, while this happens all the time I believe that this movie need a complete re-write, not from the story stand point, but just to help the scenes flow better. In my opinion there are some really intersting scenes and dialog wrapped around some really bad scenes.  I wouldn't be suprised if they filmed in Canada first since the out door scenes were bad (almost like the actors were out of character.) I might be spoiled with my TV at home, but there were not any great scenes you had to see on the Big Screen, Including Jean Grey's scene.  It was like the directory/producers didn't want to take any chances.  All the scenes were shot like you are supposed to shoot pictures.Overall I was entertained, probably won't go see it again and like the first one probably won't add it to the DVD collection at home until it is in the bargin bin.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
When will people realize that marvel makes lousy movies?,"I would consider writing a long and complex analysis of this film since I generally hate to review. However, I just can't bring myself to conjure up the mind numbing images of the movie.First of all, I don't understand why everyone feels that X2 is vastly better than it's predecessor. They are the same movie. Let's get that down. All of marvel's movies are the same. They are horrific misuses of once dynamic characters rehashed intopersonality-free clones.X2, like all other marvel movies thus far, also suffers from the Neo phenomenon. My major complaint about reloaded was that Neo, who was at least a little bit fallable in The Matrix can now be thrown into brick walls at hundreds of miles an hour with no sweat. When this happens, there is no suspense. The hero of X2 is arguably Wolverine and thanks to the blatant misuse of his regernative powers in the movie (in the comic regeneration is a longer, more arduous process) he is genuine carrier of the Neo phenomenon. Surely, this is what many films are like, but it is one of many problems with X2.This movie also has a total lack of compelling characters. Everyone is either completely undeveloped or a total cliche`. The acting prowess of Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart and Brian Cox is utterly wasted on their poorly conceived and forgettable characters while the other characters meander through this waste of time twidling their thumbs and generally carrying on.Essentially, this is just another glitzy schlock movie like The Core or Jurassic Park 3. Marvel is most certainly 0/5 (no, spiderman was not at all good and Ang Lee's presence does not make the Hulk an artistic triumph). 2/10 (I'm being generous).",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The jokes were witty and never resorted to lowbrow humour, the stunts fantastic, and the actors charming. It also poises enough questions to warrant a third film.

One of the best Comicfilms ever,"XMen 2 came to cinema in a very difficult time. Therefore I just saw the trailers for the upcoming bluckbusters ""Matrix Reloaded"", ""Terminator 3"" and ""the Hulk"" right before X2 in the cinema, wich made it kind of difficult for X2 to beat just those trailers. Another part that made it difficult is the fact that comicfilms - except Burtons Masterpiece ""Batman"" and Raimis smart and entertaining hit ""Spiderman"" - are mostly pretty average films that provide only small parts of intelligent entertainment.But I can say with good conscience, that X2 not only masters this task, but also raises the bar for exactly those blockbusters immensly!Director Bryan Singer has really made a character driven actionfilm, and these don't often succeed, but X2 is definately one of those that did.So X2 offers lots of great action (even only the opening sequence with nightcrawler is more than awesome) and never loses it's characters, wich is an even more remarkable because there are plenty of characters in X2 that all want to share their bits and not just want to be a stereotype in the background.So the adventure of Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, Dr Jean Grey, Iceman, Nightcrawler and Rogue fighting side a side with Magneto, Mystique and Pyro against the evil general Stryker and his men, is pure entertainment and pure fun. The World of the XMen comes alive, and this for more than 2 hours.Next to the tremendous achievement of director Bryan Singer and the fantastic work of several SFX houses (just read the end credits for how many there were) this is mostly due to a great cast!So Patrick Stewart as Professor X and Ian McKellen as Magneto give a great performance. Two actors with a simply breathtaking screen-presence. And in a time of Star Trek and Lord of the Rings the conflict will - at least in the heads of many viewers - be extended to Captain Jean-Luc Picard versus Gandalf the Grey. What more can you want?A very good choice again was Hugh Jackman for the part of Wolverine, a very rough, animal and yet very human character who comes to believable life thanks to Jackmans performance.Another pearl is Bryan Cox playing William Stryker, a man who hates every mutant, allthough or most probably just because his own son is one of them.As a result I personally can say that X2 definately belongs in my all time best list. X-Men 2 is cinema as it should be: fast, cool, beautiful and intelligent.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Thankfully, I wasn't, as they sort of re-introduced the characters, displaying their skills and traits. This was a really good super hero flick, probably the best of the year unless Hulk (which is released tomorrow here) or LXG are better.

Feminism Alive and Kicking,"Women loved this film. I am not a woman, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. As I watched the film, however, I did remark a large step foreward in the role of the female super hero, and I think this is perhaps why women liked this film (besides that I'm told Wolverine is hot).Traditionally, as with the Sorceress in ""Heman"", female superheros have power not because of physical strength, but because of some abstract or arcane power. This, symbolically, says that men are stronger than women, and women need to use some intangible power (be it intellect or sex appeal) to garner power.The fight scene with Wolverine and the evil assistant in the adimantium laboratory changes all this. Wolverine, the macho man of the X-men, is severely beaten by a woman in a purely physical contest. There are no spin kicks, no spells, no potions, and no cleavage distractions. This is a fair contest with equal weapons, and it was well done to boot. Granted, he wins in the end, but he bleeds buckets.Marvel comics, thus, has attracted women to a genre which is stigmatized as being male dominated. The boys with their kung fu grip Skeletor no longer reign in the comic book movie industry - way to go girls.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
OOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH MYYYYYYY GODDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!,"My entire life i watched and read x-men. And the first movie met and exceeded all my expectations.

The movie blew me away from the high octane beggining to wolvie's berserker rage, to jean's eyes and the end (wonder where that going????lol). I was suprised that they used Pyro (not that prominant in x-men)there are much bigger characters like beast or gambit (anyone note there names in the movie). Hopefully they will appear. Collosus was cool hopefully he gets beigger part in x3. And nightcrawler was good. This may sound cliched but wolvie is my favoutie character, and hugh jackman is soo good at it (van hellsing should be good he takes on frankenstein, dracula and wolf man in that movcie). And it was so cool to see him go crazy. And the magneto ""too much iron in ur blood"" and pulling it out.

"Two Times the X-Men, Two Times the Cigars Smoked - This is X2 Baby!","X2: X-Men United is the follow-up to 2000's X-Men and takes place several months after the events of the first with Professor Xavier running his School for Gifted Youngsters and Magneto still locked up in a plastic prison. However, after a mysterious, teleporting mutant attacks the President, the government orders a military intervention of the mutants, but, the deceitful Colonel in charge has different plans for the mutants. Released in 2003 X2: X-Men United saw the return of writer-director Bryan Singer along with the rest of the cast from the first, the film was received positively from both fans and critics alike and performed successfully at the box office.I was looking forward to X2 going in, I liked the first film well enough and with the return of many of the filmmakers, alongside an increased budget and more digital advances I figured the film was set up for a slam-dunk - and for a superhero movie released in the early 2000's it surely is. I enjoyed quite a bit about X2, first and foremost the acting is convincing all around and the CGI effects still hold up, due in part to an emphasis still placed on practical effects, however, it was the story this time around that I felt was a big improvement from the first. Similar to its predecessor the plot itself feels grounded (for a superhero film) as if it is something that could happen in the real world if there actually were mutants, but also felt threatening, with an excellent antagonist. My main problem with X-Men's story is I felt there were too many flaws in Magento's grand plan and although Colonel Styker's motivation may still be a little goofy, I felt the story as a whole was pretty tightly knit. It had all the nuances that were present in the first, with even more dynamic by having the X-Men forced to gain trust with an old foe.The film takes you to many places this time around and with characters split up for most of the runtime I thought it was paced well enough to keep me engaged for over two hours. There are also a lot more characters featured in X2 however I felt Singer and company did a good job balancing everybody, and showcasing proper arcs to the most impactful characters such as Wolverine and Jean Grey. My only problem with the film came in terms of a few plot contrivances, slow moments and an overall feeling of forgetfulness. Sure there are aspects to the film that will stick with me, I just feel that I am capable of remembering more about the first than this one. That may be due to the campiness of the first film and being that it was so revolutionary, but here I struggle to remember exact details of what plays out. There is a lot going on in the story and while I do feel it was handled great while watching it, after the film some of those plot points sort of meld together and/or fade away. That could be fixed with further rewatches but where I stand right now I don't feel the need to check out X2 again for a while.X2 is by no means a perfect movie, but for what it was trying to do at the time, it succeeds - it makes improvements from the first and offers fans a great one-two punch when watching the movies in order. I do recommend the film if you haven't seen it, it is a pioneer for the superhero films we know today and a good one at that. While I did enjoy the ride, some moments still remain forgetful and I'm not sure if I'll return to the film all too often, but I feel confident in saying that X2: X-Men United is a solid 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Mostly for the fans,"I was one of the lucky few who got to see this movie on an early screening, and boy did it pay off. The estimates of this film, as a Marvel fan in general, were high. Spending the last couple of months browsing through various teasers and trailers, I finally got to see the full movie.The story takes off roughly a couple of years after the incidents that occurred in the first movie. Wolverine has left his fellow mutants to dig up his past, and other mutants have joined Xavier and his X-Men to learn how to control their mutant powers. Some of these new mutants are Iceman, Pyro and you also get to see Colossus for a brief moment.The main villain from the first movie, Magneto (Ian McKellen) is stuck in a plastic prison, with severe control checks for metals every so often. It seems as if nothing bad can happen... right?The actors do their thing, and the acting is, safe to say, better than in the first movie. The only trouble the common man might have is that the movie is more aimed at the real fans of the comic books, and it features less action than the first movie. It still has, I'd think, some entertainment value for everyone, but only fans will appreciate 'every' scene of pure mutant goodness!

GREAT !!,"Liked the first movie ?You´ll love X2. In my opinion, it´s the best ""comic-book adaptation"" ever made (with X coming in second place).Almost everything about this movie is superb: thank God the US$ 120 million were well spent. The plot is very good (based upon the graphic novel ""God Loves, Man Kills"" bu Chris Claremont and Brent Anderson) and the subplots develop swiftly, joining with the main plot at the exact time. The visual effects are this movie´s ace feature. They´re just spectacular! The Nightcrawler and Mystique shots prove that. The actings are also good (especially Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine)as well as the diection by Bryan Singer.Well.... whatever, you guys won´t care about what I´m writing anyway.... But really, if you like good action/adventure flicks, go ahead and watch X2. You won´t be disappointed.

X Marks the spot,"The 2003 summer movie season is upon us with the release of X2 the highly anticipated follow up the 150 Million plus grossing `X-Men'. The film continues the story of a band of genetic mutants known as The X-Men who find themselves battling a fearful and mistrusting society as well as fellow mutants for better understanding of their kind as well as their very survival. Based on the hit Marvel comic series, the film directed by Bryan Singer, `X2' revolves around an attempt by Colonel Stryker (Brian Cox), to eliminate the mutant threat by invading the training school and home of the X-Men and their leader Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). This direct attack on the mutants adds fuel to the fire as Charles's old friend yet recent enemy Magneto (Ian McKellen), now has proof to his long standing theory that mutants must fight the humans for survival. Until now, Xavier has always believed that humans and mutants could co-exist in peace and has trained his students in this philosophy as well as the enhancement of their talents. Magneto has always believed that mutants must fight to survive, and that humans are inferior and has surrounded himself with followers who share this belief.  Naturally this conflict of interest has lead to skirmishes between the two sides as well as an increased fear of mutants from a human population caught in the crossfire.  As if the attack on the academy was not enough to complicate the lives of the X-Men, Magneto has escaped from his high security prison and a mutant assassin has made an attempt on the life of the President making a tense situation even more volatile as fear and paranoia regarding mutants is now at an all time high. Faced with a battle on several fronts, the X-Men join forces with Magneto's troops in a reluctant alliance that is necessary for the survival of their kind as well as for the very human race.What follows is a dazzling mix of special effects and action as the two sides battle Stryker's legions and each other with the very real threat of genocide hanging in the balance. There are some fine performances in the film especially those of Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as the shape shifting Mystique and that of Alan Cumming as the Bible quoting teleporter Nightshade. The two characters add energy and humor to their roles that makes them stand out from the majority of the cast save Hugh Jackman's standout performance as Wolverine.This is a much more serious X-Men than the last adventure as people are killed along the way upping the violence from the traditional comic book style yet none of it is overly explicit. My biggest gripe with the film was that there were several long gapes in the film where little was happening and that talents such as Hale Berry, Patrick Stewart, Anna Paquin, and Ian McKellen were not given much to do with the screen time they had. There were flashes of great moments such as Roque (Ana Paquin), confronting Magneto for the first time since he tried to kill her in the last film, and a bizarre love triangle involving Wolverine that has to be seen to be believed, yet as a whole, `X2' left me wanting more. I know with so many characters in the story it would be difficult to develop them all, and `X2' does a nice job expanding on the roles of some of the smaller characters from the comic and past film, yet it simply does not add up. I think that with a tighter script and more attention to the details this film would have been truly great. That being said, `X2' is an entertaining summer film that should delight fans of the past film and the comic. If you can get by a few plot holes, then you might find yourself having a good time.3 stars out of 5Gareth Von KallenbachInternational Association of Film Critics",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The first time I actually liked X-Men,"After watching the first X-Men and hearing that there was a sequel coming out, I was excited. Not only would most of the original cast come back, we also got a few new faces, including Kelly Hu (of The Scorpion King), Alan Cumming (Boris Grishenko from GoldenEye), and Brian Cox (who first played Hannibal Lecter). They all contributed to a pretty darn good sequel. I was hoping to watch this movie the summer it premiered but never got around to doing so, but I got to watch it that fall and was pleasantly surprised (though there was a spoiler revealed between that aforementioned summer and the following fall, but I won't say what for those of you who haven't seen the movie). Lots more action and plenty of cool characters as befitting the Marvel Comics franchise. It made me interested in the sequel, which did not come out until three years later. But this was the best of the original X-Men trilogy. It's got some fun moments and lots of character development. Nightcrawler, Lady Deathstrike, Iceman, Pyro, and William Stryker are the ones who really steal the show in this movie. Stryker was originally the villain in the X-Men comic book God Loves, Man Kills as a military man turned religious nut. Read that one if you're interested in the back story of this movie. But give this a go. If you enjoyed the first one, this is even better!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Did anybody see the political overtones?,"I like the idea of the administration overreacting to a terrorist assault and the cliffhanger ending with the president is left do decide wether to moderate his approach or continue on the downward spiral. I found that stance brave of Hollywood to take considering the political climate in the US now. Otherwise I do find the film not as good as the first, mainly because the plot, while good, is not so tight as in the first, and the acting is bad. In the first film the good actors (Xavier, Magneto, and Wolverine) were given larger parts which helped disguise the poor acting from other members of the cast. In any case it is the best film I have seen in a long time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The sequel wasn't as good as the original,"The plot of the sequel was interesting, but it wasn't as good as the original. The storyline was kinda well-written, but it was boring. The characters were well-developed and very interesting. It wasn't as intense as the first movie and there weren't many fight scenes. In my opinion, the first movie was way better than the second movie. The duration of the movie was way higher than the first movie, which was kinda unnecessary. The casting was kinda the same and the acting was as good as the first movie. The graphics and the effects were really cool. The ending scene was unexpected. I hope the third movie is gonna be better...! Last but not least, I hope we will have the chance to get to know more about the mutant's powers on the next few movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Blows the first one out of the water,"The first X-MEN was, I felt, a very successful outing.  But it lacked the momentous feel and captivating energy of, for example, SPIDER-MAN--which captured perfectly everything that made the comics so wonderful.  X-MEN was a skillful adaptation from a difficult medium with some great performances from 2 great actors, but I wouldn't exactly term it ""great.""X2 is great.  Better than the first, better, even, than SPIDER-MAN.  Not just by a little, but by a lot.From the opening sequence (I'm not gonna ruin it), it's pretty apparent that we're in for something more.  Bryan Singer brings his stylistic influence to bear on this film a lot more than in the original--and the results are appreciated.  His little touches of cinematic deftness make one appreciate the value of having a great director even on a blockbuster action project like this.Another improvement is the length--no joke.  X2 is able to tell a much deeper, and, well, BIGGER story than the first because it's got over 2 hours to do it in.  The extra time allows for more and better action sequences (MUCH better; am I the only one who was a little underwhelmed by the Wolverine/Mystique sequences from the first movie?), sure, but perhaps more importantly it allows for more character.  Not just character development, character INTERACTION--something the original needed more of.  Wolverine and Iceman in the kitchen, for instance, is a great example of the kind of hanging-out-at-the-X-Mansion scenes that helped give the comic book such depth and breadth.SPIDER-MAN was great because it focused not as much on recreating exactly the classic STORY of the comics, but on recreating the things that made that story so great in the first place.  X-MEN did this to an extent, but not as well.  X2 does it better than both of them, and that's why it's a better film than both of them.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Impressive and tight,This film has a tight focus on its main storyline concerning Wolverine which serves it well. It shows moments of the other mutants but doesn't dwell on them.

Do not read if have not viewed movie and are desirous of remaining blissfully unaware of its contents.,"First and foremost, I enjoyed this film.  Second and secondly, it was too long. It started out well, with a strange entity/mutant teleporting about in a frenzy, threatening the president and taking on the secret service men. But afterwards, it seemed to take on exact feel as the last movie, with no real plot twists (except the end, which seemed a little out of the blue), or character changes. Of course, it is integral to keep on the old characters with their personalities intact from the last film, however, there were few or no new characters or character changes (excepting the end).  We bravely went exactly where we went before.  Wolverine is on a quest to discover his past, in which we are once again denied knowing who he was and why he was given his adamantium skeleton.  (He also is still sexually frustrated about Dr. Jean Gray).  Mutants are under threat by panicky and controlling humans, and humans are once again threatened by the renegade mutants bent on destruction.  Magneto has an ugly red helmet, and a blue shape shifting sidekick, motiveless in her seduction of Wolverine (and what was with her turning into Stryker once as supposedly part of Wolverine's sexual fantasy?).  We miss cutie-patootie Cyclops through half of the movie, and the fight scenes, while fast-paced and action packed, do nothing to continue the pace of the film, which considerably drags.  Particularly when the X-Men are up north in the frigid outback (again), and lost for hours (seemingly), in the tunnels of Skylark's domain.  I also now know, every panel of Prof. Xavier's mind controlling orb, Cerebro. This movie's plot could have been carried out in an hour and a half, instead of over two.  I do not regret the $7.00 I spent on this film.  It was a relatively pleasant way to spend a Friday evening, however, I was not as intruiged as by the first film, and unfortunately expected a bit more than a cookie-cutter marvel comic book to film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Wow, This is a Mediocre Film","For the life of me I cannot fathom the viewers who saw this film and thought it was a big improvement over the original.  After a pretty good opening scene [but not the big stunner some people claim], the film takes forever to get started, never really gaining any momentum, featuring a mundane plot sprinkled with brief uninspired action, and a truly boring and drawn-out so-called climax.  It just never ends.  [But then again, it never seemed to get going either.]  Please, no more!!!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"A step forward, at almost all levels.","I am not very used to films that have characters from the comic book universe as their theme, but the quality and impact that some have had makes them a mandatory visit. So, even without knowing much about the characters or their fictional stories, I decided to watch the X-Men franchise films. This decision was followed by some reading about the characters and the films. I tried to follow more or less the chronological sequence of events starting with the prequels and continuing, in order to better understand what I was seeing. So this film, which was the second in the franchise, was the fourth film I saw.In this film, the American president is attacked by a mutant. In response, he authorizes William Stryker to make efforts to control and identify mutants, which are now considered a threat to national security. With Magneto trapped in a plastic prison and at the mercy of the army, Xavier's mansion is attacked and prisoners are taken. With a new danger in common, the remaining X-Men are forced to join forces with Magneto, who still has his own agenda.This was the second film in the franchise and gives a logical continuation to the story started in the first film. It is an improvement as the story is denser, darker and with space for mutants that were kept in the background in the first film, as is the case of Storm, who appears more and has more intervention in the story now. Dialogues are good and has some space for well-placed comic lines and also some romance (highlighting Rogue's flirtations and the Cyclops-Jean-Wolverine love triangle). Personally, I felt that this film puts more characters in interaction, which gives more relevance to their dialogues and the way they relate to each other, revealing more of each one's personality. This is most evident with Rogue, Iceman, Pyro and Nightcrawler, which is the most notable addition to the movie's character list.The cast is inherited from the previous film and is made up of proven actors. This is the case of Hugh Jackman, who continued his excellent work as Wolverine, or Sir Ian McKellen, who steals the spotlight when he appears, giving Magneto a threatening perversity and a cynicism full of elegance and depth. Patrick Stewart, Anna Paquin, Rebecca Romijn and Famke Janssen continue to shine in their respective roles, in such a way that they seem tailor-made for these actors. Among the newcomers, I would highlight Alan Cumming, extremely effective as Nightcrawler, and Brian Cox, who made a good villain. On the negative side, I would continue to mention James Marsden's one-dimensional and tasteless performance, and also Halle Berry, who was unable to take advantage of the extra screen time given to her character, limiting herself to continuing the bland performance of the first film, where her was character frankly secondary. She should have invested more in the character or demanded better material from the screenwriter.In addition to these merits, the film has excellent production values that should be highlighted. It is a Marvel film and there are huge millions of dollars involved, which is quite evident from the beginning. Visually its a show in itself, with great visual effects and the best CGI that money could buy. The opening sequence, with the attack on the President, immediately captures our attention for the rest that follows. The scenes and action sequences are great and the climax is a great action sequence, even more tense and interesting than the one we saw in the first film. As in the first film, it has excellent luxurious and detailed sets and costumes. Cinematography is excellent and makes good use of color and shadow to make the film denser, darker and tenser. The editing was also well accomplished, which results in a perfect rhythm, in which there are no dead moments. I think its fair to also greet the makeup department and the soundtrack by John Ottman, which is quite somber and in concordance with the atmosphere of the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

One word: Wow!,"I just got back to my apartment after seeing this movie, and I'm still on a high from it.  I think this sequel gets that rare distinction of being better than the first.  Everything was right on target with this movie. Since there were fewer character introductions, the audience is treated with a much faster paced movie with more action and even more impressive special effects.  I don't want to go into detail so as not to ruin anything for those who haven't seen the movie.  On that note, I must say the trailers of this movie were excellent by virtue of the fact that there was plenty to see in the movie that was not in the trailers.  Anyway, back to the actual movie...  If you're a fan of the comics, you will really enjoy this movie. It has plenty of plot turns that remind you of why you love the comics so much.  I'd like to keep this vague since one of my favorite things about X2 is that I had (purposely) known very little about it prior to seeing it.  So go see it now.  I mean it...NOW!",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Rigid direction of the plot,"After watching Origins:Wolverine and X-Men, I think the direction the plot went was too rigid, it's comparable to the Gotham City universe, the whole plot revolves around one major thing and I don't particularly like it. Maybe the direction is even okay and I am just not impressed by the way they presented it since the movie is 15 years old.The production was comparably good for it's time like the prequel and the few new mutants being introduced were pretty cool. My rating is somewhere between 7 and 8 but I rather go for 7 since I don't think the franchise was going the right direction, but they can always better themselves afterwards, this is not the last movie including the X-Men universe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"It's the ""Wrath of Kahn"" for X-Men movies","Okay. . .the first X-Men was a little slow. But it was necessary. For those unitiated in the X-Men universe, there was the necessary character development and slow-moving storyline. X2 picks up where X-Men left off -- there's little, if any, deep character development but it gives X-Fans what they want -- action, action and more action. It reminded me of the first Star Trek movie. If you remember, it was kind of slow -- bringing everyone back up to speed on Star Trek and where are they now. Now, that was settled -- they unleashed ""Wrath of Kahn"" which absolutely kicked butt and took names. X2 is the same deal -- building on the foundation established by the first X-Men, X2 cranks up the volume. It is definitely a must see!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I wish I could say it was better than X-men...,"It would even be really nice to say that it was as good as the first movie. You see I'm a really big actors fan and this cast is guaranteed to leave a wet spot in my cinema seat (Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen and of course Hugh Jackman!). Sadly the talents of Mr. Stewart and Mr. McKellen are wasted here since they seem to have so little to do!  The same goes for James Marsden, Halle Berry and even newcomer Alan Cumming!In my opinion, it doesn't even come close to X-Men 1.It lacks rhythm, action and tension.There were very few moments where I was wondering how a character was going to get himself out of the mess (s)he was in. The one exception to that, is when Wolverine gets his butt kicked by a girl.There is an up side: The message is still clear and enough 'in your face' to be understood by the people it is aimed at.

What I learned from this movie: be kind to people with glowing eyes.,"A wonderful movie about exclusion and alienation. With kick ass fight scenes.I'm a sucker for superheroes, and this move is crammed with them. And some of the best actors out there: Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen . . . man, I believed.The kick ass fight scenes did not hurt.The thing that is so marvelous about the X-Men is how redemptive it is. Many of us who were ever bullied as a child, all of us who have ever been oppressed and exploited want to rise up; want them to crawl at our feet.But it's not just about revenge fantasies, though the revenge fantasy was a major, major, component of this story. It's surprising subtle story about the line between revenge fantasies and building a just society.There was a whole lot of stuff going on. I'm no X-Men fangirl, but I've read a comic book now and again (at least the ones written by Joss Whedon) (everyone should read every thing ever written by Joss Whedon, btw) and I'm not sure I would have tracked what happened but for that.I work for a politician, and I love him. But man, I bought the venality of these political men.The metaphor of the dam finally breaking . . . wonderful. Cathartic, but also frighteningly Brechtian. The dam has broken, the long leashed waters unloosed, and we all have to live after the flood. Innocent or not. We still have to live in the world created by our ancestors.One of the best popular major motion pictures ever. Go see it. See it again.

"By the powers, they actually got it right this time!","""X-Men"" was a bit of a disappointment to me. Don't get me wrong it was entertaining and fun but it didn't had the right comic book/cartoon feeling to me. ""X2"" is an huge improvement and it really surprised me how good this movie was! One of the surprises of the year!Advantage of ""X2"" is that it doesn't have to waste time on character introduction because it begins were ""X-Men"" had ended. As a result the action starts right away! And what an action this movie has, the opening attack of Nightcrawler is truly spectacular and an achievement in movie making. The movie has many, many more spectacular fights of which you never get bored and that are all done wonderfully.But not only the action has improved. Also the character have improved in a major way. Storm and Jean Grey have finally become much more interesting and had a bigger role to play, especially Jean Grey plays an important part this time.Also the story has improved a lot. It is a much more interesting story compared to the first movie and it actually has the same feeling as the comics/cartoons, something the first movie was also lacking. I also like how they ""teamed up"" Magneto and Mystique with the x-men this time.Another thing that had improved was the music. I'm sorry to say but Michael Kamen's score for ""X-Men"" was simply not good and didn't fitted the movie. John Ottman's ""X2"" score suits the movie much better and even gives it a more ""superhero"" feeling.So all in all there are only improvements and there isn't much negative to say.Great action, great characters, great story, great movie!

Mozart!,"The first scene with Nightcrawler attacking the White House while Mozart's Requiem: Dies Irae plays is one of the greatest combinations of film and music I've ever seen!  I've loved this piece for years for its intensity, the way it combines fear, wonder, terror, amazement, despair, etc. . . Everything I've always felt about it was summed up in Singer's opening montage:  the action, the violence, the awe - it's all there.  I've never seen classical music used to greater effect.  I nearly pulled my friend's arm off when I knew what I was listening to while some mysterious creature was ravaging the President's guards I was so excited.  She thought I was a complete dork.

Blows the first one away,X2 has everything that X Men lacked. Most notably this is more screen time and fight scenes for Wolverine. Hugh Jackman makes a great Wolverine and I can't see anyone else in the role. Nightcrawler is the coolest mutant (except for Wolverine) introduced so far and his teleportation ability is visually dazzling and helps him do things no other mutant can. Colossus's cameo is cool but he should have been given more scenes. Hopefully in X3 he will be given more. My only complaint is that the film runs a bit long and drags in some spots. A few cuts would have kept this movie tighter and more concise. The effects in this movie are spectacular and are one of the movie's greatest strengths. I hope that the X Men films just keep getting better. Bottom Line: This is a must see in the theater.

So what if the characters were not exactly like the comics?,"This I think was my first ""Comment"" - I opened it up to see if I could make a correction to a typo and now I am being told not that I have too few words of text. Pfaw! Oh Well. I was first in line to see this thing when it came out by where I live... I was disappointed that they did not offer free comic books like they did with the first X-Movie.This movie ripped! Great story, good continuity between the first movie and this one. Excellent depiction of characters. Worth the 3 year wait. And... They actually gave Halle Berry some speaking lines.I like how Famke Janssen looks here, better than the first movie (or the last, but the last there is a reason for how she looks). My favourite thing about this film was the way Nightcrawler was shown, and the way he was filmed teleporting was exactly how I imagined it when I used to read X-Calibur (The comic series where Nightcrawler spent most of his time).Although I saw this twice in the theatre, I did not really recognise the ""Pheonix Saga"" until I saw X-3 and they brought out that part of the story.What this story deals with is mostly Wolverine's past. They changed the ""Lady DeathStrike"" character just a bit, and I have to say I like the revision.I think this film was the director's masterpiece, not really having been impressed by Superman Returns, I feel he is a traitor to Marvel for leaving the franchise and going off to DC-land.Since the first X-Men movie came out, each subsequent Marvel movie has exceeded the quality of the previous one.Looking forward to The new Hulk...

Just What a Sequel Should Be!! (Pay attention to the end),"X2 is exactly what a sequel should be. It does not get caught up in the hype of audience anticipation or a huge budget to produce a special effect bonanza with no story. Instead, Bryan Singer remains with the excellent formula that made X-Men a great success. X2 remains a plot based movie that includes special effects and fight scenes only when needed. Everything that was established in X-Men is fed off of or improved upon in X2. Mystique plays a much more significant role in this movie compared to the originial. The story of William Stryker basically attemtping to detain and kill all mutants works much better than the original of Magneto attempting to turn humans into mutants. I cannot even begin to describe the amount of excitement I had coming into the movie, and the amount of joy and happiness I had coming out of it. Not only is it superior to the excellent original movie, but it is by far one of the best movies you will see all year. The sequences in between the fight scenes or action scenes are well developed and add a great deal of importance to the movie. Be sure to pay particular attention to the closing monologue, as well as the image emerging from the water. I have been told that that will have a significant impact on the events of X3. Great cast with Hugh Jackman and the absolutely gorgeous Famkee Janssen (more significant in this movie, although not much more screen time) leading the way.

X-crement,"this is a bad movie.  there is no drama, there is no character development. all of the dialogue is completely expository.  the direction is flaccid and amateurish(three instances that come to mind are wolverine touching stryker's hand through the ice wall, cyclops crying after jean gray saves the airplane and nightcrawler reciting the lord's prayer).  it not drama. it's contrived.  the plot isn't interesting at all, though a good portion of it is confusing for a x-men virgin like myself(though i saw the first film). case in point--the love triangle with wolverine, jean gray and cyclops. that little bit had no bearing on the story whatsoever.  zero.  the special effects add nothing to the film, with the exception of the opening sequence with nightcrawler(by far the best sequence in the movie).  X-2 was extremely boring; the last half hour stretched on forever.  on top of all this, the film came off as preachy.  i got the whole 'mutants are oppressed' thing in the first movie.  no need to beat me over the head with it.juvenile, bland, contrived and unimaginative, i didn't enjoy x-2 at all. i went to see it on opening day...i'm not predisposed to disliking such a film; in fact, this is the kind of film to which i most look forward.  i love blockbusters and special effects.  i love action and superheroes. this one just didn't do it.  it didn't work.  this one was aimed at 14 year old boys, not at me.  i remember myself at 14 and i can assure you i wouldn't have enjoyed x-2 at that age, either.  it's crap.  it's garbage.  it is a coloring book filled with the wrong colors by a retarded infant.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

This was not just a good film, this was an EXPERIENCE that movie magic is all about.Yes, there WERE a lot of characters to focus on, and in order to do that, some of our favorite characters from the first one were sacrificed for newer ones, but even the NEW characters were interresting enough that I could forgive the absence of a few others.  Cyclops got the worst screen time than anyone else, I actually MISSED him in this film.But in order to develope the new villian, story-lines, and character developements, I thought Brian Singer did OUTSTANDING and gave us MAGIC.Now, can I wait till the NEXT X-MEN?  I'll just have to see this one a few more times.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Greatest Comic Book Movie of All Time,"Big words, huh? Not possible, right? Better than Superman? Batman? Better than Spider-Man? Well, see if for yourself. If you've been reading comics as long as I have, or even longer, the more you'll appreciate this movie. This movie realizes that it has the chance to take the absolute best from the X-Men, from characters to ideas. The storyline is a perfect cinematic echo from the Claremont days. The action, the... there's nothing I say about this movie. You simply have to see it. You have to. I swear you won't be disappointed.

The mutants aren't evolving,"The opening scene of 'X2' is a cracker, but from there the story and situations lack innovation and largely fail to deliver the goods. It's a real shame, as you won't find a more intriguing clutch of characters. The mutants are the whole point of 'X-Men' but most are developed no further than they were in the original, despite the filmmakers' pre-release promises to the contrary.Rogue, Professor X and the phenomenally bland Cyclops are genuine disappointments, and while Storm and Magneto hold their own, Nightcrawler is a missed opportunity and Lady Deathstrike is only required for a single scene though she appears throughout. Hugh Jackman's brooding presence as Wolverine and the shape-shifting powers of Mystique give the movie a boost whenever they're on screen, and Brian Cox does what he can with a role which is essentially that of the army guy who's forever chasing The A-Team.The whole set-up screams 'franchise' (you can almost hear the toy manufacturers drooling), but after the splash made by the original it deserves so much more.When X3 eventually comes around (XXX has been done, so 'X-cubed' maybe?), I say plot be damned - just let the mutants strut their stuff.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A Decent Sequel to the Original X-Men Movie,"When the President of the United States is attacked by a mutant who goes by the name of the ""Nightcrawler"" (Alan Cumming) the decision is made to turn the matter over to a man named ""William Stryker"" (Brian Cox) who assures the president that his intentions are honorable. Not long afterward however, Stryker uses his new-found authority to torture ""Magneto"" (Ian McKellan), who is still imprisoned in his plastic prison cell, in order to gather enough information to launch an attack upon the school founded by ""Professor Charles Xavier"" (Patrick Stewart). Now, rather than disclose Stryker's ultimate agenda and risk spoiling the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a decent sequel to the original ""X-Men"" movie. I liked the acting of Alan Cumming and I certainly didn't mind the presence of Halle Berry (as ""Storm""), Famke Janssen (""Jean Grey"") or Kelly Hu (""Lady Deathstrike""). However, I didn't care for the ending or the fact that there were probably too many characters and not enough film to cover them all. On the whole then I rate this movie as slightly above average.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Total waste of $9.50,"First and foremost, I thought the first X-Men was an average to dull movie and it in no way merited a sequel.  Hollywood of course has different agendas.  This sequel is horrible.  The first 30 mins of the movie move along rather well and have some nice special effects, but that is where the fun stops.  The last hour is so drawn out and boring that I and my co-watcher were nodding off at times.  The plot is bad, and the script is poorly written.  Can anyone answer me these 2 questions?  (1) Why is it ok to kill off goverment soldiers, but it is not Ok to kill police officers? For some reason no police officers were hurt during the filming of this movie, there faces however were covered in soot from exploding cars 1ft from them.  Meanwhile army special ops soldiers were gutted left and right with no limbs spared.  (2) Why can this band of mutants accomplish incredible feats time & time again without fail, but when faced of the task of trying to avoid a wall of water closing in on there location with 30 mins to act the best solution they can come up with is to sit in a broken down state of the art 'mutant' jet (which for some reason has no ejection seats) and look dumbfounded? WTF? And people are raving about this pile of junk.  The damn teleportin' crawler could have teleported them all 1 by 1 to a nearby mountain top in 5 secs. Nice script writing.  I can not believe this movie is going to inherit yet another sequel. Tragedy at it's finest.  There was two awesome things about the movie though that I forgot. The preview for 28 Days Later, and the preview for Matrix 2.  I'm out.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Awesome! Better than the first!,"I am picky - really picky as to what movies I like. Most movies are ""Okay"", but X2? What an awesome film. Better than the first, and completely unlike the first. This is everything Spiderman and Daredevil should have been. From the out-of-this-world special effects to the cleverly plotted action-sci-fi plotline: this movie delivers. I'm not surprised the writers had to leave out certain characters (Beast, Jubilee, Gambit), in just over two hours they chose extremely carefully who and what to cram into the viewing time. An intelligent action story with great characters (Famke Janssen and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos steal the show). An amazingly well-filmed movie. What more could I ask for?

A review of the DIGITAL projection,"I was lucky enough to see this film digitally projected (I've read that there were only 35-45 theaters in the US that are doing this.)  Living in Los Angeles, you have to deal with smog, freeways, and attitudes, but at least you get digitally projected movies!Having watched the movie projected on film the week before, I already knew what to expect from the story, so I probably wasn't as blown away as I should have been by certain sequences, especially the opening with Nightcrawler.  But what I got was a perfectly crisp picture - no film scratches, no annoying reel changes with ""cigarette burns"" followed by an audio pop.  If you don't know what a ""cigarette burn"" is, see ""Fight Club,"" but I warn you - you'll always be conscious of it every you see a movie in the theater.There were however at times, when the picture was a little too perfect. Some shots looked blurry, like they had blown up the film a little to get a closer shot.  I don't know if they actually did this, but that's what it looked like.  A few times when there was A LOT of action and camera movement, there was some SLIGHT blur and picture jumping.  And by this I do mean SLIGHT.  Unless you were looking for it, you probably wouldn't have noticed it.  Also, some of the edges on objects on the screen seemed a little jagged at times, but then again, this wasn't that noticable.Don't get me wrong, these are only minor criticisms.  Do I prefer the digital projection?  Definitely.  This is the third digitally projection film I've seen, the other two being Episode II and Toy Story 2.  The biggest differences here is that these two movies were created digitally while X2 was shot on film and transferred.  The picture was still superior, but not mind-blowing (and it made Mystique and Nightcrawler's make-up jobs look a lot more like make-up)While I preferred the digital projection, I wouldn't tell you to plan a road trip to seek out a theater that has it like I would have for Episode II and Toy Story 2.  If you're going to see it, and there is a theater around that does have it, then go for it!",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Not an Improvement on the Original,"Nightcrawler was admittedly awesome, and there were scattered moments of imagination and wit, but on the whole, the film was at least twenty minutes too long, and the villain plot (featuring Brian Cox as Commander Stryker) was dull and by-the-numbers. My favorite moments were at the school, where new (adolescent) mutants were introduced, and the storyline with Wolverine (still impressively played by Hugh Jackman) trying to figure out his origin via torturous memories. The climax (in an underground dam) stretched on forever, and the film has at least six different endings. X2 showed the mark of too many writers trying to juggle too many characters. I'm still looking forward to part three, though. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Weirdly underrated for much of a banger it is,"I've always found the discourse around X2 to be interesting. People seem to generally like it, but yet again, it's never considered one of the BEST superhero films ever. It's usually considered a tier below the widely agreed upon comic book greats, like The Dark Knight, Logan, or Infinity War.I agree that it is probably a tier below those movies, but X2 to me, is one of the best sequels ever made. It really improves upon the original in every way: character development, pacing, set pieces, themes, and ideas...everything is more refined, more confident, more polished. Unlike the first, there's less insecurity about being a ""comic book, superhero"" movie (probably because Spider-Man came out the year before and made a billion).The characters they add are absolutely fantastic. Alan Cumming's Nightcrawler is probably my favorite; not only does he understand the character completely, but so do the writers. I loved he and Storm (Halle Berry) have an awesome relationship, and oh, they finally gave her a lot more to do and she's much better in this as well. It's a shame we don't see him again.Brian Cox is great as William Stryker and perhaps one of the best villains this series has ever produced. It's amazing how a man without superpowers is not only terrifying, but effective against the mutants. He really demonstrated how harnessing the power of the US government is, in a sense, like a superpower (lol). I really loved Jason (Michael Reid McKay) and his relationship as well, as it spoke volumes as to where Stryker is coming from.All the villains in this film - Stryker, Jason, Magneto, and yes, even Pyro - work towards fleshing out the central conflict of the film and present a balanced view of the threats facing human-mutant coexistence in a way that felt grounded and pressing. This is really the movie that made Ian McKellen's Magneto an icon; it was a brilliant choice to have him have to work with the X-Men; I feel like super hero films that attempt two villains afterwards almost always pale in comparison to how this film did it.The movie isn't perfect; again, I hate how a character as cool as Lady Deathstrike is relegated to a silent henchwoman, and Jean Grey and Cyclops are yet AGAIN criminally underused. I feel like they didn't really understand what to do with these people, despite their prominence in the comics. I also can't pretend like the green hued industrial building the final TWO THIRDS the movie takes place in is a great setting. To be honest, that entire sequence is kind of ugly looking and the film really doesn't take advantage of the colour and style the X-Men offer.But, this movie is chock full of genuinely incredible and excellent moments that I remember as if I saw it yesterday. The assault on the X-Mansion, the reunion of Iceman and his parents, the fight between Wolverine and Deathstrike, the whole thing with Jason, everything with Nightcrawler...we are so back with this movie. It really solidified the X-Men as a top tier comic book movie franchise and even today, is one of the best entries in the franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
correction,"The film was amazing, yes we all know and I hope there are several, several sequels just like everyone else, it's impossible to laude X2 enough but Mr. DeSando's comment on Nightcrawler contained a slight error and as I am picky and kind of perfectionistic like that I'm going to correct that bit: ""Cumming is the satanic teleporter, Nightcrawler."".

Not only is society up in arms, thanks to the government's negative spinning on the situation, but we didn't really think that the plastic jail would hold Magneto for long did we?!

X - 2,"Review By Kamal KThis sequel is bigger, badder, and better than the first film, bringing back the excellent special effects, attractive stars, and fun action sequences, and the perfect popcorn-movie tone. That said, while this movie is all about the action, there are so many characters that it's hard to include them all in anything meaningful, giving parts of X2: X-Men United the feel of a prolonged introductionThe comic's fans want to see every character up on the screen, and the movie tries to make it happen. But the result is that it's hard for people who are not familiar with the stories to keep everyone straight or develop much of a commitment to any of them. Halle Berry and Anna Paquin in particular are still criminally underused. The most memorable character is Mystique, played by Rebecca Romjin-Stamos, who is so good that she can even act under all that blue paint and thosesequin-like scales. Alan Cummings is a welcome addition as Nightcrawler, but his German accent and Biblical references seem out of place and attracted some laughter from the audience. This is handled with more sensitivity in the comic books, where he is portrayed as a devout Catholic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Good fun, but where is X-3 heading?","SpoilersSince the release of X-men in 2000, quite a few of the members in the original cast have attained more prominent recognition, although not yet comparable to the status eventually reached by the cast of The Magnificent Seven. Halle Berry (Storm) an Oscar, albeit undeservedly. Ian McKellen (Magneto) gained worldwide recognition from his portrayal of Gandalf in Lord of The Rings. Rebecca Romijn-Syamos (Mystique) has made her mark in her alluring double role in Femme Fatale. Anna Paquin (Rouge) got considerable exposure, albeit in supporting role, in Almost Famous and Finding Forester (even if her achievement in ""The piano"" might have been forgotten).The discarded duo of Toad and Sabretooth from X-1 is amply replenished in X-2. Of the newcomers, I particularly like Nightcrawler, with his fascinating persona of religious good guy cum exotic outsider. Visually, he makes a perfect pair with Mystique, for obvious reasons. Most stunning is the visual interpretation of his teleporting feats, fruit of a perfect marriage of creative imagination and superb techonology.The new pair of Fire and Ice gets only an introductory exposure but will obviously fuel the main plot in X-3. In conjunction, Rouge gets disappointingly little screen time, particularly in comparison with the key role she had in X-1. Disappointing it may be, the strategy is understandable. The new teenage triangle is to be saved for X-3 while in the meantime, the old triangle of Wolverine, Jean and Cyclops has to be sorted out first in X-2.Somewhat wasted is black belt holder Kelly Hu's Yuriko. Again the strategy is clear. Yuriko is introduced specifically as a villain in X-2 and is not going to stay around as a member of the mutants. Therefore, it would not be cost-efficient to devote any footage to developing her character, particularly when there are already too many characters to cover.As the temporary alliance with Magneto ends, we can look forward to resumption of the good old confrontation in X-3. Wolverine will likely continue to be the central character but as the attraction in the searach for his origin is beginning to wear thin, new elements may need to be brought in. Dr. Jean Grey did not really die, as comic fans told me, and will come back. Cyclops however may receive even less attention in X-3 than the pitiably little coverage he has in X-2. As mentioned, the teenage triangle will take a more prominent position. The fate of Nightcrawler, together with that of the earlier members, still remains to be seen. Magneto's camp needs some reinforcement in addition to the fiery guy he just picked up. Hopefully, there will be some wonderful new surprises.As to X-2, it delivers what I purchased my admission ticket for. In addition to the teleporting I mentioned, there are two things I particularly enjoyed, and they both come from Magneto. The idea of infusing the jailer's blood with an overdose of iron for Magneto to manipulate is ingenious. Annihilating a whole group of soldiers by simply removing the safety pins in their grenades via magnetic influence is also pretty clever. Great fun. Marvellous movie.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Derivative title says it all.,"This film is tighter and more coherent than the first film (X1?); but overall, I would say that Brian Singer is an unfocused, mediocre director. There are some great (if derivative) action sequences, but the story seems pieced together from other sources, all in way that guarantees the viewer will be momentarily pleased (simply because the film reminds them of OTHER blockbusters), but in the end, one walks away feeling a bit unsatisfied.Once again, the film is saved by the actors (some of them at least). Ian McKellen turns in another brilliant performance. Hugh Jackman continues his reign as the best leading man in Hollywood (despite appearing in inferior product over and over again), and Alan Cumming (Nightcrawler) brings a dimension to the character that never came to fruition in the comic book's long history.The other ""actors"" aren't really actors at all. James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn- Stamos and Halle Berry are all former models that should've stayed in that profession instead of sullying this one. Famke Jennsen, another former model, is an adequate actress, but radiates none of the qualities that Jean Grey possesses in the comic (wise and commanding, she is the matriarch of the team).In the first film, the team seemed lost in their own story. Here, they're a little better off, but they all still seem a little insecure in those black, leather outfits. No one (including Singer) seems to be certain how to treat these characters. On one hand, we've got a somewhat realistic rendition of the superhero (bravo, for once), on the other hand, we're stuck with YET ANOTHER b-movie plot that involves the 'bad-guy' trying to do harm to the ENTIRE PLANET--just as Magneto did in the first film (well, he tried to change everyone in NYC into a mutant, which is about as plausible as the Black Panthers detonating a bomb to turn everyone Black.)In the end, this film looks and feels better than it actually is. You have to really pay attention to see how lame some of the scenes are, so here are a few examples I picked out for you:In the final act, Stryker becomes frantic when he learns that the damn is going to burst, and thus release millions of tons of water on his head and probably kill him (or something). Immediately after this revelation, we find Wolverine lurking through the same room where he gained his metal skeleton and claws. Stryker walks in with Lady Deathstrike and says something like: ""I thought you were the only mutant that had a healing factor.....I WAS WRONG!' (this is followed by Deathstrike popping her claws). Oohhh! This sets up the fight that ensues...and makes NO SENSE in the context that it takes place. Stryker just found out he has a limited amount of time to save his skin, so he takes a pause to dramatically introduce Deathstrike in the most cliché/summer movie way possible.Another: Wolverine is in the Weapon X facility with the team. He decides that he is going to take off his 'walkie-talkie' thing, and go 'search for his past' on his own. Someone turns around and notices he's gone. ""Where's Logan?"" Jean Grey then notices his walkie-talkie thing. She looks in the distance and says: ""...He's gone..."" OOOOOOHHHHH! It's so dramatic! So tragic! See, Jean's delivery of the word 'gone' implies a deep, metaphorical meaning to Logan's departure. And the metaphor is...NOTHING. It's nothing. It's all nothing.And one last thing: when is this stupid letter/number trend in movie titles going to end? T2 ID-4 MI:2 LXG et cetera, et cetera Not only are these titles annoying, they defeat the purpose of a movie's title in that they tell us NOTHING about the story, characters or genre. Wouldn't 'X-men: God Loves, Man Kills' been a far more descriptive, poetic and tantilizing title? (this is the title of the comic that the movie is partly based on).As long as Singer and his crew continue to mold the X-men films into the summer movie mold, these films will continue to fall short of their massive potential. For the real deal, I recommend 'The New X-men: E is for Extinction' by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely (Marvel Comics).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the best Superhero and Comic Book Movie Sequels of All Time!,"This was the first X-Men Movie that I ever watched and over the years I've constantly rewatched this movie whenever it aired on FX. As an adult, I've come to appreciate it more than I ever did as an adolescent.Positives for X2 (2003):
Similar to X-Men (2000), the story and characters is what makes this movie great. I still enjoy all of the returning characters as well as the new characters. I really enjoyed Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler to where he's one of those characters that you feel for whenever he explains his backstory. This movie did a phenomenal job at exploring the tragic past of Logan and how he became the way he is now through flashbacks and the character of William Stryker. Brian Cox as William Stryker is one of the best villains in any superhero and comic book movies. The way how he manipulates the events of this movie is so calculating and brilliant to make sure that he gets what he wants. Despite the fact that he plans on doing a worldwide genocide of mutants, he's also using mutants to help him achieve that goal. Similar to the first movie, there's a conversation between Nightcrawler and Mystique where they subtly hint that they're son and mother. I also liked how this movie was planting the seed for Jean Grey's Phoenix storyline throughout this movie. And finally, the action sequences in this movie are even better than the first movie.Negatives for X2 (2003):
Similar to X-Men (2000), I'm only pointing out these negatives because they'll definitely bother some fans of the X-Men. Similar to Tyler Mane's Sabretooth in the first movie, Kelly Hu as Deathstrike doesn't have any form of a personality. And finally, while I did enjoy seeing the movie planting the seeds for Jean Grey's Phoenix storyline, that buildup is all ruined by X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), so get ready for that rant.Overall, X2 (2003) is an Xcellent follow-up to X-Men (2000). This movie does what sequels are supposed to do and that's build upon the foundation of the original and expanding the story.

Surpasses the original,"This movie joins great company of The Empire Strikes Back, Attack of the Clones, LOTR: The Two Towers, Toy Story 2 and Superman II as a sequel that surpasses the original.  This is a great movie.  It advances the characters established in the original and gives them a greater challenge.  It also has new characters such as Nightcrawler to advance the plot. The story is terrific and does not simply repeat the plot of the first movie.  The actors, especially Hugh Jackman, are in fine form.

Surpasses the sequel; the best comic-book film I've seen,"While I enjoyed the first X-MEN, it just didn't feel enough like a full-length movie to me. There was a lot of material to introduce, there were several things that were unrefined and not as good as they could be, and I think this might have been because of the music, but the film just reeked of a typical action film style. It had a good story, and it was much more science fiction then action, but it felt too much like another action film. Bryan Singer's direction didn't have much style, it went by too fast, and there was just so much about it that made it feel incomplete and not really a movie. X2 solves all these problems.Loosely based on the X-Men book GOD LOVES, MAN KILLS, X2 raises the bar from X-MEN and goes above and beyond expectations. The film has much more style to it, it's longer, it feels more like an epic, and the action, special effects, story, characters, acting, direction, and music are all so much better than X-MEN. The film has spiritual messages within and maintains the underlying message of the X-Men universe; the irony and evil of racism and being against the very people who want to help you. As always, the X-Men are hated and feared by the world that they are sworn to protect. Unlike the first film, the X-Men fight not for humankind, but for their own kind.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Better than the Original,"The all-star cast enters again with a great sequel that talks about the same social problem of mutants vs. humans. That is not nearly as annoying as X-Men the Last Stand. The setting is the best part, Hugh Jackman is the main character as always with a bad*** suit. The whole first act is an awesome spectacle watching Magneto break out of jail (that's not a spoiler), Professor X and all the rest get more screen-time. I really feel that Wolverine's arc about finding out about his past in the three year gap between films was wasted. Rouge is easily the second best character for me she's really hot, Anna Paquin plays the character well just like the previous film. The whole dynamic with the younger X-men was interesting and made it stand out from the other superhero movies of this time period. The second act takes us to the dam and we spend the rest of the movie getting epic fight scenes, good philosophy, vengeance and fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Solid action storytelling with a bit of unfocus,"Actually finding a way to anchor this sequel's story in a single main character's journey was a smart move. The first film was weighed down by a certain directionlessness that made it feel like a random series of events before pulling most of it together for a decent climax. The sequel, not needing to explain nearly as much to its audience or characters, is able to find surer footing from which to tell its story. It's definitely a step up in storytelling with the spectacle gaining an appreciable budget increase as well, which was nice of Fox to provide.Some time after the events of the first film, the mutant problem has gotten more tense. Magneto may be under lock and key in his custom plastic prison, but the effort to spark the war between human and mutant still lives. This starts with the first scene, an absolutely bravura sequence of the teleporting mutant Nightcrawler attacking the White House set to the ""Deis Irae"" from Mozart's Requiem. The use of stunts, special effects, and editing makes this a great opening to the film, establishing the conflict and fear of the overall situation far better than Senator Kelly explaining that there's a girl who can walk through walls in the first film. This is the difference between exposition and using the tools of cinema to tell a story, and this is far more effective.Essentially, Colonel William Stryker is using the mutant situation to spark the war in a similar way as Magneto has always been expecting. Stryker is the ideal antagonist for this film. He's written as having direct ties to two main characters (Wolverine and Professor X), his plan is integrated in the base philosophy of the previous film's main antagonist, and he's played by Brian Cox. Cox, a Shakespearean trained English actor who has worked with the Royal Shakespeare Company, brings the exact right kind of presence to Stryker. He's maniacal, intelligent, driven, and vicious all at once. His manipulation of his own son for his own ideological gains is precise and focused in a way that sells the idea that Xavier killed his son in his mind, justifying the actions he takes. He's a well-written antagonist to begin with, but hiring an actor of Cox's caliber just made it better.However, the movie does still suffer from a certain directionlessness to a lesser degree that holds it back. There's a standout scene near the middle of the movie. Stryker has attacked Xavier's mansion (another very good action scene, by the way), driven out Wolverine, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro who decide to go to Iceman's parents' house outside of Boston. There, Iceman has to come out to his parents that he's not just going to a gifted kid's school, but he's a mutant. It's an entertaining little scene, gets turned into a police standoff by his younger brother's call to emergency services for reasons that are unclear (probably prejudice), they all get away, and then, well, Iceman largely disappears from the movie. Oh, he's there in the jet as the group flies to the third act, but he does virtually nothing for the rest of the film. The scene does have something to do with the central theme of finding a home, but because Iceman gets pushed so far for the rest of the movie and that scene was so specific to him, it ends up feeling like a weird extra scene rather than something integral. Nothing about the scene is particularly bad, but it just ends up feeling like it doesn't fit.Another thing that doesn't fit is the romance between Wolverine and Jean Grey. I've read that during filming of a key scene between the two the director, Bryan Singer, realized that it wasn't working so he had Wolverine just kiss Jean. I think the problem really is Wolverine himself. He's not wrong, but his sudden affection for a single woman feels out of character considering what's come before. The Wolverine who, until a few weeks before, was a loner wandering the wilds of Northwestern Canada refusing any kind of personal connection is suddenly completely smitten by Jean Grey for reasons. It just doesn't really work.Those are really the extent of my complaints, though. Centering the film so fully on Wolverine seems to retroactively justify his central presence in the first one to a degree. His past, enshrouded in mystery, gets answered to a certain amount through the plot mechanics involving Stryker. Stryker, who feels that mutation is a disease and is mad at Professor X for not saving his son from mutation, plans on using Professor X's mental abilities, enhanced by the large room Cerebro, to kill all the mutants on the planet. This is the kind of threat that brings together the old enemies of the past, uniting the X-Men with Magneto, but Magneto also has his own plan to turn the situation to his own advantage. This is all well laid out and executed stuff.What really makes it work, though, is Wolverine. He is our main window into this world, and his discovery is ours. Tying the whole plot to his emotional arc was smart. We are digging into his past, finding out that its filled with dark secrets and that he's a new man with the ability to move on. Stryker is a key to that past. The action takes place at the old location where Wolverine lost his past, but it also works as the kind of place that Stryker would take his off the books operation. It all fits together just so well.So, it's an imperfect film that delivers on its main promise while feeling oddly incomplete and unmerited in other, smaller ways. Perfectly well acted by everyone, in particular Brian Cox as Stryker, it's a fun adventure movie with a strong central throughline to hang most of the movie off of. A smaller cast of characters might have helped regain some focus in the middle section, though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The original set up an intelligent treatment focused on 'character'...,"... which the sequel then junked for the usual silly superhero theatrics and vapid set-pieces. Some people criticised X-Men because they thought it didn't have enough action - I liked that it focused more on 'dialogue' and 'mood'... X2 went too far in the opposite direction, for my liking. To put it into perspective, I also liked ""The Hulk"" for the same reasons most people hated it... ! The first installment was duty-bound to do sterling work establishing the players and examining their various back-stories. For the most part that isn't necessary here, and so I felt that it just wasn't dealt with satisfactorily AT ALL - even for party newcomers like Nightcrawler. Any trace of subtlety is pretty much swamped by the traditional gung-ho heroism now that the majority of the group know each other better.The many interesting relationships of the first (such as that between Wolverine and Rogue) are not given anywhere near the attention they deserve in order to cram in more physically astonishing feats. Your average teenage moviegoer will love this (as proved by the high rating here) but I've seen it all before; and to see the series regress to aping countless other summer blockbusters when it began by celebrating differences, (literally) was more than a little dispiriting to experience...",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The other X-men got time to grow a little more than they had in X-1.  But as I said this movie is too much Wolverine.As a Cyclops fan I wasn't too happy with such a smaller role than he had in X-men 1.It's still worth renting now as i think it's out of the movie house now.I'll have more good things to say than bad, so i'll just say it's a good watch.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I also enjoyed Kelly Hu's character, but was disappointed that she spent almost as much time cracking her knuckles as she did in the fight scene with Wolverine.

Not as great as it could/should be.,"Ok.  There's two ways to discuss this movie.  One is in reference to the comic book, and the other is to deal with the movie as if it were totally original.  I'll do both, and I'll try to be brief.-With the Comic Book in Mind:The movie is stretched out way too far, trying to keep up with the comic book as not to upset the millions of fans.  This is good, I suppose, but when the movie suffers to fit this bill, I say it's a bad thing.The movie is simply too long.  There are many scenes that I saw that could've been totally cut out.  It makes me afraid of what really WAS cut out.  And then there's scenes where just when the action is getting good, it cuts away, and then too much happens off-camera to be justified.The movie is simply too boring.  Total, there's got to be less than 15 minutes of fighting period.  Not good fighting, just fighting at all. This wouldn't be so bad in a 100 minute movie, but the movie is TWO AND A HALF HOURS LONG.  Not to mention that the comic book was indeed action packed, I just don't understand why they took the cheap route.  At the point that the movie's progressed to in the Wolverine saga, Logan is a very rough, very angry, very spontaneous guy.  In this movie, he's more like the leader of the group (which is supposed to be Cyclops, but oh well) making clear decisions, never really freaking out and killing anyone that he wouldn't have killed if he wasn't going nuts.  So sad.-The Movie as an Original Work:It's alright.  Not much action, viewers might be a little confused if they're not familiar with the Marvel Universe.  I doubt I can retain the count of unexplored characters on a fist.  Scenes seem to flow together nicely, aside from about five times.  Other than that, the movie was just way too long.  If they cut the crap out and just kept what we wanted to see in, perhaps taking this movie down to a little under two hours, and it'd be a great film.  I'm not sure if the series is that great for the theater, though.  Sure, it's great seeing these things on a big screen, but, there's way too much that they're trying to cram in.OVERALL: 7I'd give this movie a 7.  It's not bad, not at all.  Was it as good as it could have been?  Of course not.  Just don't think it's as great as everyone else seems to think.  Don't worry; it won't make you look dumb.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Good but X1 was better,"While a lot of people are giving the theatres a miss due to the SARS scare, X2 was a show that I just had to watch on a big screen.I was not disappointed...well, not that much anyways. X2 is a good show - the cast seemed to have more chemistry with each other (no less because most of them were cast from X1 reunited) and there were more action sequences. I was entertained throughout the show, which is a good thing.However, what I thought made X1 great was missing in X2 - the human aspect of the X-Men. While X1 was wonderful because of the relationship between Rogue and Wolverine, X2 suffered because of the lack of such a relationship. It came close though, through Storm and Nightcrawler, but unfortunately, this relationship did not get the amount of time that was given to the earlier relationship.Cast performance was not too shabby. While Hugh Jackman was decent, I somehow found his performance as Wolverine in the first installment better. To me, Wolverine epitomizes the devil-may-care attitude, besides brutal animal rage. While the latter was abundant in X2, Jackman as Wolvie in X2 was not so I-don't-give-a-damn. Perhaps this was due to the script. The person who stood out for me in X2 was Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler. Despite the tons of blue make-up on his entire body, not to mention the coloured lenses, he was able to portray the sensitive soul within a gargoyle-like body that is Nightcrawler. Ian McKellen continues to improve in his role as Magneto - somewhat more sinister (and more vulnerable) in X2 and less angry, compared to X1.On the whole, an enjoyable film on its own. As a sequel, it's not too shabby but I didn't think it was better than X1 (I'm betting that the Matrix sequels would be better than the original film though). Nonetheless, I look forward to further X-Men sequels, hopefully with better exploration of the human aspect of the mutants. I was thrilled on seeing Colossus...perhaps he'd become the focus of the next installment of the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
X2 - X-Men United - In-depth Comment!,"The sequel to X-Men is here and is arguably better than the first! Though I like both films and I can't decide which is better but both are great and that's awesome! The first was a dark and mysterious film and X2 is a thrilling action sequel! There are more characters in this one though Toad and Sabertooth are not in it but there are plenty of others that are just as cool! The music is by John Ottman this time around and not by Michael Kamen. People may think Ottman's score is more fitting for the sequel than what Kamen composed for the prequel but I think Ottman's score sounds similar like the original score by Kamen which in My opinion is good for the movie! The acting in the film is top notch and so is action and also the special effects! Below is an In-depth look at the characters of the film X2: X-Men United!The characters!Hugh Jackman as Wolverine - Still searching to find out who he is, Logan as he is called finds an empty base up in the great north but it appears empty as it hasn't been used for some time. Since the base is empty and his questions remain will this great fighter return to Professor Xavier back in the states and seek his help or will Wolverine search else where on his own?Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier - The powerful minded leader of the X-Men goes with Scott Summers to check on how Xavier's old friend Magneto is doing. How is he doing? Has anything gone wrong in Magneto's prison? If so will these two X-Men be able to handle it without the others?Ian McKellen as Magneto - Still imprisoned in his plastic jail, Erik Magnus Lehnsherr and the lovely Mystique are still partners from what is left of the Brotherhood of Mutants but will she be able to free Magneto?Brian Cox as William Stryker - This military leader has done some strange things and word has it that he has experimented on mutants? If this is true what kind of experiments were they? Is it possible that he responsible for Wolverine's uniqueness? Is he still active in his duties as of now? Is he a threat to mutant kind and if so will the X-Men be able to stop him?James Marsden as Cyclops - Still protective over his girl Jean Grey, Scott Summers prefers not to interact with Logan simply because Summers thinks that Wolverine wants Grey to but is this the case?Famke Janssen as Jean Grey - Jean Grey is more powerful minded now and her mind is almost as great as Professor X! If there is a time that the X-Men are in danger will she save the X-Men from an unspeakable situation?Halle Berry as Storm - The Egyptian beauty goes on a mission with Jean Grey on the X-Jet. When enemy jet fighters attack she produces incredible storms but will this be enough to stop the enemy?Anna Paquin as Rogue - Rogue has a more developed relationship with Iceman since time has gone on. Still wearing gloves since she cannot touch anyone and this makes her relationship with Bobby Drake difficult.Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique - The beautiful shape shifting Mystique is back and returns as Senator Kelly. The master metamorph changes into many others to her advantage. Does she and Magneto join their enemies? Since she fought and was defeated by Wolverine will she fight him again and have revenge or will she do something else? Does she have a relationship with Nightcrawler? Does she and Rogue have a relationship of some kind and if so what kind would Rogue have with the blue skinned beauty known as Mystique?Kelly Hu as Yuriko Oyama - The bodyguard like fighter for William Stryker is quiet but an incredible looking woman. Lady Deathstrike finally faces off with Wolverine and reveals that she is not afraid of him. She battles with each of her long extracted fingers of steel! She also has similar healing like her foe so how can he defeat a woman that has the same techniques as he, is more agile, and a more skilled fighter who knows martial arts?Shawn Ashmore as Iceman - An amazing mutant is Bobby Drake or Iceman as he wants to be called can freeze anything he wants with his hands. Though his relationship with Rogue is difficult but he loves her and will not let her mutant skills get in the way.Kea Wong as Jubilee - She can produce electricity from her hands but what else can Jubilation Lee do?Aaron Stanford as Pyro - John Allerdyce can control fire as a powerful weapon! When Magneto and Mystique arrive on the scene will Pyro join them or will he become a member of the X-Men but what has come to have him make such optional decisions?Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler - Born in Germany and raised by a Gyspy woman, Kurt Wagner went into the circus but when it changed to new ownership he then later was going to be put in a freakshow and he decided that is not his destiny. Even though this mutant known as Nightcrawler resembles a demon of ancient times he is quite peaceful and in fact studies to be a man of God. Wagner is very agile and is capable of teleporting from area to area. With his German accent and kind personality he joins Storm and Jean Grey onto their mission!Daniel Cudmore as Colossus - Piotr Nikolaievitch Rasputin who is also known as Colossus is a huge strong man and he has the ability to change his body into steel like covering. This steel also makes him have incredible strength!I love the X-Men films and I would really like this franchise to be a trilogy or even a saga! There is so much more that Bryan Singer can do with his projects especially since he has a great cast and knows how to make great movies!  I hope you have enjoyed this In-depth look at X2: X-Men United!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Not bad...except for Phoenix,"I liked the first X men.  I had my reservations b/c of the little things that we comic fans were griping about, but they did a pretty good job.  I didn't think that Halle Berry would be a good storm (too pretty, not regal enough) but I was wrong.  I thought that they picked a terrible actress for Jean Grey, and I was right.Which brings me to the sequel.  I can handle the black outfits (they actually look really cool, though a splash of yellow...maybe just the X symbol...wouldn't hurt.  I could handle the discrepancies between the film and comic book (accents, origins, and the like...after all, what fun would it be if we knew EXACTLY how it was going to turn out) but I cannot stand the horrible mistake they made in casting Famke as Jean Grey.  Not just in relation to her own role...but let's face it:  she looks like she's Scott's aunt, not his girlfriend.  And she lacks any of the sensual appeal that the character has.  Jean Grey is a knockout.  Famke is a pretty girl but more of a coutre model: skinny, no curves, that hard non-emotional look.  She'd make a great villain though, as seen in Goldeneye.  She just seriously stands out against the rest of the cast like a fish out of water.I didn't complain this badly for the review of the first film, but Jean plays a more important role in this movie so it bothered me more.Everything else was pretty awesome though.  I loved the plot, the rest of the cast were great, and I am really looking forward to seeing who's gonna pop up in the next edition.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Good Follow Up,"i wasnt ""Anxiously Waiting"" for X2 as i am a DC fan...(Batman can kick Wolvi's Tail)...But watching X2 was gr8 fun. A word for all the idiots who are comparing it to the previous movie are idiots.You dont compare a comic with its previous issue do you? Same is the case with the movie..The first established the characters and this went Forward with it.Not many ""Fight scenes"",but it was good the way it was. NightCrawler was Awsome,i hope he gets some more time in the next one, Kelly Hu's character was totally useless and unimpressive, her fight with Wolvi dint make sense.(i think they just included her to show that Wolv was a Lab Experiment gone wrong).Rouge,IceMan & Pyro were under used(They Were probably just being introduced in this one and Pyro was pretty impressive in his V.S Cops scene).....Magneto reminded us ""once a BaddY...Always a BaddY"" although Mystique was always Really CooL.And y dint they add the baddies from the first (i.e. Sabretooth,Toad & Storm???)? Toad was really kool and id love to see him go against NightCrawler.I nearly forgot...Jean's death was BAD and i never saw that coming, but   i dint see her character growing so i guess it was ok(maybe they bring a Kick @$$ character in the next)End: X2 was a great movie and for me it was a better movie than the first.it was more realistic and Quiet believable.Hope X3 does justice to this one and maybe even does one better like this one. its a 9/10 for me.. ....By the way ""Dint the Senator die in the first movie...",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A little disappointment,"First X-Men Movie was really great for the superhero motion picture. But, this sequel is a little disappointment to me. There are some impressive special effects. Especially opening scene with Nightcrawler is really memorable and well-directed, but most of action sequence is not as good as first one. But that's not a problem. I really don't like about X2 is vague plot and insensitive love stories. And I think Wolverine's storyline - especially about his past - should be better, too. Alan Cumming does a excellent job and Famke Janssen and Kelly Hu are also good to see. But Patrick Stewart, Anna Paquin and James Marsden are completely wasted here.

One of my favorite super hero movies,"X-2 is one of those rare sequels that outshines the original. I liked the original X-Men. While it was good, X-2, X-Men United is superb. It picks up where X-Men left off. Logan (Wolverine) is returning from his quest to discover his origin. Meanwhile, a new Mutant, Kurt Wagner (Nightcrawler) makes at attempt on the President's life. Enter Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox), who vows to stop the Mutants for good. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) asks for Dr. Jean Grey (Fahmke Jansen) and Storm (Halle Berry) to find this new mutant. Meanwhile, he must consult with his old nemesis, Eric Lynch, or Magneto (Ian McKellan). Dr. Xavier and Cyclops, aka Scott Sommers (James Masden) are captured by Stryker. At the same time, a hit squad goes after the young Mutants at Dr. Xavier's school. Barely escaping are Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Rogue (Amanda Paquin), Iceman, and Pyro. Then, Magneto escapes with the help of his co-hort, Mystique (Rebecca Rojmin Stamos). The plot may seem labyrinth, but it works well, again showing why Marvel superheros always outdid DC Comics. In the first place, Mavel characters are reluctant heroes, often having a downside to their power. Rogue can never touch another human being, isolating herself from others. Cyclops can never look at someone with his own eyes. Second, the Marvel superheroes are thrust into the real world. People fear them, hate them, and want them relegated to the fringe of society. The movie also goes deeper, cutting into society and their reaction to the Mutant ""threat."" In X-Men, the villain was Bruce Davison who plays a Senator reminiscent of Joseph McCarthy who used the Red Scare in the 1950's to alienate his enemies as ""Communists."" In X-2, the villain is Stryker. He does not want to use politics, he just wants to eradicate the Mutants--more like Slobodan Milosovec. The movie also takes the end of the struggle for equity. In both movie, it seems Dr. Xavier has the idealism and hope of Dr. Martin Luther King, whereas Magneto is a separatist who strikes back like Malcom X. Laced between the depth is a good-paced story with credible acting, good action sequences, and special effects that do not overshadow the story. The performances are another praise. James Marsden actually does a decent acting job as Cyclops. Ian McKellan is able to make the audience sympathize with Magneto, despite the character's cynicism and dubious methods. Brian Cox also does well as the real heavy. For a change, the villain is not over the top or a megalomaniac. He is the true, subtle type of evil--convincing himself he is doing society good. Rebecca Rojmin Staimos does her acting with her moves and stare--emitting a subtle, yet powerful evil. On the other hand, Alan Cummings gives us a Mutant who not only has a love of life, but also a faith that does not come off as self-righteous or preachy. X-2 may lack a beginning, middle, and end, but it works so well as a great superhero movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Τhe mutants are back...,"""X2"" is the sequel of ""X-Men"" and in this movie X-Men trying to find a mutant assassin who has tried to kill the President of United States. In the meanwhile the Mutant Academy is attacked by military forces and X-Men can not do anything to stop this.I liked this movie because of the interpretations of Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen and Brian Cox. I also liked it because of the story which so nice continues and it combines the history of X-Men with their evolution.Finally I strongly recommend not only this movie but all the X-Men series because it's really good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Beyond Silly,"Sorry fans, it quite simply was just too silly.  Wolverines character was fine, but magneto looked as threatening as my grandma.  Couldn't get into it.  I felt the action went way overboard and I had a hard time understanding why cyclops was all but absent from the film when he was the most intriguing of all x-men characters in the comic.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
If only all sequels could be like this...,"Considering what happened with the Batman series, particularly after Tim Burton left, and considering what has happened in plenty other comic book adaptations such as Spider-Man or Daredevil, nobody would be blamed for having bet that an X-Men sequel would be a disaster. But X2: X-Men United, as it is billed here, is a sequel that can be mentioned in the same breath as Aliens or The Godfather Part II.Like the original, this new sequel has something to say about how our society deals with people who don't look the same, act the same, think the same, or feel the same as all the drones out there. The spirit of the comic books it is based on is very much alive in this film, and that's a big part of what makes it such compelling viewing. In today's society, people with a serious mental illness will be rooting for characters like Wolverine, or Magneto if they have a sadistic side, all the way. In tomorrow's society it could be people who undergo genetic engineering to rid themselves of cancer or other horrible diseases. Who knows? That's the truly sad part of these stories - they only seem to either stay relevant or get more relevant as time goes on.Ian McKellen is in fine, fine form as Magneto, the angry mutant whose justification for waging war on ""normal"" society is all but handed to him on a platter in this episode. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos actually gets to do something other than sit there and look pretty this time, and Halle Berry proves once again that she cannot act her way out of a wet paper bag. But once again, Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin steal the show, in spite of the latter having a significantly reduced role compared to the first film. Shawn Ashmore also squeezes his head in and manages to prove he is there for a reason, too.Unlike the original X-Men, in which the true bad guys are mostly undefined except for a rather nasty Senator, one will not be able to walk out of X2 without pathologically hating the bad guys here. Brian Cox plays the mad general so well that anyone with a truly compassionate bone in their body will want to leap into the picture and tear the head off the kind of man who could do THAT to his own son. And the film is all the stronger for it, because it brings the message that the normalists who would give us all gene tests when deciding who should live or die are the real bad guys, not the mutants who have been made bitter and angry by their behaviour. I know a whole family of utter creeps who would do well to be nailed into a chair and forced to watch this film with their eyes pried open, Ludivico-style.I won't say anything about the ending except for two small points. One is that it makes Ray Park's line in the first film (""Don't you people ever die?"") seem all the funnier, except it really isn't the sort of point where one should laugh. I did, but that is just the kind of person I am. The other is that it proves anyone in this film can out-act Halle Berry, even another former Bond girl, in this case Famke Janssen. She gives the film an end-sequence of the kind that I've only seen in other films like Gladiator and Rollerball (the real Rollerball, I mean).To summarise, out of 125 minutes of near perfection, I have only three minor complaints. The editing of the final battle sequence, particularly when Patrick Stewart is in the new Cerebro, is a little too loose for my liking. Parts seem to have been repeated just to stretch out the running time. I also found Nightcrawler's constant prayer recitals annoying. If this was supposed to enforce the idea of Christian good guys, it doesn't work because we've seen before how their kind are little different from the William Stryker caste. Lastly, they really should have got someone other than Halle Berry to play Storm. I don't care who, just anyone. She is the biggest personality vortex I have ever seen on the big screen, and I kept expecting Anna Paquin to turn to her and say ""I *earned* my Oscar"".But at the end of the day, I wish all sequels could be as good as this effort. Ten out of ten from me. It did lose a point because of the things I mentioned in the previous paragraph, but it gains it back (and then some) whenever Hugh Jackman or Anna Paquin say something. Those two should work together more often.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Could still be better, but overall: much better then 1!","Alright, still missing a few things, but just looking at the movie for what it is it was great! The characters seem a bit more comfortable in the yummy leather and the special effects were good. The story line was kind of the same as one, but it was made up for by the more in-depth view into the characters. Also note the perfect music.First off: POSITIVES!:What I loved most about this movie were the new characters. Even though some were only seen for a mere minute they were there! Pyro, Lady Deathstrike, Jublee (!), Colossus and of course Nightcrawler.Having never read the comics and seeing just a few ep's of the TV-series I only knew Nightcrawler for the X-men teens series. He was young then and I don't remember him being German or religious either, but at least I recognized him right away. And I loved it. Nightcrawler is one of the best characters as far as I'm concerned, and as far as powers go, even as a child I wanted his. And of course the black clouds of smoke as he teleported were incredible! And of course applauding the make-up artists whom did his tattoo's. They are really beautiful.Pyro I already knew, and I knew he would cross over. Still it was nicely done ('What is your real name John?') Same with Jean Grey. Can't WAIT to see her as Phoenix! Femke is a good actress, but she just doesn't really *get* Jean. Jean has always been a matriarch, a leader next to Charles Xavier. She seems to focus just a bit too much on her insecure side.The story in itself builds on on Wolverine's past. From what I know about the comics, Wolverine has always been one of the characters (if not THE character) that kept the story going. People seem to love him and I can't blame them honestly. The part with the wolf was pretty, but I had a tomb raider flashback right away humAs far as the story goes it's good, with the added bonus that the two parties have to work together to defeat the new bad guy. Oh and of course NO ONE saw the stab in the back coming :P. A bit overly done but the scene where Storm comes to save the day eventually is great . ('Daddy is gonna be so mad').Another note I'd like to make is Iceman. His part was much larger in this movie and he is a great character. As a lesbian I recognized a LOT in the talk with his mom. Especially the 'Have you every tried not being a mutant?' part was memorable.Now on to: NEGATIVE PARTS!:Alright, my first one is this:WHY DOES EVERYONE ALWAYS HAVE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE!!???I mean seriously I get the bobby/Rogue thing and find it mighty cute. I was already used to the whole Logan/Jean/Cyclops thing and this time it was funny.But STORM/NIGHTCRAWLER???!!!WHY???!!!WHY!!!O_0'-_-''Okay, sorry. Calming downBut really, why does everyone always have to fall in love? I'm all for love, but gosh you just can't pass the girls from one to the other Okay, enough of thisBeside the whole love thing there were a few parts over the top. Just about every fighting scene by Wolverine was ridiculous! He is a powerful character, I agree, but this? NahMagneto and Xavier had the same trouble. Extracting the iron from someone's blood and then making not one but three balls out of it? Hum I don't think so but well, I can deal. Just as the knowledge that Xavier is so powerful that he can kill anyone on this planet. The movie just looses some points for it.I don't remember how, but I remember Lady Deathstrike and I was Marjory disappointed. Beside her amazing looks and VERY yummy nails she had NOTHING going for her. She had ONE line, to the guy taking out the trash (To her knowledge) and beside that she could have just as easily been a zombie.Overall I would give this movie an 8 out of 10.Next time more Jublee, colossus, and maybe more Kitty. Also I would love some other characters like Psylocke or The Blob ^_^",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
One of the first great movie of 2003!,"I got the chance to see the new x-men during a preview for the journalists. I am also a journalist but working for an internet website.So what about the movie? Just have to say : WOW! The sequel is better than the first one, that I also like very much. It has excellent scenario, great characters development and of course, spectacular action sequences... but it never loses the emotions and the lyricism that comes from the story. In fact, it is actually very moving... And I don't want to ruin your pleasure talking about the ending...The new characters (especially The NightCrawler) are great and looks wonderful on the screen. The directing of Director Bryan Singer is the same as the first one and the actions sequences are even better because it has much energy and punch... Don't miss the combat between Logan and DeathStrike!The movie has also a very interesting message under all the blockbuster and entertainment with reminiscences about politics, socials and war. It can contents all the stuff to fulfill any kind of audience.For my pleasure, the great composer John Ottman takes the place of Michael Kamen for this sequel and writes a FAN-TA-STIC score... With a large orchestra, chorals and his magnificent direction the music of X2 is both martial and emotionnal... And i don't tell anything about the use of classical music in certain sequences.

I can see X5 or X6 in the pipeline,"An enjoyable sequel, this movie kicks right off where the last one ended and seems to be developing itself into a franchise of films much like Star Wars. It will probably live under the shadow of The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions this year but I think the best is yet to come from the X-Men. The casting for the film is excellent and provided they can continue to coordinate the schedules of all the actors it would be great to see them in action in further sequels. This film stands out among the Matrix-wannabes and I admire it for not resembling the Matrix in any sense other than the black suits. So if you want to see an intelligent sci-fi flick and you're sick of hearing about the Matrix, give this one a look, it might just be better than the Matrix.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Superior to the first film!,"When we left the X-Men in the first movie, Magneto was caught and placed in a plastic prison and Wolverine was leaving Professor Xavier's school for mutant children in a search for answers to his past. We are now re-united with the X-Men in the second film of what looks to become a series in `X2: X-Men United.' 	This is the first of many sequels due out during the 2003 summer box-office season. One thing may make this film stand out among every other sequel this summer-the fact that it's very good. In fact, `X2: X-Men United' is the rare case in which a sequel didn't follow the conventional clichéd patterns that so many sequels do by rehashing everything the first film; thus, the reason why sequels are generally inferior movies when compared to their predecessors. 	The story centers on Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) seeking clues to his past-an experiment that left his skeleton covered in a very strong metal. And of course, this metal makes his character more deadly considering the fact that he has blades that protrude from his knuckles whenever he senses danger. But things change for all mutants when a mutant assassin named Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), tries to kill the president in protest of a Mutant Registration Act.' This attempt only increases the fear that many have for the mutants and leads a military leader named William Stryker (Brian Cox) to lead a campaign against the mutants, beginning with Professor Xavier's school. It's now up to all mutants, be they friend or foe, to unite against an enemy that could eliminate all mutants. 	It's clear that director Bryan Singer (`Apt Pupil,' `The Usual Suspects') had more freedom in the production. The film is longer than the first film by about 30 minutes. What's more, it isn't as flashy as the original film. Point in fact; it is a far darker tale that leaves its central characters in the worst possible situation, a rule that is often ignored in sequels or trilogies. 	I did like the fact that this film united all mutants, putting aside their differences in an attempt to save their race. After seeing the first `X-Men,' I felt that there were some gaps in the dialogue, and the film quickly moved from one scene to the next. But that complaint was minor, as the first film was rather impressive. Nonetheless, `X2' is more than a worthy sequel; filled with great action sequences along with impressive visual effects that it doesn't rely on to tell the story, it's arguably better than the first film. Patrick Stewart (`Conspiracy Theory') returns as Charles Xavier, as does Ian McKellen (`Gods And Monsters') as Magneto. Anna Paquin (`25th Hour') returns as Rogue who takes Iceman's breath away, played by Shawn Ashmore. Aaron Stanford (`Tadpole') ignites the screen as Pyro. Dr. Jean Grey, played by Famke Janssen (`Goldeneye') tries to avoid temptation with Wolverine, while Scott Summers, played by James Marsden (`Gossip') tries to control his temper with Wolverine. And of course, the X-Men wouldn't be complete without Storm, played by Halle Berry (`Monster's Ball'), around to wreak havoc.Released on what has become the typical starter weekend of the summer box-office, `X2' looks to become a huge smash hit with early weekend estimates predicting the film to make nearly $86 million in nationwide ticket sales.  It's not as large as last year's magnanimous opening weekend for `Spider-Man,' which made $114 million, but it is doubtful that Twentieth Century Fox will be complaining much about the success of the film.`X2: X-Men United' is a true blockbuster that is a real crowd-pleaser in which it is difficult to find something to criticize. ***",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Mutants United,"Bryan Singer returned to direct this sequel that sees the same cast returning to battle new threats from Magneto (Ian McKellen) & William Stryker(played by Brian Cox) a human military leader who is determined to defeat the mutants, and who has a personal reason for doing so. After one mutant called Night Crawler nearly kills the President, Stryker is emboldened to invade Professor Xavier's(Patrick Stewart) school, forcing Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) to lead some students to freedom, though the threat from Stryker forces an uneasy alliance with Magneto(who has escaped from his plastic prison) and his mutants(like Mystique) in order to defeat Stryker, though this mission will have devastating consequences for both Cyclops(James Marsden) & Jean Grey(Famke Janssen)...

Not as good as the first,"First things first.... why does everyone hate michael kamen so much? i loved his score, sure it didnt have big fanfares but i thought it was terrifically thrilling and moody. i didnt pay so much attention to john ottoman's score, i was just disappointed to hear different opening title musicSecond i though the first movie was superb, it was much more than just a comic adaption, it was a really well done story about wolverine with a brilliant bad guy like magneto. the police standoff in the first movie is, thankfully, matched by magneto's feature scene in this movie :)This film was what i expected, it cut loose on the tight plot of X1. While it did deliver on most of the characters, i certainly agree the nightcrawler and wolverine sequences were spectacular, i thought there were too many plot holes.the kindof 'the cell' sequence with professor x at the end was well done and very spooky but i didn't feel like it fit. it was very heavy. on the other hand magento's recruitment of pyro was trite. pyro reminded me of anakin in epII, a whingy little arrogant crapster, hollywood needs to get more sorted out about what turns people to evil - i think they should be just driven and passionate and cunning like magneto himself, or oppressed and exiled like mystique. spoiled childs are evil but not because they choose to be.i never really read or watched the comic, so i don't have any expectations for the characters. thus i didnt really care that cyclops was missing, although he could be a lot more useful than he has been so far. but storm seems like such a lame duck, they have to come up with the most contrived excuses to use her.anyway i can't say i wasn't impressed. go and have a look. but don't expect no1 again.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Now, This is more like it!","X2 (2003) We all wonder about that old saying, are sequels better than the first? Most of the time, no. However this time, yep. Better. Far better.X2 has what X-Men did not, character development. despite being introduced to so many new mutants, we learn about them and their personality. We learn more about Wolverine who has a clue about his past that is more complicated than ever. Who is he? What happened?We meet another mew one in Pyro. He seems a little cocky and explains his unique power. Another(and personal favorite)is Nightcrawler. He nearly assassinated the president and has no idea why he attempted something like that. The fights at the white house were spectacular to behold. The visuals alone will no doubt keep you entertained.We still don't know much about Mystique but she does show a little character and is used much better here. The turn of events in the movie force the X-Men to unite with the Brotherhood to stop a problem that is calculating and cold.Enter William Stryker. A mystery himself. Played by Brian Cox, expect a good performance no doubt. He is rather sadistic and has a purpose and will do anything to fulfill that agenda. Anything.The only drawbacks here is that Cyclops is M.I.A. though a lot of the movie, and Lady Deathstrike. Well casted by Kelly Hu is naturally awesome, but has no dialog at all. No story. Monster disappointment.X2 is certainly better than X-Men. The battles here are far superior than the first. the special FX are awesome, and character development is here!The Last Word: X2 is awesome.

Much Better Than The First,"This X-Men movie is great from beginning to end. The story was great, the fights were perfect, the characters were interesting, everything had a purpose, and it left you wanting more.This being a sequel definitely had an advantage over the first in the series due to the fact that the characters did not have to be introduced. Instead, the main arc of the story could take off right from the get go.Nightcrawler looks great and they did a wonderful job with the CGI of his teleportation ability.One of the only problems with this movie is that there are so many characters for a two hour film that all could not be included. Instead of having something going on, Cyclops had to spend most of the movie knocked out somewhere. I know I'm in the minority here, but personally I could have watched a four hour movie with a grandiose story which included all characters containing sub-stories for each to be occupied with. But I definitely know that most people have no desire to watch an extra long X-Men movie like that.I did enjoy ""The Last Stand"" a bit more than ""X2"", but that is by a very small margin.

Fan Boy Heaven,"What a nice surprise, it's good to see a sequel surpass it's predecessor on screen and that is exactly what X2 has done.  This is more of an Empire Strikes Back version of X Men which works very well and leaves us gagging for more.The sequel actually had more financial backing than the original which helped Mr Singer achieve some more fancy effects that were missing from the first film.  Without these effects we would never have seen Nightcrawler realised in quite the same way that he has been in this movie.  From one of the opening scenes (attack in the White house) you are just hooked. Nightcrawler teleporting from room to room kicking some serious can was fantastic, a great energy filled start to a great film.We see a lot more of Wolverine in this film too and add to his mysterious background.  We also see him a lot more aggressive (which lets face it is what he is meant to be).  A few cameos are thrown in for us fan boys in the form of Beast (well the human form at least), Gambit (although it was only his name that we got to see), Colossus, Shadowcat, Syren, Leech among others.Another great thing about this movie is the switch of roles performed by some of the characters, we actually have Magneto charging into battle leading the X-Men to stop Prof. X from killing everyone!For all those who are not followers of the comics, there are bound to be a few key points that will confuse them, like the appearance of the Phoenix, but when they bring out X3 (lets hope) all will be revealed, they can't leave it like this, can they?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Good stuff if you like comic books.,"""X2"" tells another tale about our favorite mutants and a few new ones too but it's not likely anyone is really going to care about the story.

In other words, it's a good flick for younger audiences, comic book freaks, and the like. Personally, I grew utterly bored with it and gave up about 10 minutes before the end.

We will be watching.,"X2 is directed by Bryan Singer who co-wrote the story with David Hayter & Zak Penn. The screenplay is jointly written by Hayter, Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty, and the source material, Uncanny X-Men was by Stan Lee & Jack Kirby. Cinematography is by Newton Thomas Sigel and the music score is provided by John Ottman; who also edits the film. The ensemble cast features amongst others, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, Famke Jansen, Halle Berry, Alan Cumming, Anna Paquin, Brian Cox, Rebecca Romijn, James Marsden and Kelly Hu. It is the sequel to the financial and critically successful X-Men released in 2000.Plot, in short, sees Colonel William Stryker (Cox) declare war on all mutants: especially the X-Men superhero group. This forces Xavier's (Stewart) army to do the unthinkable; join forces with arch enemy Magneto (McKellen). But there is many perils in the way, and some murky pasts and future decisions are about to be unleashed into the maelstrom.It has often been the source of much debate and musings, the old general feeling that sequels tend to be rubbish. While that is largely true as a whole, the niche that encompasses the superhero adaptation can rightly claim to have dispelled that argument in the last ten years or so. In fact many would argue that Superman II, Batman Returns & Blade II are better film's than the lead off picture that went before them, thus giving ""the superhero sequel is better"" debate more longevity of reference. Think Spiderman 2, The Dark Knight and, yes, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, and it's good grounds to believe that the mention of a superhero sequel no longer brings apprehension and dread: but hope and a belief that directors can now improve on that first touchy feely franchise starter. Which is where X2 comes in, a film that is not only one of the best superhero sequels ever, it's also one of the best sequels ever, period.In the three year gap between the first film and this sequel, Singer has had time to broaden what was appealing in that first film, whilst also getting a longer running time and a bigger budget to do the job right. The end result is a film that in every department improves upon its predecessor. The returning characters, except for Marsden's Cyclops, get more depth and time on screen, and the new characters that come and join in the mêlée, also bring with them truly great rewards. None more so that Cumming's delightful teleporting mutant, Nightcrawler, who gets to open the film up with a jaw-dropping sequence, that not only introduces us to a great new character, but also lets us know that Singer has mastered the art of shooting action. Yes it's that good. On the enemy side of things; Cox as Stryker is wickedly nasty and Kelly Hu's deliciously named Lady Deathstrike is a worthy opponent for Wolverine. Ah yes, Wolverine. As with the first film, Wolverine, beautifully essayed by the charismatic Jackman, is the core character thread. We like that he gets to kick more ass this time, that he is doing it with more back story, and in a state of anger and confusion, only serves to entertain more. Into the pot also goes the Junior X-Men, with Pyro (Aaron Sandford) & Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) joining Rogue (Paquin) for some mutant angst.There's a lot going on, but it's easy to follow and all the ingredients come together smartly. It's a credit to Singer and his writing team (and Ottman's editing) that even tho there's much in the pot it still feels lean and brisk, and, that continuity from the first film has been easily attained. The thematics have remained dark edged (hatred of minorities/alienation etc), but the film is not without humour either. While the effects are stylish and the set-pieces scintillating. Singer was saying during production that he felt The Empire Strikes Back was his marker for X2; that his film is worthy of being spoke of in the same sentence is the highest accolade we can give it. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

X Men Unleashed,"I would say that when you create a reality with so many people with special powers, you have to live in it.  In other words,  you have to deal with the real possibilities each mutant has.  If you were to make a movie depicting the consequences of said powers,  it would have to be epic, with mutants making trouble all over the place.  Or battling one power against anothers. In this case, Bryan Singer does exactly that.  It reminds me of Superman 2, where the 3 villians discover that they can control the world.The special effects are flawless, the action is furious, the characters are explored and are mostly convincing.  The story feels like it benefited from some re-writes.  There are disturbing correlations with registering mutants with the latest homeland security measures dealing with terrorism.  Even the Special Ops forces storming the X Men's school grounds,  looks eerily like footage from the Iraq conflict.  This makes the film all the more resonant.Only a few complaints.  The movie tracks in at 2 hours and 15 minutes,  and feels about 15 minutes too long.  The third act gets a little discombobulated with the twisty turny endings that seem to be all the rage these days.  Why do filmmakers feel the need to pile more and more plot points in the third act?  Perhaps they are afraid that the 3rd act is weak, and they need to add more story elements to confuse you.  Please please please trim down the convoluted endings!   There have been many duds released lately (Basic, Identity, The Recruit),  that have been condemned by critics for deteriorating into utter nonsense.The other somewhat disturbing aspect of the movie is Wolverine's violent blade-wielding attacks on said Special Ops, and other normally good guys. Remember Terminator 2?  Great care was taken to keep the film on a comic book level by only slightly injuring the innocents (police and bystanders), and not worrying about the negative reaction to a high body count. Wolverine is not a nice guy here.I give this film a 7 out of 10.  I will probably go see it again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Still Marvel's greatest achievement,"Seemingly using the first film to practice big-budget movie-making, Bryan Singer followed the mediocre X-Men (2000) with X2 (one of many dodgy titles attributed to the film), a balls-out, mutant mash-up full of genuine characters focus, an intriguing storyline, and set-pieces worthy of the money it earned. In fact, the opening scene, which depicts newcomer Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), a mutant with a forked tail and the ability to teleport, attack a small army of helpless government agents to get through to the President, blows anything the first film had to offer right out of the water.With mutant antagonist Magneto (Ian McKellen) imprisoned in a plastic cell, Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is focusing his time on helping the maturing students at his school for gifted youngsters. He has sent Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to Alkali Lake, in the hope of helping him discover more about his past, but he finds nothing but an abandoned military base. After the attack on the President, government operative William Stryker (Brian Cox) leads an attack on the unsuspecting Xavier's school, capturing Xavier and Cyclops (James Marsden) in order to strengthen his mysterious plans.The plot summary is as compressed as can be, as, like the first film, X2 has a lot of big personalities with big, special powers with their own individual stories to tell to cram into a two-hour film. Although there are mutants with far more interesting powers and greater physical potential, the focus remains on the fan-favourite Wolverine. It's Jackman's enigmatic performance that makes him so easily likable, and he is finally allowed to roam free here. There are no soft fights where nobody dies as in X-Men; Wolverine massacres many of Stryker's men during the attack on the school. When he first drives his claws into an agent who makes the mistake of firing on him, it is the first of many air-punching moments throughout the film.It's hard to fathom a threat that could actually make a dent in a race of people with such unbelievable powers, so Stryker, a man with no liking for mutants but a fascination with harnessing their powers, has found a way to subdue them. Seeing a mutant like Magneto so helpless is oddly affecting, so, after his spectacular prison break-out, he becomes a sort of anti-hero, doing the kind of dirty work Xavier would not lower himself to. But ultimately, it's the Xavier-Magneto good vs. evil fight that remains the most fascinating, and even with Stryker playing the main villain, Magneto is far from forgotten and has plans to bend Stryker's actions to his own personal gain.It's a shame then that X2 marks the high-point of the series. There is now a remarkable 7 instalments set in the X-universe, and although X- Men: First Class (2011) injected some life back in the series, and hopes are high for the new X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014), none have come close to the kind of energy and invention of this. Though you could complain about the lack of a coherent narrative, and that some of the minor characters are left out to dry, X2 is a near-perfect superhero movie, and is still Marvel's greatest achievement. And with almost 15 years of men in tights and capes, that is high praise indeed.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Good sequel, but not great","X2 is definitely better than the original, but considering that the original had as much excitement as watching paint dry, that's not too much of an improvement, is it? Still, for a big budget Hollywood movie, X2 is strangely dull. The only bright spot is when Wolverine destroys STryker's soldiers in the X-Mansion. The rest of the movie is about 30 minutes too long. And boy, did the ending drag on forever! I was ready for this film to end about 30 minutes before it finally did.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
X2 Review,"The first X-Men film presented a grand cast of iconic heroes in a troubled world; their heroics would only become grander and more complex in the continuing conflict. Bryan Singer's second X-Men film carries over everything that made the first film great, and still manages to cram in a whole lot more.The action in X2 is phenomenal. The film starts off with one of the most elegantly-staged fight scenes on film. Shortly thereafter, the film rolls ahead with a constant series of fights and flights; among the most inspiring of scenes, Storm takes out a pair of jets with tornadoes, and Pyro goes berserk against a police squad. The entire last half of the film takes everybody to Alkali Lake, for a massive cascade of impressive action, including a great fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike, Magneto wreaking havoc with the military, and Cyclops blowing things up. The whole time, all life on Earth remains at stake. It all reaches its apex with an awesome dam burst sequence, the likes of which could put the scenes in Superman: The Movie to shame.Despite having so much, the film never feels overblown or convoluted; it all flows very sublimely, and gives just enough room for the story to unfold and breathe a little. Characters shine a little better than before, and more attention is given to the lesser players. Some of the strongest moments include revelations concerning Wolverine's character. The film also digs up enough background on the villain, Colonel Stryker, and his situation to give the evil plot more relevance and depth. It all ties into the grander scheme of showing a world struggling against mutant prejudice, and thanks to the characters and their interactions, it remains a compelling struggle.This film is made with fantastic photography and editing. Acting is great from the whole cast: Hugh Jackman continues to excel as Wolverine, while Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, Brian Cox, and everybody else remains solid. Writing is not bad. This production uses great-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects are generally good, but are aging a little. John Ottman's music score is great.X2 is a perfectly-balanced sequel with fantastic action scenes, but still gives a good amount of attention to the story and characters. In spite of this, it is a massive step up from the first film, and remains one of the best sequels since T2.Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Damn, disappointing","So disappointing! I loved X Men, but what the hell happened on X Men 2? In the name of ""development"" all the original X Men characters were merely stretched, then lost. All mystery in any of their characters was gone, spelled out on the screen in neon lights and boring stereotypes. X Men 1 was utterly engaging; number 2 was kind of disgusting. When a movie shows all the cards of all the characters it feels a bit like seeing all of your acquaintances in the nude. Where's mystery? What can we possibly talk about now that will top what I've just seen? Possibly a large part of these problems came from having to squish character ""development"" in amongst the over-worked plot and gratuitous action sequences. I love action, but I demand a certain level of motivation and tension which this film just didn't manage to provide. Singer has lost his way on this one, sorry :-(",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"God, anyone who doesnt like it should die","I was privelidged to be at the first public screening of x-men 2. Well i was excited about this movie, i loved the first one, i thought it was a great film, entertaining, had its own tone, and had wolverine. As an X-men fan or fanboy of comics, i usually love these films but i also have great expectations but am always satisfied, cos i know i cant do any better. I thought what the first one lacked even though it didnt really bother me, was that it didnt have enough comic book elements, it didnt feel totally like x-men, whereas spiderman felt like reading 70's spiderman comics, and daredevil felt like reading frank miller era daredevil. There wasnt enough berserker rage, wolverine said bub twice and you couldnt hear it. Cyclops didnt have that leadership aspect. Well there was fan response, and it wasnt backlash, it was just suggestions to make the next film better and more entertaining, Bryan Singer being an x-men fan, listened to these suggestions and went one step further, not only including all of them but delving deeper into the comic and making it one of the greatest adaptations ever. Fans complained that there wasnt enough berserker rage, it needed a deeper background story and more violence. Woaahh Bryan Singer does listen.The story is great, the script is uber strong and it flows amazingly. But in adaptations of comics its about visuals and characters. The camera shots are unbelivable and perfect, the effects are God. So yeah the whole film aspect is amazing. But were gonna look at the comic side.We get a new character nightcrawler(who is in one of the greatest opening sequences ever in film, mix matrix and marvel), we dwell deeper into the lead characters of the first film(wolverine,storm,jean, prof x) and we focus alot more on the minor characters of the first film(iceman,pyro). we also get villains, stryker a militant mutant hater and lady deathstrike(a female esque version of wolverine, who in the comic was partially cyborg like) and the return of the mutant malcom x - magnetoThe film is great in bringing the characters to life, also including alot of wit and humour, alot with wolverine. But a big impact is the amount of violence, taken up a big notch, its x-men in full glory. Not witholding what wolverine can and will do.Wolverine clearly steals the film again because even though there is a little less focus on him, his character is so strong but also due to Jackmans amazing and perfect portrayal of wolverine. He looks like he could kill you and take on an army, which is what i loved, apart from being way more buff than the first film, we get my favourite aspect, berserker rage, this comes into full effect when strykers team invade the mansion and bang! wolverine goes off. Screaming and aggressive fighting with unquestioned stylistic brutal killings, wolverine is what he is supposed to be. BrutalThe film also includes alot more of jean grey and for the next film we are shown that it involves mainly her as phoenix which is also in this film.Even though cyclops isnt that involved, his character is so much better than the first, he is cyclops.An amazing aspect of the film and script is the amount of great ideas they had in mutant powers, the way they can use them and the way they are shown, such as magneto extraditing iron from a guards blood. Its total post 90's X-men.For an adaptation to be amazing, it needs to be faithful to the comic, it needs to be entertaining, and it needs to flow like a comic. Whereas books are more direct, X-men has more than 40 years of narrative so only the main and important aspects are needed. Spiderman went godlike and did it perfectly. Daredevil went even further and might as well of been written by Frank Miller. X-men 2 is its own film but the triumph of the film is that it feels like X-men. So go watch it Bub.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
X-men films: The highs!!,"X-men was a revolutionary idea and I personally think the films do them complete justice. The effects have been astounding and with such a variety of powers to express it would undoubtedly be a difficult task to demonstrate all these realistically.Although the absence of certain characters, like Gambit, Ms. Marvel (who Rogue gets her additional powers from), Jubilee etc, has been a great concern for X-men fans, I seriously doubt that 'X-men: the last stand' will be the last film dedicated to this band of amazing superheroes and even amazing villains! I know there's a spin off with Logan but as far as I know that is the only information they have released as of yet although there are rumours that one of the people on the set have released that the x-men trilogy is just a small section of the many x-men films to come.This is understandable as many of the x-men comics were in different stages e.i. Apocalypse, Pheonix, the Future etc.In all I am looking forward to these films greatly, above all anticipating (hopefully) Rogue's encounter with Ms. Marvel and also Gambit's appearance! Although I respect Everyone's opinion, I do think some of the comments left have been badly supported. X-men was always going to be a complicated film to explain and express to an audience but I doubt it could have done better!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Duly impressed,"I thought that X2 far surpassed the original film.  I was expecting more of the same going in, and instead got everything better.Obviously, the action was hard to miss.  The opening sequence with Nightcrawler lifted my heart.  He's always been one of my favorite mutants, and I'm glad that Bryan Singer and his team did him justice.  Thoroughly beautiful effects, and brilliant choreography.  While arguably the best (or at least the coolest), it was by no means the last action scene in the movie.  Wolverine, Yuriko, Mystique, and Nightcrawler all show us what they're made of with some flashy hand-to-hand (or claw) fight scenes. Magneto and Jean definitely flaunt their powers, again with some quality special effects to back them up.The thing that most surprised and impressed me, however, was the character development.  That had been my chief complaint with the first movie: I thought that a lot of the characters went in the wrong direction.  Almost all of them were considerably more fleshed out in this movie.  Notable exceptions are Rogue and Magneto, but this is because of the considerable background that they got in the first movie.  I thought Mystique got some more of the treatment she deserved: she became a true character, instead of just one of Magneto's tools.   With that came a chance to show off her mutant abilities to a much higher degree than before.  Storm's character was played down, but I maintain that it had been overplayed in the first and that she had gotten much more attention that she merited.  Cyclops changed little, but he was noticeably absent for most of the movie.  I'm not complaining though, because he was always a whiny little snot.  It was good to see the new characters lurking in the mansion.  Let's hope that some of them (Colossus, Shadowcat) come out in the future.So what about the next film anyway?  Word on the street is, there's going to be Sentinels (mwuah hah hah hah).  That should be a blast and a half.  I'm betting on Gambit and Beast showing up (did you catch their ""cameos"" in X2?) and on Jean making an appearance (*wink wink*).  Wolverine may be the most bad-assed X, but he's not the only one.  Besides, they may have played him out a little too much in these two.  I'm calling for a little less of the clawed Canuck in the next.  And here's to hoping that we get to see Rogue go from the mega-babe she is to the Rogue we all know and love: the butt-kicking, super-powered mega-babe from the comics.  I don't think that X3 needs to be the last, though.  For years, Marvel has  supplied some of the best comics on Earth, and since their inception, X-men has been the largest, most complex story line of any comic series.  The material is there, the movie talent has been shown, the special effects technology exists.  There's no reason why X-men couldn't be a running series.  I think Fox will find that audiences will go see as many X-movies as they make.Here's to hoping...",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Improvements are made and visible,"In ""X2"", Bryan Singer manages to build upon its predecessor and produce an even better final product. The semi-philosophical mutants-vs.-humans themes are explored further and more explicitly, but never by cannibalizing on the expected superhero action and showdowns. As a matter of fact, ""X2"" contains two of superhero cinema's most memorable scenes: Nightcrawler fighting his way through the White House to the tones of Mozart, and Magneto's gory escape. The emotional stakes are increased, and thankfully the tacky dialogs are reduced. ""X2"" is one of too few sequels that you will be happy was made.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Another decent comic book movie, like the first ""X-Men"", but slightly superior","When I went to see this in the theatre back in 2003, I had never seen the first ""X-Men"" movie, but could remember some of the main characters fairly well, thanks to certain childhood memories, mainly from watching the animated TV series. I'm not exactly sure how impressed I was when I saw this sequel to the 2000 blockbuster, so it obviously wasn't the greatest movie-going experience I've ever had, but it definitely was better than going to see ""Hulk"" about a month later. Since then, however, I have seen all three movies in the trilogy more than once, and would say this is the best one, the worst being the third.During a White House tour, a mutant comes along and soon attacks, attempting to assassinate the President! The President is saved, but after this, the mutant population is once again in danger, as the fear and hatred of mutants from the rest of humanity increases! A scientist and military leader named William Stryker, a major threat to the mutant population, gathers information from the now imprisoned Magneto about the X-Mansion! He then comes to the mansion with his armed forces, where they attack the school! Some mutants manage to escape, including Logan, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro, who go and meet up with Jean and Storm. Meanwhile, Stryker has managed to capture Professor Charles Xavier and intends to use him for his evil plans against mutants! Magneto soon escapes from his prison cell, and he and Mystique meet up with a group of X-Mansion residents. The mutants must put aside their differences for now and unite to stop Stryker!Like its predecessor, and like most other comic book movies from recent years, ""X2"" has some fairly weak moments. The White House attack scene could have been better, and perhaps choral music wasn't the best choice for it. However, overall, this is another comic book movie that works. For those who want action and suspense, there's lots of that in this film, as well as some excellent sets and special effects (not unlike the first film), but that's not all. The movie adds another character who was not in the first movie named Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler, a mutant who turns out to be good. He's a good addition to the story, and what he tells Storm and Jean when they find him is a very moving moment in the film, which reminds me, the story here is a bit deeper and more moving than that of the first live action ""X-Men"" feature. Like the original, there are also some good humorous moments, such as a cat purring and licking Wolverine's claws. Lastly, the dialogue in the film is sometimes weak (which can be expected in these comic book movies from the past ten years or so), but some of the dialogue is quite strong (including the Kurt Wagner speech I mentioned), which cannot be said about some of the other recent comic book movies, some of which are pretty lame.If you didn't like the first movie in the ""X-Men"" trilogy, or you dislike recent comic book movie blockbusters in general, then you're probably not missing much if you haven't seen this sequel. As you probably know already, you might as well skip it. Some people generally don't care for films of this type, whether the films are well-received or not. However, I'm sure most people who have been impressed with the 2000 comic book movie have also been impressed with this sequel, many of them more so than they have been the original, and I think that includes me! Sequels are usually expected to be inferior to their predecessors, but occasionally, there are times when they turn out to be superior, and I guess this is one of those cases, even though the third installment, "" X-Men: The Last Stand"" turned out to be significantly inferior to both of the previous installments, unfortunately.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Great Entertainment!,"A polished comic book adaptation, darker and grittier than the first in the series. I think it lacks the fun factor the original had, mainly due to the content. Still, it is hard not to admire Singer's faithfulness to the comic.This time around we have Nightcrawler, Iceman and Pyro joining the crew as well as cameos by Hank McCoy (aka Beast), Siryn, Jubilee, Colossus and Kitty Pryde (aka Shadowcat). Lady Deathstryke is deadly as the evil counterpart to Wolverine; their one on one battle, one of the highlights of the film. Still, Alan Cummings steals this movie as the shy and sensitive Nightcrawler whose make up gets the first star. The opening scene as he invades the White House is sheer popcorn fun.The nemesis this time around is William Stryker, played gleefully sinister and corrupt by the always marvelous, Brian Cox (the original Hannibal Lecter). Stryker has it in for the mutants and his presence lends some insight into the creation of Wolverine. Magneto is back, the fuel for the fire of his hatred against humans rekindled by Stryker's actions. His aide, Mystique, played by the delicious Rebecca Romijn, is given a larger role as the deceiver and spy which adds more fun factor to the film. Plus she is easy on the eyes.I really didn't enjoy the subplot of Professor X and Stryker's son, Jason. I found it too dark to really get swept away in the film. The rest of the film is pure Saturday matinée enjoyment. I cannot wait to see the outcome of Jean Grey's metamorphosis into Dark Phoenix, insinuated at the end of this film. All in all, a good romp, well worth a rental or buy of the DVD and promises a great chapter to come in X3.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Amazing Sequel!,"X2 (2003, Dir. Bryan Singer)After the events on Liberty Island, everyone at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters are settling in.

For the sequel, 'X2', Singer has the opportunity to make it even better. He does this wonderfully. He has created another amazing story, which is much more interesting than the original film. Having humans as the enemies towards the mutants, give an interesting twist on the story. The special effects are amazing again, and so realistic. All the wonderful characters are back too, with more more action for characters such as Iceman and Pyro. Unfortunately, James Marsden gets a very small amount of screen time, which is a shame.

www.thefilmbuffs.tumblr.com,"""It is a historical fact: sharing the world has never been humanity's defining attribute"" – Charles XavierThe follow up to Bryan Singer's X-men is a true sequel in every sense of the word. Where other comic book films seek to introduce a clean slate for a new plot and major reshuffling of characters (mainly villains), X2 seamlessly snuggles into place from where its predecessor left off. My review for X-men dealt with the issues of a lack of character development and on screen chemistry. This was mainly an issue due to the heavy focus on the background for Singer's X-men world, detailing the mutant/human divide and the morals and intentions of the three factions of the series. X2 provided the emotional depth which the original film lacked, wrapped up within a multi-level, thicker plot leaving you wondering who ""the real bad guy"" was.After an assassination attempt on the US president by an unknown mutant, the country is in a state of panic over the ""mutant problem"". William Stryker, a war veteran turned experimental scientist who holds a deep disdain for anything mutant, is intent on starting a war in retaliation, and has extracted information on the Cerebro device by torturing an imprisoned Magneto. Xavier is imprisoned in Stryker's secret base, and his school is assaulted by Stryker's soldiers, so it's up to the X-men , including new addition Nightcrawler, three novice students (Pyro, Iceman and Rogue), and Magneto to save the professor and stop Stryker from manipulating Xavier's psychic powers to destroy mutant-kind. Throughout the main storyline, Wolverine is also trying to find clues to unlock his past, and finds out that Stryker is the key to doing so. Rogue and Iceman experience their own troubles of a mutant relationship, showing that superpowers aren't always a good thing to possess.X2 is long. It clocks in at over two hours, half an hour longer than the original. The level of character development is such that it really needs to be (initially), everything up until the final showdown at the secret Alkali Lake base deals with building upon the foundations of personas created three years previously.Wolverine, again the central figure of the film, has become the animalistic loose cannon he is known for thanks to good script writing and choreography in action scenes. The scene where he disposes of a squad of soldiers sent to attack Xavier's mansion is an incredible action scene with some fantastic stunts and brutal claw-work. Jackman brings much more angst to the role, perhaps because of Wolverine's frustration over his forgotten past, yet also becomes a rock for vulnerable, younger characters. Whether it's physically protecting the students or being a confidant to Bobby or Marie, Jackman excels and stamps his authority on this film as the lead actor.A disappointing factor for Wolverine is that his story is diluted with the main storyline to this film, however, his relationship with Jean Grey blossoms beyond just flirtation from X-men; unfortunately Cyclops largely isn't a part of this story, which is disappointing due to proved on-screen chemistry between Marsden and Jackman. We do see some well acted scenes between the pair at the films conclusion, however. Marsden's performance at this stage poses the question as to why he didn't play as big a role in the film's lengthier mid-section, alas the story did not require his presence.Famke Janssen also steps up greatly, and isn't just a damsel in emotional distress caught between two big strong men. Storm's character develops to an extent. Berry plays well off of new member to the team, Nightcrawler, who brings a sense of freshness to the X-men line-up. Although Storm has a bit more to say and do in this film, she really isn't one of the stronger characters, ironic that she and Cyclops are generally considered to be Xavier's second and third in line.As for the two old adversaries, Stewart and McKellen can't be scrutinised at all for their roles as Professor X and Magneto. Magneto slightly deviates from the role of a crazed dictator bent on world domination, breaking character to add some catty dialogue when he reluctantly aligns with the X-men to tackle the common enemy that is Stryker. However, this enhances the idea behind this film and its predecessor that the ""bad guy"" always has a redeeming portion to their persona; no one is completely unlikable or has no reason for their character flaws.Storywise, X2 has the right amount of complexity for it to be considered a great improvement on X-men. Devious tactics, double-crossing and a touch of politics gives the right amount of depth to colour the basic plot of mutants teaming up to stop the evil human. Thankfully, the score also got a much needed revamp this time around. John Ottoman brings a larger than life, dramatic feel to the film with his music; where it may be a bit over the top in some places, in comparison to the dark, emotion-tugging Batman trilogy's score, it certainly was a big step in the right direction from what was musical non-existence in X-men.My one major criticism is over length; even though it's all action for the film's final thirty minutes or so, time seems to drag on. There are some needless scenes involving Rogue, Pyro and Iceman (why couldn't they have been part of the action?) in the X-Jet, and Wolverine's story intertwining with that of the rest of the cast gets a little confusing on top of all the action taking place. That said, the entertainment value of the film makes it quite enthralling, easily the most engrossing of the original trilogy.X2 (2003)Allan's Score: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Pass the Popcorn! review,"The first X-Men movie was, in a way, a revolutionary movie. It was, more or less, considered a low budget movie and nevertheless it managed to earn a ton of money, making way for future movies. Not only did the movie turn out to be a huge financial success, but it was also quite a decent superhero movie which managed to perfectly combine action and drama. After the first movie's financial boom and positive critical reception, a sequel was bound to happen. 'X2′ was a much bigger movie then its predecessor – it had a bigger budget ($110 million), it earned more money (over $400 million) and was overall a better movie.The movie opens with a mutant, later identified as the Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), attempting to assassinate the President of the USA. This failed assassination triggers a harsh human response against the mutants, and the Presidents goes with the plan of one William Stryker (Brian Cox), an army colonel who wants to storm Professor Charles Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) School for Gifted Youngsters. At the same time, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) wants to learn more about his past, and Magneto (Ian McKellen) is still in his plastic prison, but Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) has her own plans for busting him out.'X2′ is the ideal example of a sequel done right. The movie contains everything which made the first one good (the social commentary, the acting, the memorable characters), and it upgrades some things that didn't really work in the first one (some of the dialogue, Halle Berry has a significantly smaller role), but still has a voice of its own. There are several newcomers to the franchise who are properly introduced and developed throughout the movie, but the one who stands out the most is Brian Cox as the movie's villain, William Stryker. Cox, aided by two other veteran actors (Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen), makes for one impressive triumvirate of actors. This movie is worth seeing because of acting alone, but when you add to that the great fighting sequences, the amazing set pieces and strong writing – you get one really remarkable superhero movie.'X2′ is not only better and bigger than its predecessor, but it's also 30 minutes longer, which may be its biggest problem. Not that the movie is boring, but there are so many subplots in the movie that 'X2′ sometimes feels like two movies crammed in one, thus being somewhat overcrowded (especially in its third act). Nonetheless, 'X2′ is still an impressive entry in the genre of superhero movie and the whole X-men franchise. Unfortunately, right after this movie, things went south for the X-men franchise.Rating: 8/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"A little better, but essentially the same","Decent sequel pulls all the expected punches to topple it's predecessor, albeit in it's fanbase appeasement way. Continuing right where we left off, viewers are pretty much treated to a parallel go-around, although there have been a few noticeable tweaks. Action scenes, while still not nearly as stylish as potential would have, are filmed more fluidly and hold more intrigue then some of the undercooked action of the original. While the film still suffers from it's callous, measured approach, thankfully the cast's principal leads outshine the duller supporting ones. While Cyclops, Storm, and Jean Grey look and perhaps feel the part, their dry interpretation as usual takes away from some of the excitement, thankfully carried by the core actors. Fans will surely be pleased with a continued focus to bring the Xmen to screen, but casual movie-goers will likely feel indifferent as they enjoy their dosage of eye candy..",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant Storytelling and Brilliant Acting,"Brilliant Storytelling and Brilliant Acting is what make this the Best X-men Film. Bryan Singer has done an incredible job with the X-men series and after this sequel, it is no wonder why. This is a brilliant film with little flaws, terrific acting, and a wonderful storyline. This is one of the best comic book movies to date.Not only do the excellent actors in Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellan, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Anna Paquin, and Rebecca Romijn return as great characters but we see a whole new line of excellent characters and actors. One of which is Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler. His character is so amazing in this film and Cumming does a beautiful job of bringing it out. His character is so likable and the entire part of the story focusing around him: his back-story, his faith, and the effect he has on Storm is wonderful. Speaking of Storm, Halle Berry plays a strong role in this film as Storm. I disliked her in the first film but she does better in this one. We finally begin to see her emerge as a leader and as a dynamic force to this X-men unit. Brian Cox delivers an incredible performance in this film as William Stryker. He captures his characters mental instability perfectly on screen. And a big compliment goes out to Aaron Stanford. He is a perfect actor for the character Pyro. He has a certain anger and ""deadliness"" characteristic to his appearance that makes him well suited for the part.I would also like to add that I think this film is Mystique at her best. Rebecca Romijn takes complete control of her character in this film and holds little to nothing back. Her character has evolved into an even more evil, dangerous, and wicked character from the first film. Her performance in this film is extremely notable.There are some small problems I have with the characters. I do dislike Icemans character in this film. He seems to much like a wimp and do-what-your-told character. Cyclops seems like he is gone for way to long in the movie. He may appear in like the first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes. This film was the first in his descent as a critical character.I like this film because it is a teaser to the young mutants powers. We begin to see just some of the capabilities Iceman has. Another teaser, seeing Colossus for the first time transform. And of course, the ultimate power that Pyro possesses and not only how well he can handle it, but also how dangerous he truly is with it. I would have liked to see more with these characters powers but I understand they are developing and these ""glimpses"" are just a teaser to show what they are developing into and what they will be capable of in future films.What makes this movie great is the story. There is little to no flaws with this movie and it is so easy to get sucked into the story. It is very easy to follow yet has a deep and powerful meaning to it. So many concepts are touched on in the movie (Wolverines past, Developing more powerful side of Jean Grey (Phoenix!)) with little to no inconsistencies affecting the major storyline. This is one of the best stories, I believe, ever written for a film and I give a tip of the hat to the list of writers and screenplay writers.The movie is amazing in that so much happens but you do not feel like anything was wasted in the end. You feel like every pivotal character was touched on enough, no big character got left out of anything, and you are left with a feeling of satisfaction. This is a truly wonderful film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
EXCELLENT,"I only have one thing to say about this movie. AWESOME! It was by far, better than the first movie. I like the new characters especially Pyro, he's my dad's favourite. Everything was well done, the action and fight sequences were off the hook. But I only had one problem and that was why couldn't they have more of Lady Deathstrike (Kelly Hu). There was only one scene where she released her claws. But other than that, perfect. 10/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Soap Opera in Comic Book Form,"X2: 6/10: X2 solves the biggest problem I had with the original X-men movie. I am no longer rooting for the wrong side.You see in the first film I quickly found myself agreeing with the bad guys led by Ian McKellen rather than the good guys led by Captain Picard himself Patrick Stewart. I simply felt the so-called bad guys were right and on top of that simply had a better plan. Since McKellen and Stewart are working together in this film (however temporarily) that point is mooted.The other improvement over the last film is more coherent and effective action sequences. Part of this is due to a bigger budget and better F/X technology, but director Bryan Singer also seems to have a better grip on the pacing and shooting of both the action sequences in particular and the entire film.A better grip on the characters on the other hand still seems the series weak point. Part of this is my fault.I am simply not familiar enough with the X-men universe and their powers. For example we have Stewart's character able to kill everyone on earth with his thoughts but unable to escape the mental influence of a little girl. The rest of the powers are often as sloppy.One great example is the groaner when Magneto draws the iron from blood to make bullets. Even the characters get confused as nobody remembers that there is an Iceman on the plane when the killer tidal wave approaches.Also, as in the first film, a chunk of time is spent on Hugh Jackman's Wolverine character. He is cool and all but I still am not sure why he is considered a mutant? (If he has a metal skeleton surrounded by flesh and was built by humans I thinking cyborg)Throw in another dozen or so good and bad guys to keep track of and the confusion seems clear. As a result there is no real emotional attachment and a lot of confusion regarding the characters.Add on a clumsy coming out to your parents parable and a generally PC vibe of the good guys and I can't recommend the film. Also where exactly in McKellen's clear jail cell suspended from the ceiling is the bathroom?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
An Amazing Movie,"What an amazing movie that is a perfect adaptation to the X-Men comics and cartoon. First I have to say that if you see this movie before the first one, you'll be confused and won't really understand why things happen the way they do. X2 isn't really a movie on its own, you need to have seen the first one. But everything about this movie, is so much bigger and better than the first, all of which equals to an enjoyable movie to watch many times. One of the best things about it, is that Rogue and Iceman have a much, much stronger role. As well as Pyro, making things interesting for an X3 (not to mention the hint of Phoenix in Jean). The characters are all amazing to watch on screen, all the main mutants are great on screen as they work together, and the effect of their powers make it better. Even the filming locations (Canada) look amazing on screen. The one negative comment I have, is that a few of the stunts and effects seemed a little un-realistic such as the X-Wing, but it's a small price to pay for such a good movie. Definitely a movie to watch if you're a fan and even if you're not, you'll still like it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The war has begun,"I base this on the 2-Disc release. It has started, and it simply rocks. This whole thing builds on almost all of what the first set up and did, in so many ways, and in fact goes places only a follow-up could. Now that the world and the universe have been established, they could afford to do interesting stuff with what they had, and this the romance is just part of it. The new is also impeccable... the villain, the addition of Nightcrawler, so much is brought to the table with this, food for thought, complexity, dense, more than meets the eye. This is bigger than its predecessor, and without becoming pure fluff in the process. The action is grander, without being the main focus. The themes are the same, with a couple of different explorations of them this time around. The attention to detail is still amazing. The plot is well-done, nice script, very intriguing, and the pacing is spot-on, never standing still and not overwhelming, either. The nods to the comics are marvelous. The humor is well-done and fitting. The dialog is mostly good and well-delivered. The effects are incredible, and better than before. There are utterly stunning visuals in this. The fights are memorable and awesome. The ending of X-Men pays off majorly in this. This is quite dramatic. The orchestral score is fantastic. The powers are used well, such as the morphing(in this as well as the entry before it), and they look excellent. Production design is spectacular. The costumes, the tone in general remains true to the realistic approach. Cummings is well-cast, as well as Cox and Hu. The acting is, with few exceptions, invariably magnificent. There are strong women role models in this one, too. The problem of X1 has not been solved in this, in fact, if anything, it's made worse. There is an even greater amount of characters, and far from everyone gets to be developed in this. It does tend to work and there are fairly solid arcs in this. The abilities yet again have to be written around or out of the way entirely. These don't cost it a lot of points overall, I would say. There is relatively mild and infrequent language in this, and the sensuality is somewhat present, not necessarily strong. The DVD holds extras, including featurettes, interviews, behind-the-scenes stuff, extended/deleted scenes, plenty of galleries and two commentary tracks, one of Bryan Singer, and one of various crew-members, both well worth listening to. I recommend this to fans of the graphic novels, just watch the movie series from the 2000 film, and know that these translations, interpretations, not direct adaptations with everything accurate to the books. Those into science fiction ought to enjoy it, as well. And proof that sequels can match, and, arguably, surpass, the original, is always something to take note of. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
X-Men 2 — A great super powered sequel,"X-Men 2 is what should be expected of a sequel, something the fan of the original X-Men can be proud of.

As a bonus, we're introduced to new super heroes.The actors. About the same performance.The bad. The CG doesn't show as much as in X1, but there's a bunch of logical flaws in the scenario. Not too bad, but slightly distracting. The Wolverine's hairdo is messed up in the intro and conclusion.The ugly. Nothing.The result. Yet an other good super powered action flick.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
It just gets better,Continuing from the first X-Men film the story develops into a great fun action film. It's great because there are more complications within the characters and story which makes it more interesting. The character of WOlverine becomes more intriguing for he tries to uncover his mysterious past. I loved the involvement of Mr. Stryker and how the action centres around him and what he plans to do. The characters are once again great and really bring the story to life. Bryan Singer did a great job with this film and for all people who love superhero films then this is the film for you. There was one scene of sexual content which was unnecessary. Apart from that this is a fun filled adventure film.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"The comic book tone of the first film is missing here, but still a great, powerful movie","I watched the movie for the first time at theater in 2003 and disappointed. It seemed me less entertaining and pretty slow paced. However, later, I took its DVD and watched it again, completely changed my mind. X-2 is as entertaining as the first one and again with great, amazing action scenes. Plus, the movie is deeper, more powerful than the first one owing to the brilliant script. The opening sequence of the movie is one of the best opening sequences so far. However, one of my favorite parts, may be favorite part is the assault sequence. It is spectacular, not showy. Especially editing and sound editing are great and to me it deserves to be included in cinema anthology, at least action cinema anthology. I like Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, but whatever he does, he cannot be as tough as the original character, in other words, he does not look like a threat. Sorry, but Brian Cox's William Stryker is much more better than Danny Huston's William Stryker. The man with the wheel chair must be one of the most important characters of X-Men myth, but I did not know this character, still I don't know, I haven't searched, so I cold not understand that part exactly. The cell of Magneto recalls the cell of Hannibal Lecter obviously. The plan of him and Mystique was probably one of the most smart plans in cinema. As for the X-jet sequence, like the assault part, it deserves to be included in the bests. Except Behind Enemy Lines, the greatest 'jet' sequence is here. Spectacular and especially sound editing is great. Twister moments were unbelievable. Wolverine Deathstrike fight is very harsh (as I know, because of the complaints of the fans, Singer made fights more tough) but a bit exaggerating and showy. However, there are more amazing scenes, more action and sub stories in the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A well-done motion picture epic,"I had the opportunity to see X2 at the theater in which I work prior to its national release on May 2, 2003. When I enter a theater to see a film such as X2, I suspend my beliefs, not expecting to see a film that will be artsy and/or Oscar-worthy. X2 is, in fact, a very well-produced and entertaining motion picture. The characters appear as if they have been plucked straight from the pages of any of the hottest X-Men comic books in the series. The fighting and action scenes are very energetic, lively, and fast-paced, helping to boost the stamina of the film. I did, however, see some problems with the film. For one, I would have loved to have seen more battles between the villainous X-men and those fighting for the betterment of mankind. No such battles exist, however. The central villain in the film is Colonel William Stryker, a man who does not possess extraordinary mutant powers. He is, essentially, a human who desires a planet rid of the troubles that mutants produce. All in all, the film was very entertaining although I was a little bit disappointed. It is definitely worth a viewing on the big screen. X2 is one of those films that requires a viewing in the theater; otherwise, one will surely feel that he or she is missing out on something if he or she views it at home on video or DVD for the first time. My Rating: ***/**** B",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Short of Greatness,"X2 has moments of greatness, but it never felt like the stakes were raised. The film was continually hashing out the same problems as the first X-Men without much progression. A lack of direction and too many hands in the writing room kept me from being fully invested.That being said, the action was great (especially Wolverine), the team-up was legendary (who is the real bad guy) and Magneto's cage (the blood!) was easily the best scene of the film. X2 isn't bad but it isn't great, it's simply a mid-tier comic book movie. Compared to the rest of the X-Men Universe, this is higher up on the ranking but not when looking at modern cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
WHAT WENT WRONG?!,"X-2 is the biggest disappointment this summer.  No, Reloaded and Hulk didn't disapoint me:  I was right about both films sucking.  But X-2!  This was supposed to be the film that took the original hit to an extreme level!  It would revolutionize the comic book film genre again, just as the prequel did three years ago.  Sadly, this is not the case.  We have a horrible b-movie in place of what should have been a classic.What really makes the movie fall apart is the characters.  Remember how they seemed to feel realistic, and how we felt like we could relate to them? Well, the writers decided to toss that feeling out the window for part 2. These characters are extremely superficial, playing to their old, 2-d, flat comic selves, making it impossible for us to feel that they're real-life representations of the characters we knew so well.  Granted, some characters have moments in the spotlight more than before:  Ie., Iceman and Mystique(who actually has more than one line this time!), but many of the characters, with the possible exception of Wolvie, have had their roles largely diminished, most notably Cyclops.BOTTOM LINE:  The best comic book movie currently out on DVD is X-Men 1. This is a much better choice than wasting your time on this black sheep.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"""You picked the wrong house, bub.""","Fantastic sequel that is regarded by many as superior to the original. I don't particularly agree but rather than wade into that argument I'll just say that I love both movies. Where this movie is obviously stronger than the first is in its action scenes. It has some especially strong sequences, such as the opening Nightcrawler scene at the White House or the assault on the X-mansion. These scenes and others like them are much more cinematic and well-staged than the action scenes from the first movie.Most of the first movie's stars shine here as well. Jackman and McKellen lead the pack again. Janssen, Romijn, Berry, and even Marsden improve upon their roles from the first film. Also returning from the first film with a significantly larger part is Shawn Ashmore's Iceman. He's really good. New to the cast are Alan Cumming's wonderful turn as Nightcrawler, Aaron Stanford's enjoyable Pyro, Kelly Hu's sexy and deadly Lady Deathstrike, and Brian Cox lending some weight as the villainous human Stryker. There are also a slew of fan-pleasing cameo appearances from comic book characters such as Kitty Pryde, Siryn, and Colossus.Where the movie does suffer some is that, in adding the new characters and giving them a lot of focus, it takes away from some characters from the first movie that I liked a great deal. Patrick Stewart's Professor X is sidelined for a large part of this one. Anna Paquin's Rogue is stuck in a romantic subplot that gives her little to do for most of the film. Worse, her plot never goes anywhere. It's in the same place at the end of the movie as it was at the beginning. Sadly, things would get even worse for her character moving forward in the series. A crying shame considering how important she was to the first movie.Bryan Singer's direction is even more polished than the first movie. The script, while a little more involved than your average comic book film (at that time especially), is intelligent and full of memorable lines and scenes. The special effects are very good. The music is better than the first movie as well, although still lacking a definitive score like Batman or Superman had. Judged on its own merits or by comparison, it's a great movie. It's a shame that Singer didn't return for the third film. We all know how that turned out without him. At least when he did return with Days of Future Past, he brought back the old magic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Bigger and better than the first one....,".....quite enjoyable, if anything it does over-stay it's welcome a little, while the first one wasn't long enough. But that's just me. I enjoyed the better characterizations here-Wolverine, Storm, Jean Gray, Magneto, etc. It was also kinda fun watching Rogue driving around the Big Jet there like some regular teenaged kid getting into an 18-wheeler and half-backing it thru the warehouse door to get it inside. You gotta root for her.Lotsa nods to the fans-'Hank McCoy' on TV, files mentioning Sentinels, a Phoenix image in the water at the end, etc. All that. Plus Iceman too. The plot was the standard Superhero/Bond kinda thingie that you really should waste time trying to follow or guage for realism, that is besides the point if anything.  Nice to see Brian Cox at it again too.Def. a good flick though one that will be dated kinda fast seems like.*** outta ****, go and enjoy it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Pretty good as far as first sequels go.,"I've often held that the sequel of a superhero film is better than the original. Most superhero film franchises start out with an origin story, so by the time the second film comes around, all the ""exposition"" is out of the way and the heroes can really take on some powerful villains. However, since X-Men (2000) didn't have much of an origin story, its sequel, X2 is almost relegated to the fate of a ""flashback"" sequel. Still, the darker tone does help set it apart from its predecessor, which is nice.Granted, the choice of exploring Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) past was a good one, considering the strength of the character. Heck, he got two more movies outside the main X-Men saga, so clearly he's a fan favorite. What's nice about the superhero sequel is that most comic book story arcs are short enough that they can be incorporated into a single film. In this way, X2 could almost stand by itself, much like its predecessor could. In fact, X2 almost follows the same formula as X-Men by not actually delving too deep into any single character's origin story. All the supporting characters are useful and relevant, which is important for a series that relies on the teamwork of a group of mutants.This film also mostly avoided the trope I like to identify as ""the trilogy conundrum"". Because it could stand alone as its own film, especially for those already familiar with the characters and premise, there isn't a need for it to be a cliffhanger to motivate people to see the third film in the trilogy. If you can ignore the glow in the water at the end of the film, it hardly has much of a connection to X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) at all.Pretty good as far as first sequels go, I give X-Men 2 3.5 stars out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant,"I wasn't thrilled with the first X-Men, mainly because of Halle Berry (Storm was useless: afraid of everything, gets her ass kicked, then goes berserk) and the fact that there was virtually no story.  I suppose it really served as a 2 hour trailer for X-Men 2...well, and to show off Mystique.I was very impressed with X-Men 2.  This film was absolutely brilliant.  The characters all appeared as more of a team and as the ultimate superheros that I remember from the comics.  The action was much better than what I saw in the first film and there's some great humor.  Highlights are Wolverine's rampage through the mansion, Pyro's destruction of police cars, the foreshadowing of Phoenix, and OF COURSE every sequence involving Mystique! I also liked that this film was on the edge of not being a movie for kids...which is great considering the original fans of the comics are now adults.I just hope the original cast stays on for more sequels!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
a must-see!!!,"X2 is by far one of the best sequels ever put out.  It lived to the hype. Singer and company put together an absolutely brilliant movie bringing the comic book characters to life.  The best sequence in the movie is the first scene with Nightcrawler.  The Rogue-Iceman relationship is definitely a heartbreaker to watch and the Wolverine-Jean Grey-Cyclops love-fest was more developed in this movie.Here are some things that points I would like to make about the film.  Get a new Cyclops.  James Marsden can?t act, especially the scene where Jean leaves the plane and he tries to stop her and starts getting upset when she closes the door.  Everyone in the theater laughed.  Also, there is no chemistry between Marsden and Famke Jennsen (Jean Grey).  That makes it hard for those not familiar with the comic book to understand why they were together.  Lady Deathstrike was underused.  I don?t think she even said a word.  It seemed as though she was more of a robot than a human.  I?m not staying that Kelly Hu?s acting was bad or anything.  She just wasn?t given a chance to act.2 hours and 15 minutes of great movie watching.  Can?t wait for X3!!!9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

X-Men United A Much Better Sequel With Some Flaws,"I thought this one of those rare sequels that was actually much better improvement over the first one but there were some flaws. The film is no Dark Knight or Spider-man 2 but I'd say that it's just as good as either Iron Man or The Incredible Hulk. Bryan Singer does an admirable job with this sequel giving the audiences some more interesting characters (but it can feel a bit much at times) and just enough exhilarating sci-fi action. Singer improves on some of the flaws in the first one but some are still in the sequel but the good outweighs the bad. The cast are great in their roles including Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier, Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine, Ian McKellen as Eric Lesherr/Magento, Halle Berry as Ororo Munroe/Storm, Famke Janssen as Jean Grey (Phoenix), James Marsden as Scott Summers/Cyclops, Rebecca Romijin Stamos as Mystique, and Anna Paquin Marie D'Ancanto/Rogue. Joining the cast are Brian Cox as one of the villains Colonel William Striker, Kelly Hu as Lady Deathstrike, and Alan Cumming as Kurt Warner/Nightcrawler. The rest of the supporting cast are good in their roles but unfortunately they don't get a lot of screen time and aren't developed either. Magneto, Mystique, Striker, and Deathstrike prove to be effective villains. But how many villains can you have in one movie? Other than Deathstrike not being in it much and having almost no dialogue. The actors and actresses bring a lot to their roles no matter how big or small it may be. On the side of good Wolverine, Storm, Jean, and Nightcrawler prove to be believable heroes in the imaginary world they inhabit where mutants and humans are trying to co-exist. Some of the flaws in the last film are in this one as well like the fact that they still seem to be juggling too many characters (Colossus, Jubilee, and Kitty Pride have nothing more than brief cameos). Patrick Stewarts Charles Xavier and James Marsden's Cyclops also seemed to have less screen time than they did in the first film as well. Cyclops disappears for a large parts of the movie (like Xavier) only to show up near the end. The other supporting characters including Iceman and Pyro have bigger roles that some of the others but they still lack screen time. Bruce Davison also returns for a brief blink and you missed it appearance as Senator Kelly from the first film (He's actually Mystique because his character died in the first X-Men). With it's flaws aside X-Men United is still definitely a much better improvement over it's predecessor and is an entertaining comic book brought to the big screen. From it's incredible opening sequence involving a teleporting Nightcrawler to it's emotional climax involving the possible death of a major character X-Men United has plenty action, suspense, thrills, drama, and some humor that make for an enjoyable film to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Superhero film that delivers the goods!,"There may be a new trend in Superhero sequels, and I have to admit, I like it.  First seen in Blade II, where the bad and the good join forces to fight an even more menacing force, it is perfected in the new X-Men sequel X2.The movie picks up shortly after the conclusion of the first and we are quickly re-introduced to the mutant gang of Professor Xavier's school for the gifted.  For those of you not up to date with the mutant cast of characters, Patrick Stewart (Star Trek) is back as Professor X, Halle Berry (Monsters Ball) is Storm, Anna Paquin (The Piano) is Rouge, Famke Janssen is Jean Grey, James Marsden as the laser eye shooting Cyclops, Shawn Ashmore as Iceman and everyones favorite Canadian Superhero, Hugh Jackman (Swordfish) is back as the adamantium clawed Wolverine.  Some of our favorite villians are back for an encore, Ian McKellan (Lord of the Rings) plays the metal manipulator Magneto,  and Rebecca Romijin-Stamos is back as shape-shifting Mystique.  And finally, what would a superhero sequel be without the marketing of new characters?  Aaron Stanford plays the fire manipulating Pyro, Kelly Hu plays the quiet but deadly Deathstrike and Alan Cummings steals the show as the blue faced teleporter Nightcrawler.With a cast of characters as strong and dilluted as X-Men 2, you would think that no character would have time to establish themselves to the audience, however, director Brian Singer (The Usual Suspects) manages to string each of the mutants out in comic book fashion ensuring that no matter who your favorite, you will not be disappointed.The story is thin, but lets face it, we throw down the $10 per ticket for a movie of this genre to be bedazzled by the special effects and blown away by the rumbling sounds.  For what script there is, the President of the United States is convinced by the evil General William Stryker (played by Brian Cox), that the mutants are a threat to mankind and must be rounded up to prevent the threat they impose.   Since all mutants are targets regardless of their good or bad nature, Magneto (once freed from his non-metallic cell) and Mystique join forces with the X-Men to rescue the Professor who is being forced to mentally link with all the mutants on earth, for the purpose of their destruction.There are many subplots in X2.  IceMan and Rogue continue their teenage foreplay, Wolverine continues to try and understand his past, there is the love triangle between Cyclops, Jean Grey and Wolverine that continues to sizzle and there is the wild card Pyro who seems to have problems with authority and anger management.  But when you get right down to it, the story doesn't matter much.  Brian Singer spends his $150 million dollar budget wisely, and the special effects are top rate, and the body count (missing from the first movie), piles up fast.Wolverine commands the biggest presence on screen and his battle with the intruders to the school and later with DeathStrike, is better than anything filmed in the earlier released superhero film Daredevil.Those comic book enthusiasts will not leave disappointed and will have an advantage over the average movie goer.  You will get glimpses of Colosses, Kitty Pryde, and there are enough scenes of the Blackbird that the plane should have been given an acting credit.Mostly, Brian Singer does what Peter Jackson has done before him.  He made a film that is a lot of fun, but is a tease for a third.  Although no official announcement about X3 is evident, X-Men 2 ends with the death of major character (no worries, the Pheonix will rise) and with Pryo taking his place amongst Magneto and Mystique as a member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.Especially in today's real world, it is promising and refreshing to see both good and bad characters join forces whenever evil threatens all.  Don't expect Bullseye and Daredevil or Batman and Joker to team up, but that just keeps movies like this even more enjoyable.In short, a good film.  Better than the first and hopefully, just a launching board for the third.  B+.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Ever character gets their adequate screen time and Singer just handled them so well, it amazes me to this day.

As well as having new and interesting cast members being added to the movie. The acting performances in ""X2"" are good. Returning actors and actresses include the likes of Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Halle Berry, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen, Anna Paquin, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn and Bruce Davison. And there were some nice new additions to the movie with the likes of Kelly Hu, Alan Cumming and Brian Cox.Visually then ""X2"" is enjoyable. The CGI effects are good and realistic and add a lot of flavor to the movie. And with ""X2"" being a superhero movie, then special effects are a make or break factor. Thankfully then the effects in the movie are good, making it all the more enjoyable and fun to sit through the movie.If you haven't already watched ""X2"", then you definitely should do so. While it is not really necessary to have watched the 2000 movie ""X-Men"" before watching ""X2"", I would recommend doing so, just in order to get everything taken in.My rating of director Bryan Singer's 2003 sequel ""X2"" lands on a well-deserved seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
above average comic-book sequel,"X2 was a movie I revisited before seeing the 3rd X-Men movie, and I'm reminded how director Bryan Singer, in one of his best films here, can have control, style and even moving artistry for this kind of popcorn entertainment he's now done with these two films (and will do soon with Superman perhaps) while still making it witty and dramatically engaging. That's not too common in a time when studios will gladly shill out pieces that have the painstaking (well, maybe not so much in 06) special effects and technical side to it while not having jack-s*** with the story and dialog.It helps with X2 that the actors are good professionals rising to the occasion and then some (Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, even character-actor Brian Cox as Stryker brings real menace). And I liked how the relationships and/or trouble some of the characters are expanded upon with this story of a battle between the mutants and the darker forces at work. I could go on about the specific details of how certain action set-pieces are well done, or how the conflicts with the characters are proportioned well for their fates or personalities. But it comes down to something simpler- it's got that mix of a certain social attitude and relevance that isn't pushed too much into your face, just enough as the subtext for ""Hollywood"" appeal. Some scenes are more standout than others (Famke Janssen's plot line has the most relevance and depth, as her's is an unintentional 'to be continued').Overall it's an exciting time, especially as a kind of nothing-to-do movie on the weekend- as are the others in the franchise. X2 is the kind of sequel, at the least for fans, that does have the appeal of trying to top itself from the first and not going into complete wastes of logic and style.

Good but...,"Overall, X2 is a solid blockbuster entry.  It has characters that are well thought out and well inhibited by the actors portraying them. There are beautifully sequenced fights and action sequences. And the relationships between the mutant characters is remarkable for a movie this lightweight.  But I did have a few major qualms with this movie.First off, it's WAY too long.  About thirty minutes too long.  It needed to be shorter and more focused.  I wasn't really expecting this problem from a Bryan Singer movie as his films tend to zip through start to finish and are usually expertly edited.  That's not to say some of the scenes that probably should have been edited weren't good scenes.  One scene that comes to mind is the scene at Iceman, Bobby Drake's house, which is completely inconsequential to the real action of the movie and tacks on a good five or ten minutes.  There are countless scenes like this that add up to create a large close to 2 1/2 hour movie that you stop caring about the last ten minutes.  The first X-Men movie was short and while unfufilling in some respects, didn't wear out it's welcome.  It was a great popcorn movie.  This one require a popcorn AND a hot dog AND a refill on the popcorn.Secondly, it was preachy.  I think everyone got the idea that the only way conflict can be resolved between mutants and humans is that they learn to live together instead of trying to kill each other.  I think this is pretty obvious to the audience after the third time someone has a monologue about acceptance, but after the umpteenth time someone gives a speech about acceptance or the lack thereof you wish Wolverine would just claw the speaker to pieces.  The only thing I can think of is that maybe it is a veiled attempt at one or many political messages.  Christian persecution, gay persecution, mistreatment of minorities & our foreign policy are all ripe for picking but none of these really stick in our mind.  So we are left with getting lectured about accepting mutants.  And mutants DON'T EXIST!  So all this lecturing feels a bit pointless and empty for interpretation by whoever.Finally, my last qualm with this movie is actually an element missing from one of my favorite part of the movie, the wolverine fight scenes.  I'm not going to go into any detail about his fight scenes, but let's just say they are much cooler  and more intense than in the first one and are easily the edgiest part of the movie. But there was one thing missing...blood.  Now I know this is a PG13 movie, but when a human being gets clawed through the chest, there tends to be blood.  To not include blood is to lessen our conflicted feelings as Wolverine kills the guys who attack him rather than just disabling them like the other X Men.  He's dangerous and hot-headed and not the guy to mess with, and I want to see the blood splatter on his face when he stabs the dude. It doesn't even have to be explicitly violent.  Just enough to know that this guy has an edge and a dark side about him that the others don't.  As I said, he's dangerous.Anyway, other than that the movie was a very impressive sequel with great acting.  And I know it was better than the first, I just didn't connect with it like the first one.  I think fans of the first movie should definitely see this one along with non-fans who will like this one better.  A nice if overblown blockbuster to start the summer season.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Action few a far between,"I thought the movie was good but I was expecting it to be great. There were some actions scenes but they were few and far between.

"""Booooooooring"" - Homer Simpson","Here's what I say about the ""best"" movie in the X-Trilogy: I took a nap during this slog three times. Three.I'm all for movies that focuses on character work and personal stakes instead of big explosions in my superhero movies, but this constructs the blandest and vaguest versions of those possible. An aggressively boring movie not only wrecked by ugly sets and a horrendous pace, but also by how it fails to live up to the central conflicts in the movie. Strykers son feels completely contrived, only there to freeze Xavier out of commission in the third act, and Wolverines journey to his past just marks down things we already know. It all feels like filler, with the whole ""global headache"" in the end not holding any stakes.The only scene that really registered with me is probably the least necessary plot-wise but perfectly highlights the ""Mutants as metaphor for civil rights"" angle. The scene where Iceman meets his parents in shock - which then follows Pyro killing armed cops with explosions - is easily the most emotionally riveting and coolest scene out of all of these movies. And the crazy thing about it: we don't even need it in the movie! It's just a detour for the characters to seek refuge only to get picked up by the hovercraft anyway.Yeah, I just don't care. Personally, I choose the first movie simply because it's shorter and more to-the-point, despite looking a whole lot cheaper.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Loved It!!,"I loved this movie and Bryan Singer again brought some brilliant stuff to this movie!!I loved it so much!! I want to buy the DVD so badly!! The plot is excellent and I really enjoyed it!!! The budget was bigger, the cast got larger, the story got deeper and more fascinating, THE MOVIE WAS MORE EPIC!!!! I loved how the brotherhood teamed up with the X-Men and were fighting against Stryker, then after that problem was solved they fought...I think because I haven't watched it in a while. Anyways the movie was awesome.The ending, however was a little bit sad but it was good. And I knew from the first X-Movie(just like you) that Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) fell in love with Jean(Famke Janssen) because of the way he looked at her and she had a thing for him too even though she was with Scott(James Mardsen). 10/10, Highly recommend you watching if you haven't yet.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
X-Men United,"The most impressive, most entertaining, most actionpacked, most well-crafted comicbook adaptation of a movie I've seen so far in my life. Everyone shines as the story becomes the star of the movie from the opening scene. Watch how the writers keep some characters a question. For instance, what was Nightcrawler's motivation for attacking the president? Loved the oepning scene, by the way.The movie is beautifully shot. Magneto's escape. Wolverine vs. Deathstrike and I particularly love Mystique's agility when she takes out those military men in a heartbeat.Anna Paquin is very attractive as Rogue, she is one woman who I can say does not have fabricated beauty.The pacing might falter at times but I love how the writers get to show each character's superpower and incorporate it with the action in the story.John Ottman's score sucked though.A-",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Xcellent!!,"As a fan of the Xmen comics and cartoons, I enjoyed and was for the most part happy with the first installment to the Xmen movies, When I saw the first I felt satisfied and happy that the Xmen I had for so long wanted to see taken to live action on the big screen done right. Well, as with most sequels I was weary and wasn't expecting much I admit. Well, what I was given was something I wasn't expecting, a much better movie and depiction of the Xmen characters than the first. This is a FANTASTIC movie and much better than the first in so many ways that I didn't even think of from the first. Hugh IS Wolverine, enough said!! Even Halle does a much better job with Storm. Alan as Nighcrawler was the absolute best choice, he is fantastic, steals the show. This fan thanks you so much Bryan Singer, no one could have done it better. Thank You for making the second even better than the first. I still am so Xcited about the movie and can't wait to go see it again and I defiantly am going to see it again. It's ALL good!! Can not wait for the next installment in the Xmen movies. Please Mr. Singer stay with us , I have total faith in you!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Better than I expected.,"I thought this movie would be pretty good, but from the trailers I thought there would be way to many characters.  For the most part though they mainly focused on those who returned from the first movie, with only Nightcrawler and Pyro being the only new characters that showcased their powers.  I was a bit disappointed not to see much of Colossus, and Iceman didn't really do much, but aside from that this one was really good.  I also wished Cyclops was in it more, but that made for an interesting sidepiece as this movie takes place on three fronts.  McKellan is great as Magneto and all the other cast is rather good as well.  Though I loved watching Magneto escape from the prison.  Lady Deathstrike really didn't have too much screen time and she had only one line, but she had one heck of a fight with Wolverine in this one.  Though I wish their fight was a bit longer.  The highlights of this one include of course the fight with Wolvie and Deathstrike, the cool opening scene with Nightcrawler, the scene where Pyro goes berserk, and the scene where the troops raid Xavier's school.  There are other cool scenes in there, but these were my favorites.  I don't think the movie ended as weak as some movie critics have said it did, but it wasn't the best feature of the film.  I also didn't care for the introduction of the Phoenix character they gave flashes of throughout.  I don't know if it will go with the movie formula all that well.  All in all a good film, could have ended better, but I am just being picky.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Less Character, More Movie.","While there is more movie here than in the first one, there is much less of the characters involved.  Instead of ""X2: X-Men United"", they should have titled this ""The Story of Wolverine"".  Whereas the last movie was an ensemble piece, in this movie everyone takes a backseat to Logan.  This is especially glaring in the cases of Rogue, Professor X, and Magneto.  In the last movie they (along with Wolvie) were the main characters, the main focal points of the plot.  In this movie everyone outside of Logan is reduced to set dressing.  One gets the idea that if the actors weren't contractually obligated to return for the sequel that they wouldn't have (because the script gives them nothing to do).In addition to that, certain plot lines are suddenly dropped while others are begun and go no further.But don't get me wrong; this isn't a bad movie by any means.  For instance, the fight scenes are better this time around, and the general story isn't bad at all, it's just that the overall feel of everything is different here.The story is bigger than last time (the whole world is at stake), but the time devoted to characterization is smaller (Cyclops is MIA for 3/4 of the film).It's a different balance this time around.  In the first flick the story was small, the characterization was in the forefront, and the number of characters utilized was many.  This time around the story is big, the characterization is in the background, and the number of characters utilized is few.Perhaps they should spin Wolverine off into his own film series.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Love this cast,"X2, oh boy, what a mutant rollercoaster! The actors really brought their A-game, giving life to the characters with a charisma that hooked me from the get-go. The film editing was like a mutant power in itself, seamlessly weaving together action sequences and emotional moments. The strength of X2 lies in its ability to balance the explosive mutant powers with the vulnerability of its characters, making them relatable despite their extraordinary abilities. The music was a mutant anthem, perfectly syncing with the pulse-pounding scenes. While it soared in many aspects, there were a few hiccups in pacing that kept it from reaching mutant perfection. Yet, the cinematography painted a visually stunning world of mutants, leaving me on the edge of my seat. X2 may not be flawless, but at 7/10, it's a mutant masterpiece that embraces the beauty within its quirks.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A rarity of a sequel in which you don't have to watch the original to experience,"X2: X-Men United shares the tradition of Aliens, Dawn of the Dead and The Lost World: Jurassic Park as a sequel far superior than their original counterparts. If i had words to describe this movie, and that is ""Ultimate Bad-Ass."" The film doesn't waste any time with getting to know the characters as a mutant known as Nightcrawler (A.K.A. Kurt Wagner, played by Alan Cumming) goes on an attack in The White House almost succeeding in killing the president until being deter by an agent. It is then where humans want to do something to efface the gifted mutants from the face of the world by brining in William Stryker (Brian Cox) to capture and illuminate those who have powers.From the first movie, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) returns from the Alkalide Base in Canada where he discovers that there was nothing left; everything had been deserted. He goes back to the mansion/school in New York to see that nothing has change with the fellow X-Men members Storm (Halle Berry), Jean Gray (Famke Jansen), Cyclops (James Marsden), even Rogue (Anna Paquin) has accepted herself in the school of the gifted. Wolverine learns from Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) that not only is Magneto (Ian McKellan) in a facility, but there is a mutant that almost killed the president.The X-Men leave Wolverine to take care of the young students where Jean and Storm head up to Boston to meet with Nightcrawler just as Scott and Prof. Xavier meet with Magneto where the head teacher discovers that Stryker has met with the fellow nemesis and giving all the details about the mansion full of mutants. Later that night, Stryker sends his team to capture a few of the students with Wolverine saving a couple of students including Rogue, her boyfriend Iceman and buddy Pyro. With the mutant registration in place, mutants from all sides unite to fight for civilization and the right to live.X2: X-Men United has more heart pound suspense and savvy action than it's original predecessor. Fans do get to see Wolverine slice and dice things up more than in the first movie; but the real treat however is Alan Cumming's portrayal of the demon Nightcrawler for which everything from the German accent to the design of the creature will have fans talking about him for ages to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"The Best of the Best, indeed","This is the best movie of the Summer, hands down!!! I'm just posting this review right now coz i wanted to veiw all the other potential contenders for that title and I'm very happy to say that X2: X-men United is best of them all. Yes. I saw Terminator 3, Hulk, and the much-hyped The Matrix Reloaded and none of them comes even close to X2 in overall quality.I saw X2 on the second day of its release with my parents and two sisters(one younger, one older). I,personally, loved the movie and I'm a diehard fan (ie. the hardest to please) of the comics even before the first movie came out. The restof the family tho, where novice to the mutant world and they (with the rest of the sold-out theater)laughed, ooohed, ahhhed, cheered at the right moments. Even after the film, everyone was abuzz especially regarding the ending of the movie (re: one character's ultimate sacrifice and her inevitable evolution into Phoenix).The best scenes are Nightcrawler's attack on the President, mansion raid by the rogue military, Magneto's escape scene, Nightcrawler and Mystique's little moment (they're mother-son), the whole jet chase scene, the whole Dark Cerebro scene, Wolverine vs. Deathstrike, and foreshadowing to Jean's inevitable Phoenix, etc.I also happen to think that this has the best ensemble cast in recent memory. Patrick Stewart as Prof. X (Star trek films), Sir Ian McKellan as Magneto (Gandalf in Lord of the Rings), Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Halle Berry as Storm (Monster's Ball), Famke Janssen as Jean Grey (Golden Eye), James Marsden as Cyclops, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique, Anna Paquin as Rogue (The Piano), Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler (Anniversarry Party), Brian Cox as Col. William Stryker (The Ring) and Kelly Hu as Lady Deathstrike.I highly recommend this to anyone who just wants to have a good time. Of course, it wouldn't hurt to rent the first movie first (i recommend the X-men 1.5 with plenty of X-tras).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The upping of the stakes and the going overboard of the sub-plots has the X-Men sequel just about pull through with an array of frequently imbalanced material.,"Was the title ""X-Men 2"" really so long that we needed it abbreviated to form ""X2""? As it happens, Bryan Singer's 2003 follow up to the reasonably pleasing a film from 2000 entitled X-Men is a little longer and a little baggier in its biting off more for us to chew on. Wheter it pulls off everything it decides to take on is one matter, whether it does it at all well another; the fact remaining right the way through to its closing credits that some of the more ordinary stuff on show is explored and granted much more time than some of the other content which may have been interesting. Sure, it has its shocks and its twists but it has its tendencies to conform and that's the most frustrating thing. Regardless, from its dramatic opening sequence of a mutant and his attempted 'hit' on the life of a fictitious American president, to the closing allegorical monologue from said man about mutants with clear allusions to the item of terrorism as we're told to 'acknowledge' this new phenomenon, X2 is an enjoyable if draggy experience which hits enough notes.The bigger picture and generally wider spectrum of both character and narrative Singer was quite clearly setting up in the first film is here granted the room to flex its muscles. X2 sees an expansion in stakes and general atmosphere, a spreading out of its wings so as to encompass an all out war between human-beings and mutants when tempers fray between the species, corrupt government officials manipulate the circumstances around them and hardened relations between those within the fractions become greater. The film hops about all over the place in attempting to cover and develop each of the little sub-stories it's got going on, and it does a decent job of it overall. The strand running central, to all of Wolverine's (Jackman) journey of discovery as he tries to uncover how he became what he is; the love he has for Jean Grey (Janssen) but the love she has for Cyclops (Marsden) as well as Rouge's (Paquin) romance with Iceman (Ashmore) which interestingly runs on an idea revolving around how great harm will come to both of them if they kiss or attempt to express their love for one-another at such an age, is the captivity of chief Mutant villain Magneto (McKellen).Regardless of what people think, the film channels The Silence of the Lambs and the imprisonment of Hannibal Lecter in Magneto's clothing; cell and demeanour. It's nice of the asylum staff to play him classical music seemingly on cue, and while it isn't The Goldberg Variations by Bach, it might as well be. The consistent presence of Brian Cox, whom actually portrayed Lecter in an earlier novel incarnation, adds further mirth to proceedings when there really ought not be any. Magneto's being held by a top American military official named William Stryker (Cox), whom wants nothing more than to stoke the fire between the two species. For Stryker, it's less-so business in his feuding with the mutants and more-so personal; his son, Jason, once a subject of Xavier's mutant school only to come home thoroughly less than well off and grossly affect the family situation as a result. We're told to conclude that Stryker is more evil than at first when it transpires he keeps a bunch of kidnapped infant mutants in a grim little cell within a secluded Arctic-like base much later on.Like X-Men; the mutant's apparent superiority over the human's is presented, not by way of the imperious lead of the first in Wolverine as he wins bare knuckle boxing match after bare knuckle boxing match in an unruly part of town, but by way of new German mutant Nightcrawler (Cumming) and the aforementioned attempt on the American President's life. We sense trouble is unavoidably afoot after digesting such a sequence following on from an opening voice-over from the anchor character of the films so far in Professor Xavier (Stewart) while skirmishes out in the public eye do nothing to help. The sole surviving aide to Magneto from the first film arrives in the many forms of Mystique (Romijn), the earlier film going some way to paint freakish and disfigured portraits of Magneto's other aides with Xavier's then-and-now subjects much more handsome and more beautiful in their appearance. Here, all mutants are briefly aligned and the film has fun in its retaining of the one bodily 'scarred' character from the first, whom just happens to be able to change form as temporary new identities and allies themselves are forged. Singer has additional fun in constructing suspenseful sequences in which Mystique must infiltrate government zones and we have to remind ourselves that we want her to get away with it.Alas, each and every one of the strands X2 takes on seems to overwhelm the next; the film hints at some bigger, brasher and more interesting things when one younger mutant is discussing the correlation between his mutant persona and human-being persona with the all powerful Magneto. The inference being that it's probably better to be 'Pyro' than 'John Allerdyce'. The film is a flabby actioner, its meshing of content for all ages ranging from the adolescent with the more adult to the fact veteran actors Patrick Stewart; Ian McKellen and Brian Cox all feature prominently making for an odd experience of action orientated frills and more mature issues. Its formulaic finale and gradually more and more conformist to spectacle attitude is one of its more chief faults, but there is edible entertainment to be had out of X2; a digestible comic book adaptation from a director we feel relaxed to be in the hands of.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"worth the price of admission, BUT...","How was X2?  Ehh...fairly decent.  definitely worth the price of admission, but the movie is not without serious flaws.X2 was thankfully not as boring or lethargic as X-Men, but it still needed a shot of adrenaline.  Even though there was a boatload of characters, i felt that not enough stuff actually happened in the movie.  I felt there needed to be at least two more one-on-one fight scenes and also a good group-vs-group maylay.  Nightcrawler's intro and the Wolverine/Deathstrike fight were great, but I felt they were bigger teaser to upcoming bigger events that just never happened. The X-Men were repesented as a minority sect fleeing their persecutors.  I think that perspective makes for great story-telling, but i think for an action movie, Singer spent too much time having the X-Men on the defensive.  I've read reviews about Marden's portrayal of Cyclops.  Yes, the role was reduced, but I think his brief presense and emotional breakdown of losing Jean were very well done.Lastly, I wasn't crazy about the ending.  X-men versus lots of water. That was about as satisfying as the alternate ending of Blade 1 featured on the DVD.  In the alternate ending of Blade 1, he's up against this 5 story blood tornado.  But the makers reshot the ending because the scenario of protagonist versus liquid just doesn't produce a big enough pay-off to movie-goers.  People go to see a big-budget action movie to see the ultimate conflict resolved in a big action sequence.  Sorry, guys, spewing water just doesn't cut it.  The resolution has to be with the antagonist that faced the protagonist with overwhelming odds throughout the movie, not with a soulness, faceless force of nature that appears in the last reel.There are a lot of other little things that needed tightening up, but enough people have written about them, so I don't feel i need to.  Granted, while there was a lot of room for improvement and the movie was too long to sit through (w/o jetting the the bathroom), i still walked away happy that I saw it.  I think non-comic books fans would be uber-bored, but I must confess, I will definitely pay to see X3 when it rolls around in a year or two.

A Gripping Saga Continues...,"As others have said, an all-round excellent movie. From the available film evidence accumulated over the past century or so, it seems to be extremely hard to make a sci-fi movie that doesn't come across as shallow and unbelievable, perhaps because we have trouble relating to fantastic situations portrayed on screen. However, X-2 succeeds admirably in these respects, delivering a deep, compelling and all-too-familiar story of mistrust and fear between two alienated groups of humans. The result is a considerable improvement over the (already good) first movie.The one caveat is that if you haven't seen the first movie then much of what happens here will not make sense. This dependency allows the film makers more freedom to develop story and spend less time introducing characters, but if you haven't seen X-1, go see it before you go see this one. You've been warned!Fans of the comics will find much to like here as well, including an obvious (perhaps over-obvious) setup for a third installment involving what is probably the most famous story arc from the paper version. I won't say which to avoid spoiling your experience, but if you're a fan you can probably guess what I'm talking about anyway..I'd give this a 9/10. In it's category it's pretty much right at the top, but you won't find anything here the redefines a genre, or that you will find yourself still puzzling over days after.

A BIG improvement over the first movie...,"I just saw X² and I must say it was quite good. It was much better than the first installment for a variety of reasons. First of all, it owns a much more deep and intelligent screenplay. Now, the X-Men face a real foe that actually has the power to destroy them. I thought the villains in the first movie were very weak and expectable, but this time there is a greater character development, and the figure of William Stryker assumes a very powerful role in the plot.It also has better special effects and better acting (Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, Brian Cox, Alan Cumming and all the others were awesome). I still do not like Cyclops, however. I think he should be portrayed by someone older.I thought Nightcrawler was AWESOME; not only he has bad-ass powers, he is also psychologically deep, being religious and all. The opening sequence was great; the tension between the SS agents in the white house while they hear their colleagues having their asses kicked in the room next to the oval room was pure cinematic glory. Magneto's escape was also tryumphant, my favorite sequence in the whole feature! Sir Ian rules!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
As sharp as adamantium,"X2 did for Xmen what Blade 2 did for Blade. This is an extremely good sequel and undoubtedly better than the first. The action is better, and with a bigger budget it'd better be. The opening sequence was mind blowing however it did make the rest of the movie a little dull since it was such a huge opening. They do a much better job developing some of the characters but i think that Cyclops is a lost cause. Storm is a lot better in this one but of course after the first, she couldn't be any worse honestly. At least she didn't spout off any cheeseball lines.The story line is solid and lays the foundation for a promising trilogy. It lacks many of the storylines from the comics and cartoons but you can't ask for too much because it'd be quite difficult to pull off some of the things that the Xmen do on a daily basis in the comics and it'd take forever to explain the storylines and backgrounds or all the Xmen. Tackling the main characters and only the main ones seems to be the next best way to go and Singer does a good job laying it all out.In my opinion, X2 is the real deal and the true hit of this early summer movie barrage, The Matrix to me is a huge flop. I don't care what anyone says, The Matrix Reloaded was trash.My only suggestion for the next Xmen film is to have a new villain like Mr. Sinister, Juggernaut or Apocalypse. The whole Professor X, Magneto (with the bad costume) thingy is getting kind of tiresome. Also, when do they reveal that Mystique is Rogue's stepmother and is responsible for Rogue's powers? If she ever gets her powers in these movies. Maybe she's fated to stay a useless, maiden in distress.Anyhow, Xmen 2: Xmen United gets a 9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

X-Men sequel X2 tells the story of a group of mutants who see it as their duty to act as the guardians of humanity.,"At the head of the X-Men, as they are called, is Professor Charles Xavier, played by none other than Patrick Stewart, who has played Captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation since 1987. Going up against him, and his band of unusual superheroes, is supervillain Erik Lehnserr AKA Magneto, played Sir Ian McKellen, known to many New Zealanders as Gandalf from Lord of the Rings. For a science fiction flick the film relies little on science, although there are some referenced to evolution, and has plenty of morals - even Christian ones. The most obvious morals come from Alan Cumming as Kurt Wagner, the German mutant otherwise known as Nightcrawler who prays when he's in a scrape and is constantly talking about his faith in Jesus - refreshing for a film that could so easily have relied on technobabble. At times the film, now showing at Te Awamutu's Regent Theatre, was difficult to follow with the plot leaping all over the place - perhaps a result of not having seen the first film. The cast, including New Zealander Anna Paquin as Rogue, delivered a sterling performance and made me want to hire the original from the video store. I'm particularly intrigued by Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) back story. If you love comic book adaptations then you're bound to love X2.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Better than the first one,"Such a great sequel to the 2000 original X-Men. Nightcrawler played by Alan Cumming has a fantastic opening sequence and an equally good ""recruiting"" moment with Storm and Jean Grey. Every X-Men (Rogue, Iceman and Pyro joining the team) has his or her moment and their mutant powers are in different ways important for the story. Stryker - the bad guy - is used and played very viciously. Magneto becomes the ""Loki"" of the story. He and Mystique have to join forces with the X-Men to stop Stryker but at the same time they scheme their own diabolical plan. Once again Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan show what they can do just with their mimics. Strongest players in this game. Sad - very sad - that the third part of this original trilogy was not as good as any of the past and future X-Men movies. This could've been a nearly perfect trilogy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Better than the first but not a great movie,"Picks up right where the first one left off. The plot is way too convoluted to get into--there's enough plot for three movies here, and that's the main problem. More than once the movie has to come to a screeching halt for exposition and it really bogs things down. Also there were too many characters--that was a problem with the first film. This time they compound it by adding MORE characters! Also Cyclops and Professor X were horribly underused. There were also a few nagging questions left unanswered--PLEASE SKIP THE NEXT PARAGRAPH TO AVOID SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Where does Collosus take the mutant children when the school is under attack? And why is Wolverine's past STILL a mystery at the end?Still, the movie did a lot of good things. They did get rid of two of the stupider villains (Sabretooth and Toad). They added Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) who gets a lot of screen time and beefed up the roles of Iceman, Pyro and Rogue. Also, Collosus has a few scenes. As with the first movie, Wolverine is center stage again (this is a good thing) and Halle Berry seems much more comfortable as Storm the second time around. The younger cast members seem very comfortable with their roles (especially Paquin) and Ian McKellan is great again as Magneto. Also Mystique has much more screen time and the sequences with her were just great.Also the acting is good, the special effects terrific and it was very touching at the end.So, aside from a few dead spots, this is a very good super hero movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Frosty Highlights and Weak Phoenixes,"As someone diving into the series chronologically, watching this after the electrifying 'Dark Phoenix' feels like a cosmic joke.

Bobby's frost tricks are a chilling delight, pun fully intended. The iron in blood scene was a witty shot in the arm for the plot.

Ehhhhh.....,"X2 is a pretty disappointing comic book movie. I didn't really care for the first X-Men movie when I first saw it either, I was hoping for something more out of the comics so maybe this one will grow on me too. That being said, this movie looks like it was made in a hurry, like they didn't have enough time to make it. A lot of the plot lines are really quickly put together and are not explained hardly at all. Also, where are the main characters? You only see Cyclops for a total of about five minutes in the movie. He's the leader of the group! I think they have strayed too far away from the comics and this movie is off track not knowing where it wants to go. Hopefully they will just leave this franchise as is, or give it to someone else to try and push it in another direction. Also, the music for this movie is terrible. Where is Michael Kamen? He made great music for X-men 1, why the change? Bummer, hopefully The Hulk will be good and put comic movies back on track. 6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A masterful sequel!,"A year after the courageous mutant team known as The X-Men saved New York from destruction, it seems there has been a terrorist attack at the White House made a blue devil-like mutant named Nightcrawler a.k.a.

Now after the threat at the White House it seems that humans are being against mutants, Stryker terrorizes the school of Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) as he kidnaps some of the mutant students so he can conduct experiments on them. Stryker also wants to learn the secret of Cerebro so he can use it to harm all mutants in the world as it's now up to Cyclops (James Marsen), Wolverine, Storm (Halle Berry), Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and now teamed up with enemies Magneto (Ian Mckellen) and Mystique (Rebecca Romjin) to try to save both humanity and mutants alike from this new menace but can Magneto be trusted?A sequel that surpasses the original in every single way! this one is from the original director/story writer/producer Bryan Singer who brilliantly brought the Marvel comic to life. This one features more mutants like Lady Deathstike (Kelly Hu), Pyro (Aaron Stanford), Kitty Pryde (Katie Stuart) and Alan Cumming whom i mentioned as Nightcrawler. The cast and crew are reunited including Stan Lee who serves as executive producer as the film saga continues on allegories on people of different races, sexualities, and disabilities.

A sure-footed sequel,"Now here's a prime example of a sequel that builds on and surpasses the original. Freed from the constraints of telling an origin story (and infused with a bigger budget), ""X-Men United"" gets down to the business of throwing more characters at us, widening the scope and delivering great comic book movie spectacle - all while deepening the gay rights symbolism (you can widen this to civil rights in general if you so choose, but it's pretty on-the-nose here). Ian McKellen owns, once again, but Brian Cox is a great addition, as well as Alan Cumming (he made a great Nightcrawler).Even if this movie was lacking, you still have to admit that that opening - Nightcrawler's balletic attack on the White House - was pretty damn cool. Fortunately, this movie surges right along and lets the property live and breathe. In retrospect, the one downside is that Singer wasn't around for the third movie.

X2 was a little 2 much,"I love the X-Men series since watching the cartoons as a kid. I loved the first X-Men movie. I definitely had high expectations for X2. In this sequel to the first film, Wolverine attempts to learn more about his identity and a new villain emerges in William Stryker (who in a way is the human counterpart to Magneto) who, like Magneto in the last film, plots to annihilate the entire mutant race by controlling Professor X.The opening scene with Nightcrawler was spectacular. One thing the first movie lacked was good special effects, which was greatly improved upon in the second movie. Action scenes were on par and the plot was certainly interesting.However, X2 was a little too much at times. Besides the main plot, there were so many other sub-plots. A lot of new characters got introduced and the movie ended up being dragged out, in my opinion, to explore these small nuances in these characters. It took away from the main storyline and left the film with a confused sense of direction.Overall, the movie was okay. Better special effects and showmanship but too cluttered with new characters and sub-plots.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"A Thrilling Spectacle, Crisp Screenplay, But Slightly Boring Script","X-2 is a visual feast for the eyes and senses.

The screenplay is top notch, and each actor/actress emotion's are better conveyed because of it. In addition the dialogue is more convincing for the more part.What let's the film down a little is the script that gives enormous ease for both sides to execute their plans.

Many reviewers here have already told enough about the plot of this film so I wont add more to what they have said regarding that plot. I'm only going to write about how this film made me feel..and that was fantastic. This sequel took chances, had a strong message and didn't back down from you knowing who was 'good' and who was 'bad'..on both sides of the coin.

"Not bad, but doesn't live up to the hype","I don't have time to write a full-blown review, but here are a few points I'd like to make:1) Visual effects are adequate for a movie of this genre, but are not at the same level of LOTR or to the level I suspect the Matrix Reloaded will be. Nothing groundbreaking here.2) The movie notably lacked a consistent, smooth rhythm and seemed ""choppy"" throughout.  Ideally, an action movie like this should pace itself and build up to a climactic ending.  The problem with X2 is that each action scene during the movie is treated as if it were the climax itself, so that when the actual climax comes, it isn't that big of a deal.  Ultimately there were several action scenes during the movie that were more exciting than the supposedly ""big"" ending.3) Some of the ways that our heroes get out of trouble happen too coincidentally.  It's always exciting to see a hero find an ingenius way to get out of a virtually certain-death situation.  The problem with X2 is that the X-Men too often get out of trouble not by creative teamwork, but by sheer coincidence.  Wow...a magical escape door appears out of nowhere just when there seems like not exit exists.  That's not superpower, that's dumb luck.  I'm not impressed.4) Problem: at the end of the movie, not everyone in the audience is rooting for the X-men to prevail.  Do you hate it when the good guy in a movie has a chance to finish off the bad guy, but decides not to because that would be the wrong thing to do?  Or because the good guy doesn't want to stoop to that level?  Then you'll know what I am talking about.5) Instead of a movie about all the X-Men together, it felt as if the movie was filmed one character at a time and then edited together.  The movie works best when we see the X-men working together as a team, but too much of the movie occurs with each of the characters in their own little storyline, which is much less effective.6) Famke Janssen is gorgeous and is the best part of the movie. Even more so than Halle and Rebecca.Bottomline:  I'd give this movie a reluctant ""thumbs up,"" despite its flaws simply because it is the ""X-Men"" and that even a mediocre sequel will attract millions of people based on the strength of the first movie.  Just don't expect to be blown away.  Personally, I was expecting much more based on all the hype surrounding the release of this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Excellent Movie until it Wears out its Welcome,"Focus is an important word. The first ""X-Men"" movie has it. It is a short movie but carries a simple plot and has no unessential moment. The sequel is full of such moments. The characters are now established so there is more room for fun. Second chapters can use that to their advantage. ""From Russia with Love"" is the best of Connery's Bond movies. ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" which comes after ""GoldenEye"" re-introduced Bond to the public, is the strongest one starring Pierce Brosnan. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" remains the pre-eminent Star Wars movie, and ""Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan"" and ""First Contact"" are the fan favorites. All of those movies had focus. ""X2"" gets so wrapped up in itself that it does not know when to quit.THIS IS YOUR WARNING TO STOP READING IF HAVE NOT SEEN THE FIRST MOVIE.""X2"" begins where its predecessor ends. Magneto (Ian McKellen) remains incarcerated in a plastic prison; Mystique (Rebecca Romijn Stamos), still masquerades as Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison), and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is checking out a location that may be the key to his past. Cyclops (James Marsden), Storm (Halle Barry) and Jean Gray (Famke Janssen) continue to teach young students at Professor Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) School for the Gifted. Rouge (Anna Paquin), Bobby aka Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and John aka Pyro (Aaron Stanford) are among the best students.A mutant attack on the President (Cotter Smith) shatters the peace between ""normal"" humans and their mutant kin. Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox), a man with Hitler-like hatred of mutants, seizes the opportunity to attain authorization for a raid on Xavier's school. At his side stands Lady Deathstrike (Kelly Hu), a mysterious mutant whose cooperation stems from reasons initially unknown.For the first three quarters, ""X2"" is markedly better than its predecessor. Character interaction is briefly put aside in favor of story setup, but its strength from before remains. The subtitle ""X-Men United"" indicates that this will not be a typical X-Men story. Everyone knew that a third chapter was coming, so we have an easy time accepting these sacrifices. Sadly, an axe-murderer mangled the dead-on-arrival third installment.The opening White House scene sets a high standard for the action and the writers develop Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) into one of the movie's most complete characters. Wolverine gets his first berserk scene. Many mutants have their own showcase moments: Bobby's ice wall, Banshee's ear-bone-busting scream, and Colossus' beat down of the military are some examples. The most awe-inspiring is Pyro's excessive assault on the police.The final assault on Stryker's base contains the best moments. It is at this time that writers Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter do not know when enough is enough. The action ends at minute 96 and the major conflict is settled at 99. That leaves nearly 30 minutes of dead space before the credits. A plot contrivance extends the act, but even that takes only a few more minutes. I am not averse to character time. The first movie is my favorite and it has the most.Cox turns Stryker into a more-than-memorable villain. Jackman again proves why he is the best actor to play Wolverine. The other standout is Kelly Hu. She mainly has to act with her face and does so flawlessly. It helps that she is a finalist for most beautiful woman on the planet.The movie has a lot of glass balls to juggle, but after the Wolverine/Deathstrike fight, they all fall to the ground and shatter. The interminable ending includes one more contrivance with cheesy special effects. The anticlimax causes ""X2"" to fizzle long before it is over.

I need to collect myself because I was blown away!!!,"Hep me, Jesus!!!  I would have to say that I do need help because I was blown away.  When I saw X-Men 2 I was down in Witchita, Kansas and I saw it at the Warren Theater.  A very huge theater.  I begged to my mom to see and I did see it with my sister.  She didn't see the first X-Men,but as soon as she saw the second one she had only one mission in life to see the first one.  I don't know if it was because the sound system's volume was up way to loud or it was my sister cutting off the circulation in my arm.  I don't know but, I had bruises on my arm after I watched it from her.  But after I saw it I bought the X-Men 1.5 DVD and I was stunned.  But it looks like Bryan Singer had down it again and is on the verge of X-Men 3 and making it bigger and better. I was very immpressed with all the new characters and I hope to see more of them in the next movie.  I also hope to see more villians and X-Men in the next movie.  My brother encouraged me to see it and I am glad I did.  I asked him what new characters were coming and he said he hopes that beast and the card throwing guy.  I don't know his name. I also hope to see Wolverine and Jean getting a little more romantic.  I also hope to see what Jean looks like and what her new powers are.  I asked my brother what she had become and he said that she had become a new mutant. Whatever she is now its going to be rocking in the next movie.  I thought that the end was very suspensful and left everybody on the edge of there seats and hanging. The best part about this movie is that it leaves a lot of things un done and left you wondering what was going to happen to the love triangle of Jean, Wolverine, and Scott.  What I hope to see in the next movie is that Magneto starts getting a little bit more serious about killing off the human race and I hope he has more mutants go along with his cause. I am also wondering when the next movie is coming out? E-mail me if you know. I would love it if you could. Anyway that figure in the water at the end is sweet and I do know its Jean and that she is still alive and kicking.  I hope that Bryan Singer will make the next movie a lot longer because I couldn't get out of my chair afterwards.  I wanted to see it all over again. Well this takes a lot off my mind.

Man is the most dangerous predator,"The second film of the franchise about X-Men was released three years after the appearance of the first and very good picture about the adventures of mutants in the near future from the moment of the release of the picture. The creators decided to repeat the success of the first adventure, made a bias in the story of Wolverine, obviously realizing that this character is the main character of this franchise. The film predictably tries to be higher and more interesting than the last picture. In most moments it succeeds.The plot focuses on the deteriorating conditions of the hidden existence of mutants around the world. Because of the attack on the head of the American state, which was committed by a mutant, a real threat looms over the shaky world between humans and mutants. The picture will show how the characters already familiar from the first film and a whole scattering of new ones will participate in this conflict, and the scenario moves will make you watch with interest the story that began sometime in the past and is closely connected with the transformation of Logan into the adamantium beast that the viewer already knows him.Acting is good. The characters are revealed again with interest. The authors pay enough attention to the characters of the first film. We are waiting for the continuation of the relationship between rivals Charles Xavier and Eric Lansher, who see life on the planet together with people in different ways. You sympathize with both, you understand each of the heroes, sometimes you even get lost in which side you would take in this confrontation. Logan is still looking for opportunities to be with Jean Gray, but it seems that everything has been decided here for a long time, because the girl has been in a relationship with Scott Summers for a long time. The love triangle does not leave anyone indifferent, but fades into the background when a mysterious man named William Stryker enters the scene. This is a significant character not only of this film, but of the entire franchise as a whole, if you know what role he played in the past of some heroes. On the screen, he was embodied by an excellent actor Brian Cox. This is a dangerous and calculating opponent. And do not think that since he is just a man, he will not be able to compete with mutants with their superpowers.The picture continues to develop the themes of the first film. Here, the loneliness of each mutant is much more acutely felt, which for various reasons turned out to be alone. Despite everyone's capabilities, it is a heavy burden to be different from everyone else. People seem to feel that such hiding mutants are vulnerable. Humanity is afraid of people who are not like them, and as has long been known, if a person does not understand what he has encountered, he often tries to destroy it. Mutants defend themselves, save themselves, but some are ready to wipe people off the face of the Earth. And this film is also interesting because three forces collide here at once, each of which pursues its own interests: two groups of mutants and people. Professor X, Magneto and Stryker lead these forces and will try to achieve victory in the confrontation.The picture came out beautiful. Excellent visual effects, decent humor, a more serious picture at the same time as a whole. The script turned out to be much more mature, and the story is full of a lot of interesting twists.""People X2"" is a good fantastic action movie based on comics. It turned out to be dramatic and memorable, bright and large-scale. This is a strong story that puts important topics in front of the audience, one of which is the equality of people in this world. It is also difficult because it is impossible to level everyone one by one. There are good and bad people, there are good and bad mutants. How to find a way of mutual coexistence in such a complex world, whose side to take, how to conduct a dialogue in such a situation. The picture will not give final answers, but it will definitely make you think about solving such a problem.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
quite xellent,"i was ever so slighty disappointed with the first x-men movie. i thought it tailed off in the last 20 minutes, which ruined the whole movie. so with this one, i had no expectations. which maybe is why i enjoyed it so damn much. it has all the right ingredients for a summer blockbuster, and more, as singer has a nice touch that makes it mature enough to be seen as a proper movie, rather than just a brainless summer movie. the characters evolve nicely, and some nifty special effects add a little fun into the plot, which isnt that good. but it has enough sub-plots to keep people interested. lets hope the pyro plot is followed up.and unlike the first film, the finale is exciting and well executed.roll on X3",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Review for the X2 Men movie,A good movie with which shows a group of mutants with superhuman powers .This group battles to fight against forces that seek to oppress them. Its a movie which is packed with action and very profound special effects. The characters have developed much as they were given more depth than the previous X men movie. The movie focuses on eliminating discrimination and fight for equality which makes it a typical example of a good super heroe movie. The movie is a better version with a better character development abd deeper themes. I encourage viewers to watch abd enjoy this fully packed action movie.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The Unbearable Coolness of Being a Mutant,"Coming out of the theatre after over two hours of one of the most thrilling cinematic joyrides of this young millenium, I can only think of two losers from this second installment of the X-Men franchise: Storm and Cyclops ... and we shall see why later.The biggest winners, on the other hand, are the audience. Being one of the year's big event movies, X2: X-Men United surely delivered on the hype, treating us to one of the best superhero film adaptations in recent memory.The movie leaps and sprints off to a frenetic start, assaulting the senses with every cool thing Hollywood money can buy, and not letting up for the duration of the movie. The story begins with a mutant's assassination attempt on the President right in the White House, which sparks an anti-mutant hysteria among the populace. This emboldens the movie's main villain, retired military scientist William Stryker, who is bent on putting an end to the entire mutant race while using mutants themselves to realize his fiendish designs. Stryker, with the full might of the US military behind him, then launches a treacherous night-time raid on Professor Xavier's School For Gifted Youngsters, leaving the beleaguered X-Men with no choice but to unite with their recently escaped arch-nemesis Magneto, hence the title.There are noteworthy subplots as well, including Iceman's coming-out to his family about his mutant-ness, Wolverine's origin, and an uncanny twist that sees a major character in an act of self-sacrifice. Finally, even the last scene managed to append one last hint of what is to come, which certainly got those comicbook fans in the know, including this author, excited and drooling in anticipation for X3, which by the time it is released should probably be getting a better, more innovative title.As with all sequels, this one is no different in being freed from the constraints of plot establishment and character introduction. And quite adeptly, director Bryan Singer, along with screenwriters Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, made full use of their added screen time (this sequel, clocking in at 135 mins, is even longer than the first) to give us more action, special effects and lots of new interesting characters.And how delicious those new ones are, most notably the aforementioned Bible-quoting Nightcrawler, and the sweet, menacing Lady Deathstrike, who gets to fight Wolverine, adamantium-for-adamantium, in one of the film's numerous highlights. There is also Pyro, played strikingly by a brooding Aaron Stanford (of Tadpole fame), who gets his own moment to display his fearsome fire-manipulation powers.Indeed, with this film, Singer comes out of the geek closet - with a bang! - and successfully tells a story much like a comic book: pulp fiction with flashy eye-candy illustrations. And that is not a bad thing in this case! Singer et al perfectly synergized, as clichéd as it sounds, the magic of movie-making with the storytelling simplicity and surrealistic inspiration that gets us all addicted to superhero comicbooks once in our lives. And the result is a sheer sense of wonderment and awe, the kind we feel whenever we see anything `cool', and we can only exclaim to ourselves, `this is what movies are all about: pure delightful entertainment, period.'This is not to say however, that the film is devoid of any real-life relevance. On the contrary, it actually echoes many of the events that we continue to witness presently: warmongers dictating policy, minorities being persecuted or marginalized and the McCarthyist witchhunts they are subjected to, and innocents being the ultimate victims. The main conflict of the film franchise, and indeed of the entire, hopelessly convoluted comicbook-based X-Men saga, is humankind's inability to comprehend and accept anything that is different from it. What could be more universal and familiar themes than intolerance and discrimination? And for balancing these delicate subject matters with something as frivolous as a blue-skinned teleporter, AND actually making it work well enough that we all happily suspend our disbelief, which was difficult to do for other failed superhero films like Batman and Robin, this film comes out as a winner in its genre.And as for the aforementioned losers? Well, the two biggest losers from the previous X-Men movie managed to make it two-in-a-row.First is Storm, who again gets the award for the worst hair-do ever of a superhero. From the original's bangs faux pas, she now gets a Farrah Fawcette-meets-Bonnie Raitt do-over, which is just as bad as the previous one!  I couldn't help but wonder what the hell the production designers were thinking when they decided to give her this hideous hairstyle! Probably too high on Starbucks caffeine, all of them. I mean really, how hard is it to just do it the way fine illustrators like Romita and Lee do it in comic books? Long, thick and flowing, and without the bangs, dammit!  I still maintain that Halle Berry, her Oscar notwithstanding, as Storm is one of the most unfortunate miscasts of all time. Ororo as we know her, and as I have grown to love, in comicbooks is an African princess, regal, dignified and tall, none of which are attributes I can see in Berry's Storm.But Storm's cinematic travails do not compare to Cyclops', AGAIN the movie's worst loser. The poor guy gets shafted once more in this film, getting relegated to the sidelines even worse than the first time. Before, he was at least took part in important fights, whereas here, he is hardly seen. Pity for Cyclops, who is actually a major character in the comic books, and pity for James Marsden, the character who plays him. Mr. Marsden ought to give the writers, or his agent , or anyone responsible for this kind of shabby treatment, a good red-glared stare.Will these two unlucky mutants make it three-times-a-charm in the next X-Men movie? This writer probably wouldn't mind, as long as we get treated again to the fantastic unfolding of the X-Men mythos that this sequel proved to be.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Superior sequel,"I was lucky enough to see the movie the night before it opened in NYC thanks to K-Rock. This movie was incredible. It was more of an action flick than the first one, but sooooooooo worth it. It has one of the best opening sequences Ive ever seen in a movie....it concerns Nightcrawler and the President. Very cool stuff. Also you see more of the uses of the various powers in this one. Everyone uses it that much more than in the first one. And for those of you out there who heard it or the rumors: Gambit is NOT in this movie...though his name is. You see his real name, Remy LeBeau, on a computer screen in one of the sequences. This movie kind of reminded me of Empire Strikes Back in some ways. It left so many doors opened at the end of the movie for X3. The ending has a real surprise to it and paves the way for, in my opinion, was one of the best sagas in the X-Men history. Hugh Jackman absoluetly rocked as Wolverine. I was a little disappointed in the first on in that he always seemed to get his ass kicked. He tears people up in this one in true Wolverine fashion. Magneto was amazing in this movie too. He seems to become a real bad guy at the end of the movie. People have said oh the first one was better, this was crap blah blah blah. I thought it was great and was an incredible sequel. Definetly check this movie out if you're an X fan.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
really entertaining,"It was MUCH better than the first one! The action and special effects sequences in this movie were top notch. I didn't much care about the first one and as I was watching it, I realized one of the reasons why: the first one was mainly establishing all the characters and their powers and left hardly any room for action and coolness. The second one basically devoted ALL of its time to action and coolness because all the characters were already established by the first movie. I also think Bryan Singer, the director, improved 100%. I thought he was wrong for X-MEN 1 and I wasn't a big fan of THE USUAL SUSPECTS, but on X2, he did an excellent job. Maybe a lot of people helped him on X2 since the budget was a lot bigger. The cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel (who worked on the first X-MEN movie and on THREE KINGS) was also really creative. I especially liked the scene where Mystique seduces the prison guard in the bar. It has really clever and weird angles. Of course the special effects and makeup was awesome (especially the stuff with Nightcrawler).There really were only two problems with the movie: the screenplay could have been better and the acting could have been A LOT better. Brian Cox, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen all were pretty good, but everyone else sort of sucked.My grade:7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A kick-ass start to the summer movie season!,"This was one wild ride of a movie!  It was definately more action-packed than the first one, due in part, I think, to the lack of backstory necessary.  The first one dealt more with building the characters.  This one had some character development, but most of the movie was just focused on getting the bad guy!I will say that I am definately looking forward to the next installment..I thought it ran a little long, especially toward the end.

Out of all the X-Men movies this one I would have to say is the best one!!! May be a little lengthy, but it describes things very well. X-Men 3 is way too short. The first X-Men movie was great but this one has much more action and a better story line and it's way more fun to watch. I love the fact that it starts from where the first one left off and it has a following of the first one to this one and right into the third one.

X-Theology,"The X-Men graphic novels and movies are rich materials for any budding theologian who wants to examine about the relationship between popular culture and theology, and vice versa. This is perhaps truest of all with X2: X-Men United. The film explores issues of identity, estrangement, reconciliation and sacrifice.The X-Men are of course a group of beneficent mutants with various powers. Some can never be injured; some can teleport; some can move objects with their minds and even enter the thoughts of others. But the mutants use all of their powers to combat the nefarious Magneto and, in this movie, a non-mutant who is even more dangerous. I feel justified in making comparisons with Christians (who were also excluded and viewed as mutants in their original culture). Some have the gift of healing; some have prophetic gifts and some are teachers. And Christians use their gifts together to combat injustice, inequality and excluded.Jean Grey was the most interesting mutant in this movie because of her struggle to remain on the same level as the other mutants, although very early on we discover that there is something very different about her. Something is swelling and growing inside of her and everyone soon recognizes that there is something very different about Jean Grey. I believe her character could be understood as a Christ figure, with the man Jesus praying that the cup would pass from him, but who nevertheless does the will of his father. There was a tension inside him just as it was in Jean. Will she sacrifice herself as well? Next, the X-Men realize that the only way that they can defeat the villain of the film is to unite with the Brotherhood--mutants who do are not full of good will. Only when all of the mutants combine their power will the twisted Stryker be defeated. I believe this represents the church's acceptance of elements that have traditionally been outside of itself. It is only when we think outside of the church box and embrace women, minorities and everyone who has been excluded from Christianity in the past, that we will finally have the power to overcome evil.Lastly, as all of the X-Men are on board the jet, Jean finally reaches her moment of decision. When she discovers that she has the power to save her colleagues even though it will cost her everything, she sacrifices her own life and even thwarts their plans to save her. I think it bears a clear resemblance to Jesus' sacrifice and of his condemnation of those who would try to fight their way out of it (Peter).This review could be the product of a young theologian who has left X-Men on too many times while reading his theology homework, but I believe there is enough familiar material to us to consider the series, but especially X2, as theologically oriented.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Half Bad,"X-MENWhen the initial X-MEN feature was released, I`ve cut it some slack because of Bryan Singer`s previous work. I`ve realized that the movie is part of this cunning Avi Arad strategy of reviving Marvel franchises that began with BLADE. But then, when time went by, when SPIDER-MAN managed to suck so much, when DAREDEVIL appeared to be among the worst major-release directorial efforts ever, on par with ECKS VS. SEVER, I realized that it is not Avi Arad taking care of the franchises. It was New Line taking care of BLADE.X-2 is considered to be a step forward. And somehow it is better than the first one. But it isn`t the step forward. It is just a healthy step, nothing else. It is the first step. Because the first film should have been X-2.X-2 has a serious plot. It has enough character development to work with audience that has no knowledge of the comic book or the first film. It really does. X-MEN did develop characters and it sketched the origins but basically it was just a plotless movie that cannot work on its` own. X-2 is a well-shaped film.The script, written by a comitee, actually offers some smart cues and fine ideas but never really reaches beyond boundaries of halfhearted hacking.The basic trouble is Singer`s direction. It`s not just that his directorial position means responsibility. It really feels that most of the flaws are directly his own personal fault.First off, Singer is not an action director. His action scenes are lame. Some of these action scenes are nicely set but they still appear lame. It`s not just the question of his knowledge and talent which is nonexistetnt when it comes to action scenes. It is also his choice to avoid the old school method of fluent action filmmaking. He obviously never goes for the visceral. It`s his concept. A bad one.He insists on these slow, compiled, action sequences where many details and close-ups obscure his inability to direct big spacious set pieces.It is a tough thing to sit through a comic book actioner made by a man who can`t and won`t direct energetic action.Besides, most of the coolest moments happen out of the frame. Check the SWAT raid at Xavier`s School.There`s also the question of cinematography. Newton Thomas Siegel uses this shady light that is supposed to bring us some sense of realism. Instead it makes al the sets and costumes feel fake.Bad staging and bad light work reveal other wesknesses. First off, there are some big mistakes in the script. Some howler lines that were supposed to b serious. The whole Nightcrawled affair which is downright terrible.Also the acting isn`t top notch. Rebecca Romijn Stamos rules not only the toilet scene that was lifted from De Palma`s FEMME FATALE. In the end, it is tough to act in such a superficial enviroment with poorly shot sets and costumes.The script isn`t brave enough to pull the Grant Morrison twist on the franchise. It sticks to the original Stan Lee vibe with some seventies revisions thrown in. But the Stan Lee vibe makes me compare this one with BATMAN FOEREVER, and it feels like the DC contender had better direction and more consistency even though X-2 feel innovative.As it was mentioned some of the best scenes in X-2 were lifted form T-2 and FEMME FATALE.The whole serious minded ideology about mutants being this metaphore for different people doesn`t work because Singer betrayed X-MEN trashy origins but failed to provide us with solid groundwork for this serious, and politically correct, agenda.X-2 isn`t a complete failure. It isn`t disgrsceful and unbearable. But it isn`t as good as superhero flicks ought to be in 2003.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Best movie adaptation of a comic,"X-men 2 is by far the best movie adaptation of a comic. The director, Bryan Singer captured the real essence of the comics, though obviously trying to stay as true to them as possible. Though the dialogue was lacking, it was an excellent film.The second movie sees many  of the prequel's mutants developing and changing in character and power. Some grow stronger, both mentally and physically while others.... well, they just go totally the other way.Take Scott Summers/Cyclops (James Marsden) for example: in the first movie Scott was protective, but very mature. In the second movie he turns into a total baby who always whines and lacks real substance. I have totally lost All respect for him. Wolverine/Logan (Hugh Jackman) has also changed alot: In the first film he was more of a withdrawn, lost puppy who only used his claws to defend himself; now he's more like ""Mr Kill and Stab everyone in sight!!""The one person who has earned my respect and admiration is Jean Grey. (Famke Janssen). She has matured alot and her new found ""Phoenix"" powers are much more stronger. She is also [resented with the choice of Logan or Scott,which to me seems would be a hard decision, as it looks as though she has feelings for both of them. She creates the most defining moment of the film when she reveals her true power, and sacrifices her own life for those who she truly loves and admired. Even though you may be baffled by her sudden ""death"", we know that it is all for a bigger and greater purpose.In this film there is more on the younger generation of mutants. Rogue (Anna Paquin) no more looks young, lost out of place and innocent and has matured into a fine young adult. Her relationship with Bobby Drake/ Iceman (hottie Shawn Asmore) has blossomed and bloomed into more thanjust a schoolgirl crush. Another key fact is that if he touches her, he'll get the life sucked out of him is aproblem and a real bummer on their part. There is also newcomer Pyro (Aaron Stanford), who is a bit of a trouble maker.The new villain is human, William Stryker (Brian Cox) who is hell bent on destroying all mutants. Of course there is still Magneto (ian McKellen) and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) who seem to have good intentions. But we all are shown that they, in fact, have an alterior motive ;)My favourite ""Bad guy"" is Yuriko Oyama/Deathstrike. (the gorgeous Kelly Hu) Think of her as a slicker, deadlier, faster. more advanced version of Wolverine. I think the film should have shown more of her and her background. They also sold her out on her lines as the only thing she says is"" What are you doing in here?"" I also felt sorry for her when Wolverine pumped her full of Adamantium.A few more newbies are Siryn (Shauna Kain) Kitty Pryde (Katie Stuart) Colossus (Daniel Cudmore) and Nightcrawler,(Alan Cummming) a blue, religious teleporter. There is also Jubilee(Kea Wong),but in the deleted scenes of X-Men 1, she has a small part. Also those who read the comics an watch the cartoon would know that she was a main character.Phew! now that I have got all of that out I would just like to say that this is a movie that can be enjoyed by audiences of all ages. I give it a ***** out of *****>",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

An Amazing Step in the Saga,"It is rare that a sequel is better than the first, but that's the case for ""X2.""  Seeing it for the first time is exhilarating--and a bit creepy, since things keep going wrong (comparisons between ""X2"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" are right-on in this matter).  The film isn't just a visual delight and action extravaganza, it's also has aspects of a thoughtful examination of bias, minority, and government power.  I've heard it said that a director's first job is in casting, and once again, Singer delivers by not only bringing back the core cast, but also in the addition of Alan Cumming (Nightcrawler) and especially Shawn Ashmore (Iceman).  Singer uses each actor perfectly (why not have Oscar winner Anna Paquin carry much of the non-action drama?), but his greatest feat is that he has made ""X2"" better than its predecessor.  Kudos to him for that, and I can't wait to see what he has in store for ""X3.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

About as perfect a science fiction feast made from comic-book ingredients as I could have hoped for.,"`X-Men 2,' the sequel to `X-Men,' is about as perfect a science fiction feast made from comic-book ingredients as I could have hoped for.  Granted it may not have the cultural impact of the first ( a challenge for sequels, especially those adapted from comic books), and it may be too long by about a half hour, but there are intriguing themes like acceptance of differences (mutants) and the equality, maybe superiority, of women (Some of the most powerful mutant activity comes from women).Although the old `good versus evil' motif is a staple of most successful sci-fi, `X2' Director Bryan Singer (`X-Men,' `The Usual Suspects') has the good fortune of Brian Cox as the very evil William Stryker, dedicated to revenging himself on head mutant professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and destroying all mutants.  The government is determined to neutralize the mutants by putting forth the `Anti-Mutant Registration Act,' which would effectively eliminate any peaceful co-existence. The parallel with John Ashcroft's ambitious `rounding up all the usual Mid-Eastern suspects' comes immediately to mind.The special effects in `X2' are as good as the best out there, the minor women as smart and versatile as any `Avenger' or `Charlie's Angel' (for example, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mistique, the shape-shifter with a brain and a strong shape), but the leads are even more astounding.  Besides the always-interesting Stewart, Ian McKellan is the wicked but loveable Magneto, and Alan Cumming is the satanic teleporter, Nightcrawler. Even Anna Paquin in a thankless role as Rogue is able to establish a presence. Hugh Jackman as the irresponsible but attractive Wolverine should remain the audience favorite and the most human of the mutants.As our WCBE operations manager reminded me, casting plays a significant role in sci-fi flick success: Stewart and McKellan are the examples here. But more than their presence are the themes, the imagination, and the energy to make it all distinctively `X.'

"Great job, Bryan Singer!","Development for the sequel to X-MEN came after the first film and production began immediately and that film lead to a series of superhero films being released and a sequel to the first film titled, X2: X-MEN UNITED.David Hayter and Zak Penn wrote separate scripts, combining what they felt to be the best elements of both scripts into one screenplay.Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris were eventually hired for rewrite work, changing characterizations of Beast, Angel and Lady Deathstrike. Sentinels and the Danger Room were set to appear before being deleted because of budget concerns.Filming began in June 2002 and ended that November of the same year. Most of the filming took place at Vancouver Film Studios, the largest production facility outside of Los Angeles in North America. Production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas adapted similar designs by John Myhre from the previous film.The idea to have Jean Grey sacrifice herself at the end and to be resurrected in a third installment was highly secretive. Singer did not tell Famke Janssen until midway through filming. The film was released on May 2nd, 2003 to critical praise by critics and fans, saying that this film is the best film in the X-Men series.I loved this film and it was really amazing to see and it was really fantastic to look at these characters and it was really fantastic. In the sequel, Colonel William Stryker brainwashes and questions the imprisoned Magneto about Professor Xavier's mutant-locating machine, Cerebro. Stryker attacks the X-Mansion and brainwashes Xavier into locating every mutant on the planet to kill them. The X-Men must team up with the Brotherhood and prevent Stryker's worldwide genocide, but eventually, in the end, Jean Grey, a leader of the X-Men sacrifices herself to save her friends.The story is more action-packed in this film and keeps me interested and makes me feel emotion for the characters and I am giving credit to Bryan Singer, Zak Penn, Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris and David Hayter and they all did really good job writing one heck of a sequel to the 2000 film and is really fantastic as hell.The actors are still shining as they did in the previous film. Brian Cox plays Stryker and he is the villain that you just want to hate. Kelly Hu plays Lady Deathstrike and she does good in the screen time that she has, but also, I will say that Aaron Stanford as Pyro is amazing and he would play Pyro in the next film.The CGI, action sequences and music are all really great and fantastic this time around and John Ottman's score is really music and my favorite action sequence is Wolverine and Deathstryke's fight scene is really amazing.Overall, I love this film and it is one of the best superhero films and it is amazing to see this sequel every once in a while and it was fantastic.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The best superhero flick of all...,"Better than Superman, Batman, and Spider-Man, and a sequel that surpasses the original. Great effects, excellent story, Nightcrawler steals the show.

My favorite movie of all time...  'til X3 anyway!,"I'm admittedly somewhat biased, being a HUGE X-Men fan and all.  In fact, they are without a doubt, the greatest fictional fantasy EVER created... IMHO.  X2: X-Men United DEFINITELY improved upon the thematic concepts introduced in the first film.  It's much grander and more expansive than the original.  This time out, the large and talented cast are balanced more economically in their screentime, helping it to achieve a faster pacing. EVERYONE involved should be VERY PROUD that all their hard work resulted in such a wonderful film.  This movie is worthy of the obvious time, care, and effort spent making it.  I, for one, would like to say...  thank-you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Perhaps the best superhero movie of the decade,"Not only is X2 a rare sequel that manages to top the original film that it was spun off from, but it also emerges as one of the best superhero movies ever made. Director Bryan Singer and his small army of screenwriters have fashioned an impossibly tight little film that grabs you right from the beginning and refuses to let go. Inventively and successfully merging the expected superhero elements with a finely tuned story of political intrigue and unholy alliances, X2 also provides popcorn audience with plenty of marvelous action set-pieces and top-drawer special effects. As with the first film, X2 is definitely character-driven, but unlike the first film (which admittedly felt a little rushed) Singer takes his time here and gives everyone something interesting to do.Once again, Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen really make the picture with sharply-defined, fully-realized portrayals that always feel real and genuine, although the brilliant performance of newcomer Alan Cumming is just as impressive. Brian Cox and Kelly Hu make memorable villains, and X2 also gives the striking Rebecca Romijn and the always-underrated Famke Janssen more screen-time, the latter of which manages to quite nearly steal the show in a surprising moving climax. As with any movie that features so many characters, not everyone is going to be featured as prominently, and, as a result, the screen-time of Patrick Stewart, Halle Berry, and James Marsden is rather limited – but they all have strong moments and together form a terrific ensemble. Exciting, entertaining, and though-provoking, X2 is top notch action.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
interestingly boring,"this movie was boring. i am a fan of the X - men evolution cartoon. however , right after the movie was released all that love faded away. however i must say that the men are definitely hot . i hate Famke Jansen. she looks twice her age and closes her mouth , can she be clear when she talks. and god why does everyone fall in love with jean? She is like an old woman. Anna Paquin is a major transformation for rogue in the cartoon. Shawn Ashmore is cute. Kitty is sweet. Hugh Jackman is sexy. the story line is good , but i don't hink they should have ever put Famke Jansen in it. That was the biggest mistkae. Just another piece of advice. stop making X- Men movies!",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Delivers everything you wan't in a movie and more.,"With X-Men, Brian Singer introduces us to the mutants with great conviction and admiration in the spirit of the politically and socially complex comic book series; bringing them all to stunning life. In X2, Singer not only expanded upon established material, but improves upon it with some very great ideas. Having seen the first film, I can say with honest sincerity that X2: X-men United outshines the original for many reasons: Case in point: Character development is highly prominent in this second installment with returning and new characters being fleshed out at the same time. There's seems a more open-mindedness to the atmosphere overall of the mutant hysteria with both human and mutant at each other's throats; very relevant to our current post-911 world. And with one of the main characters going out of his way to explain the dilemma of his true nature, that alone rings all the more true.The story is more tighter and focused this time around with a morally ambiguous government agent (played by Brian Cox) who seeks genocidal extinction of all mutant kind, even going so far as to justify the means in order to accomplish such goals. Some may say he's conventional but I tend to digress; especially the twists and turns surrounding his character and the ultimate revelation to one of the main characters which I will not spoil for anyone.And the special effects. Oh my HOW SPECTACULAR they are in the skillful manipulation of pyrotechnics and mega kick-ass action brought ever so eloquently by one of the finest craftsmanship in the business!! Singer doesn't go overboard like most action movies of Hollywood's ilk despite being a Hollywood production, but plays it straight with balance and sheer innovative technical skill required of such direction. When you have a script combined with the right amounts of action, there's a great film for your eyes and brain. And sometimes you get the impression that the powers the mutants display are not just for the action, but also for subtlety.And who can forget Nightcrawler; a charming, charismatic, bad-ass mutant and one of the BEST things EVER to happen to the franchise the first time you see him. He nearly stole the show from Wolverine!!! This gives the film a sense of a ""competitiveness"" seldom seen in a superhero flick. But there's also a human side to him that conflicts with his faith and identity; again reinforcing one of the human aspects and themes of the comics and first film.But the main selling point of the movie is heart. The comic book series left no stone unturned when touching on taboo subjects like intolerance, fear, prejudice, loneliness, acceptance, and even to a certain extent, genocide. Although the film is science fiction in nature, there is also a sense of verisimilitude that anchors the film to a fundamental level.My only faults are that Cyclops and Storm seem undeveloped but those are only minor quirks in a ""X-citing"" action/sci-fi flick.X2: X-men United delivers in bucket loads of superhero goodness with flair and style and mental stimulation. But what followed later on in '06 is another story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"A moderate improvement, but the best should still be to come","It was the very nature of the original ""X-Men"" that kept it from being the no-holds-barred action movie we all wanted.  This was for a number of reasons:1) None of the principal characters could be killed, as they were needed for the sequel(s).  So nothing was really resolved at the end of the first movie.2) Any significant twist of plot or revelations had to be saved for later installments to give them more weight.3) Exposition, exposition, exposition.Now comes the sequel, more of the type of movie we wanted from the first one.  The pieces are all in place to give us a deeper, faster, higher-octane entertainment.  Freed from the bounds of having to explain all the backstory, we move rapidly forward in each character's development (though some characters' day is still clearly to come).However, this movie again ends with the feeling that the REAL war between humans and mutants is still in the future.  The logistical problem with this is, How long is this cast going to stick with the series?",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

A Great Movie with Surprises.,"The only basis for judging this film was on the first X-Men. I wasn't thrilled with the first movie. I thought the action scenes were cut a little short and when I finally got a small dose of some fights, it ended rather quickly. To be frank, the X-Men got their butts kicked. And on top of that, they did not leave any time for some growth. The movie was one hour and forty minutes long. I was keeping my fingers crossed going in to the second movie. I was not disappointed. At a great two hours and 15 minutes, the film left enough room for character development and wonderful action scenes. Some unexpected twists and good acting accompanied the script as well as visual effects that surpassed the first one. Go see this movie in the theatres. You will not regret it. 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
"Good, but still room for improvement","The special effects were great, especially the opening scene with Nightcrawler teleporting through the White House while kicking the Secret Service.Favorite scenes include that one as well as Magneto's break out of prison. For X-Men fans, this is a good movie.From the ending, it looks like the next flick will jump into the Phoenix Saga, but what about the Sentinels, Bishop and the future, Juggernaut and Apocalypse?The only criticism that I have has to do with discrepancies and the powers of the mutants.For instance, Wolverine is supposed to have the ability to smell people. But he kisses Mystique in the tent scene as if she were really Jean Grey.Rogue, in the comic books and the TV series, has the ability to fly and is very strong, but she has yet to display those powers in the films.Also, the Iceman should appear like a human block of ice.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Not Uncanny,"Accepting the homosexuality of others is, to my way of thinking, an enriching virtue...I have people in my life close to me who happen to be gay, and I'm about as straight and happily married as anyone can imagine.So what are we to make of Singer's self-referential narratives of dealing with homophobia (it's less blatant in the first ""X-Men"")?Well, for starters we don't have much of a movie vision here, with the exception of the opening attack on the Oval Office. Plainly, a different production team was in charge of delivering a knock out first punch.The rest of this is just a flat morality play, the sort of thing that aims for a target containing ""Spartacus"" and ""La Cage.../The Birdcage"", while using big, colorful characters.Shamefully, Singer approaches this from the angle of Bush-bashing (forgetting or ignoring that VP Cheney's daughter is openly and unapologetically gay - a fact that cost Bush some support from the Movement Right) and blaming the evil Republicans for all the woes of those ""who are different""...a mother asks her son if he'd tried 'not being a mutant'...a father reprograms his 'deviant' son -- by the way, he's named Stryker after Julius Streicher, the infamous Jew-baiter and Nazi war criminal -- to suggest the US government supports this is deeply offensive.Singer is a person who is granted the extraordinary power of directing a series about people who are granted extraordinary powers...and sadly, all he can offer us here is cheap, hackneyed moralizing.Let's see Singer use some real power to take on the 'People's Republic' of China, where gays are routinely incarcerated in mental asylums.Or follow the example of John Maynard Keynes, a gay man who changed the way the world thinks about economics (whether you agree with Keynes or not), and direct his powers at things other than preening and profiteering.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Improves On The First In All The Right Ways,"As a fan of the comic from way back, I more or less enjoyed the first X-Men flick, but I definitely had issues with it. I thought overall it was too short, with not enough action, a thin story and not much emotional depth.It was as if Bryan Singer read my mind, because all of those things have been improved upon. X2 runs thirty minutes longer, has more(and better) action scenes, a good story and a kind of Empire Strikes Back tone, involving us more in the future of these characters.It's still not perfect - I still could have used another big set-piece battle towards the end and it does have its slow spots - but overall this may be the best comic book film to come out since ""Blade"" kickstarted the new wave in '98. It definitely tops the first one, and I'd go so far as to say it was better than ""Spider-Man"".My only suggestion for X3 would be more Colossus. His one brief scene was one of the most exciting.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Huge Improvement,"X2: X-Men United may have a bit of a corny title, but is very entertaining for fans and non-fans of X-men.

The second movie is much more focused on action than the first which for me is a good thing. X2 always has you guessing what will happen next with a few major plot twists that should keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole movie. X2 introduces some more good and bad mutants like Pyro, Iceman, DeathStrike, and my fav Nightcrawler. It also features some cameos of a few popular characters like Beast(Human form on TV), Colosus, and Shadowcat. X-men fans and people who never heard of X-men will enjoy this movie.

Criminal lack of excitment in the missions and a criminally bad score.But still, with an even better Hugh Jackman, an entertainig and overall good villain and villainous plot, and an improvement in the quality of the action plus a way better ending and overall more coherent and more entertaining third act, it ends up being average or mediocre.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The Moose Hole - Review of X2: X-Men United,"The beginning of the summer season always seems to open with a bang. In years past, the first major blockbuster film of the summer didn't open until Memorial Day weekend but times have changed. The first weekend of May has become the starting point now and Spider-Man solidified that with its $114.5 million opening weekend last year. This year presents another comic-book adaptation, X2: X-Men United, a sequel to the 2000 hit, X-Men. Comic book adaptations seem to be the huge rage now with past films like Spider-Man, X-Men, and Daredevil being such box office successes. But X2 is presented with a slight problem. X-Men did have a big opening weekend but started to really slow down after that with some movie-goers being disappointed. Obviously the marketing of the film will prevent X2 from being a failure at the box office but will the sequel disappoint fans like its predecessor or will an evolution occur in the movie-going experience?The story picks up where the last film left off with Magneto in jail and Professor Xavier and his X-Men fighting to protect both human and mutant kind. This time around, though, the war between mutants and the rest of humanity seems growing closer as moves made by certain people have created conflicts that will become bigger as time goes on. Due to recent events including the attempted assassination of the president by a mutant, William Stryker has sent a crew to invade Professor Xavier's School for the Gifted. But he isn't after the children. He has bigger plans involving all mutants on the planet. Now the X-Men must join up with Magneto and his group to fight for a more peaceful world. The story for X2: X-Men United was very well done but there are many elements that the normal movie-goer would not understand but a big fan of the comic-book series would. But those elements are to be expected with most comic-book adaptations like X2. This was also a problem with Daredevil, which was released in February.The cast was fabulous once again and much of the returning cast seems to be more comfortable with their rules then they were in the first film. Hugh Jackman is Wolverine. Plain and simple. Jackman proves that the role was meant for him and does it magnificently. Patrick Stewart is great once again as Professor Charles Xavier, the head of the School for the Gifted. He isn't included in as many scenes as last time but still plays an essential part in the film. Ian McKellen sends chills up backs as Magneto. He plays him so well that you would actually believe he is that character much like he did with the role of Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings series. Out of the new members of the cast, Alan Cummings is the shining light playing the role of Nightcrawler. Cummings presents much emotion to a character that you would expect to be placed in a film for special effect purposes rather then character development.Overall, X2: X-Men United is a huge leap from the somewhat disappointing original. Close to perfection, there are some things to pick at. There were some members of the cast that seemed to be pointlessly placed in the film. Among those would be Kelly Hu as Lady Deathstrike. Her character was almost pointless outside of the fight at the end with Logan. The role of Cyclops seemed to be pointless as well in this film as he was not scene almost at all except at the very beginning and at the end. There were a lot of action sequences but maybe a little too much. Eliminating one or two of the sequences would have been fine. They weren't bad, there just seemed to be too much thrown at the audience in two hours. And the ending, though magnificently done, will confuse many movie-goers not familiar with the comic-book or cartoon series. But maybe a better explanation will be shown in X-Men 3. The summer begins with a bang and if others films turn out like X2, we are in for one Hell of a summer.My Rating: ****1/2 out of 5",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
X-Men 2,"X2 X-Men United is the second film in Fox's X-Men universe and it introduces Nightcrawler, a german mutant with teleportation powers, and Stryker, a non-mutant villain who wants to rid the world of mutants. I find that Nightcrawler is kinda underutilized in the film and in the Fox-Verse in general. It also ties a bit of Logan's past with Stryker, though it won't be covered in depth until his own movie in X-Men Origins Wolverine that was released 6 years after this one and 3 years after the ending of the original X-Men trilogy. Stryker is a contrast to Magneto as Stryker is a normal human and wants to get rid of mutants and Magneto is a mutant and wants to get rid of non-mutants. I find both of them are like Malcolm X and Professor X is more like MLK when it comes to Mutant rights. Though Stryker doesn't believe in mutant rights.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

NOTE: THIS IS NOT A REVIEW BUT GOOFS I WANT TO REPORT!,"Goofs:(Continuity):When William Stryker notices the dam is leaking he looks up, takes off his glasses and a drop of water falls on it. When the camera zooms in on his hands holding the glasses there is no water on the glasses. And Stryker could not have wiped it off first (since the footage is supposed to be continuous).(Factual Errors): Magneto's cell is completely metal-free so he is not able to control anyone who is wearing metal. When Stryker comes in he wears his regular glasses (the pair he is wearing throughout the entire movie). Although it is hard to tell, but close inspection of the glasses point out the glasses contain metal. At least the bridge over his nose and the legs contain metal. The glasses probably also contain metal screws.The guard, who is seduced by Mystyique and eventually killed by Magneto in his cell, also has badges on his uniform held by metal buttons.",,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

I'm still not sure about Rogue.  I love Anna Paquin's portrayal of her, but lets face it - this isn't the Rogue from the comics.  I doubt we'll be seeing Rogue and Ms. Marvel duke it out in X3 if you know what I mean.

An Evolved and Matured X2,"Director Bryan Singer's ""X2: X-Men United"" has evolved past a great comic book movie into a great movie. Singer along with David Hayter have stayed true to the spirit of the comic book story lines (of which I was a fan years ago..), and at the same time told a tale of humanity, tolerance, and heroes. Singer has the benefit of ""X-Men"" under his belt which was itself a good movie, though very expository by nature of being the first movie. In X2 Singer amps up the action and the characters, focusing on Logan (Hugh Jackman) and Jean Grey (Framke Janssen).Logan/ Wolverine starts unraveling his forgotten past with the introduction of human villain, William Stryker (Brian Cox), a paramilitary scientist with his own personal agenda of destroying all Mutants. Stryker has a grand plan. Jean Grey starts showing symptoms of awesome and yet uncontrollable power both as a telekinetic and a telepathic-- rivaling the prowess of Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart). Like the comic this is an excellent foreshadowing of things to come-- in the next sequel. Jean also has romantic feelings for bad boy Logan (Jackman), though she is with Scott Sommers (James Marsden).Along the way, X2 creates great drama. Returning as Magneto is a very effective and strong Ian McKellan. Magneto and Charles Xavier (Stewart) form an unholy alliance against Stryker. This is a great touch. Magneto and Xavier possess the same goals, though opposed by ideology, sort of like Malcolm X and Martin Luther King. This is a presumptuous analogy, and much like the comic book it is ambitious. And it is better to have something smart to say, rather than having nothing to say at all. Singer uses some of X2 (not all of it) to comment on the insanity of hatred against groups of people solely on the basis of being born a certain way. The true heroes of the world do their best to alter the listening of this kind of discrimination-- be it X-Men or humans-- into what is possible.Hugh Jackman really powers X2. He is a movie star. He has amazing charisma. As my friend, Jennifer, reminded me throughout the movie: ""He's hot!"" He is a also a very good and versatile actor. Whether he is bravely defending the children at the Xavier School from Stryker's troops or confronting Styker in the icy forest, he is powerful. Famke Janssen is up the challenge of the evolving Jean Grey. She is beautiful, smart, and conveys a sense of honor and sadness. Brian Cox as Stryker is essential, because he is a threatening presence throughout which is key to the drama unfolding. There is a quiet and justified evil that Cox brings to the character. X2 also has Deathstrike (Kelly Hu) and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) as beautiful and absolutely deadly villains.Bryan Singer and company have made a great movie--characters, action, and drama. Hopefully, Jackman and Singer will be back for X3.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Not as good as the first one,I have just seen xmen2 and I must say that I´m not as impressed on this movie as I was on the first one. Maybe it is because I don´t like to watch actors standing still and stare as they use their powers.But apart from that the acting was good overall and I enjoyed the guy playing Pyro.

Family Fun!,"I recently watched X2 for the second time recently, this time with my parents.  I enjoyed it so much in the theaters that I bought it the first weekend it was released.  Now, I wanted to share the X-Men phenomena with my parents, but I'm not sure they really got what the big deal was.  Watching it with this new perspective in my mind, I admit the plot can get kind of confusing with the numerous characters and their unique and peculiar mutant abilities.  Nevertheless, I think they still enjoyed the movie especially for its awesome special effects.  Unlike a lot of action movies, the special effects enhanced X2's story rather than dumbing it down.It is probably a better movie if you do understand the characters though.  I never really was ever confused myself as I enjoyed the X-Men cartoons when I was little.  Nearly all the mutants in X2 stood out in one way or another. Wolverine was awesome as always, Nightcrawler was a great addition to the sequel, Jean Grey became much more interesting in this movie, and I think Mystique stood out the most with her great efforts to save Magneto and all of mutantkind.  However, I do think Cyclops definitely took a backseat in this movie.So overall, X2 is just a top-notch action adventure.  It's not necessary to see the first movie or be familiar with the mutants, but I think it does help.My IMDb Rating: 9/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A- (Almost Perfect)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant! Completely Brilliant!,"There are no words to describe how great this movie was. Much better than it's predecessor and doesn't even compare to Daredevil or the first Spiderman.This time around, our X-men encounter a military group who is bound to kill any mutants at any costs. Led by Brian Cox who has a much bigger desire to kill the x-men than before Sentor Kelley died. Where his part is now being taken by Mystique ""Rebecca Romjin Stamos."" This movie takes a very unpredicted situation at the end where Jean Grey ""Famke Janssen"" meets her end and a very wet one at that. I wasn't expecting that at all. Which this ending has led no where to turn but enter a very huge part of X-Men. THE PHONEIX SAGA. Which is nice because i was watching the extra's for the first X-men film and Ms. Janssen clearly said she never really wanted a huge part. Well, now your gonna have take on one because The Phoniex is huge part and you'll finally take the spotlight from the recently rejected Halle Berry ""Storm"" who has reluctantly given up X-men 3 for roles like ROBOTS which will be a flop and the oh so great Catwoman.Now, since Jean met her sticky end, this seriously destroys Scott ""James Mardsen"" and suffers huge emotional problems. I think he will have a hard time fighting when the love of his life fell for the sake of him and the others to safety.Anyway, the rest of the cast return, Hugh Jackman, Ian Mckellan who by the way escaped his plastic prison, Patrick Stewart, Anna Paquin, and Shawn Ashmore who is given a bigger part this time. And some new characters where added Kelly Hu ""Kelly Who,"" Alan Cumming who plays Nightcrawler in which i didn't honestly think that he would do all that great but i was wrong, and Aaron Stanford who plays Pyro and basically follows our hero's around and which evidently ends up with Magneto ""Ian McKellan"" in the end.All and all, this movie is great and shows us what people are willing to do and still be criticized for who they are.

He had made great movies until that point and now he should sell his soul to a franchise?The first X-men was disappointing in general but had some treats for the comic-buff.This time around, the search is over, this is by far the best comic adaption ever made. It follows the pace of the comic, the frequent appearances of different characters of the comic and the whole setting is just the kind of roller coaster the old comic used to be.The casting (maybe except Scott Summers) is great, especially Xavier and Magneto. And some of the kids also looks promising.Some of the minor Characters like Beast (Dr. Hank McCoy), Colossus and Kitty Pryde I really wanted see more of. Every mutant character in this movie do have a possibility of doing an own franchise, maybe with a crossover with their fellow Marvel superheros Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, The Hulk and Dare-Devil to name a few.The Marvel Universe (great movie title) contains countless possibilities, we all expect that if Bryan Singer stays on board on this franchise this series will evolve (pun intended) to maybe the greatest comic-to-film-series ever.

Most satisfying movie this year!,"In my opinion, this is one of the top 5 sequels of all time.  Rarely have I seen a movie that captured the identity of so many characters and still maintained an excellent plot/story-line.  All of the elements that make-up a great movie were displayed. Great acting, directing, special effects and story.  I can't wait until X3......

X Marks The Spot,"And there are plenty of big action scenes throughout but it's the first half of the film that really impresses. During the invasion on the school and the Oval Office are highlights. Wolverine goes ballistic on an intruding army and the introduction to newcomer Nightcrawler makes for an intriguing watch. But it's action with a good deal of intelligence. One such instance is the incredibly bloody escape of Magneto. It was so cool that I find myself supporting the bad guys and not feeling guilty about it. This new spin on the inclusion of familiar bad guys Magneto and Mystique does give the actions and emotions for the characters a new level of appreciation. I can be on both sides of the fence and simply sit and watch it unfold. During the second part plot threads are trying to get resolved and action slows down (a bit). Jean Grey played by Famke Janssen is a shining example that her own evolution in powers not only make a great finale but will prompt notions of a third film (can anyone say Phoenix :-).In the end there is nothing new developed in the growth of the X-Men. We have a flipped coin where they put Men against the Mutants instead of the Mutants against Men scenario of the first. But at the same time there is more to offer in this superior sequel. Better action, humor, effects and a stronger connection for our heroes and villains. X2 never undermines the audience and does all that is expected of it. Direction is great by Bryan Singer and though they take us nowhere new the script was smart and fun. Sound is sharp and vigorous, as you'd expect from an action film. Design is suave and the collaboration between Singer and John Ottmen continues from their Usual Suspects project. Ottmen did a brilliant job in the editing room and the scoring studio. Ottman's score had a more heroic theme than the one used in the first film by Michael Kaman. The overall impact of this film leaves you with a great sensation of a job well done. Fast paced for a long film, spellbinding visual effects and with that gripping final  well let's just say I'm counting the days until we meet again.Score - 4 out of 5",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Top sequel far better than the pretty good original.,Saw this last night at cinema world in one of their lurvley large DTS auditoriums.What a film!The opening sequence with Nightcrawler. alone is worth the price of admission. I had my reservations about Alan Cummins playing this dark devil like character but he plays him beautifully as a highly sympathetic yet lethal mutant. Hugh Jackman was as Cool as ever and made my wife and her friend who came along with us wet their seats as soon as he entered the frame.The film really lets go this time out and is no mere character study with a few ropey xf scenes like the first but a full blooded excursion into superhero mythos acompanied by lashings of quite vicious ass kicking that will stand up to anything the Matrix reloaded is gonna throw at us(maybe) .All the characters are well served this time round you don't just think you are are watching the further adventures of Wolverine. We also see the gradual transformation of Jean grey from telekinetic psychic to goddess and it is handled beautifully. I could go on about just how cool Magneto and Mystique are this time around or about how Rogue is getting a lurvely pair if boobies on her but I wont.Go see this film it's the best film of the year so far.Oh just wait til you see Lady deathstrike and wolvy throwing down that's one stinging painful fight.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Good part of it,"**Title: ""X-Men 2"" - A Superhero Sequel That Soars**""X-Men 2,"" also known as ""X2,"" directed by Bryan Singer, is a masterful follow-up to the original ""X-Men"" film that continues the saga of mutants in a world that both fears and envies their powers. Released in 2003, this film stands out as one of the finest entries in the superhero genre, offering a rich blend of action, character development, and thought-provoking themes.**Plot and Storytelling:**The film kicks off with a thrilling sequence featuring Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) in a daring attack on the White House, setting the stage for a high-stakes adventure. This event prompts the government to intensify its efforts to control the mutant population, led by the sinister Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox). As the plot unfolds, the X-Men, led by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), must join forces with their former adversary Magneto (Ian McKellen) to combat this new threat.One of the film's strengths is its ability to juggle multiple storylines without losing focus. The screenplay, written by Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris, and David Hayter, delves deeper into the personal lives of the mutants, particularly Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), whose mysterious past is explored further. The themes of acceptance, prejudice, and identity are woven seamlessly into the narrative, making ""X2"" more than just a popcorn flick.**Character Development:**""X2"" excels in developing its ensemble cast. Wolverine remains the central figure, and Hugh Jackman once again delivers a charismatic and intense performance. The film also gives more screen time to characters like Storm (Halle Berry) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), allowing them to shine and contribute significantly to the plot. The dynamic between Professor Xavier and Magneto is compelling, highlighting the ideological divide between peaceful coexistence and militant resistance.Nightcrawler's introduction is a standout, with Alan Cumming bringing depth and vulnerability to the teleporting mutant. His religious faith and moral dilemmas add a layer of complexity to the character, making him a memorable addition to the X-Men roster.**Visual Effects and Action:**The visual effects in ""X2"" are top-notch for its time, with seamless CGI that brings the mutants' powers to life. The action sequences are exhilarating and well-choreographed, showcasing each character's unique abilities. The climactic battle at Stryker's Alkali Lake facility is particularly gripping, combining high-stakes action with emotional resonance.**Themes and Impact:**At its core, ""X2"" is a film about acceptance and the fear of the unknown. It explores the mutants' struggle for a place in a world that views them with suspicion and hostility. The film's parallels to real-world issues of discrimination and prejudice are both poignant and thought-provoking. This thematic depth elevates ""X2"" above many of its genre counterparts, making it a film that resonates on multiple levels.**Conclusion:**""X-Men 2"" is a superhero sequel that successfully builds upon the foundation of its predecessor while expanding the X-Men universe. With strong performances, compelling characters, and a narrative that balances action and substance, it remains a standout entry in the franchise. Bryan Singer's direction, combined with a talented cast and crew, ensures that ""X2"" is not just a great superhero movie but a great movie, period. For fans of the genre and newcomers alike, ""X2"" is a must-watch that continues to soar high in the annals of superhero cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Better Than Xmen,Even Better than the first... I thought the first film was 1/2 of a movie. Put them together and you have a really good comic adaptation.  Critics complained about the script but they forget that it is a comic book movie. Fans of the comic will really enjoy it.  My only fear is that they won't be able to hold the cast and director/producers together for forthcoming films.

The best one in this trilogy,"This sequel surpasses the first movie by a huge margin, it literally covers up all the flaws from the first movie. The first movie was good but this sequel is so much better. This has a well crafted story and has way more action sequences that the first movie lacked. In fact not only is there more action in this there is more creative use of powers and the fight sequences are so much more entertaining to watch. This is a superheroes movie done right in almost every way, it's not a perfect movie but it's hands down a great one. That fans of these types of genre should most definitely not miss out on.

All the characters, new ones included, are well played and deep, with the possible exception of Rogue, who kind of got put aside in favor of the others(which is okay in my book).  The plot is sort of a mirror image of the first movie, but it's a subject that reflects the sort of thing we as humans deal with on an everyday basis, and an important one to boot.

Perfect illustration of why marvel works and other falter,"With a quiet weekend isolating I thought I'd go back over some of the early '00's hero film where the current trend started from & I was blown away in hindsight how sloppy the story thread was on these Fox/Marvel film were. Don't get me wrong as this as a stand alone film is good fun with some of the biggest heavy weight actors on the planet selling the story but even they can't hide just how far Marvel have raised the bar. Today you wouldn't get a plot where a massive character like Nightcrawler is an unknown mutant then 7-8 years later you see him suddenly as a youngster working with the X-Men and do it goes.It must be said that here in 2022 Marvels attention to detail and interwoven story telling is pier less

Joins the rare ranks of superior sequels,"I have to admit I had high hopes for this going in, which I don't usually allow myself for Hollywood big budget films - so often rubbish! However this was Bryan Singer, a great cast and the X-Men (a comic I loved as a kid). I was disappointed with the first film which was good but not the spectacular entertainment I had been hoping for. Now X2, this surpassed all my expectations.I don't want to spoil anything so I won't say much but the scope of the film is much broader giving all the characters a proper storyline and blending three major plotlines seemlessly. You would imagine that at two and a quarter hours the film might seem too long but that is never the case. Uncommon for Hollywood summer efforts X2 is dense with plot and characters but is never weighed down by it.The action is superb. From the moment the film opens with a stunning sequence which introduces a new character (won't say who you'll just have to seee it) to the very end the effects and stunt work are breath-taking.As for the acting it is solid throughout. Once again it is Sir Ian McKellen and Hugh Jackman that steal the film - along with the always excellent Brian Cox. However Famke Janssen and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos also shine in far better roles than they were given in the original film.My advice is see this as soon as you can because you'll want to see it more than once if you like it and if you don't then you were probably the person who never expected to like it in which case, well,  no harm no foul.Those of you who want a kick-ass start to the blockbuster season but not as dumb and plotless as most, enjoy. Let's all just hope The Matrix Reloaded continues the quality while we wait for the end of joys that will hopefully be Kill Bill, Intolerable Cruelty, The Matrix Revolutions and (deep breath) The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King.

Fantastic!,"Three years down the lines and director Brian Singer has grown much more confident with action - or maybe it's just that the old team, (with composer / editor John Ottman), is back in place.X2 is a joy to watch with a great storyline and fantastic set pieces. The intrigue and character development follow on from the first film and are taken further than your average sequel would usually bother to go.The cast look superb and once again the solid Jackman as Wolverine keeps things trotting along with menace and some pace. Professor X and Magneto suffer slightly from reduced roles and Alan Cummings pathetic accent pulls his dialogue down somewhat.On the whole a thoroughly enjoyable romp with much more sensibility than the average summer blockbuster.

can't wait for X3,"i was so stoked when the x-men were finally brought to life on the big screen that nothing could have disappointed me.  everyone ripped the first movie, but i loved it.X2 was even better.  nightcrawler.  can't say enough about him, and alan cumming for that matter.  humor, depth, awesome special effects and costume brought him to life like none of the other characters tackled in the two movies.  he was exactly, EXACTLY what nightcrawler always seemed to be in the comic book.as for storylines, i liked how they kept the plot for the most part relevant to the comic (like the role of mastermind as well as pyro going with magneto and mystique to join the brotherhood).can't wait for X3.  they once again did a great job hinting what the story's gonna be.  obviously it's going to get into the phoenix saga a bit and explain what happened to jean.  i can also see some new badies coming out (blob, quicksilver maybe) to add more diversity to the brotherhood. hopefully, they'll develop beast after his split second cameo in X2.  same w/ gambit after they toyed with our emotions by flashing his name on stryker's computer screen. colossus will definitely have a part after being toyed with in X2 (just like iceman and pyro were in X-Men).another hope is that rebecca romijn-stamos will get more screen time. not mystique, rebecca romijn-stamos.  she was so gorgeous in that bar scene, it puzzles me that they don't just get rid of the silly scaly costume and the grating voice effects and just paint her blue, dye her hair red, and give her the tight white costume that the character really has.after seeing how much better the second movie was (though the first was great), i sooooo can't wait for the next one, and the next one, and the next one.  think about it.  they can go with this thing forever.  all the storylines and characters and depth of the x-men comics... as long as they can get the same people and a competant director, there's no reason this franchise should go bad.  can't wait for X4, X5, APOCALYPSE!!!, mr. sinister, omega red, x-force, shatterstar, angel, the sentinels...  it's too exciting to put into words",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Bryan Singer is a genius,"I think people have already agreed on the fact that this is the best comic to movie translation ever done (perhaps until X3), so I won't get into that.What makes this movie so good when I total the tally can be squarely put on one director: Bryan Singer (And no, I'm not a friend of his or being compensated by him in any ways). What makes this movie better than other Marvel translations into the big screen is the following: First of all, casting is perfect (or direction is good enough to mask any flaws in casting). They're not selecting the actors based on their previous work but is an uniquely original mix of talent that when brought together, works. The cinematography is also excellent with special effects, props, lighting, background, color and mood is perfectly integrated on each scene. Plot and subplots all enhance the interesting quality of each superhero and villain, and it's not just a blurr of characters showing their super powers one after another.The movie shows that you can be respectful to the original plot of the comic and yet tell a meaningful story in 2 hours. Unlike some other movies that are just superficial translation of character's name, costume, and powers. How deep the script writing, and screen play went into digging into the interesting aspects of the original comic is evident in this movie, and bringing them into life in the big screen shows the true genius of people who've worked on it.I just wished that all other movie rendition of Marvel superheros are as good as this one. But for now, I'll be satisfied that at least one director's got it right.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

What every comic book movie should be.,"2000's ""X-Men"" was the first majorly successful comic book movie in many years, and it revived the entire genre.  It's sequel ""X2"" arrived in theatres one year after ""Spider-Man"" broke box office records, and with adaptations of many other comics either delivered or on the way.  Fans were legion in their anticipation, and the general public was waiting to see if the franchise would falter, or if it would soar.  It was the latter, clearly.  ""X2"" was truly glorious, perhaps the greatest comic book movie ever made. Director Bryan Singer returns to his creation (sadly, he will not finish the trilogy with ""X3""), and brings with him crack screenwriters like David Hayter.  The massive cast of the original film also returns, with some (Halle Berry) having significantly increased their star power since the original film. The villain this time around his Colonel William Stryker (Brian Cox, the original Dr. Hannibal Lecter), and his mind-controled mutant assistant Yuriko Oyama (Kelly Hu, a menacing presence, but with little to do). Stryker schemes to rid the world of all mutants, with the unwilling help of both Magneto (Ian McKellen) and Professor X (Patrick Stewart).  Stryker's plan involves using Professor X's mental powers to kill every mutant on the planet, and uses mind-control to get information from the imprisoned Magneto.  With Professor X and Cyclops in his grasp, and the remaining X-Men reeling from Stryker's assault, Magneto executes his escape from his plastic prison; he, Mystique, and the X-Men head to Canada to stop Stryker. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) feels that Stryker was involved in his past in some capacity, and this ads an additional level of intrigue.  Another addition to the X-Men is Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), a deeply religious mutant who was once controled by Stryker. Singer finds an excellent balance between action and character, and gives screentime to his entire cast (although some, like Professor X, are shortchanged).  He crafts some truly brilliant action sequences, the best being Nightcrawler's assault on the Oval Office. The cast is as good as before, with Berry making some improvement (but remaining the weak link; I'm not sorry that ""X3"" will be without her). I give it a 9/10, and I hope that we can look forward to many more X-Men movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Simply Marvelous,"I must say that this movie is going to be one of my top ten favorite movies of this year.  The movie has a fine plot that would stand above many of the original comic books stories, the characters are believable, the action scenes are incredible and the special effects are second to none(except maybe the matrix sequel that is coming out soon).   I gave this movie a 9, if only because the movie was perfectly in-line with the original comic books.  The opening scene with nightcrawler has already made it to the top five action scenes I've ever seen in American movies.  I can't possibly praise this movie enough... Go out and see it for yourself.  This is definately a big screen must, the movie will lose a large amount of its appeal on a small television.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Good Arrows!,Well lets just say it starts at very fast pace no messing with this. Special effects are superb. Better than the original X Men. It leaves off from where the first one ended. Wolverine searching how he became what he is. Patrick Stewart does a great performance along with Ian McKellen. There is quite a few twists in the film but it is easy to follow. It was also nice to see a few more mutants in it which did lack in the first one. Plenty of action in this one very little time to relax. Brian Cox does his bit too with a convincing performance. Overall I recommend you go watch this very entertaining. Lets hope that Bryan Singer is going to do another one a fine piece of work.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A Fantastic Sequel,"Next on my X-Men film watching comes the sequel to the original film the weirdly named X2 which later just became known as X-Men 2 and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees an army colonel attack the X-Mansion which forces The X-Men to team up with Magneto & Mystique to take him down.Main Character
Hugh Jackman is back in his second time in the role and he maybe even better here then he was in the first film. He still has the charm and charisma, but in this film we see a more feral Wolverine and this is the first time we really get to see him in brutal and heavy action scenes. Also his character has a more personal arc here, his connection to the villain is well established and adds to the intrigue of the character of Wolverine.Supporting Characters
Sir Ian Mckellen is back as Magneto and he is superb here, he is brilliant in the role and seeing his dynamic with the rest of the cast is a highlight of the film. For such a legendary actor seeing him revelling in this role is truly fantastic and he is just an absolute treat to see here. Sir Patrick Stewart is also back as Charles Xavier and he is also great, his character is in the background a bit more here but he still gives a powerful performance and it works here. I gave Halle Berry some criticism as Storm in the first film, but she is so much better here and her character is really well done and she is given a chance to show more of her powers off which is great. Alan Cumming comes in as the mysterious Nightcrawler and he is the showstealer here, he delivers possibly the greatest opening scene in comic book history and has a really interesting character here. Famke Jenssen as Jean Grey is even better here then she was in the first film and Rebecca Romijn is even better as Mystique and along with Nightcrawler is a real standout here. Also Brian Cox is great as William Stryker and is a worthy antagonist here
Story
The story is really interesting, focusing on Wolverines past and a different human angle is great and provides a different experience from the first film. The individual team members get good character arcs and seeing Magneto and The X-Men team up is great to see. My few issues with the story is that Xavier & Cyclops really get pushed into the background here which is a disappointment, also the first act of the film is a bit choppy. It introduces so much that it is a little unfocused which means some characters have much more screen time then others.Script
The script here is great, similar to the first film there is a real great blend of humour and drama. The drama I felt was increased here and made this a much heavier movie then the first which really helped make this film better the n the first.Style
The film looks fantastic, the action scenes are so well done. It feels more intense and more action packed then the first film, there is a siege of The X-Mansion which is amazing and a fight scene between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike that is better then any action scene in the previous film.Overall
Overall, this is a fantastic sequel, that pretty much improves on everything from the previous film. It is a truly great comic book movie and for me is one you must watch, after you have watched the first film.Rating - 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Best superhero movie ever?,"The main problem with any comic-book or superhero movie is that the portion of the audience that is unfamiliar with the characters and situations (usually a VAST majority) needs to be brought up to speed.  If the writers drop you into the middle of, for example, the ""X""-universe without explaining what mutants are, what they can do, and why ""normal"" humans are so afraid of them.The first ""X-Men"" movie did an incredible job of giving the background of Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his team of mutant superheros, the X-Men.  However, director Bryan Singer was a bit limited by the fact that he couldn't jump right in headfirst to his story.He faced no such problem with ""X2:  X-Men United,"" and has in the process created the greatest superhero film ever made.  And, yes, I'm counting the original ""Batman"" and ""Superman"" films, as well as the more contemporary ""Spider-Man"" and all of the mediocre (""Daredevil"") and just plain awful (""Masters of the Universe"") films to be made in the meantime.I saw ""X2"" opening night, and now, one week later, I literally keep replaying the movie in my head.  From the opening sequence where crowd favorite Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming) tears up the White House through to the heart-wrenching conclusion, Singer hits all the right notes.I'll be honest.  I haven't read the comics in about seven or eight years.  I don't know any of the contemporary stories, but from what I can remember, ""X2"" portrayed every character as accurately as it could (keeping in mind the fact that audiences would not buy any of the trademark X-Men storylines that involve time travel or outer space).  Nightcrawler, the ""furry blue elf"" who looks like a demon, had the right mannerisms.  Colossus (Daniel Cudmore in an incredible cameo) was just the right mix of gentle giant and imposing freak.  Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) was written perfectly for what happened to her character (no spoilers here, folks.  See it for yourself).I can't stop thinking about this movie, and as someone who sees a lot of films, that's really something.  Lines of dialogue, memorable visuals, and even the bit of Mozart's ""Requiem"" that plays throughout the opening sequence chase each other around my head as I write this, and this would be a long review if I put every word of it down on paper.In short, see...this...movie.  It is a truly mind-blowing experience, the likes of which I haven't seen in a theater since ""Adaptation"" (though that was mind-blowing in an entirely different way).Before I leave, here are some of my favorite moments from the movie (I know I'll leave some out, forgive me):~ Nightcrawler's romp in the White House. ~ Professor Xavier's first ""143""-induced hallucination. ~ Siryn! ~ Iceman and the Dr. Pepper bottle. ~ The kid playing with the sabretoothed tiger skeleton in the museum. ~ Pyro's outburst at the Drake house. ~ Wolverine vs. Deathstrike ~ Any scene with Bryan Cox ~ The way Mystique still doesn't quite have the ""Kelly walk"" right. ~ The dogfight ~ The Angel x-ray in Stryker's office ~ ""Shoot anyone that approaches.  Even if it's me."" ~ Magneto, his prison, and iron. ~ ""We love what you've done with your hair."" ~ Jean giving the Professor's monologue from the beginning of ""X-Men""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Kurt Wagner steals the show,"X2 ticks the boxes of what a sequel should do, and functions as a smooth transition from the first X-Men to X-Men: The Last Stand.The first X-Men film had a surprisingly small scope for the concept it introduces. It was simply Magneto and some of his mutants vs. Xavier and his team. The impact of society's discovery of mutants is barely mentioned. X2 visits this political and ethical issue, but also leaves plenty of room for X-Men: The Last Stand to encompass it even further. However, it is refreshing to see the mutants act in and deal with the non-mutant society. I also find it fascinating how satisfying it is to see a multitude of mutants showing off their powers. It's just an element that is fun to see in every X-Men film, even in the ones that are not as generally solid. Luckily, this installment offers a fresh variety of mutants and Alan Cumming as Kurt Wagner got me hooked on his character from the first minute. It also helps that the action sequences are well-directed and far from shy. They pack quite a wallop and they add just enough of a grown-up aesthetic to match the tone the film is trying to convey.There is one thing that this film did not improve on, and it's dialogue. Most of the time, it's all over the place and a little uncomfortable. This film, like X-Men: The Last Stand and First Class, could really benefit from more extensive discussion on the concept of mutants. Perhaps this is just something that was saved for the third entry in the series.All things considered, X2 is a strong follow-up on a film that mostly had its concept and the corresponding aesthetic going for it. It shows what good sequels ought to do: improve on the original while keeping the good parts.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Comics's best,"One of the best movies of the year. Of all the comic books made to film, there is only one which convinces. Superman, Batman, Spiderman, Daredevil, Catwoman, Wonderwoman, you name it, to me they are all boring and unable to bring across the intensity and essence of any of the comic book writers, especially when they copy George Lucas' idea of creating a prequel. I think the director was able to capture the essence of the story and the feeling of the mutants. The CG FX were pretty good, not great but good. The actors, cinematographers, and producers did a pretty good job at creating the picture and realize the directors vision. The script was well written and the cast well chosen. ""X-Men"" is a good movie, not like the Godfather but definitely the best of all comic books brought to life by film. Entertaining and worth the money. If you're a sci-fi/fantasy/comic fan, definitely a must! Rating: 8 out of 10",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
simply the best,"There is no possibility for Hollywood to have better hq-based movie than this one. Bryan Singer said ""X-Men"" (1) is a trailer of ""X2"". I say it's a teaser trailer. If you are a fan of the hq series, you're gonna love this movie: it matches perfectly with the comic-book stories, with a lot of revelations and amazing action scenes. And the direction and screenplay couldn't be better.But, if you don't know anything about the mutants, it's better for you to see the first movie before seeing the second. If you know something about the mutant's stories, it's still good to be seeing the first one before seeing the second, but I think you'll understand it.X-Men 2 is one of the best action thrillers ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This is what the first should have been,"Wow, it's amazing what infusing a bit of good writing will do to make a film great instead of bland. Like a chef who finally decides to invest in great raw materials instead of relying solely on his own prowess, Singer decides to employ some creative script writers that manage to harness the more serious undertones of the Xmen comic books. Tragedy and intrigue, combined with awesome over-the-top super hero battles are what make the source material stand out on the comic rack, and so too does it make this second part of the trilogy. Here a menace is fast approaching the Xmen, and a full out assault on the X mansion plus several traitorous mutants make our hero's take stock of their efforts on behalf of the ""normal"" human population they seek to protect.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
X MEN ALWAYS,X men is unmatched wolverine will forever be one of my fan favorites and this was the perfect sequel. If I had the choice to change things I wouldn't the way this movie built its story is truly a time grabber. Would you believe at the the time of release for this masterpiece I was in grade 2 even prompted me to buy the PlayStation one video game and it was life changing. I feel as though cyclopes s portrayal gave us a deeper look into his life and his more vulnerable side which was classic. The death of jean was heartbreaking the sacrifice she gave laying it all on the line to ensure the team makes it gotta love x men for true genius.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
top notch,Good movie I love characters such as magneto in the movie. I have been watching the movie since childhood. I really enjoy watching the movie over and over Again. May you keee with the X-Men series . Another character that I really liked is Logan. The way he regenerated from damage was absolutely awesome. If you can create sort of a series of X-Men that can have seasons it will be wonderful. Professor x was also a well crafted character . The way he could read other mutant minds was quite phenomenal. Also other characters such as rougue though she was a powerful character though being on the wr.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
A definite improvement; one of the best in the series and the superhero genre as a whole.,"'X-men 2 (2003)' is a definite improvement upon the first, making it the rare sequel that surpasses the quality of the original. It's incredibly entertaining because it features visceral action and compelling character depth in equal measure. It's consistently enjoyable, but maintains a layered narrative approach that set its predecessor apart from others in the genre (which was still young at this point). This time, Singer really lets loose with the action sequences and provides some memorable, well-choreographed and genuinely tense scenes far improved from the first. This is perhaps the best film in the series - the main 'X-men' series, that is, as 'Logan (2017)' knocked it out of the park entirely - and ranks among the best in the superhero genre. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The 2nd of is better then the 1st,X men is a great movie. This is better. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. It has a lot of action. 7.5 is a good ratting. But this is such a good movie that 7.5 is underrating it. I give it 9. X men the last stand is better. X men origins wolverine is also better. X men first class is better. Wolverine is better. X men day of future past is better. X men apocalypse is also better. But still this a good movie. See it. It is one of the best action movie from 2003. has fare has time goes this is the fourth X men movie. See it. It is a great movie. This is a very cool movie. I give a 9.

Dated Pointless Rubbish,"Iam sorry but i had to give this a one just to help bring the overall score down a bit. 7.7 your having a laugh. I would of probably of rated this a 5, very average.I will admit i only watched the last 20 minutes of this film but thats all i need for me to rate a film because i am that good at telling what a good film is from an average film to a dam right piece of crud.Honestly when i turned over to this film and saw that spaceship and saw storm doing her wind and water magic i laughed and said surely the sequel must been some low budget film that some newbie director made. A bit like War Of The Worlds 2. But to my amazement it weren't.Honestly the special effects are so crap that i reckon the director and producer were on the fiddle. And whats all this DNA mutation speech at the end, its inaccurate and wrong, whats the point on talking about the worlds evolution when this film ain't even real. Evolution will never evolve to where you have men firing laser beams out their eyes or controlling the weather with their hands.Cheap rubbish film the cartoon series is far better.

A sequel that outshines the original.,"An attempt on the Presidents life doesn't help the X-men's cause for peace between mutants and mankind. Magneto is still up to no good and a new enemy surfaces, Stryker, who seems to have a past with Wolverine. Wolverine tries to find answers to his past through this mysterious man who wants to kidnap mutants.X2 opens with a bang and is one of the best scenes in the entire trilogy. We are introduced to a popular x-men character, who is visualized perfectly and is one of the best character adaptations the films have ever done and the sequence itself is entertaining. So much that it immediately grabs you and tells you that this film is a sequel that outshines the original and it does. Bryan Singer took the flaws of the original and fixed them here, he makes a sequel that is not only bigger, but better. Many times sequels fall under it's own need to do things on a grander scale, but here it works.We are introduced to some new characters, such as Nightcrawler, Pyro and Lady Deathstrike. All three of these characters shine in this film and elevate it to making this sequel the best in the series. Deathstrike has a brutal and violent fight scene with Wolverine, it seems he has finally me his match this time around. Styker is played by Brian Cox, he is deliciously evil and a nice face to see against the x-men then just having it be Magneto again.The action sequences are better here, more rough and tough. They are choreographed to make it not only more real, but more entertaining. They fit the comic book form a little more here than in the previous installment. The risk in this film seems a bit greater as well, the stakes are risen in the sequel and it makes us care more about the characters and the outcome then what one would initially think.Halle Berry and her role as Storm is still one of the weakest parts of the series. Her lines fall flat and her sincerity doesn't seem genuine. Her bits with Nightcrawler seem forced and she somehow manages to take one of the coolest characters from the comics and make her quite lame here. James Marsden improves here as Cyclops, he has more emotional baggage to carry here than last time. It's always hard to act when your eyes are covered, I give him credit despite having less screen time.This film is darker, not everyone makes it out alive. It sets up one of the best story lines the comics have ever introduced, the Dark Phoenix Saga. The script is tighter as is the acting. Rogue is still an annoying teen, but she has matured a bit since last time. The special effects are improved and the direction is more polished. If I were to point anyone into the direction of an x-men film, this is the one I'd tell them to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Great...The Marvel Universe has never been better captured...,"X2 is, in many ways, the movie X-Men could have been but wasn't.  The story is crisp and very well-paced (at about 2 and a quarter hours running time, the film just seems to fly by).  The characters seem much better developed, and the acting is much better than typical genre fare.That Hugh Jackman is becoming a huge star should come as no surprise with his work here.  And McKellen (his interactions with Romijn-Stamos and Stanford are absolutely priceless) and Stewart are even better than before, with Brian Cox a more than welcome addition to the cast.  Alan Cumming makes Nightcrawler more real than I would have hoped and even Halle Berry adds much more depth than she had been previously permitted(in a role likely beefed up after her Oscar).  Although Raimi's ""Spiderman"" came closer to achieving the feeling of that particular character, X2 is perhaps the best embodiment of the Marvel Universe put on film.The ending actually had me light up with glee at the mere suggestion of something lurking beneath the surface of Lake Alkali.  Never has a film made the world of the fanboy more accessible and admirable than X2.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
x-men 2 is the sexiest movie ever,"X-Men 2: United is seriously the sexiest movie I have ever seen.  If you need an example, of the scene when Magneto was standing in the second Cerebro...  mmm...

X-men great Sequel for fans,"They've done a great franchise justice, to not let the fans down. That's my response to Singer's X-Men films; they're slick, funny, emotive and a real blast to watch. Without overdrawn character introductions and explanations, X2 launches right into seventh gear and doesn't let up.Admirably, the film allows the majority of its characters a genuinely engaging story-line amongst the bigger picture, and although the story is not without its fault (using Cerebro as a major plot point two films in a row is like building the second Death Star in Return of the Jedi; been there, seen it before) it is certainly worthy of high praise. It's amazing that in just two films we already have a real appreciation for the relationships between such a considerable group of characters, and it is for the continued development of these relationships - and not the cool story line and action sequences - that makes me look forward to another X-film.I would love to say that it's the casting that makes the films so brilliant - and it's true, the casting is great - but a couple of these characters have been woefully miscast. Iceman stood out for me, bringing an uncomfortable Backstreet Boy vibe to the role, and although his role in X2 is small, James Marsden just doesn't seem to have it in him to hold a commanding and authoritative position among the X-men as Cyclops. In the first X-Men film he managed to at least stand beside the Wolverine with some great gags, but he's been left in the gutter for X2, and in the single scene toward the end of the film where Marsden is allowed to genuinely act, his emotional response feels awkward and forced. I am sure he is capable of more than this, and hopefully when X-Men 3 comes around he'll have more to work with. I've never been happy with Halle Berry as Storm, and she looks bored out of her skull in this film. I hope not to see her return.Thankfully, most of Singer's new cast are admirable. The recast Pyro is great and Nightcrawler is fantastic. In fact, Alan is the only actor in the film who comes close to matching the quality of Jackman's Wolverine and McKellen's Magneto. These wonderful actors all appear to genuinely revel in portraying their characters. Janssen steps her performance up a notch too and it helps the film no end. I really hope to see her in the next film.Ultimately, there are just a few slip-ups here in an otherwise classy and supremely entertaining film. With such an established canon of characters everyone is going to have their own opinion on how particular character should be portrayed, and for the most part X-2 does the job. Hopefully the bugs will be ironed out and we'll see a sequel of equal or greater quality in a few years. I'm certainly excited at the prospect.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Sweet bliss,"this may come across as some fanboy rambling, but i really don't care. this is the best movie i have seen this year, hands down. to say that this was an improvement over the first installment would be a gross understatement. my one and only complaint about this movie is that now i have to wait, impatiently, hopefully and dedicatedly for the, dare i dream, third installment in the x-men franchise. with the multitude of characters inhabiting the marvel universe from which to choose, the possibilities are endless for not only a continuation of the x-men series, but also for any other of the marvel characters. with the star wars saga drawing to a close (long-windedly and thankfully, thanks to the abysmal episodes I and II), we need a new mythology for the new millennium. marvel comics has provided meaningful escapism through it's comics for decades. now that technology has advanced to it's current state, and will continue to only expand and further astound us all. the ability is there to bring the escapism formerly only available in comic form to the big screen for more people to enjoy. so, to all of the true believers out there, keep showing your support.and if i may be so bold as to quote the great Stan Lee: EXCELSIOR!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

Well they've done it with X2 (even the title is better with its gender neutrality).  A fun summer flick way before summer (do they realize it's not even Memorial Day for another 24 days?) is here.

I've heard that X2 was suppossed to be the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the X-Men trilogy, and I wasn't disappointed. This movie was much darker than the original. Many of the scenes at the military lab reminded me of scenes between Darth Vader and Luke at Cloud City. The fight sequences were great, the romances weren't cheesy, and the acting was very good. Hugh Jackman was once again perfect in his role as Wolverine. Bryan Singer did a good job of directing, throwing in a lot of the plot twists that he's famous for in the Usual Suspectes.

X2: X-Men United is a comic book genre masterpiece and an absolute must-see.,"I recently watched X2: X-Men United (2003) on Disney+. The storyline picks up where the previous film left off, with Magneto locked up and Wolverine and Rogue searching for their identities. Enter Colonel William Stryker, who has his own sinister plans for the mutants and kidnaps Professor X. The X-Men must turn to their old foe, Magneto, in order to locate Stryker and save Professor X. Along the way, Wolverine and Rogue's personal journeys are brought into sharper focus.Directed by Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects), the film stars Hugh Jackman (Swordfish), Patrick Stewart (Star Trek: The Next Generation), Halle Berry (Swordfish), Ian McKellen (The Lord of the Rings), Famke Janssen (Deep Rising), and Brian Cox (Succession).This is easily my all-time favorite X-Men movie. The returning cast is fantastic, and their roles are well balanced throughout the film. Nightcrawler's inclusion is a standout, from his incredible White House opening sequence to the legendary airplane scene-both superhero genre all time great highlights. The Wolverine versus Lady Deathstrike fight was awesome too. Stryker makes for a compelling villain, and his connection to the broader X-Men universe unfolds beautifully. Seeing the good and bad X-Men team up adds another layer of excitement, and the final obstacle is executed perfectly. There's nothing here to dislike.In conclusion, X2: X-Men United is a comic book genre masterpiece and an absolute must-see. I'd score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"""Have you ever tried... not being a mutant?""","FILM: 8.5
Rewatching X-Men 2, I am reminded of how a superhero movie should be done. While it's not my favourite superhero film, it certainly stands out, especially at a time when superhero films had nosedived. Bryan Singer and his team delivered a solid foundation with X-Men, and a few years later, still prior to the renaissance that Spider-Man 2 and Batman Begins would bring, Singer returns with a sequel that is superior in every way.The mix of action, drama, and comedy is perfect, and the story plays out very nicely. I find myself engrossed in the unfolding events, appreciating the balance that the film strikes. The performances are a major highlight, with Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, and Hugh Jackman being particularly excellent. Their portrayals add depth and gravitas to their characters, making the narrative even more compelling.Unfortunately, Halle Berry doesn't impress once again, which is a bit of a letdown. However, some of the younger and new cast members receive nice development. Shawn Ashmore's Bobby and Alan Cumming's Kurt Wagner stand out, bringing fresh energy and intriguing character arcs to the film.The quality of production also shows a noticeable improvement over the first film. The script is tighter, the visual effects are more polished, and the cinematography is more dynamic. The whole film presents as a more mature production, indicative of the mid-2000s shift towards taking comic book films seriously. The attention to detail and the effort to elevate the material is evident throughout.Overall, X-Men 2 is a fantastic rewatch. It builds on the strengths of the original while correcting its weaknesses, resulting in a more refined and engaging experience. The film successfully combines thrilling action sequences with meaningful character moments, making it a standout entry in the superhero genre.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 8.5

Better than the original,"Much better than the original. Instead of spending time setting up the characters, they are actually able to use them, having the mutants interact with both each other and the rest of the human world.

awesome,I'm a big fan of X-men. The first x-men movie is from my favorites. I just saw X2 last week. To be honest with you I think X-men is a movie that we can say that measures up to the likes of The Matrix and Lord of the Rings. The movie proved that it's a quality sequel and not like other comics movie sequels. This one had more action and fighting scenes than the first one. It also went deeper into the characters like the first one did. If you liked the first one you should love the secondI give it a big 10/10,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Darn good,"Better than the original, X2 is a popcorn action flick with brains. Miles better than Matrix 2. Everyone in the cast, especially Hugh Jackman, Alan Cumming and Ian Mckellen, is outstanding.

X2,It was a total blast watching this movie. Truly remarkable piece of artistry here. I am a big fan of sci-fi and superhero movies and I can only say this is a masterpiece. Marvel surely out did it's self with this one. X2 is a classic movie which show cases a wide variety of people with extraordinary powers and is entertaining to watch. Shout out to stan lee and his team. And the dialogue is truly remarkable leaves you wanting more. I also like the cgi which is top notch and ahead of it's time by far.In conclusion all I can do is encourage everyone who hasn't experienced this movie to grab some popcorn and enjoy the show.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
This movie surpassed my expectations in every way,"I was expecting to go and see an average sequel, with a similar plot line, but I was wrong.  From beginning to surprising end, I was in Awe.

Great Fun And Highly Intelligent,"What made X-Men great was its intense action, fantastic characters, and wonderfully intelligent screenplay. What makes X2: X-Men United great is some intense action, fantastic characters, and wonderfully intelligent screenplay.X2 gives audiences a lot of new ideas that the first movie offered, with some added bonuses as well. The characters are even deeper here, and the film isn't quite as Wolverine heavy (even though I didn't think he was overly done in the first film either). But this film also takes its time with its characters a little bit more, which is what is so endearing about both of these movies.There is a surprising amount of tension in this film, especially concerning Xavier's cerebro, which I didn't expect. The tension builds beautifully during the action sequences (and these sequences did not disappoint).I also loved what they did with the villains here. Magneto, the main villain of the previous film, switches sides in X2 a couple of times, since he cares more for the rise of mutants than he does the well-being of average humans. But X2 introduces a new villain in a Lex Luthor type role. He's an average human with no special powers, but who pulls a lot of strings to get what he wants. In fact, I felt like this film played out more like Luthor than Luthor did in the Superman films.Every one of the X-Men has a big role in this film. Every one of them was played out very well and written in with a firm hold onto the story. Each one of them has his or her own story that is told fully and completely and that the audience can follow exceedingly well.In short, I liked X2. I'm not sure if I liked it more than the first film, but both of these movies do a lot with characters that I think a lot of superhero films (and action films in general) can learn from. Great fun and highly intelligent, X2 is an excellent film.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Worth it for the first five minutes,"The characters were so much better in this film than the last.

Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are as awesome as you'd expect, Rebecca Romijn and Famke Jannsen both deserve special mention too, as does Alan Cumming. But once again the star of the show is Hugh Jackman. He has a natural charm, that few movie stars have. He is a good looking man with a great physique and he has charisma in spades.

Impeccable blend of cultural commentary and comic book action; the definitive superhero sequel,"The X-Men series has always demonstrated more promising opportunities for deeper poignancy than the typical superpowered slugfest, a trait which director Bryan Singer embraced for the first film adaptation of the timeless comic book series. And while the fear that the unique gravitas and social scope of the first film might be lost in a flurry of mindless action associated with the typical sequel, X2 exceeds any seemingly insurmountable expectations by exemplifying and even expanding upon every successful element of the first, making its mark as one of the few sequels to not only match but surpass the quality of its predecessor.What could have been simply played as an all out action film instead retains laudable cultural context, as returning director Singer tackles his source material with a slightly more fun, enjoyable tone without losing an ounce of the serious realism or societal commentary which permeated his first effort. As prejudice towards mutants becomes more pronounced and the rift between them and ""normal"" humans grows ever larger, morally ambiguous fields emerge and extremes are taken by both sides of the issue to eliminate the other, giving the film ample opportunity to touch upon issues of discrimination (Iceman's ""coming out"" scene to his parents draws explicitly poignant parallels to homosexual repression) or other issues of impressive complexity for a superhero blockbuster. As such, certain storyline similarities to the first do emerge, but these are hardly apparent and utterly insignificant in the face of such a uniformly superb work.The film's clever script balances its wide array of characters just so unlike the slightly rushed and chaotic feel of the third instalment, as each character shines given their appropriate moment without the film ever feeling cluttered or imbalanced. Similarly, many knowing winks of humour result from throwaway references for fans of the comics (watch for fleeting mentions of Gambit, Sebastian Shaw and Dr. Henry McCoy) without ever jeopardising the credibility of the film. The film similarly boasts more streamlined action setpieces than its predecessor (Nightcrawler's opening attack on the White House is a breathless, superbly gripping piece of work), as computer animation is seamlessly melded with practical effects and makeup, culminating in a laudably realistic depiction of superpowered beings in a frighteningly real world.The quality cast inhabit the potentially daunting material with a passionate urgency, fusing potentially laughable subject matter into an affecting and exhilarating work. Reprising his defining role, Hugh Jackman once again effortlessly essays the animalistic charm of the savage Wolverine, his roguish charisma remaining pitch perfect for the role. The calm dignity of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan provide dramatic backbone as opposing mutant figureheads, the peace seeking Professor Charles Xavier and ruthless war mongering Magneto, bringing class and distinction to the film and helping to sell many of the less realistic moments while also both demonstrating surprising vulnerability during respective captivity sequences. Returning cast members Famke Janssen, Halle Berry and James Marsden continue to impress, expanding upon their previous incarnations of their roles, and Anna Paquin and Shawn Ashmore contribute a surprisingly feasible youthful existentialism subplot. Despite minimally written roles, Rebecca Romijn and Kelly Hu provide suitable menace instead of simply statuesque forms as the shapeshifting Mystique and ominous villainous Deathstrike respectively.Yet most commendable are the new cast members, as Brian Cox chews scenery with the utmost of bottled fury as military extremist William Stryker and Aaron Stanford inhabits simmering defiance like a second skin as the unpredictable Pyro. Yet the film's most resonant and ultimately affecting performance without question is provided by Alan Cumming as outcast teleporter Nightcrawler. His soulful interior poignantly counterbalancing his demonic exterior, Nightcrawler serves as a figurehead for humanity's close-minded discrimination, and Cumming's masterclass of a performance extracts every possible ounce of humanity and sympathy from the character - one of the most moving and fervently felt performances ever seen in a comic book adaptation.With exquisitely thrilling action to put most summer blockbusters to shame and an undercurrent of thought provoking profundity which could give most dramas a run for their money, X2 proves an almost faultless piece of quality film-making as well as easily one of the strongest comic book adaptations ever released. Even those usually put off by superhero films will have much to appreciate, and fans of such material will be hard pressed to find a film nearly as bombastically satisfying as X2.-9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Awesome!!!,Better than the first one for X-Men fans...introduces some of the new characters.  Truly enjoyable and breathtaking.  I love the new introduction of Nightcrawler!

A Comicbook Sequel Of Standing!,"The initial movies of this franchise are true to the origins of the comicbooks which inspired it. The second film has loads more action, mutant cameos for the comic fans, great effects and hardly stops for breath.The political backdrop of this alternative universe echoes our own to establish credability in the events.Here we have edgy humans looking over there shoulders, suspicious and untrusting of these almost alien-like human mutants.The opening scene is a Tour De Force- a purple, devil-like, teleporting Nightcrawler,with fully functioning CGI tail, attacks the President of the US inside the Whitehouse.The Prezzer's secret service agents are hopelessly ""outnumbered"" by the mutants split second teleporting attacks. Great ""BAMF!!"" sound effects and Matrix style slow-mo's!!The story centres on the nefarious efforts of a Military Scientist to hold the Presidents ear and combat the ""mutant threat to mankind"".He manipulates any and all to the ends of using the Professor X's massive psychic power to destroy all mutants via the Cerebro computer. This is just an excuse to launch all manner of mayhem.However, just when you think the story might be swallowed up by the CGI and action, something else happens to keep you interested.Much of the narrative is simply to plug the holes of implausibility and the characterisations suffer to some extent.Fans of the comic book will be so frustrated by the tantalising teaser ending!This is the first Blockbuster of the Summer!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
X2 is lit,"The movie that was so loved in 2000 that it brought us to where we are today with our superhero madness. No easy task. Yet, it holds up to the best we've had in these nearly two decades of these films. X2 is expertly crafted, perfectly paced, and most importantly doesn't have one of those annoyingly over-the-top endings where spectacle takes over and everything is telegraphed. The reason it works so well is the reason any film works so well- it lets its characters drive the story. Every action is reasoned, motivations are clear, and the results are earned. Plus, it's thrilling, full of great action, and has a great deal of mystery that's been missing in the recent X-films. It's a fantastic movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Better than anyone could hope for,"Despite some reservations, I think this is a superior super-hero movie. There is a strong story, it builds brilliantly on the first film, and has some terrific set pieces. Bryan Singer controls it all with a sure hand and the cast are great, especially McKellen Cox, and Stewart who add gravitas to the whole proceedings. I love the those little things for fans (Hank Mccoy, Collusus), though I am still waiting for a hint of Warren Worthington III.(Does he still exist in the comics?) As an original x-man fan, I was kept very happy. The ending was totally unexpected , and yes I think The Phoenix saga must be on its way. Bobby the Iceman was nicely expanded, but as he was an original x-man shouldn't his parents be very old or is the comic guy now really young? Does his brother exist in the comics? Shawn Ashmore is very cute. I reckon the Ice keeps Bobby young. Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler was just extraordinary, and the effects that go with him were just like the comic character come to life. I worry that non-comic readers will be lost, but I think Singer has balanced everything so well. I wish there was more Scott Summers, but there's always X3. The effects are superb, goes without saying these days, but they work well with the storyline which nowadays the biggest task is of combining both well, which Singer did excellently.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Not On Par With The First, But Very Enjoyable","Continuing my plan to watch every Hugh Jackman movie in order, I come to X-Men 2 (2003)When anti-mutant colonel William Stryker kidnaps Professor X and attacks his school, the X-Men must ally with their archenemy Magneto to stop him.This was the first movie Jackman was paid $1 million dollars for a movie, a 100% pay rise from his salary on the first movie.I never noticed before, but Halle Berry has dropped the accent from the first movie, and now talks in her normal voice.It's big on spectacle, the budget is certainly up there on the screen, it's action set piece after action set piece, and the sacrifice a certain character made at the end, did leave an impact, as I watched it unfold, but it lacks the heart of the first movie, even if it has a 'coming out to the parents' scene.It's a lot more violent than the first one!! Considering Logan/Wolverine did not kill anyone in the first movie, he racks up quite the body count here.I remember liking this more than the first movie, when I first watched it.

Fantastic sequel that betters the original.,"The first X Men was a perfect comic book adaptation. It was flawless, keeping the action until the final act and instead focusing on plot and character development. It worked a charm and its success meant that a sequel was a foregone conclusion. Some sequels to comic book films are usually better (Superman II) or almost on a par with the first film (Batman Returns). X2 should be added to that list. In fact, it is more of a Superman II. Bryan Singer has bettered the original, and boy has he done a great job. First of all there is an increase in action, resulting in some of the most spectacular scenes outside of the Matrix series for 2003. The attack on the President at the start is spectacular with some superb visual effects, fantastic camera work, superb stunts and superb music. This launches the plot superbly and introduces us to Stryker, played fantastically by one my favorite actors, Bryan Cox. Never over the top and playing it with a realistic, yet disturbing fashion, he is a great villain and plays a magnificent part in the ensemble.Bringing back everyone that survived at the end of the first film, increasing the roles for some of the characters only seen briefly in the first film (like Iceman) and introducing some enthralling new characters like Nightcrawler, what we get is a Hollywood action packed blockbuster with heart and soul. Nearly every character gets their moment (even neglected Cyclops) and Singer shows us that not only can he do an intelligent and cerebral superhero movie, he can also do one with the best action sequences money can buy. The fight scene between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike is superb, not to mention graphically violent for a film rated 12 in the UK, the dream plot that Professor X is caught up in fantastically done and never confusing, while Jean's sacrifice is brilliantly handled and ensures that an emotional element is here that fits the film like a glove.Performances are once again superb. McKellen and Stewart chew scenery fantastically, Hugh Jackman is fantastic once again, Famke Janssen almost steals the film with a performance that is moving, especially in the final moments, as Jean comes to terms with her increasingly stronger powers. Halle Berry gets more to do this time, mostly sharing scenes with Alan Cumming's Nightcrawler, the two sharing fantastic chemistry. Cumming almost steals the film with a performance that is at one moment funny, the next incredibly moving.X2 goes beyond a comic book movie. It is without doubt one of the best blockbusters of the year. The template that Singer was working too was The Empire Strike Back, and like the best Star Wars film, we have a sequel that is better than the original that was a great film anyway. What we have here is a more confident production. Singer seems more confident at handling the increased input of action as well as the smaller character moments (Scott and Logan's sadness at losing Jean, and the moment of her decision to sacrifice herself to save her friends is almost as memorable as the action sequences). It is very rare that we get a Hollywood blockbuster like this. When was the last time you can say you watched big bangs and fights galore and still found the film moving.This is shaping up into a wonderful series of films. I only hope that X3 is more of the same and less Superman III.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Way too much fun,"When I decided to watch this, I thought it would just be a fun diversion for a little over 2 hours. Turns out, it was a highly entertaining 2 hours that I do not regret. The movie may seem a little silly for non-superhero fans, but I think any veteran superhero fan will find it enjoyable; it is one of the best superhero films (maybe top 3 when it came out, now it's probably somewhere between 5-10). The film is more enjoyable if you've seen the first, but if you have to watch it without seeing the first, it probably would just seem mediocre. This is because it focuses on developing new characters more, while the story relies on characters developed more in the last film. In addition, the humor does not seem misplaced or overused (one of my problems with current superhero movies). People may not also like how there is not a clear cut protagonist, but I think that's kind of the point (hence the title). All in all, a really enjoyable movie that I definitely recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

As a first viewer of the X-Men universe in the first flick, I was instantly captivated by the realm of the X-men.  These movies are testaments to the technical achievements available in today's movies, where comic book style action can be accomplished realiztically. These movies do a great job of making the special effects an integral part of the plot and development of the movie, and they are amazing as well.

"Not 100% accurate to the comics, but manages to be a great movie while remaining true to the feel and meaning of the comics","Although the story elements sometimes clash with the comic book story lines a little, the changes are OK... Instead of recapping the whole movie, I'll just say that it felt epic. The movie was a lot longer than the first one, running over 2 hours, but everything felt great as far as plot goes. Even with this size it is unfortunate that many characters get almost no lines. Kelly Hu for example, has none as Yuriko Oyama.  This I found strange as her character does appear in one of the more impressive scenes in the movie. Simultaneously, James Marsden's Cyclops gets relatively few lines, and at best you feel sorry for his character.But the movie gives comic fans some inside jokes, and some comic geek hidden gems.  The humor factor for this movie seems quite a bit higher, and overall the entire movie was much more enjoyable than the first.Even though the plot may seem utterly unbelievable if you're thinking of it as a regular movie, those familiar with the X-Men universe and those willing to just suspend disbelief get sucked right in to the story line.

X2 impresses and out-does X-Men,"""X2"" was considerably better than the first. I believe that it being better had more to do with a bigger budget than anything else. They obviously put more into the CGI and special effects to show off the X-Men abilities (I mean why else are we watching it?). After the opening scene I knew I was in for a fantastic treat. The movie starts with an awesome display of Nightcrawler's abilities. The camera perfectly captured Nightcrawler teleporting from point to point to just absolutely dismantle the secret service. It was a supreme use of CGI and stunts to make a spine tingling good scene. The story in X2 was good as well, it stayed true to the comic book and the constant battle between homo-sapiens and homo-superior (humans and mutants). We got to see more mutants and a better display of their skills. X2 did not disappoint and it even offered a little teaser at the end with Jean.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

The Superhero Movie Has Evolved,"Well, anyone who had doubts about this franchise after X-Men can thankfully be proved wrong, as Bryan Singer has gone and created the best comic book movie of all time!X-Men was great, and holds a position of prestige in my DVD collection. However, some have said that it lacks in spectacle.  X-Men 2 has spectacle in the bucketload.  Right from the explosive opening, which has made Nightcrawler into arguably my favourite X-Man, to the whopper of a climax, action-packed and tragic in equal measures, this movie is certainly going for bigger and better.Hugh Jackman is every bit as good as Wolverine as he was in part one.  I'm sure that by now, most people have forgotten all about the fact that Wolverine is a short, squat feral guy.  Hugh Jackman is the only way I can visualise Wolverine now.  He really gets to kick ass in this movie, particularly in the much-hyped raid on the mansion.  This is a character who keeps on evolving, so it will be interesting to see what is done with him next.Halle Berry gets a beefed-up role as Storm.  This means that, unlike in part one, she has something meaningful to do other than say a bad line to Toad. However, Famke Janssen's Jean Grey impresses more with her touching performance as the telepathic Jean Grey, who is beginning to struggle with her powers, which are developing at a frightening rate.  Comic fans will know what this is building toward with X3.Nightcrawler is a real delight to watch in this film, easily the best new character in the film.  The opening has to be seen to believed.  Going into the theatre, I was thinking, ""So he can teleport, so what?""  Man, right from the first BAMF, I was nearly out of my seat cheering, as Nightcrawler teleports all over the place, at a speed that's almost too fast for the audience to keep up with.  Alan Cumming is great in the role, going on to give the character a sense of humour as well as a certain degree of naive innocence, once you get over the really strong German accent (""my name ees Kurt Vaaagner"" - I wouldn't have it any other way) that is.  Also, its good to see that there is a Christian protaganist in a modern blockbuster - it shows that religion hasn't lost all meaning in today's society.  Thank God Cumming has signed on for X3!While Cyclops and Professor X don't have much to do other than appear concerned - they are captured for the best part of the movie, the X-kids get a good portion of time to develop, both in quiet moments (Iceman trying to tell his family he is a mutant) and action scenes (Pyro wrecking havok on the local police force).  Sadly, Rogue's role is toned down a bit this time, but I can see that this was necessary.Once again, Ian McKellan seems to be having a great time playing the nefarious Magneto, this time going all Hannibal Lecter in his little prison cell.  Its common knowledge that Magneto escapes from his prison, but how he does has to be seen to be believed - one of the movie's most kick-ass scenes.  I was glad to see that Mystique has a bigger role this time round: she also gets to have fun playing both the seductive femme-fatale and a big-time ass-kicker in the final battle.And what about the real villains?  I mentioned Hannibal Lecter before, well Cox's portrayal of Lecter doesn't hold a torch to the sheer evil of William Stryker.  This is a truly despicable character, who is so prejudiced and downright nasty that you want him to die in a big way.  Learning about what happened to his wife and son makes you pity and despise him respectively. Yuriko Oyama, known as Lady Deathstryke in the comics, is the only new character that disappoints.  Sure, she is really cool in her climactic battle with Wolverine, sadly a bit too short, but doesn't really do much until she unveils those killer fingernails.  Before that, you'd be forgiven for thinking her power was cracking her knuckles really loudly.  However, she is a character you pity in some ways:  rather than being a mindless killer, she is just another pawn of Stryker.Bryan Singer really appears to have picked up his stride with this movie, which follows on perfectly from X-Men.  I was glad to see that he avoided the trap fallen into by so many sequels, just repeating the best bits from the original, but making them more extravagant.  This movie is certainly more extravagant than part one, but the set-pieces are entirely original, inspired more from the comics than from the original movie.  That doesn't mean that the original film is ignored: far from it.  This movie links very closely to the events of part one, so you need to see that before seeing this.It's interesting that this is a movie about evolution, as with its release, Singer has brought about the next evolution in the superhero flick, setting a standard that will be hard to top.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Yet more trash,"""X2"" is the same as all the other X_Men movies to date. {We are watching them in chronological order} The premise is, we meet ""superhero"", superhero does not get on with other superhero's, superhero mets bad guys and gets arse kicked to shreds, things look over for ""good guy"" theta the last minute, superhero good guy comes back from the brink and wins against the stronger bad guys.

X-Men 2 packs twice the amount of adamantium to make a stronger sequel.,"Bigger, better, bolder and quite simply brilliant. Not only is this the best 'X-Men' instalment, and yes I'm controversially including 'Logan' as well, but one of the best superhero films of all time. Now that the foundations have been built from its predecessor, Singer is able to build upon the relationships within the mutant world to create an infrastructure that boasts impeccably executed action and dark twists. A genocidal colonel leads an assault on Xavier's school so that he can build his own version of Cerebro, capable of destroying every mutant on the planet. What really makes this film claw its way above the rest, is its various storylines. The primary plot being the prevention of Stryker's Cerebro, one that allows Cox to be an enigmatic and memorable villain. Enabling the X-Men to unite and develop their relationships even further without being detrimental to the main story. This includes Jean Grey's uncontrollable powers, Rogue and Iceman's romance, Pyro's hatred for humans (although slightly underdeveloped) and Nightcrawler's Catholicism. Lesser subplots that give life to these characters, preventing them from being wooden superheroes. Singer's balance between each subplot was near perfect, with the focus still being on Wolverine and his attempts at finding solace. This ensemble cast contains an array of captivating performances, particularly Jackman, Stewart, McKellen and Cox, that allow their characters to be investing. The action sequences limit the amount of visual effects and create some well choreographed scenes, especially when Wolverine battles Lady Deathstrike. I do take issue with the underwhelming ending, forcing a sacrifice upon a character just to quantify a sequel (to which they easily could've survived). This then results in the concluding ten minutes losing that sharp pacing. Oh, and Paquin still can't act. Still, this sequel achieves that rare feat by bettering its predecessor by a substantial margin. Just a shame that the franchise peaks on the second film...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
I want to be a mutant!,"Excellent movie! Out of all the mutants... Magneto rocks. Nightcrawler was fantastic. Wolverine carved up plenty of cannonfodder and Mystique, what a babe.

Great scenes + great characters = decent movie?,"I was quite enthusiastic about seeing X2, and for the most part I left quite satisfied with the results.  I'm not quite ready to say that this film exceeds the first movie.What we have here is a set of undeniably cool characters and fantastic scenes, but they are sewn together in predictable and almost cliche patterns.  Adding to the hurt is the fact that I watch movie trailers closely, and any big surprises this movie intended to deliver were drastically softened by the scenes shown there.  That may be unfair, but big blockbuster movies like this that plan on inundating people with marketing material should be more careful with what they reveal.  When you see 10-15 commercials plus 2-3 trailers for a movie, you are going to pick up on a lot of things unless you take better care to hide them.  Shame on the production team for that.Character portrayals are quite good individually, but interactions are a little off.  Magneto and Mystique pull off the best chemistry in the movie amongst the characters from the first movie.  The scenes with Stryker where he interacts with Wolverine, Magneto, or Professor X are surprisingly good, pulling off a sense of real history that characters from the first movie got for free.  Other areas suffer.  Iceman's dealings with his family fell flat for me.  That should have been a pivotal scene, but it played out like a clip from 90210.  Luckily that scene doesn't last long.The bad chemistry moments aren't really that bad, and they're quite hard to notice with all the action going on.  You rarely get a chance to breath before someone flexes their mutant powers for some reason.  Unfortunately, these displays of power often feel disjointed, like a bad fight scene. Punch, block, punch, block.  It feels like the script was divided up into one section for each mutant to show off his or her powers.  This gives the film overall an awkward flow.  The sheer coolness of most of these scenes tends to outweigh this awkwardness.  I'm going to rate this film an 8 out of 10 because I really did enjoy myself while watching it.  However I think that if I wait another week to review this film, it will drop to a 7.  The reason is because any thought after-the-fact on this film only further exposes its weaknesses, and that really isn't fair to a film that delivers some devastatingly good popcorn fun.My advice would be to see this film without high expectations, and don't let the occasional brilliant scene get your hopes up for a smart film.  Set your brain on autopilot and bask in the great action.  In the end, the plot really doesn't fly, but pretty much everything else does, and marvelously. The opening scene alone should go down in history as one of the best fight scenes ever.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Well deserved praise,"I was very pleasantly surprised. By everything from the overall plot to the character cameos. There was one hair-splitting flaw. Certain characters were used too much and others not to their potential. The reasoning seems justified to those ""in the know"" once you realize that Singer and company are setting up a cliffhanger of sorts for the next installment, but certain events could have been avoided with proper execution of characters' abilities. That's a mild criticism compared to the rollicking good time I had at this one. Much better than the first movie and the effects were awfully cool. Overall, well worth the price of admission.

"eXcelent, eXtrodinary.","The wait is finally over for all the fans of the comic book saga from Stan Lee. The sequel from one of the major blockbuster hits of 2000 has arrived; and it isn't to much to say that it has surpassed the original. By that, this movie makes history being one of the first, IF NOT THE FIRST sequel to actually manage to be better than the original. The budget is bigger, the cast is larger and better, the plot is deeper, the action and the situation are more compelling and the special effects, although outstanding, do not treat the plotline or the characters as secondary. X2 picks up where X Men left wrapped up, so the characters have little evolution from the previous situation they were: still unaccepted by society and now with a bigger problem: General William Stryker, a cold hearted man full of rage by his wife's death due to their son's mutation problem, goes much further than Senator Kelly ever did. He wants to use Professor Xavier and his Cerebro to put down every living mutant on the face of the earth, so things can come back to normality. All the previous characters and actors are back, this time better looking and with expanded roles and screen time. It's not to much to say that X Men is everything Spider Man could have been and isn't. It is already a new Star Wars saga, because the wonder, the beauty, the action and the actors manage to attract unfamiliared viewers, what also contributed to this success was the fantastic trailer, that was undoubtely the best trailer of the year, and actually didn't steal to much of the movie, because it still had much to give. Every one involved in the project specially the actors  should be congratulated for their work, most specially Hugh Jackman for his excellent composition of Wolverine.

Bears the grace and charm of a comic book,"X2: X-Men United plays, feels, and consistently moves with the grace and charm of a comic book, and that's about the highest compliment one could pay to a film of the superhero genre. Riddled with sublime special effects, some characters we can further invest in, and drama and subtext that is further elaborated to provide for a viewing that requires us to keep our brains on, if you catch my drift.The story reacquaints us to Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and his team of loyal X-Men, who fight for the idea that humans and mutants, those with extraordinary, life-altering powers, can live harmoniously together. However, there has been a great deal of anti-mutant ideology being peddled by Congress and the general public, specifically lead by Col. William Stryker (Brian Cox). Stryker pushes for a mutant genocide, believing that humans shouldn't have to share their planet with mutants in any way.Of course this calls for some form of combat, which is where our uncanny X-Men come in. The clawed-Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), the easily-underestimated Storm (Halle Berry), the telekinetic Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), and the shy but imitable Rogue (Anna Paquin) attempt to lay to rest these ideas, and also, once again, stop Magneto (Iran McKellen) from yet another bout of attempting to have mutants control the universe Much of X2's success is attributable to the talent of director Bryan Singer, who pulls most of the same punches he used to get the first film off the ground. The only difference is with X2 is that he does things a little bit bigger in size and scope, with larger action setpieces, new characters to meet, and the characters we already met being further expanded for stronger character depth.The special effects, for me, are what stood out more in this second installment. Singer never missed a beat when it came to filming large, grandscale action in the original X-Men and never does he misstep here. Singer's action, combined with the strong editing work of John Ottman and Elliot Graham, possesses a rare fluency to it, where action exists as something to look forward to and utilize in addition to character development, plot, and thematic resonance. Too often is it utilized and exploited in place of those things rather than working harmoniously with the additional devices - like humans and mutants should.It also helps that the look of the film is crisp and clean thanks to cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel. Sigel captures everything Singer wants to include in X2 with a beautiful look and style, effectively mirroring the camaraderie on screen with the aesthetic, appeal, and kinetic movement of a comic book. The film doesn't go for the similar, more blatant style of comic book mimicking as seen in Ang Lee's Hulk, which would release theatrically about a month later than X2, which attempted to create the feel by using the picture-in-picture method. Yet, both films find ways to succeed using their own style, with Singer and Sigel's route to a comic book providing for consistent fun and enjoyment.On a film note, one cannot neglect the performances at hand here. Jackman, once again, works well at playing a character we find it difficult to have sympathy for at times, while at others, being effortlessly fun and likable. Paquin still nails the subtle facial and body communications of Rogue, while Berry and Janssen continue to fit well in their assigned roles. Throw in Ian McKellen for good measure and you have a complete package for X2 After watching the first two installments of the X-Men franchise, the sole word I can conjure up is ""impressive."" Who would've thought that two films concerning mutants, bearing a heavy emphasis on special effects but not neglecting the human element of the story nor the thematic ideas of discrimination, would live up even after a decade? The fact that the first two X-Men films possess more elements than incredible, bombastic special effects ensures a longer lifespan than your average blockbuster, many of which have a hard time bringing much else besides their looks to the table.Starring: Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, Anna Paquin, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Alan Cumming, Brian Cox, and Bruce Davison.

Absolutely Amazing!!!,"The first X-Men film was a superb movie, yet it didn't strike me as a true-hearted comic movie. X2 did (especially since its based off of an actual graphic novel). I had more comic-geek moments than I've ever had in a comic movie. Yet there is more to this than the typical comic geek reaction...The movie is character-driven, and that is the best strength any film can rely on. Some characters sadly are left behind, Rogue and Cyclops, while others are expanded on and introduced. I was disappointed that Rogue didn't get more screentime...but they did introduce Nightcrawler who is superbly acted by Alan Cumming. He starts the rollercoaster with the Whitehouse scene and that is by far one of the best fight scenes in cinematic history. (Neo eat your heart out).Hugh Jackman once again shows why he was the best and only choice for Wolverine...incredible. If Singer had focused on him a bit more this film, it would've been even better. (Though I'm sure not complaining).Overall, this follow-up to the first is very much like they way Empire Strikes Back and The Wrath of Khan. It improves on the original by leaps and bounds, and opens the doors to new and higher ideas. Go watch it several times, in fact, see it at least 3 times to catch all the little Easter Eggs you missed before. (Remy LeBeau, the Sentinels project, etc etc etc)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

x1 versus x2,"Unfortunately, I watched x1 and was completely and totally thrilled with what they had been able to do.  The adaptation from comic book/cartoon was absolutely astounding.  The way the film maker was able to duplicate the special mutant abilities of all the characters AND keep the human relationships involved made x-men 1 a hands down 10!!!That said, x-men 2 got a 5 from me.  There were some great action scenes *although too dark to see most of what was happening* and a much more serious feel to x2.  But one of the best attributes of x1 was that Wolverine was the focus of the movie.  In x2, Wolverine didn't play near as big of a role as he did in x1.  Normally that wouldn't have been a problem, but there was no one in the movie to take Wolverine's place.  It felt like there was just a big hole in the movie with action taking place but no focus for it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
X-hilarating!The Best Yet!,"This movie was awesome! I don't think this as the sequel, its more similar to the movie. The first X-men was more of an introduction to the 'war'.The movie has everything: From awesome actors, to an extravagant mind boggling plot that will take you on an adventure that will reel you beyond your wildest imaginations. X2 tries to give a bit more of screen time, this time, to most of the important characters. Fans will be extremely pleased because Colossus gets a bit of screen time too! There is a bit of romance, but its not all out. We see a relationship develop with Rogue and Iceman. Ofcourse Rogue does still have a girlish crush on Logan. It's hard not to.Girls if you love Hugh Jackman, this is the film to watch.  There will be just a tiny scene with him and Jean Grey... Jackman, again, does a wonderful job portraying Wolverine. The film combines humor and action to create a film that is unforgettable. The casting is superb and nobody can miss the fighting scenes especially with Nightcrawler in the whitehouse and the fight Wolverine has with Lady Deathstrike. The fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike is fleshtearing and very painful to watch. The fight is intense and moviegoers can't help but wince everytime Deathstrike stabs Wolverine. Special Effects was awesome, the movie excelled beyond my wildest imagination. All and all, this is one amazing film with awesome special effects. It is not to be missed!

Excellent. More than worth the $10,"For those of us who grew up on these comics, this movie is a dream come true.Nightcrawler, always my personal favorite, is well-acted by Alan Cummings, even though his unexplained religiousness is a little annoying. He shows a little chemistry with Halle Berry's Storm, still underused, though it's great to see her finally cut loose with her powers.And speaking of cutting loose, Wolverine kicks some serious ass in this one. The Deathstryke fight is a major highlight of this one.With all the different characters, some suffer from lack of development. That being said, the fact that there is character development is a testament to Brian Singer's abilities as a writer and director. The film is an excellent balance between effects and drama, character and spectacle, and action and introspection. The scene at Iceman's home is a perfect example of this balance, with a little of everything.Brian Cox' portrayal of the villian Stryker is the standout performance of X2. Just when you think he couldn't be more of a scumbag, he reveals his most disturbing crime, which I won't reveal.An excellent movie with something for everyone.

A GREAT comic-based movie sequel!,"Being one of the first people around the world to see X2 in the theaters, I left the movie house this afternoon HIGHLY IMPRESSED.X2, or ""X-Men 2"" as the way it is branded here in the Philippines, is truly a GREAT sequel especially for the comic-based movie genre. For movies in general, X2 is also an impressive sequel.What makes X2 great? For the most part, the story is the main factor of the greatness. Being a comic collector years ago, my expectations and demand for quality story making in X-Men has always been high and the great thing is that this sequel's story is very well made.Unlike the first X-Men, X2 is presented with a more matured toned and the story always makes sense concentrating on the conflict between humans and mutants. The characters are also very well presented in delivering the atmosphere of the X-Men universe and this time around the relationship between Professor X and Magneto has been explored even deeper thus blurring the boundary between good and evil. Hugh Jackman's performance as Wolverine has IMPROVED this time around and the same goes with Rebecca Romjin-Stamos as Mystique. But most notable among all is Sir Ian McKellen's portrayal of Magneto which is much better this time around (I guess playing the wise Gandalf really helped him). Patrick Stewart continues to bring quality performance as Prof X.The biggest new addition to the cast, who also has a very impressive performance, is Brian Cox as the obsessed William Stryker who will stop at nothing to wipe out all mutants.Any flaws? The cast, while generall very good, does have MISCASTS. James Marsden is STILL TERRIBLE and STILL IMMATURED as Cyclops/Scot Summers while Famkke Jansen is TOO OLD and UNAPPEALING as Jean Grey.In my own opinion, Cyclops and Jean Grey should be played by actors who live up to each character's maturity and appeal. With the fact that Marsden is 9 years younger than Jansen in reality, their age gap is very present in the story.Aside from having a great story and strong cast, X2 also has some of the best action scenes in film yet this 2003 not to mention some of the most impressive special effects works.With the way the film ended, I was left impressed and satisfied plus I am already looking towards the next X-Men movie. If the film crew follows the way X2 ended as far as story telling goes, I am optimistic that they will explore the Jean Grey-Phoenix storyline that was legendary in the comic books (I just hope that Marsden and Jansen get REPLACED).X2's rating for me: 9 out of 10.

Wonderful Escapist Fare,"Years ago, when I first heard that X-Men was being brought to the screen I cringed. How could they translate the numbers and complexity of characters within a movie's short time span? Well, Mr. Singer did a good job of it, but had to spend much valuable screen time establishing his characters and their universe. Not so in the sequel, and the previous work pays dividends, allowing him to better develop the plot  and probe deeper into the character's personalities. Also, and this may be a result of having so many subjects to work with, Mr. Singer is not afraid to kill off his main characters, from any of the three conflicting camps. This heightens the tension, so often missing from comic-book movies. The result is that X2 surpasses the original across the board.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"Wolverine:""It's good!"" Magneto:""You have no idea!""","That's precisely what, in the end, resumes all of this magnificent journey into the world of mutants for the second time. The sequel that took three years to make, with an ensamble cast of 12 leading characters had all the ingridients to fail; but Bryan Singer knew what he was doing. It isn't too much to say that this X2 actually manages to surpass the original movie in every single aspect you can point out. For our luck, both of Bryan Singer's versions of the X Men are, as Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart said, worthy of being Shakespearian. All the characters have depth, are given a background, and enough room to move around and show off without clouding anyone else. This time, the storyline goes in deeper than it was three years ago, so the plot isn't quite just an underlining matter for the special effects. While all the action movies lately that were worhty of recognition first built up in the first part of the movie so they could ""burst"" in the other half. Well, X Men 2 starts with that ""burst"", with one fo the best action sequences in recent memory: an homicide attempt on the President of the US, by the new mutant around, Nightcrawler, played by the surprising Alan Cumming. What we could all fear whereas the movie would drop down from there on, it didn't happen. It kept the pace, never leaving the plot behind. Anyway, the movie's big winner is once more leading star Hugh Jackman, that walks away once more with an extraordinary performance and a character compositing that makes us like this Wolverine personna even more. So we wait anxiously for the hopefully upcoming sequel with the whole cast returning, and Hugh Jackman's next leading role on Van Helsing.

Firing On All Cylinders,"The first X-Men is a fine film but it follows a similar formula than plenty of other comic-book adventures. It felt original and fresh at the time, but it doesn't hold up as well on repeated viewings as X- Men 2/X2/X2: X-Men United does. In fact, X2 gets better every time I watch it. Exceptionally directed by Bryan Singer with just the right amount of action and timely emotion, X2 is one of the best X-Men films to date.I'll always contend that the X-Men films are best when Magneto and Professor X aren't necessarily on opposite ends. Magneto has never been a cut and dry villain. There's always a grey area to him, and I think X2 nails that as well as any other X-Men film. Just like in Days of Future Past, he doesn't have an agenda until he's brought back into chaos. This time, the chaos is brought on by none other than William Stryker. Stryker is in charge of the facility which keeps Magneto captive, and is also the one who holds the answers to Wolverine's past. That in itself boasts some fascinating prospects for the film.But what's more impressive is how well this film once again balances all of its story fighting the ""bad guy"" while also having the ultimate antagonist (humans) feature so prominently in the story. It's not to the extent that the original deals with it (registration act), but at its core you know this film is about humans vs mutants. The two butting heads has always and will always be the way to take the X-Men's story.We get introduced to a few new mutants, and an extended look at Pyro and Iceman, but it's Nightcrawler that makes the biggest impression. The opening sequence at The White House is known as one of the best comic-book scenes to date, and rightfully so. It's terrifying and thrilling, which doesn't really describe his presence throughout the rest of the film, but it's quite the opening. Iceman is used more as a love interest for Rogue than anything else, but Shawn Ashmore is charismatic enough to verify his presence. Pyro, however, feels like the prototypical kid who was inevitably going to turn on his friends. You never truly believe that he's going to stick it out on the good side.With much higher stakes than the first film as the human race is at risk, it's no wonder the runtime is significantly longer than 2000's X-Men. There is rarely a second wasted, but having the entire last hour of the film take place at Alkaline Lake was risky. With so many mutants running around, it's easy to find someone to take up screen time, but that's a long time to spend at one particular location. So I can see where it may feel a little long and dragged on by the time we leave the place.The important thing here is that Singer keeps us on track with the story he wants to tell. It has more action, characters, and surprisingly more heart than I expected. X2 is a triumph on almost every front and set the franchise up for limitless possibilities and adventures.

"X-Men 2 Has Aged, Though It's Still Damn Watchable Stuff.","In the 1980s and 1990s, Marvel wasn't the company it has become today: the company teetered on the verge of bankruptcy and they had to auction off the film-rights of its characters ranging from Spiderman, Captain America, The Fantastic Four and The X-Men to film companies that included Sony, Fox, Paramount, Universal and New Line Cinema (oddly Disney didn't have the rights for ANY Marvel characters before buying the company outright in 2009, for $4 billion). Does this film honor its source material? Yes it does.X-Men 2 is easily one of the finer fruits coming from Marvel's circumstantial deal-brokering and near-bankruptcy in the 80s and 90s. Hugh Jackson, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are the stars of the show here, and they're in a much higher-stakes adventure than the original X-Men. Humans and mutants are on the brink of all-out war with each other (as they always are in these movies), and the X-Men are the arbiters of justice stopping all that chaos from hitting the world.While the film has become slightly dated with its effects, it's still a good Marvel-yarn and respectable take on everyone's favourite mutants.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

This is, however, not a problem in any of the two movies. I can totally buy the myriad of characters and the universe which they inhabit. And let's face it - there are a lot of characters. X2 has a huge number of participants and the real miracle is that everyone (even Halle Berry) works so good.

The movie is faster, the fighting sequences are better and the characters of the ""evil"" mutants are not shallow anymore (in the first movie Mystique, Toad and Sabretooth just spoke about 5 sentences all together).But I still think that the focus of the film should be taken more away from Wolverine (he's a cool character, but he's not the only one in the film) and more towards Storm and Cyclops (They never show the leading capabilities of the comics and don't get enough screen time for their cool characters if you ask me). Additionally I would like that Shadowcat, Colossus, Siryn and Jubilee get a more than 5 second appearance in the film (I know, I know, there's already a whole bunch of mutants, but its about a group of mutants not just about some of them) and show a little bit more of their powers.So for the third part I just hope that Sabretooth and Toad come back (they are surely not dead, they are much too tough for that), the reappearance of Jean Grey aka Phoenix and perhaps the introduction of Angel, Beast and Gambit (Angel & Beast are the last two of the original 5 X-Men to be still missing, but Beast was already mentioned in X2 and Angel shouldn't be too hard to introduce, because he worked as ""independent superhero"" before joining the X-Men. And Gambit, Gambit is just a cool character.).If the improvement from X2 to X3 is as good as the one from X1 to X2 the 10 point scale won't be enough anymore. 10/10 points",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Average,I would give this film 5/10.  It's OK but overall I found it disappointing and not as good as the original one.  The acting from everyone except James Marsden and Halle Berry was excellent.  Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen were the stand outs for me.  But there was just something missing for me.  It didn't have that extra spark.,5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Amazing,"This movie is so incredible good, saw it last night, and I just sat with gooseskin all over. It's amazing that the x-men2 is even better than the first one, however, it is :) I can recommend everyone to see it, if they already saw it, see it again! The special effects and the storyline just knock the spoof out of you :P Another thing about the movie that I liked, is that they havnt used too many new charactors, and the movie holds on very good to the old story...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
X-Men mutates into something better,"X-Men 2 was the original Dark Knight. A superhero sequel that steps up everything from the first and becomes one of the all time superhero greats instantly. It's a much better tale than the first one and becomes a more complete and satisfying story.It works better than the first one mostly in that it's plot is a significant step up. The first one chose to spend as much time as possible on Rogue and Wolverine and whilst Wolverine is a genuinely interesting character, Rogue is not and the entire first movie felt like a slog through her life and her rather boring life-story. However in X-Men 2 they scrapped this and made every character get a similar amount of screen time and aside from a few (Cyclops) they all get time to expand and do something on the screen. The other significant benefit is the sophisticated villain and plot, whereas the first one had a villain, who was slightly under-developed, and a plan that for a movie of its magnitude kind of lacked much imagination or sophistication whereas here the clues are presented from the beginning, the plot takes a dark turn and the storyline is not as clichéd as the original.Another benefit is that whilst the first one had to waste time developing and introducing characters this one just starts and runs with it and here is the best thing about this movie: character relations. Magneto develops more than his bad guy stance in the last movie. Wolverine becomes more like we've always him to be: violent and dark, but fundamentally good. Rogue has a role but is not as significant, Bobby has some great scenes. Jean Grey has a great transition throughout the movie. Storm doesn't do much but is constantly present. Pyro has a nice development and minor twist. Professor X becomes a far more deeper character. The villain is thoroughly evil. His son is a dark and depressing character and provides one of the biggest atmospheres a mute character can create. Cyclops goes missing half way through this movie but soon pops up again rather randomly. And the star of the show is ... Nightcrawler. Nightcrawler is an amazing character, well thought out, interesting, greatly used and really well developed.But the best thing about this movie is that whereas the first one was ""sort-of-wow"", this is non-stop ""cool"". Magneto's escape is genius, other metallic deaths are worthy of a cinema ticket in itself and practically every other character has an awesome power used to awesome effect here.So, is this movie perfect? Hell no. Sophisticated plot aside, the ending is far too simplistic. The twist is also a pity, ruining a hell of a lot of character development. Problems also arise around through a few plot holes, both early on and late in the movie - and the most frustrating things about these plot-holes, some of them are in the start of the movie and could be sorted with one line of dialogue later on! Overall, every way a superior movie to X-men, not without it's fault but it's got to be one of the top 5 superhero movies of all time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
They've listened to my plea and made a sequel,"X2 (what people invent such a clever title?) was released here in the Netherlands on May the 1st, but I had to wait until today (May 25th) before I could finally watch it, because as a poor student I was a little short of cash (plus I'd planned to waste my last few bucks on seeing The Matrix Reloaded on the REALLY big screen and watch X2 in the village cinema which gets movies a few weeks weeks to three months later than any other cinema). Anyway I was pretty excited to see it and when it came to my notice that the film would be playing th the village cinema on the 25 of May (a mere 3 weeks after it's release) I immediately reserved me some tickets. A few hours before going to the theater though I came to realize that I hadn't seen a preview of X2 yet. No trailer, no teaser, nothing (or had I simply forgot about it due to the Matrix hype?). The only thing I new was that the mutants had to stand united for something. Now why was I going to watch a film, if I didn't know what it was about? Well I was going, because I had seen the first X - Men film, which in my mind (I don't know if that is a good method to measure by) was awesome. To make it even more plain and simple: I was going because this film roughly had the same cast and crew as the first X - Men film and because I trusted them to make a good sequel. I didn't need noisy trailers or samples of the special effects and action scenes that were to be seen in the film. Being responsible for making X - Men (with Spider-Man THE BEST Marvel comic adaption until now) is all the credit you need to get me to the big screen.X2 kicks off with a very nice fighting, scene which certainly owed some of it's visual finesse to Andy and Larry (you know who you are and so do most movie buffs). After that shine and turbulent intro the film continues where X - Men had ended, namely with Wolverine's quest to find out what exactly had happened to him. From that point on, these two events become entangled into each other and a story unfolds which builds on quite well on the previous film, without neglecting new elements. The new elements in the story are mainly new characters or characters that get a bit more attention than in X - Men (Pyro, Nightcrawler, Colossus) who were all portrayed in an acceptable manner by the actors. The only exception to that was Nightcrawler, who was portrayed excellently by Alan Cumming. He was very believable and rather sweet as the faithful and shy mutant from Germany and he even managed to nail the parts in the film in which he spoke German (correct German without too much of an accent and none of that: 'Schiess den Glas' crap they pulled in Die Hard). The rest of the film pretty much built forth on the things that were established in the first film (so if you haven't seen it I can advise you too, it will make some things much clearer). The film does so in an excellent manner and I've really got no complaints to the film overall. The action and the story were good, there were some emotional elements and one or two laughs as well, without any big misstep's. But comparing the film to it's predecessor (something which one always does) I must say that the film could have been a bit more dramatic. Not just to add drama, but to give the film more depth. Yes that is the word. The film could have had a bit more depth. It could for instance have explored the relationship between Jason and Charles Xavier a bit more or there could have been a bit more focus on what Stryker had done to Jason, so we (the viewers) could have felt a bit more for that pitiful 'creature'. Now mind you that these are all minor pointers to the makers and it does not mean that the film was not good. It just means that it wasn't as good as the first one, it wasn't perfect. But is still was a very good sequel. I (yes I too answer the question that has held a lot of movie freaks in their grip for quite some time this year) even thought it was better than The Matrix Reloaded. But that does not mean much, simply because The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions are to be combined into a 5 hour long film and I've only seen half of it. I am as it were currently in the lobby of the cinema drinking and eating some refreshments, waiting for the break to finish.Singer, cast and crew have once again managed to make a good film and I am truly grateful for it. I sure as hell hope that they'll make a third film in the series and I hope that next time they'll inject a bit more of that Marvel-dilemma into the story. But this time I cannot be quite so sure of a sequel. None of the actors had signed a contract for more than two films and to be honest I think that there could be some problems with getting the entire cast to return. Academy Award winner Halle Berry might be the biggest trouble, but I certainly hope there won't be a problem a bigger paycheck can't solve. I don't care how much money the actors ask, give it to them they've earned it (on performance AND profit).If the X - Men return, so shall I.8,25 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Hmmmmm... Lots of pretty mutant actions but no story... :-(,"I found myself simply waiting for mutant stuff to occur (and when it did it didn't disappoint..  The opening sequence & Wolverine's first big action sequence are fantastically filmed & well worth admission price.)  But there was nothing between....  Where was the story?Now I know it's a superhero film but I want to be gripped rather than fail to see good reason for certain events happening at certain times.I want to see & feel that there is no other way to get round problems other than to take the frankly lousy choices that the main players make.... (sorry bout the vagueness regarding the events & times but don't want to spoil what there is for people who've not seen it.)It really did seem to be a series of great set pieces showing the comic book characters in flesh and blood as the fans want...  But with no substance or emotion.All of this seems to be attributable to one main criticism however, and that is that there are too many characters to focus on and none of them seem retain focus (or work as a team.)  Suppose that most people would only really be interested in a wolverine film if they gave em their own individual features, so no magic answers as to how the producers can get round that one.Bah.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
WWWAAAAYYYY better than the first one,"I'll make this quick and easy.  i didnt enjoy XMEN 1 very much-too short-just didnt sit well with me. X2 is such an improvment over the first one.  Nightcrawler is a masterpiece and i enjoyed a longer, more in depth movie.  Of course there were a few problems, but i'll just say that i would pay to see this one again in the theater, unlike recent comic debacles DAREDEVIL and even SPIDERMAN.

A Gift for X-Men Comics fans,"In 1990, I read my first X-Men issue. It was the marvelous ""Dark Phoenix Saga"", written by Chris Claremont. I was amazed by the quality of the plot and its fascinating characters. Since then, I have been dreaming of watching a movie adaptation of the story. After I saw ""X-Men 2"", I can say that my dream is getting real. Bryan Singer did a wonderful job, by creating an exciting prelude to the Phoenix Saga, which shall be the central theme of ""X-3"". Now, let´s wait for the third installment of what promises to be the definitive COMICS MOVIE TRILOGY. Long live to X-Men on screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"

"A worthy sequel, and a darn good film in it's own right","It isn't too hard to satisfy my cinematic demands [I wasn't wild about, but tolerated Jar Jar; as you can guess I am as big an X-Men fan as I am a Star Wars fan], so when something like this comes along, I can be forgiving of its flaws.The first of which is that the movie was several days to short.  That's right, my chief complaint is that the movie was too short.When I was about ten years old, I bought my first X-Men comic book.  I waited 21 years for the characters and story to hit the silver screen; 2000's ""X-Men"" was worth every minute of the wait.Now, two years later, this was not only a worthy sequel, but it surpasses the first movie in many ways.I want George Lucas to hand over the director's reins to Brian Singer, and have Wolverine make a guest appearance in Star Wars: Episode 3: the Undecided Title.I would have love to have seen some cross-pollination; that is, someone should have been reading a newspaper, and it should have been a copy of ""The Daily Bugle.""The movie seems to have been inspired, to some extent, by 1982's ""God Loves, Man Kills"" an X-Men story that I enjoyed greatly.If you are a fan, or if you say ""X-Who?"" this is an enjoyable movie, and I hope that I one day can take my kids to see ""X-Men 7 - Wolverine Shaves!""",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining super hero film,"An entertaining super hero action film, that I enjoyed more than the original. Basicaly the plot has a sinister figure in the U.S. Government manipulating the President to try to wipe out the mutants once and for all... so they launch an assault on the X-Mansion and the X-Men wind up having to scatter and try to fight back. All the actors from the original film return and are joined here by a few other X-Men that have been brought in from the comics. A fairly faithfull rendition of the comic book storylines featuring decent acting and entertaining fight scenes (something lacking from the original). Halle Berry and Famke Janssen have more to do this time, Anna Paquin has less.. but the focus remains on Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and Patrick Stewart's Professor X. Still, it was vastly entertaining.. better than the original. GRADE: B+",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
The Best Comic Book Movie until Spider-Man 2 comes out!!!,"Wow, this was most likely the best comic book movie, maybe even movie I have ever seen. The action was amazing, the script was fantastic, and so were the actors. Often had very funny lines, and I just loved it. Striker was a fantastic villain. Hugh Jackman was the perfect part for Wolverine. The fight seens with him in the mansion were unbelievable. Also when he fought Deathstrike. It was fun to see the X-men teaming up with Magneto and Mystique. I loved at the end when it had Jean ""die."" Can't wait to see her as phoenix in the next one!!!

Much better this time around!,"Although I enjoyed the first Xmen movie, I wasn't nearly as impressed with it as X2.  At times, Xmen would drag on and tried to pull you wherever it decided to go.  This time around, the script was much tighter and the action sequences so much more incredible.From the very start X2 captivates you.  With the introduction of Nightcrawler you realize you are in for one heck of a ride...and X2 does take you there.  Wolverine starts to become the Wolverine we remember from the comic books and cartoons...simply losing it at times.  Just GREAT!  The acting was phenomenal on most accounts...even James Marsden whom I typically don't like very much.  Anna Paquin, however, was a bit off on some of her scenes but not so much to ruin the movie or detract from the overall experience.  Magneto, Mystique, Dr. X, Wolverine, Pyro and even Iceman all gave fantastic performances...leaving you wanting for more.A definite must see!  Overall, I give X2 a 9 1/2 out of 10 stars...taking a half star because Anna Paquin really bugged the snot outta me in a few scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Fantasm,"I saw this yesterday and I'm not sure how to describe it, but it is a fast and exciting film to watch; every minute!  Plot is a little confusing about mutants fighting mutants and others with exraordinary powers.  You have to listen very carefully.  The war is between humans and mutants after a tentative murder in the White House against the president of the United States.  On and on with many action scenes and revelations.

Xman one of the best,"*X-Men* (2000), directed by Bryan Singer, revolutionizes the superhero genre with its blend of action, character depth, and social commentary. Set in a world where mutants face discrimination, the film follows Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) as they represent opposing philosophies on coexistence. Hugh Jackman's Wolverine emerges as a reluctant hero, embodying the struggle for identity. The special effects and action sequences are visually striking, while the performances are compelling, particularly from the leads. *X-Men* remains a landmark film, paving the way for future superhero narratives and addressing themes of acceptance and prejudice.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
Xcentric,"I must confess that I was hoping for a lot better. This happens a lot to me because I watch some films with too many expectations - X2 was the case. I really loved the first movie although my favourite X-Men characters (which are Nightcrawler and Colossus) didn't take any part in it - in fact, only Nightcrawler takes active part of this movie since Colossus' role is more like a cameo. X2 isn't a bad movie, in fact it is quite good. The problem is that it isn't any better than the first one, but it isn't any worse as well. I was expecting some evolution other than a technical one and Matrix-lookalike special effects. The storyline is as good as you usually get in a comic book adaptation and the use (again) of black suits instead of the traditional Yellow-Blue X-Men suits adds a bit more reality to this movie. I liked this movie a lot although I think it could have been much better. Being a comic book fan and guessing what the story of X3 is going to be like - which is easilly guessable by any comic book fan just by watching the ending of X2 - the wait for the third installment will be unbearable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Sci-Fi"
