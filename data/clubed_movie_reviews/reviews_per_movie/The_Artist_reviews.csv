A unabashed love letter to Hollywoodland,"This is a treat. Charismatic leads with chemistry and talent, in a love story that plays as a pitch perfect homage to vintage Hollywood features, whilst never tipping over into parody, and that's no mean feat. The period detail is outstanding: film stocks, tints, (heck even the frame weave), captions and montage are all on the money.There's an evocative score, an imaginative use of silence, wonderful locations and costume. All rounded off by a top notch cast which includes a brilliant dog. Dujardin is every inch the charming 20's star and Bejo is sassy, surefooted and gorgeous. Go see this people. They do make 'em like they used to!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
stunning,"Jean Dujardin deserved his Palme D'or for his captivating and wonderful performance. Where to start...this film is so clever, so beautifully crafted, so mesmerising. The lost art of the silent film is once again brought to life and that era is impressively recreated, whether it be the acting style, the sets, the locations (shot in Hollywood), the shimmering black and white photography. It is obvious to see that the people behind L'artiste respected that era of film making and wanted to recreate the magic with some modern touches ( I won't spoil them) and totally succeeded. I saw this in Cannes at an 8.30 am press screening and was totally entranced. I cannot wait to see it again!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I may like this so much because I am very interested in the transition to sound film...,"... and I have to say that because I am familiar with that period of time, I think this is very well done. It has its own unique path, but if I had to pin it down I'd say it was A Star Is Born meets Singin In the Rain, although it avoids the depths of drama of the former as well as the comic highs of the latter. It is a very good mix of drama and comedy. Throw in Eddie from Frasier and you pretty much have it. And now on to the story.George Valentin is a huge silent star in 1927. One night at a premiere of one of his movies a fan of his, Peppy Miller, has a chance encounter with him and in front of the crowd and the cameras she snatches a kiss from him with the headlines reading ""Who's that girl?"". George's wife is not amused but Peppy manages to get into George's Kinograph Studios and get work as an extra on the strength of it.Even in the silent era, Peppy slowly works her way up the credits from just a girl in the chorus to strong supporting roles. Then sound comes in and she is put under contract as one of the ""fresh new faces"" of Kinograph when that studio converts completely to sound, where she stars in one hit film after another. Meanwhile, George no longer has a studio home as his producer (John Goodman) tells him that audiences will want new stars to match the new technology.As George's fortunes decline everybody abandons him including his wife who has been showing signs (she blackens his teeth out when he is on the cover of Variety) of being unhappy since we first meet her. Only his loyal dog and butler/chauffeur stand by him. What will become of him? Watch and find out.Visually this film gets everything right. The hairstyles, the fashions, the car models, and the architecture are correct for the 1920s and early 1930s. Everything about it reminds me of a film from the early 1930s - it's not meant to make you think too hard. It has some dramatic moments, but it is meant to make you leave feeling good, as the Great Depression was serious enough without adding to it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Masterpiece that will leave you ... Speechless ...,"«We didn't need dialogs, we had faces» said the narcissistic Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) in Billy Wilder' ""Sunset Boulevard"", referring to the Silent Era, when she used to be big  before the 'pictures got small'.The reason of this introduction is that after watching Michel Hazanavicius' critically acclaimed: ""The Artist"", I strongly felt this was the perfect illustration to Norma Desmond's iconic eulogy. From beginning to end, my eyes never ceased to be amazed by the communicative smile of Jean Dujardin as George Valentin, the aging silent movie star and the sparkling eyes of Berenice Bejo as Peppy Miller, the young and flamboyant starlet. Their faces occupy the screen with such an electrifying magnetism that they don't just steal the scenes, they steal the dialogs  literally.I was awestruck by Dujardin's performance. To those who didn't grew up with French TV programs, he's one of the most popular and talented comedians of his generation. Dujardin created the character of Brice de Nice, a blonde surfer whose specialty was to 'diss people', but it was so funny it never sounded mean-spirited. He was a member of a cult comic-troop (who made sketches à la SNL) but even back then, he had a little something that made him special: a voice, a smile, a charisma in both TV and movies, in both dramatic and comedic register. There was no doubt in France that the guy who was famous for his impressions of Robert De Niro and the camel (and even De Niro doing the camel) was promised to a brilliant career.Look closely at Jean Dujardin's face, it's like drawn with 'classic' features: the finely traced mustache who builds a Fairbanks-like charisma like the strength from Samson's hair, the dazzling smile making him look like the lost son of Gene Kelly, and a certain macho toughness reminding of a young Sean Connery. Dujardin's face is a gift from cinematic Gods, and ""The Artist"" finally lets it glide, earning him the Cannes Festival Award for Best Actor. I sincerely believe he deserves an Oscar nomination, because he just doesn't play an actor from the Silent Era, he embodies the Era with the same level of demented craziness as Norma Desmond, in a brighter and more light-hearted side.Valentin's self-absorption echoes Desmond's cynical ego while his gaudy 'Don Lockwood' mask (Gene Kelly in ""Singin' in the Rain"") hides the more poignant face of his insecurity. He's the star of the screen because only the screen allows him to express his unique talent. While Lockwood had to adapt to the 'talking' revolution, George Valentin makes a conservative U Turn starting an inexorable descent into madness, from an outcast, to a has-been until being finally alienated by his own talkie-phobia. The direction is so clever that it challenges many times our perceptions, creating unexpected feelings of discomfort when real sounds are heard. But I was surprised to see how much it worked on a dramatic level.And this is the strength of the film, although I expect it to discomfort some viewers: it isn't a tribute in the literary meaning of the word. It has its moments where it tricks us into the use of sounds or dialogs, but never fails to distract us from the core of the story: the romance. Very quickly, we forget about spotting the hints, the references to silent classics: chase scenes, over-the-top comical gesticulations, slapstick jokes etc. This mindset would disappoint those who expected a film with the same material as Mel Brook's ""Silent Movie"", which was clearly a tribute. ""The Artist"" IS a silent movie, featuring a beautiful romance between George and Peppy, who got her break with an idea from George, something that would make her different from the other actresses: a beauty spot above the upper lip. A clever credit-billing montage depicts her consequent ascension to stardom until she finally dethrones George and makes a has-been out of him.If I mentioned the performance of Dujardin, Berenice Bejo also deserves some accolades because she succeeded in looking so ""old"" from our POV yet so fresh and modern in the film, with the appealing feel-good and optimistic attitude she constantly brings on screen. With her doll-face and youngish smile, she's like a cute little girl enjoying what she does. In a way, Peppy Miller embodies the film's most inspirational element: a positive message about passion and enjoyment. And this indirectly highlights George's source of troubles: being deprived from what he enjoyed the most and suffering from his progressive fading into oblivion. Along with this conflict, the evolution of George and Peppy's romance never feels forced, quite an accomplishment when we consider how slightly over-the-top silent movie stars used to act.Both Dujardin and Bejo are indeed powerful in an Oscar-worthy level and at that moment, I can't continue without mentioning the third character of the film, George's dog. The relationship between George and the dog provides a sort of Chaplinesque feel to the movie, a mix of tenderness and poignancy, so natural and convincing I wonder if the Academy will think of a honorary Oscar. Anyway, I applaud Hazanivicius for not having reduced ""The Artist"" to a flashy spectacle with no substance, with the word 'homage' as the director's convenient alibi, and make a touching romance about two people who met each other at a pivotal time in the history of film-making, each representing a side of cinema, the old-school silent generation: Chaplin, Keaton, Pickford and the exuberant talkers: Grant, Hepburn, Davis  And I'm glad he found the true note to reconcile between these two universes at the end  didn't I tell you Dujardin was the lost son of Gene Kelly?""The Artist"" plays like a missing link between ""Singin' in the Rain"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"" and it's indeed one of the best films of 2011, with the absence of words as an endearing 'beauty spot'.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Silence speaks volumes.,"As I waited for two hours in a long queue to watch this movie at the Mumbai Film Festival, I wondered why I was doing so much for a silent movie, of all things. Post screening, I'm ready to brave hail, rain or the super hot Indian summer sun and stand in a serpentine queue, just to watch this movie all over again.'The Artist' is sure to go down in history as a must-watch. For those who want to study films, for those who pursue cinema relentlessly, and also for those who just watch movies because they just like to. If you're wondering why a silent film, the movie not only answers it, but makes you fall in love with the medium. it's clearly a product of a thinking director, where every thing in the scene has a story to tell. Whether it's the ironical film posters, street signs, or just a little dog barking quietly in the corner.I don't need to comment on the talents. The Best Actor award at Cannes 2011 has done that already. I will however mention the four-legged supporting actor in the movie. Best performance I've ever seen so far!Enjoy this movie.

Marvellous; one of the best movie experiences you'll ever have,"The Artist arrived at the Toronto International Film Festival preceded by the accolades it received at Cannes, so expectations were high, but those expectations have been more than amply fulfilled. This film is an absolute marvel - charming, witty, surprising, moving, clever and beautiful. Filmmaking is about decisions, thousands and thousands of them, and everyone involved in The Artist makes every decision to perfection. The cinematography is ravishing in luminous black and white. The musical score, on which the film, being silent, is so dependant, is subtle when it needs to be subtle, dramatic when the occasion calls for it, and never overbearing or overwrought. The screenplay (yes, silent films do have screenplays) toys with the conventions of the silent era, paying homage to some of the greatest films of the first two or three decades of cinema history. The acting is flawless, extracting emotion and humour from a simple but classic storyline. The direction displays such self-assurance, and treats the audience with such respect, that it is almost like having a dialogue with the director.The Artist is one of the most enjoyable movie experiences I have ever had. It deserves a wide audience and all sorts of awards. I can hardly wait to see it again.And oh yes, if there is ever an Oscar for best animal performance, the dog in The Artist should receive a lifetime achievement award for this role alone.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Breath Of Fresh Vintage Air,"What a treat. I left the theater sort of floating. Delighted. A European film looking back at Hollywood better than Hollywood has been able to do for years. ""A Star Is Born"" and ""Singing In The Rain"" mixed in a glorious black and white cocktail. Silent, yes silent! But with a fabulous score and so much panache. Jean Dujardin is the revelation of the year. What a performance! Running the gamut of emotions, leaving us breathless, and if this wasn't enough, a rousing tap dance routine in the style of Fred Astaire and Eleanor Powell, partnering with the wonderful Berenice Bejo. I know that it's not just me. The audience applauded and cheered as the end credits rolled.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Doesn't Quite Live Up to the Hype,"The Artist is a well-made if not particularly involving homage to the silent films of the 1920s. The film itself looks beautiful, and makes interesting use of its lack of sound. However, the story lacks interest, and is as clichéd as the silent films it pays tribute to.The artist of the title is George Valentin, a silent film star caught in a loveless marriage to a petulant starlet. He gives a jump start to the career of actress Peppy Miller after kissing her at a premiere. However, he soon finds his stardom dwarfed by hers after the debut of talkies and losing his fortune in the stock market collapse.The film is at its best when it plays with the whole concept of silent movies. The most impressive example is a dream sequence conveying the transition from silent to sound movies. Valentin dreams that his word, previously filled with a silent movie soundtrack, now consumed by overly loud background sounds. This may be the first time in cinematic history in which a dog's bark has conveyed the shift of an entire world.Unfortunately, the film also suffers from one of the major flaws of silent films in general. Because of the lack of dialogue, The Artist ultimately has a simplistic story with largely one dimensional characters. To a large extent, the plot mimics that of A Star Is Born, focusing on a famous performer ultimately surpassed by his protégé. As a result, the film is boring and predictable.Furthermore, the film emulates the least interesting of the silent movies. Rather than focusing on the more experimental films that characterized the early years of silent movies, such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and D. W. Griffith's work, it looks at the making of genre films. Given that The Artist, by its very nature, is aimed at film buffs with an extensive set of references, one would think they would give attention to more interesting films.Still, the film's cast does a lot, particularly given the lack of dialogue. Penelope Ann Miller gives Valentin's harpy wife as much dimension as one can to such a one note character. John Goodman is also good as a dictatorial producer.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fantastically Entertaining Film!!!,"I go to a lot of screenings and it is rare that once the credits roll I feel satisfied. One or more of the elements of most films just don't work together to create a feeling that you have been thoroughly entertained.I am happy to say that this film DELIVERS! The acting is superb, the chemistry between all of the actors is sizzling, the comedy is absolutely hilarious, the storyline grips you and never lets go, the music is superb, and you feel emotionally connected with the characters and story.If you check my previous reviews, you will see that I am most often moved to write a review when a film was really bad, but this film caught me completely off guard and I just had to express my overwhelming satisfaction with this filmmaking experience.I can't imagine how difficult it must have been to try and finance a period film with two stars who were not well known outside of their own country. I am just overjoyed that it all came together. This is how film should make you feel when you leave the theater - entertained! To the entire production team - BRAVO!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beware of the overhype!,"If you can get your Weinstein-manipulated expectations WAY down from ""Oscar"" to ""cute gimmick,"" then this cinematic truffle could very well satisfy – especially if you've ever seen and enjoyed a theatrical screening of a silent movie. There's a faithfulness to the spirit and techniques of the silent era that's undeniably impressive and will delight those few audience members (myself being one) who have enough familiarity with silent cinema to appreciate it.But is it a movie that you should be running out to see because omnipresent web advertising says that it's an Oscar lock? Negative. If you DON'T have the required familiarity with the silent era, the charms and nostalgia evoked by the film will be completely lost on you, and you'll be far more dependent on the thin and unoriginal storyline for entertainment. (Note: the story borrows shamelessly from both SINGING IN THE RAIN and A STAR IS BORN and is fully consistent with the era's cornball aesthetic.) And even if you ARE familiar with silent cinema, ""Oscar worthy"" is going to seem like a stretch. Either way, if you really want to enjoy this movie, lowering your expectations from their current hype-elevated levels is imperative. (Anybody notice how remarkably similar Weinstein's overhype campaign for this film is to the one he successfully ran for Roberto Benigni's LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL years ago? Anybody watched that movie since?)I first saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival with a full house at the spacious Elgin Theater, and it received a favorable albeit muted response from the audience. (By comparison, I saw AMELIE at the same theater ten years prior, and it received a ten-minute standing ovation at the end.) If I'd known at the time that I'd just seen the year's BEST movie, I would have been depressed over what this portended for the year-end releases.You simply can't help being aware of the limitations of silent movies -- and thankful for the quantum improvement that the introduction of sound made -- no matter how deft the filmmakers are in recreating the look and feel of a bygone era. It's a movie-making era that you're glad IS bygone -- as evidenced by the inability of any of the gushing critics to cite a single color talkie favorite that they wish had been a b&w silent instead.I say ""A"" for cinematic conceit and ""C"" for entertainment value (""B+"" for silent film buffs).",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cannes Favorite,"I managed to catch a screening of this at Cannes, and if you're thinking about skipping this film because it's silent and black and white, you're going to be missing out on a very special experience.Everything about this film is exceptional. The acting is top-notch, the story is intriguing, and despite being black and white, the film is visually appealing. The filmmakers really make great use of the medium, and even though there are no voices or color, my interest was never lost.Jean Dujardin gives a great performance. You like him instantly and, without giving too much away, you want him to succeed. This movie is really chock full of great actors and actresses.

"A bit over-rated, but overall the performances steal the show here","Going into this film , I did have high expectations. What I learned coming out of it is that, I do believe, I have grown a bit as a critic. This being of the highest praised films of the year, I had no doubts that I would come out of it liking it somewhat at least. This being said, I was mostly let down here. Another thing this film taught me is that trailers for films can be deceiving and that literally most of the great parts of a film are within it's trailers. This is mostly the case here. I found the most enjoyable moments were parts of snip-its from pieces in the trailer. If you have not yet seen the trailer for this film, I recommend against watching it. The story here, overall, is actually quite bland and nothing to really get excited for. This is a pretty easy film to swallow, and there is really only one scene in the film that really gives it anything worthy of a PG-13 rating. You could say this is almost a family film for the easy minded, and for some, it could be something anyone could enjoy if you are into the more independent films of course.However, despite all this, the performances is what really saves the film here, and they are spot on, and in every way worthy of an Oscar nom. from at least the 2 leads or just the female lead overall. Also, the cinematography is quite gorgeous to look at for the most part. I can't really say that what IS here is really flawed at all, it just really didn't grab me and have all the magic most are claiming it to have. There is something here, but it is missing a lot of charm it could have had. What we get here is splices of charm with a downtrodden face.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I Don't Understand the Universal Praise,"I really don't get it. My wife and I went to see The Artist this past Saturday and I was left with an overwhelming feeling of ""meh."" Which is really surprising, given the almost universal, glowing praise this film has been getting--what with Golden Globe awards and Oscar nominations, etc (not to mention all the 10-star reviews here on IMDb).I just didn't see anything special here. I mean, they filmmakers did a fairly good job of recreating a silent film, but they didn't take it any further than that. The plot, acting, etc, was no better or worse than a real silent film. I've seen many much, much better silent films on TCM's Silent Sundays each weekend. Those who are gushing over this movie have apparently not seen very many real silent films from the 20s. If they had, I think they'd have found this film kind of a ""been there, seen that"" kind of experience as I did. Or maybe this Artist-Praise-Hysteria is mostly the result of folks desperately wanting to jump onto the bandwagon of the newest ""cool"" thing.The thing that bothered me most (besides the stretches of tedium) was that the cinematography was distractingly flat and gray--there were no real blacks and no real whites. I understand from articles I've read that this low-contrast, glowy B&W was intentional. But I didn't like it. Just looked like it was poorly shot with a bad video camera with the contrast turned all the way down. (this wasn't helped by the fact that the theatre I saw it in now presents all their ""films"" via digital projection--a process that, in my opinion, has NOT been perfected yet and is still too ""low res"" for cinema).All in all, ""The Artist"" should be nothing more than a minor, vaguely interesting experiment that would have had a better home on video. How it has become an indie sensation with Oscar nominations is a totally mysterious to me. Wonder how much money it took to convince us all that is was a masterpiece?",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Left me uplifted and moved, a magical piece of film-making and a truly endearing homage to the silent era","2011 saw a lot of very good to outstanding films. After seeing 'The Artist', having heard so much about it but never got round to seeing it, for me it is up there with the best of them and one of the best films seen in a long time.As someone who loves a lot of films from the silent era, having been vastly entertained by classics from the likes of cinema icons Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, 'The Artist' is magical film-making, a wonderfully endearing homage to the silent era and is much more than just a gimmick like it could easily have been in lesser hands.For starters, 'The Artist' is gorgeously filmed in black and white with the cinematography along with the likes of 'Drive', 'The Tree of Life' and 'Hugo' being some of the best of the year. One of the most visually exquisite films seen in a long time actually. The music score, with a nice affectionate nod to one of the greatest music scores of all-time Bernard Hermann's 'Vertigo', is whimsical and rich in playfulness and charm, all the time beautifully orchestrated.'The Artist' was clearly written with a lot of affection, with plenty of funny and poignant moments, and while the storytelling is simple it really uplifts and moves with the atmosphere of the silent era more than convincingly evoked. The direction is also without complaint. The characters endear and entertain, especially George and adorable Uggie, and nothing can be faulted about the acting.Jean Dujardin's lead performance is just wonderful, a more than worthy winner for the best actor award. Bérénice Bejo is similarly charming and has great chemistry with Dujardin, while the talented supporting cast are all stellar with no weak links. As for adorable Uggie, one of the best animal performances on film to me and award-worthy if there was an award eligible for animals (which one wouldn't say no to).In conclusion, a sheer delight all round and, despite the competition being strong, its Oscar win for Best Picture was deserved. One of the easiest 10/10s given recently. Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
As colorful as any black and white film could ever be!,"¨Look at what you've become. You've become proud! You've become stupid! ¨The Artist is a beautiful film that pays homage to movies from the late 20's and early 30's, the silent film era. In order to do so, French director Michel Hazanavicius decided to make this film almost entirely without sound and in black and white. Many producers would've probably thought he was crazy for trying to make a film like this in these days where viewers are used to seeing spectacular and colorful movies with great sound and even in 3D. However, The Artist works perfectly and is one of the brightest films of the year despite being in black and white. The cinematography is spectacular (perhaps only rivaled this year by The Tree of Life and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy), the costume design and editing are among the best of the year, and the score is also amazing. This is truly a beautiful film that many film historians will enjoy for the nice tribute it renders to the age of silent films. Many famous actors during this era weren't able to make the transition to the talkies, and that is exactly what The Artist is about, and it does it in a very simplistic but stylized fashion. The film has been nominated for 10 Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Performance by a Lead Actor (Jean Dujardin) and a Supporting Actress (Berenice Bejo). It will probably walk away with the Best Picture title considering how appealing the subject matter is to the Academy, and how well the film was crafted. Please don't be scared off because the movie is silent or in black and white because the story is really entertaining and despite being colorless it is brighter than any other film released this year. It is really worth a watch; you won't regret it.The year is 1927 and George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is at the height of his artistic career. He is a very successful Hollywood actor and producer Al Zimmer (John Goodman) is very pleased with his work. After having succeeded together yet again in a recent film, they are already collaborating for their next project. During rehearsals for their next movie, George runs into an extra named Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo). They hit it off instantly sharing a dance number and George insists that Peppy should get the part. Pepper falls in love immediately with George, but he is married to Doris (Penelope Ann Miller) so their relationship is entirely professional. George gives Peppy the best advice she would ever receive: In order to make it in the industry she needs to be different and he paints a spot near her lip. This will be her trademark later on as she slowly begins rising to the spotlight during the arrival of the talkies. Valentin however, isn't lucky and realizes his days as a successful actor are coming to an end with the advent of these talking pictures. People want to see new faces and hear their voices. Al Zimmer realizes this and breaks relations with George, so Valentin decides to produce, direct, and star in his own silent film. The movie is a failure as people want to see these new talkies, and as Valentin's fame becomes to decline, Peppy Miller begins to grow into a superstar. Valentin is left with nothing except his faithful driver, Clifton (James Cromwell) and his Jack Russell Terrier named Jack. The times have changed for the great artists and fortunes are reversed.The Artist is among my top ten favorite films of the year and it works really well, not only as homage to these silent films, but as a love story as well. Along with Midnight in Paris, these are perhaps the two best romantic movies of the year and would make for an excellent date. I've already mentioned some of the technical aspects, but now I would like to praise the performances from Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo, and the dog (which was played in most part by Uggie). I can't leave out the dog, because he plays an important role in this film, and in a way is Valentin's faithful companion and savior. Jean Dujardin does deserve the Oscar nomination for his performance, he was terrific, and I think I enjoyed it over George Clooney's. If he wins, it will be well deserved. My favorite performance of the film however, comes from Berenice Bejo, who was also nominated as a supporting actress. She is just terrific and shines every time she's on screen. Her performance gives this black and white movie a lot of color. Both Bejo and Dujardin have worked together with director Hazanavicius in the past in the French spy spoof film OSS 117. I've never seen the movie, nor its sequel, but after seeing The Artist I'm very much interested in doing so. Overall this is a terrific film and one you won't want to miss.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Go see ""The Artist""!","Having dabbled in the 1920s with ""Midnight In Paris"", this movie will immerse you in this classic decade. The cars, the clothes, the hair... Director Michel Hazanavicius doesn't miss a single beat. Even the extras - every pedestrian and stagehand - has the classic familiarity of your grandparents' yearbook. Even the top name character actors filling in the cast as featured extras (Malcolm McDowell, Beth Grant, Ed Lauter). Stars Jean Dujardin (looking more, at times, like Gene Kelly) and Bérénice Bejo fit perfectly into this era. All in all, it's like a lost reel straight from 1927.I grew up going to the local Silent Film Festival every spring, so my hopes were high for ""The Artist""; I can tell you, I was not disappointed. It wasn't a stylized homage (like, say, ""Down With Love"") or a technical exercise (Gus Van Sant's ""Psycho""), this was a 20s period film all around. Like the indulgent ""reality"" of ""Mad Men"", ""The Artist"" is clouded with cigarette smoke, charmed with male chauvinism, and shamefully lacking real roles for minorities; and at the same time, full of G-rated romance and compelling melodrama.Michel Hazanavicius takes full advantage to his film's lack of sound and dialog, using title cards only when absolutely necessary. In fact, one slightly jarring moment comes when we hear Rose Murphy singing ""Pennies from Heaven"" over a montage. Slapstick and truly expressive acting are illuminated instead. This, frankly, has been sadly absent in movies lately. The most expressive performances coming from animated characters like Wall-E and Caesar (""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"").One of the compelling (and melancholy) aspects of the plot is the shift during the Great Depression from silent films to talkies. Though it is the undertow of the lead's story, it simultaneously self-conscious, reminding us what a rare treat this movie really is.Like I said, Go see ""The Artist""! Take someone who truly loves cinema with you. Take your grandparents. This movie will transport you and remind you why we love movies so much.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good in it's simplicity, but...","First of all, from 2008, the movies which won best picture shifted directions: instead of going towards the masterpiece original movie they are going towards the commercial type. I hope this is the climax of these 4 years, although I have serious doubts.The critiques say The Artist is just a mix of clichés, a compilation of scenes from other films. How does that affect me, why would I care(asks the casual viewer) ? Well, the answer's simple : this film lacks depth. Badly. I mean it's fun to watch, it's well made...but it just doesn't have like other layers of meaning hidden below the surface, imagine an egg which is empty inside. I don't think in those times films were like that!The story is fine for entertainment, but doesn't even come close to, say, The Aviator. I did like the moment when the music stops and we can hear some sounds which are briefly related to the story, it makes you more intuitive. The acting is indeed good- and the movie is good, but overall it just doesn't bring anything new. It just stinks of Hollywood, and not the old one !I could tell you 100 films like this one, but could hardly name 3 like, for example, The Tree of Life.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Like Someone Has Just Uncovered A Lost Masterpiece,"It may have been a cold January night in Leicester Square when I left the cinema but inside I was glowing, my faith somewhat restored in film having just seen this heartwarming classic.There's little point going through the deeply romantic/dramatic plot set in stark contrast against the shallow world of 1920's Hollywood as it may only spoil it for those yet to see, but in summary this film is a real gem, a true joy to behold with a clever little unpredictable twist at the end. Fabulous acting, superb score, great cinematography and look out for a star turn from a little performing dog which is quite amazing at times.With lots of classic touches woven throughout this movie, expect to laugh out loud, cry real tears and go through a roller-coaster of emotions as you will no doubt watch in fascination, the vivid recreation of an exceptional time in the history of cinema (the advent of talkies)and the history of the America (Wall St Crash/Great Depression).Though it is a silent film, sound is used in a very clever way. Similarly the director meshes subtle modern cinema techniques with some classic framing and detail. This is a glorious mixture of the old and the new and has great balance between light comedy/entertainment, intense romance and at times dark drama. The result being interesting characters that engage on many levels.It's worth mentioning the nods to some of cinema's all time classic films like Singing in the Rain, Sunset Boulevard and Citizen Kane(and several Chaplin classics) but it's not plagiarism, parody or irreverence - it's a beautiful pastiche of the cinema's finest. Watching The Artist, feels like someone was clearing out an old Hollywood Studio and stumbled upon one of the greatest silents (if not films) of them all and suddenly the lost masterpiece is revealed to the world.Emerging from the Cinema and into the crisp night air of Leicester Square, my thoughts were on one thing...how many Oscars will this instant classic win come February? The Academy certainly didn't disappoint as it picked up 5 Oscars including Best Actor, Best Picture and Best Director.A big thank you to all who were involved in this magnificent production, a truly wonderful film, delivering a great cinematic experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A love letter to 1930s Hollywood,"A French comedy-drama; This story is a tribute to the magic of silent cinema. A joyous film with delightful performances and a beautiful visual style, bringing back the glamour and glitz of old Hollywood. It is extremely well cast with Dean Dujardin in Academy Award winning form as an older silent film star and a rising young actress as silent cinema falls out of fashion and is replaced by the ""talkies"". The costume design was also recognized by the Academy, and rightly so. The stage and set design is also impeccable with some surprising cinematography in street scenes that brilliantly captures 1930s Los Angeles.
The film used the soundtrack from ""Vertigo"" which caused consternation in some quarters of the film industry, but this is not a film pupporting to be unaffected.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Absolutely unmissable, charming film of the year!","Hollywood, 1927: Silent movie star George Valentin is famous and wanted by his fans. He meets Peppy Miller, a young dancer, and propels her to the top of the movie industry. But as the sound enters the Hollywood, will George Valentin stand up to the challenge or surrender? I will definitely remember the year 2011 as the year of extreme nostalgia about the old movies. It seems to me that suddenly that feeling overwhelmed all the major producers, and as the result we saw so many films heralding how good the times were. The suit was started with Drive, the movie that initiates a time travel into 1980s movie production with all the main attributes in place: pounding soundtrack, violence and L.A. Then there was Hugo, in which Martin Scorsese took us back to the very beginning of the film production and has shown the fate of one of the pioneers of the industry, Georges Méliès. This time, the nostalgic authors take us to 1927, the era of silent black-and-white movies and booming movie industry.The Artist is very different from the other two films mentioned. If the Drive hails the style of 80s and Hugo is the ode to the brave pioneers of the movie industry, the Artist talks mainly about the people involved. It asserts strongly that the actors during the 1920s were shining, glossy, glamorous in their own, down-to-earth style, and builds the entire storyline around it, not trying to capture the viewers' attention by anything else.This was a very risky experiment. The movie is black-and-white and silent in the era of 3D, Avatar and Transformers. But the authors' bet on the charismatic characters paid off – the movie is very lively and charismatic. The simple story about George Valentin who tries to find his place in the rapidly changing world is very touching; the simple jokes easily make you smile. The fact that the movie concentrates on the new technology allowed some amazing plot turns – I promise that the George's nightmare will catch you by surprise. The movie is charming and light in a way that only old movies can be, without being too worried about special effects or the drama in the plot. The authors concentrated on one thing only: that is, to make people empathise with the main characters again, and they succeed – the main characters are charismatic and lovable.Of course, this would not have happened without the right cast, and it is difficult to underestimate the work of Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo. It feels as if they came straight from late 20s, they look so natural and confident. It is difficult not to smile when seeing Ms. Bejo's smile or watching Mr. Dujardin's dances. They performed to their best, and it is this brilliant performance that guaranteed the charisma and irresistible charm of the movie. Absolutely gorgeous actors literally filling the room with optimistic and upbeat mood, despite all the hardship – they make this film what it is.VERDICT: The risky experiment in the era of 3D and IMAX, but the most charming film of the year. TO WATCH: if you don't want to miss the most festive movie of the year.http://m-picturegoer.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Original, Innovative, Uplifting","It's rare that I go out to a theater these days to see a movie; I usually wait for Netflix. But ""The Artist"" was the exception. When I heard about this silent black & white film (with the great reviews) my curiosity was peaked. And it surpassed my expectations. I left the theater feeling like I'd just had a three-day weekend. This is a movie you can trust with your emotions; it won't let you down. I just wish it were playing in more theaters because I wanted to buy tickets as gifts for my family members in other cities. ""The Artist"" is about a silent film actor who rejects the new technology of ""talking movies"" in the late 1920s (anyone who has ever cursed a Microsoft release should relate to his resistance to new technology; couldn't resist). His journey of fame, wealth, hard times, and love opens like a Christmas present on the big screen, with a fun musical score, fine acting, original screenplay, and -- of course -- an adorable dog.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Genius,"I'm getting tired of reviewing other peoples' work, when I want to be shooting my own stuff, but this film really was a stroke of genius.Who says they don't make black and white silent films anymore? Before the days of talkies, musicals (much less sci-fi blockbusters and CGI fests) there were the likes of Rudolph Valentino, Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplain and a host of others who are now immortalized in American (and now global) cinematic culture.Old fashioned film making with modern film making techniques, and a few rifts on an old formula with a contemporary twist. Me, I really didn't get the whole romance thing, but that's just me. It seemed a bit over the top. But, the film is what it is.Give it a shot. It's worth a view, though I might only recommend it to die hard film aficionados.Enjoy.",,Anonymous,Romance
"A decent representation of a period of Hollywood history, but the stylistic mirroring limits its emotional pull","This being the first silent film I've seen, it's possible it's simply more difficult for me to engage with silent films in general. Even if that's the case, I still feel that telling a character study, emotion-driven story is inherently going to be less successful if you don't hear the characters talk. I recognize the stylistic choice to mirror the silent films which are the topic of the film, but I don't think it really adds to the depth of the story (we can understand what a silent film is like even if we're not watching one). The Artist is primarily a Star is Born like film about a falling actor and rising star. The plot is fine, but the meat of the film is about George's struggles to adapt to shifting movie preferences, and because we only get small amounts of dialogue we fail to get a good sense of why he is so adamant about silent films and how his frustrations manifest. As the movie progresses, it becomes more and more about his emotional instability and his relationship with Peppy, and the emotional stakes are completely blunted by the fact that we don't hear them talk. Both lead performances are good, and the premise is fine, but it's a story arc I'm not enamored with and uses a style that to me completely undercuts its own intent.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
good classic film making,"I was a little bit timid going in to The Artist, fearing that a PG rated hundred minute silent movie might be soapy and sentimental. I was very impressed to find that this is not the case. The Artist is a film about simple relationships, and that's its strength, simplicity. We begin in the year 1927. George Valentin; a charismatic silent movie star is very fond of the new member of his latest cast, Peppy Miller. She is very fond of him too, but they go separate ways with the arrival of talking pictures. George refuses to take part in such pictures, while Peppy embraces it and goes on to become a super star, leaving George in the shadows. But does this mean she has forgotten him?I think what keeps the movie from being cartoony is that The Artist could have easily been played as a romance, but it chooses not to. George and Peppy are presented as friends not lovers. The movies that are featured within the movie have all the soap and sentiment, but this one is played serious. It does have it's effective moments of comedy though. The best the Artist, even as a silent movie, never feels overdone.Most of the time, The Artist is actually a rather sad movie. A good portion of it is focused on George's low point in life, spent brooding, low on cash, and unable to make a successful film. The two leads carry the film, beautifully. Director Michael Hazanavicious trusts his actors completely. He chooses to let the camera linger on their faces rather than break up the scenes with to many caption cards. In fact there is more dialogue spoken and inaudible in the Artist than there is captioned dialogue. The plot is presented accessible to a fairly general audience while still being a maturity of subject matter; also quite impressive.The Artist is shot and assembled very well, and looks like something that was made eighty years ago. One item worth noting is of course how early movies have far more static frames than moving ones, as stedicams and shoulder camera-work would not be in vogue il the mid- late twentieth century. Even for a mostly static picture, there are some great shots and angles. I particularly enjoyed a dutch angle (diagonal) shot of George at a table which is so polished that you can't telling with is the man and which is the reflection until he spills his drink.The ending came a little bit more abruptly than I thought. for a film with such a long middle section I would've liked to an extra five to ten minutes. the hundred minutes that made up the Artist are a delightful throwback, with room for laughs and tears. It's a film with heart and soul, and even if imperfect is one of the most disticive films of the year.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Timeless class. Humour, pathos and the shortest script for decades","This film is one of the most refreshing I have seen in a long time. A slight reworking of the 'Star is Born' tale but so much more. The chemistry between the two main actors (and the dog) simmers gently. The scene when filming take after take is probably the most sensitive and evocative expose of falling in love I have ever seen. All the scenes are well worked and superbly directed and filmed, some scenes are just exquisite. All the actors create subtle but powerful roles with no ego inflected cameos. Oh! and it is in black and white and a silent movie. but the use and timing of sound is remarkable. And you will want a Jack Russel after seeing this.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Contemporary Silent Film a Classic?,"The artist is a smartly crafted tribute to movies from the silent era. Everything from the sets, to hair and outfits to the overly exaggerated expressions, to even the late 20s mentality brought us back to movies from that time period. The actors expertly emphasized the over the top emotions which are needed since verbal expression is not possible. The as minimal as possible shots of written words to convey a statement, as was done in silent films from the past, was a fun aspect that showed how minor a role words actually play in order to convey a story by film.It was a nice tribute and it excellently mocked those old silent movies however The Artist is not a classic as those old silent films are. I think when a silent film is revisited it is not so much for its entertainment value but rather for its value as a classic as a art form in its infancy, perhaps to get a sense of the time period or perhaps to touch on film history by witnessing legendary actors or filmmakers. It was impossible for The Artist to achieve this level or any level of nostalgic classic nor will it since it is a contemporary parody.As a silent film and as a mimic of those old silent films it had a cumbersome pacing at times. It was rather light hearted and didn't have as much as that interesting psychological dark edge as other similar stories that explored a Hollywood star that is once on top, loses it all and is no longer relevant has; think Sunset Boulevard. There were also much more entertaining movies made about the advent of talkies and the impact it had on actors from the time period, think Singing in the Rain.The Artist is mildly entertaining, with a premise that felt revisited. It was a comfortable tribute that expertly recreated films from the 1920s.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not as good as it thinks it is,"I had high hopes for THE ARTIST, a modern-day black and white silent movie that promised to be a charming celebration of movie-making in the silent era and a film which swept the board at the Oscars. Unfortunately it's a movie that's not as good as it thinks it is, one which happily copies that which has come before rather than providing much in the way of originality.The story involves a famous silent film actor who finds his career in the doldrums after the arrival of 'talkies', sound films which effectively bankrupt him and end his career. Gee, wasn't this done already - and with a lot more charm and vigour - in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN? Elsewhere, there are plot links to the likes of SUNSET BOULEVARD, but THE ARTIST feels overall like a pastiche rather than genuinely profound piece of cinema.Sure, there are a handful of funny moments here and there - my favourite scene is the 'sound' nightmare - and the dog is instantly lovable. But I felt that Jean Dujardin was smug rather than likable, and his romance with a co-star is pretty sappy and doesn't really go anywhere. The ending also feels false, apparently tap dancing makes all the problems go away. Like Scorsese's HUGO, this is a film that had everybody raving about it, yet I fear it's one of those ""Emperor's new clothes"" situations after all.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Modern Silent Masterpiece,"From the beginning, this film was destined to fail.I've never seen a silent film. I've got a couple on the ""to-see"" list, but I've never seen one. That's why I went into The Artist with excitement, but apprehension. Would I like it? People don't talk, what about the story? Will I get bored? All those questions disappeared in the first 10 minutes of the film.Truly a delightful and utterly unique film, The Artist is pitch perfect (mind the irony)! I loved the characters, the rush backwards in time to the late 1920's, and ESPECIALLY the absolutely charming and 100% original film score to accompany the Artist.The film itself is heavy with thought provoking material: Why does modern film lack the ""movie magic""?, How can simplicity find a voice when big special effects or conformity are the true ticket seller? Who cares about character and story anymore? It's a unique film in this sense.Continuing, you will love the characters. They don't utter a word, but you will grow extremely attached to them, from the start. Jean Dujardin is incredible as the lead as well! the acting is all around incredible!From the beginning, the film was destined to fail. No big name stars, no eye popping trailer, it's not directed by Lucas or Spielberg or other big dogs, and...hold on...it's a silent film? In 2012? Are you kidding?But your thinking is backwards. It's been tainted for years by big names, big budgets and big industry. The Artist is the most refreshing, delightful, fun and entertaining film I've seen in 2011. Give the Artist your full attention. This director, musical composer and wonderful cast has found their voice in the simplest of forms.

This Season's Best Movie,"If you like something that's different in more ways than one for the holidays, where the movie has real plot and character development, and not standard cartoonish violence as in many of this season's holiday movies, then run, don't walk, to see ""The Artist."" The movie is headed by two international stars who should become well-known to American audiences - French actor Jean Dujardin as the hero George Valentin, and Argentinian actress Berenice Bejo as the ingenue Peppy Miller, along with the familiar faces of John Goodman as his usual cheerful self in the role of the egomaniacal studio head Al Zimmer, Penelope Ann Miller as Valentin's troubled wife, Doris, and James Cromwell as Valentin's faithful butler.The message of ""The Artist"" is all about changes in our culture. Also, this movie, while maintaining its originality, pays homage to two of the greatest Hollywood movies ever made, ""Singin' in the Rain,"" where Debbie Reynold's regular voice fit best for talkies as Jean Hagen's itty-bitty voice didn't, and fell for her co-star, Gene Kelly, and the storyline of ""A Star is Born,"" where the heroine's celebrity rises and the hero's celebrity falls. For those who really think that ""they don't make movies like the used to,"" then you see everything in ""The Artist."" It is much more than an all black and white silent movie. It is a tribute that makes the viewer think, feel, and yet enjoy its magical movie-making. It is funny, sometimes disturbing, intellectual, and the viewer leaves with good feeling and emotion. And that's what a great movie is all about.The storyline goes that George Valentin is a hot 1920s silent movie hero who meets dancer Peppy Miller. He puts the beauty mark on her and then she is a star ingenue. However, Al Zimmer realistically announces to George that the movies are forever changing to sound, which is true in our culture, and George feels disheartened over his silent film celebrity status. Even more disheartening when Peppy's sound movie is a fit, George's last silent movie is a flop, and George's actress wife, Doris, deserts him. George moves into a small apartment with Clifton, and his Jack Russell Terrier, and still more desolation ensues. George drinks uncontrollably, attempts suicide twice, and the only people to save him are his smart and loyal dog who knows more danger signals than humans, and Peppy, who loves George unconditionally. The predictable but exhilarating ending is a real gem that not only makes the viewer feeling good, but thinking what will come next for years to come. And finally, George is back in form in the next status, which Peppy adapted to right away.The last silent movie tribute was, well, Mel Brooks' ""Silent Movie"" back in 1976. Sorry, but audiences these days seem to be more interested in a thoughtful tribute than a mindless but still always hilarious and timeless parody by our spoofmeister Brooks. Thirty-five years later, we get the real treat for what the silents are all about. Call it artsy and all black and white, but ""The Artist"" is a thought-provoker that I would like to see nominated for Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor Dujardin, and Best Actress Bejo. I'm not the best at handicapping Oscars, but it looks so far that this movie may win for all its artistic merits.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

In modern times where movies are heading towards high definition IMAX, CGI and what not, a black and white seems like a step back, much less a silent one. But this film is definitely worth your time if you're a fan of classics. Easy to comprehend and very enjoyable to watch.

Great Homage to Silent Cinema,"Artist, The (2011)**** (out of 4)Silent film star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) wonders what the invent of sound movies is going to have on his career and he quickly finds out when he's out of money and can't get a job. While he's career is going down the drain, a young woman (Berenice Bejo) he helped get into the business has her career take off. As a silent film buff I was a little cautious when a heard that someone was attempting to make another in today's time but those fears were put to rest because THE ARIST is a tremendous success as not only a film but also as a love letter to cinema. It's funny to think that this movie as well as Martin Scorsese's HUGO would be released so closely together and give the silent films such a boom but both movies have their hearts in the right place and it's the viewers who are going to be treated. Shot in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio and in black and white, director Michel Hazanavicius does a masterful job at pulling off all the glamor with the style. The movie is a very good replica of what silent movies are all about as we get some great laughs, good melodrama and of course a couple chase/action scenes. I thought the screenplay was so simple yet the director took what he had and did as much with it as he possibly could. I always say a familiar story can be told countless times as long as you have talent telling it. The film is obviously influenced by and borrows elements from A STAR IS BORN and SINGIN' IN THE RAIN but the story is catchy, it pulls you in and it's a lot of fun. Much credit has to also go to both Dujardin and Bejo. Both actors do a marvelous job in their silent roles. There are some insults about mugging at the camera, which play an important part in the story but both of these actors give it their all and you really do get a feel that they are giving what a silent performance should. Dujardin speaks so easily without words because you never have a problem knowing and feeling what's going on inside him. Bejo is just so charming and sweet that you can see why an actress like her would have boomed back in the early talkie era. The supporting cast includes strong work by John Goodman, James Cromwell, Malcolm McDowell and Penelope Ann Miller. THE ARTIST works on just about every level but I think it's strongest cord is the fact that it pays homage to a great age in movies. People complain about certain movies today and I always tell them that there are great movies out there but sometimes you have to search for them because they're not playing on three- thousand screens. THE ARIST not only breaks that tradition but it pays respect to the great movies that came before it.",,Anonymous,Romance
The Artist is Pure Art!,"I doubt as a reviewer I can say anything about this movie that hasn't already been saidbut as a filmmaker who has written and produced a film on the silent film era (Madcap Mabel) I can say plenty, starting with the sub-title to The Artist should be ""Is Great"". For starters, what the film does best is not overplay its concept. It is a silent film but it doesn't hit us over the head by playing to the public's general perception of what those films entailed. For instance, title cards and music are used sparingly and not as cliché devices catering to what people not familiar with the genre (in other wordsthe majority of the movie going audience) would expect to see. This not only gives one an appreciation for not being catered or dumbed down to, but allows the actors to truly earn their keep by ""acting"".The story is simple but classicafter helping young starlet ""Peppy Miller"" (the name fits the character), movie idol ""George Valentin"" (the last name perhaps an homage to silent great Rudolph) falls on hard times and when the now famous actress he's helped tries to return the favor, his pride becomes his biggest demon. OK, we've seen this when James Mason's alcoholic binges destroyed him after making Judy Garland the title character in the classic A Star is Born. However, setting this theme in the silent movie era, using the advent of sound as the impetus which led to the title character's downfall (fueled of course by a drug more dangerous to an actor than alcohol""ego"") was both ingenious and historically accurate as many a silent film star's career disappeared when sound first emerged from their mouths (as another classic, Singin' in The Rain, could attest).The film's structure moves everything at a great pace. We see actor Valentin's subtle downfall from fame equally balanced with starlet Miller's rise and again without the usual clichés. The cinematography is as sharp as any classic black & white film and the few lines we do read from title cards are witty and clever. Finally, the ending which I will not give away, brings everything full circle.Director Michel Hazanavicius should be applauded for not only attempting the risk of making a silent film about silent films in this day and age, but for writing a screenplay which not only brings together such classic themes, but doing it in ways that cleverly highlight the film's genre by using its silent limitations. I not only smell Oscar nomination herebut maybe Oscar itself.Speaking of Oscarlead Actor Jean Dujardin should also be getting an early phone call on nomination day for his portrayal of the egotistical yet always classy fading star. As for lead Actress Berenice Bejoshe does the impossible by letting her natural beauty come second to her natural acting. Her performance combines comedy, tragedy and genuine emotion and one can't help wonder how great she would have been as an actual actress from that era. Her large expressive eyes which make one melt with every blink speak volumeswhich although an oxy-moron when discussing silent film is certainly true in this case. Her scene with a coat rack is hysterically-romantic and if the Academy gave an award for ""Cute Dancing"", her ""Charleston"" would be win handsor should I say ""feet"" down. In good supporting roles are Penelope Ann Miller as Valentin's long suffering wife ""Doris"", James Cromwell as his chauffeur /assistant ""Clifton"" and John Goodman as the blustery studio head ""Al Zimmer"" (another good name). And for all you pet loversyes, Valentin has a very talented dog that fills those ""awwwww"" moments.The films only fault maybe it could put acting schools and teachers out of business for all aspiring thespians need do to learn the true craft of their vocation is to watch the heartfelt, well written and well directed performances in The Artist. As a silent movie buff I Iook at this film as a love letter to that bygone era and hope and expect it will renew and create interest in classic silent movies and silent movie stars. As a writer, producer, actor and general movie lover myself I give it as many stars as the talkies destroyed. In fact, I've already put in my pre-order on Amazon for the DVD, the insert of which I'm sure will feature the words ""Academy Award Winner"".",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Silent pictures? They deserve better than this.,"I won't mince words here: for me this was a desperately disappointing film. I am a passionate fan of the movies, especially the silents, of which I have seen more than a hundred, ranging from the excellent to the almost unwatchable and I must say that ""The Artist"" does not come up to my expectations. I shall be very surprised if it wins any major awards. It is not a silent film, it is not even a silent film with recorded musical score and occasional sound effects like, say ""Sunset"" or ""The Trail of '98"", it is more like a talkie with the dialogue track muted. The musical score is completely wrong as it sounds to me a couple of decades later than the period of the film. There is too much lip movement and there are too few titles: silent movie lovers will know that by the end of the silent era, titles were used sparingly and the unheard dialogue was short and to the point. Add to this the fact that the lead characters were not particularly likable and the film was too long. I was expecting a tribute to the art form I love and ended up watching a spoof! I much prefer ""Singin' in the Rain""-at least it is an honest spoof.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Best Film and Soundtrack I've seen in a long time.,"I just saw this film and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I was surprised that a black-and-white movie could captivate and affect me so much. Ironically, the fact that it wasn't a color talkie with modern special effects actually helped me to pay attention to the wonderful film; the score/soundtrack (best soundtrack, in my opinion, since I saw ""Fantasia"" back in the seventies), the facial expressions and bodily movements, and the absence of speaking ""spoke"" to my emotions rather than to my intellect. Sometimes modern technology, including color, and language distract me; they also seem to enable bad acting and imbecilic plots. The acting in ""The Artist"" was superb (I especially enjoined the leading man's and leading lady's performances), the costumes were authentic (I loved the fact that men actually dressed up and wore ties to the movies), the vehicles were works of art (rather than the plastic bubbles we drive today); I felt nostalgic for a time when class and compassion reigned supreme.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sublime,"""The Artist"" is a true cinematic achievement. In this day and age of CGI effects, color, 3-D and wide screen, here is a film done for all practical purposes, like a film made in 1928. This is so well-made it hard to know where to begin. The music score has the sound of an actual Vitaphone score from the period. In particular, some of the score reminded me of ""The Jazz Singer"". The narrow-screen aspect and evocative black-and-white photography added to the vintage atmosphere the makers were trying to convey. The players are all excellent, and wow! Can the two leads dance? Watch them! It took me about a month to see this because it did not play at all in Chicago for the first month of it's limited release. At the end of the screening, the audience actually applauded. Something I haven't seen in a long time. The appreciation by the audience made me think that if a contemporary audience can enjoy this, they may not avoid some of the other classic silent films that are still available to be enjoyed.

"Thoroughly enjoyable, and mightily ambitious, it's worthy of the applause.","When The Artist premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May, it opened to an enthusiastic reception that continued to spread over to the U.S. Now hat I see it, it isn't hard for me to see why it's been bringing audiences to their feet, and claiming Best Picture awards left and right.The Artist was a passion project for director Michel Hazanavicius. He'd long wanted to make a film inspired by the black & white silent movies of the 1920's and early 30's. There's barely any audible dialogue or sound effects in the whole film besides music. The movie's first ambient sound effects aren't heard until half an hour through the film, and they aren't followed by any more until a full hour later. This is where Hazanavicius specifically lets his writing and direction take center stage.Some may call it incredibly flashy, but I actually find the direction to be quite subtle. Co-working as both a director and film editor, Hazanavicius paces the movie at the exact rate it always needs. He pieces together his excellent cast's performances with style, and knows when to make a quick cut, whether it be to another person or an inter-title. But he also knows when to slow things down, to let the audience absorb the detail of the film, such as the pleasant cinematography and lovely costumes, and to let a shot go uninterrupted and let Ludovic Bource's elegant, if not always so subtle, musical score do the storytelling. This is a thematically and technically excellent score, as Bource relishes in the lightly romanticized and melodramatic orchestrations inspired by those from the golden age of Hollywood.What Hazanavicius ultimately excels at best is his terrific cast. There's a whole slew of outstanding performances in this picture that perform perfectly, and manage to tell us almost a whole story without saying a single word: including great supporting roles by John Goodman, James Cromwell, and Penelope Ann Miller. Standout notices go to Jean Dujardin, whose natural charisma, sincerity, and incredible array of emotion in the role of George Valentin is enough to carry the whole film on its own. Berenice Bejo, on top of being so utterly beautiful, gives a masterstroke portrayal as the enthusiastic Peppy Miller, never uttering a single line, but charming us and placing us under an irresistible spell. As if that weren't enough, Uggie the dog, who plays Valentin's faithful pet, is the most adorable thing I've seen all year. Applause is most richly deserved.**** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The moment the credits roll, you'll want it to start all over again.","The Artist is, without a doubt, one of the best movies of the year. An original masterwork filled with true moments of joy, drama, pain, and classic romance that hasn't been seen on-screen this side of Singing in the Rain or Gone With the Wind.For the modern audience, most of whom have never actually seen a silent film, the task of sitting through an entire production based around the concept of a silent actor portrayed in a silent movie will prove to be a cinematic curve that will deter certain audience members (see: anyone who liked Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides).For those who are willing to listen, The Artist will provide the most satisfying taste of cinema's ability to truly entertain.George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a prominent silent film star in the late 1920s. On the top of the world, Valentin spends his days working at a job he loves, coming home to his loyal (and adorable) dog, Uggie . He also comes home to his wife, Doris (Penelope Anne Miller), but a brief hello is the extent of their vapid interaction.Valentine has a chance meeting with a fan while schmoozing for the crowd, and this serendipitous event turns out to have vast repercussions on George's future. The girl, Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), soon musters up her own career, eventually finding a place for herself in Hollywood. The attraction is immediate and visceral, but the two cannot consummate their feelings.When ""talkies"" become the future of the movie industry, George finds himself out of work, a has-been, and decides to prove the world wrong by making his own silent feature. All the while, Peppy finds herself as the new face of the talking Hollywood era. From here The Artist weaves a wonderfully spirited portrayal of a man who has it all, loses what he loves, and must come to terms with what his life can be.Will he find love? Will he get back on top? Will he make it out alive?Valentin is one of cinema's most empathetic characters to come along in years. He's a throwback to the stern of mind, light of feet, and ""quick with a joke or a light of your smoke"" movie stars from a by-gone era. Jean Dujardin, who has rightfully earned many awards and nominations for his performance is simply—enigmatic. He shows more emotion in his left eyelash than most actors over an entire career.Physical comedy, which hasn't been enjoyable on-screen since Jim Carrey and Chris Farley were able to capture the magic again in the early '90s, is finally back. When George and Peppy engage in a Deliverance moment of back and forth dance steps, the audience cannot help but smile. The Artist is a gift, it brings the past to the present, full of all the original charm and charisma that made cinema a worthy art form in its genesis.In order to engage a modern audience effectively, The Artist boasts a captivating score by Ludovic Bource. Helping to keep the audience up to speed with the tone and feeling of each scene, the score's heightened importance creates a different kind of cinematic experience that hasn't been around since the silent film era. There is no other score as integral as The Artist's is to its success.The Artist is also masterfully directed by Michel Hazanavicius, choosing to visually move the audience with shots framed with a classic elegance and movement. (It was actually shot in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio from the silent film era.) The scene that showcases this best features George drinking whiskey on a reflective table. The camera turns upside down, framing his reflection, only to have the whiskey poured on top and distill his appearance. The scene gives the audience everything they need know about the character, and it's simply brilliant to watch.OverallA captivating and cultured cinematic love letter to the era of Hollywoodland, The Artist not only hearkens back to the best of the era, but pushes modern cinema forward with a look back to where it came from. It's amazing with all of the hack Hollywood scripts floating around, the idea of turning them into silent movies shouldn't be altogether cast aside. (It's a shame The Artist wasn't around before George Lucas started working on his prequels, audiences may have never been subjected to that horrid excuse for dialog. C'est la vie.)On the SideUggie is one one of the best on-screen dogs in years. In fact, this year boasted a rather large collection of memorable pets, including Arthur in Beginners, Dolce in Young Adult, Skeletor in 50/50, and (stretching a bit here) Caesar in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Any dog lover must see The Artist, simply to shed a few tears about the love between a man and his best friend.",,Anonymous,Romance
More homage than something new,"OK I get it. It's black and white. I don't want to play the meathead who can't appreciate the artistry of The Artist. But I don't think it's as profound as some have made it. There's a reason that kind of film went away and hasn't return in any significant way for 3/4 century. And I don't see this as a trend either.Jean Dujardin is pretty good playing broad as the matinée heartthrob who couldn't make it in sound. Bérénice Bejo is also pretty good. Without sound, that's one aspect that is missing from their performance and it feels the absence. If there was one way to break thru for me, it's to add much more physicality to the movie. Think of Buster Keaton, or Charlie Chaplin. The action is more cute than daring. The story is also cute and functional. Certainly there nothing ground breaking going on. The whole thing feels more like a homage to the silent era than creating something brand new.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Should be Oscar's Best Picture of 2011,"When witnessing the evolution of film, it's hard to grasp how it went from a seemingly simple concept of silent imagery into a loud, uproarious third dimension experience. Michel Hazanavicius' silent film The Artist plays homage to the origins of our cinema in a general manner while attaining a massive respect that can't be denied. The film tells the story of George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), a silent film actor megastar who withers away into obscurity when the introduction of ""talkies"" meets monumental popularity. Movie extra Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) is a star on the rise who's admiration for George's work runs much deeper than the film's they share. Writer/Director Michel Hazanavicius explores the deepest parts of his soul which he calls ""a love letter."" What a beautiful letter it was. He makes conscious choices to illustrate the medium in the most toxic and potent fashion. A Q & A with Hazanavicius' at the end of the picture placed much into perspective. His funny, mild-tempered personality will carry him extremely far in this year's Oscar race. He could easily be the new director that everyone roots for. His stamp on the film is evident and his adoration and tribute to the genre is clear and ostentatious.Dujardin and Bejo showing Oscar all they got... The obvious question is how does the silence work and is it done well? Tying in with the prominent theme of silence, the presentation is an absolute marvel. Hazanavicius' respect for film bleeds out the screen into the audience and with so little words, we are transported into a world of unspoken expressions and explosive representation. The narrative is so uniquely relevant and intricately precise, that every scene is as equally important as the one before it. There's no fluff just brilliance. Production design by Laurence Bennett alters the viewer's perception of reality and engages a time travel experience to Hollywood 1927. The sets are so imaginative and exquisite, the film runs like a hybrid of classic films like Rebecca (1940) and Angels with Dirty Faces (1938). Cinematographer Guillaume Schiffman shoots the film with a modern camera but attacks each scene with finesse and diligence like an old pro. He captures some of the best shots seen this year on film. Hazanavicius not only writes and directs this triumphant piece of cinema, he dips his hand into the editing process with Anne-Sophie Bion. The duo know their pace and they know when to give more and pull back. At 100 minutes of pure cinematic magic, it's one of the rare instances in film where it begins and ends perfectly. Bringing to light the gorgeous production design, the gray whirlwind images shoots the costume design by Mark Bridges to the forefront. Bridges captures sharply the essence of time especially with Peppy's wardrobe. An awards magnet indeed. The star of the technical show is Ludovic Bource, a composer that just catapulted himself into the big leagues as composers John Williams and Alexandre Desplat. In a silent film, the music is important and needs to be on queue every second. Bource knows when to play it rough and especially when to retreat and let the film speak for itself. It's not overkill in the slightest. The supporting players, which American audiences will know more than our two polarizing leads, are effective in their respective roles. John Goodman proves to be the strongest of the players, ripping through scenes of comedic brilliance and showing that he still has everything in his armor. Penelope Ann Miller, an underused and undervalued actress during her prime returns to form as the beautiful Doris, a brokenhearted housewife looking for some attention. James Cromwell plays Clifton, the ""Alfred-type"" driver to Dujardin's ""Bruce Wayne,"" a tantalizing and endearing performer that shakes the hearts of the viewers. Malcolm McDowell shows brief but subtle showmanship. The Artist is the year's finest and most wonderful film. The Academy Awards can stop looking, this is their winner for Best Picture 2011. A fine piece of cinema that will hopefully be clutched by moviegoers for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A very unique film.,"The Artist is a story about silent movie star George Valentin(Jean Dujardin). When the era of silent movies end, Valentin is worried whether he'll lose his popularity in the new era of movies. Whereas Peppy Miller(Berenice Bejo), an aspiring dancer is on the verge of a big break. I really loved the idea of making a silent movie after all these years. The story of the movie was really emotional & touching. You really feel sad for George Valentin when people lose interest in his silent movies. However, the movie was a bit dragging in the middle. Jean Dujardin has done a spectacular job in his portrayal of George Valentin. Berenice Bejo is impressive as Peppy Miller. The supporting actors have done a good job as well. So, I would like to conclude by saying, The Artist is worth a watch. Is it Oscar worthy? Not really.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A peace treaty between silence and sound,"Hollywood has never reconciled with its silent past. Most of the infrastructure that supports the 21st century film industry, from film technique to the studios themselves, have their roots in the silent era. This film (and Martin Scorcesse's Hugo) helps to bridge that gap and does it brilliantly.The two leads, Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo, are spot on perfect in their performances. The direction of Michel Hazanavicius was pristine.We're afforded glimpses of the lives of Douglas Fairbanks, John Gilbert, Gretta Garbo and other silent luminaries in this story of how Hollywood learned to talk.This story is not exclusively for young or old, male or female, or any particular nationality.

OFFICIALLY MY FAVORITE SILENT FILM,"Very seldom does anybody get to watch a good silent film in this modern era of filmmaking, and I was fortunate, as was everybody else, to have come across this French gem. Michael Hazanavicius did a fantastic job creating a film that was like a big shoutout to the entire movie industry and its colorful history. The storytelling was so simplistic and charming that one cannot ask for more. It felt like it was one of those films that speak for itself. Great performances from Bejo and Dujardin. Even the supporting actors were amazing too. The film does a careful but impressive job in creating a perfect atmosphere of sadness and joy in between scenes. And for all of that it was one of the most enjoyable films to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dull,"I don't get why people are agog over this movie. I wanted to like the movie but it was achingly boring through the first hour that I didn't think I could take the last 40 minutes. It picks up a little in the second half as it gets darker but it's still limp. Not as good as any ordinary silent movie I've ever seen. Overly campy, predictable, and frankly boring. I thought the movie would provide modern movie story-telling to an old art form to transform the medium. It clearly didn't do that and also failed as an ode to the glorious silent films of the past. Simply making a silent film today that is weak, insipid and vacuous does not qualify as homage. Even the independent film house where I saw this movie, which has adoring audiences that tend to applaud at the end of every movie, failed to generate the obligatory applause when this tome ended. I was very disappointed.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Wonderful Cinematic Experience!,"A perfect score for a classic film.Given the risks taken (the largely b/w and silent elements to the film, for a start) I'm really impressed that it was made at all. Set in the era of silent movies but on the cusp of radical change, Hazanavicius has unravelled a tight story with playfulness and pathos; based around the rise of one star's career and decline of another's.Rarely present in films, both leads show genuine star quality with compelling chemistry drawing them together as circumstances and pride conspire to keep them apart. Over the years I've resisted leaving a review on IMDb but have eventually succumbed here, believing that this film deserves to enjoy the success of its many virtues. 'The Artist' has the rudiments of a solid, classic film – a well-paced, empathetic and evolving plot, characters with likable personalities and an interesting, brave medium in relating the story. This film has a lot to say and does so in style.If you love going to the cinema then please see this movie but if you don't like films much then this may change your disposition...I hope it will delight and move you as much as I. Long live storytelling!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Will leave you speechless,"I'm quite confident to say that ""The Artist"" will be the best film of 2012 and the year hasn't really even started yet. It's quite a shame to see how ""The Artist"" was only playing on my local cinema (well not local, local that one doesn't have anything worth seeing on it! It's just got one screen and it's usually kiddie films, but it's cheap and they have the odd thing on which can be useful) for just one week, on one of its smaller screens (still bigger than my local, local one!) I can only presume that its been taken off early for ""The Darkest Hour 3D"" because they thought that a silent black and white film will not do well. Who's going to want to see a black and white film? Never mind it being silent! Obviously a lot more people are going to want to see the upcoming masterpiece ""The Darkest Hour 3D"" that's clogging up two screens because it's in 3D. Well they're wrong! (If I'm assuming correctly) because ""The Artist"" sticks one gracious middle finger up at 3D blockbusters and has you asking, ""Who the heck needs sound?""! Because it is an absolute masterpiece!The only other film I've ever felt slightly the same about was last year's ""Black Swan"" (although I don't think I'd put it up there yet...) But that just shows how ""The Artist"" really is for everyone, because it is absolutely nothing like ""Black Swan"" apart from the fact that it ended on the stage. ""Black Swan"" is an extremely intense character piece that literally blew my mind (don't worry I'm not schizophrenic) whereas ""The Artist"" is a character piece but presented in such a different way that it blew my mind as well! I knew that when I went to see it that it was going to be good, I just didn't have no idea it would be THAT good! I probably would've gone to see the very next screening but it cost £8.65 or something outrageous like that. Thankfully, ""The Artist"" is worth every single penny. If you have to pawn your watch to see this film then DO IT!Why am I getting excited about this film? Well, I've never seen anything like it, quite literally because I've never seen a silent film, just parts of ""Nosferatu"" and so I wasn't quite sure what to get. Actually ""The Artist"" has pretty much everything, fabulous acting, beautiful directing and cinematography, engaging story, amazing music that just carries the whole film! The soundtrack is gorgeous and basically does play throughout the whole film, only when their is no music, it's done in perfect timing and is just breathtaking!""The Artist"" also carries so much emotion, it's happy, it's sad, it's angry, it's funny, pretty much every emotion is shed on that screen and it's just an absolute delight to see. I wasn't expecting ""The Artist"" to be quite so deep either, because I didn't really know much about it, I just knew it was a love story, when actually it is so much more! It's a character piece really on our hero George who places too much faith in silent films, when talkies suddenly appear around the corner. It's also an extremely clever idea to present a film about the silent era as a silent film, because you can actually sympathise with George as it makes you thing ""Talkies are crap!"" When a film can look this beautiful and be silent and black and white.""The Artist"" is also so amazingly clever! It's like great literature being projected onto a screen. Like ""Black Swan"" and ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" it carries so much symbolism and visual metaphors that are just so clever it had me astounded. The film is also so beautifully shot! There are some shots that I thought looked absolutely perfect, like when George sees his shadow on the white screen, and when he sees his reflection wearing a suit, these are absolutely perfect shots that are also executed magnificently. There just seem to be so many great moments throughout the film that are sure to make this film a classic for years to come, it's the definition of ""modern masterpiece"".I have to talk about the actors as well, Jean Dujardin is perfectly cast, from the moment we see him he is instantly likable. He has this perfect silent era charm about him and is such a great comic actor and emotionally charged actor. You can feel his pain and happiness where ever is appropriate. Bérénice Bejo also has a great charm about her, she's weirdly beautiful and also a great actress. The dog is also an absolute joy to watch. When he's on screen (I know it's a ""he""!) he brings guaranteed laughs, and also tugs on your ""aww"" strings. The dog is actually an amazing actor and probably should win ""Best Supporting Actor"" at the Oscars.In fact ""The Artist"" should win everything at the Oscars, it should win ""Best Picture"", ""Best Director"", ""Best Actor"", ""Best Actress"", ""Best Screenplay"", ""Best Music"", ""Best Sound"" (no really their is some great use of sound in their!) But then again I said the same thing about ""Black Swan"" and that only won the one. ""The Artist"" is a film for everyone, it's oozing to the brim with sophistication, and if it was a woman it would charm me right into bed! It'll make you laugh and it just maybe might make you cry on a couple of occasions, but one things for sure it will make you full of absolute joy. ""The Artist"" is perfect, basically perfect, from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"One of the years best, most charming films, a total gem","The Academy of Motion Pictures ran a film series (here in L.A.) earlier this year, of some of histories best silent films. If the film I saw tonight, The Artist, had been released (yet) this film surely would have made the list. This is one of the most charming, funny, sweet, clever movies I have seen in years. Everything about this movie works and is executed to perfection. Due to the fact that I actually watched several silent films on the big screen earlier this year, I can say this film looks straight out of the 1920's and is one of the best reminder's of why America fell in love with the movies.The Artist opens in 1927, to a packed movie theater enjoying another silent Hollywood film premiere. As the credits end, its star George Valentin (played by Jean Dujardin in a sure- fire Oscar nomination for Best Actor),who is strikingly similar to Douglas Fairbanks, walks onto the theaters' stage. Considering the man never udders a word throughout the whole film, it sounds funny to say I think he will get an Oscar nomination in the Best Actor category, but I do! And yup, I think The Artist's stunning leading lady Berenice Bejo will probably get nominated for her portrayal of Hollywood's favorite ""talkie"" star Peppy Miller. Peppy Miller (Bejo), an aspiring Hollywood actress, bumps into star George Valentin (Dujardin) leaving the opening film premiere, and there relationship continues over the nest several years. As his career fades with the silent film era, her career grows with the ""talkies"". There is delightful cast of characters peppered throughout the movie, played by actors such as James Cromwell, John Goodman, Penelope Ann Miller, Missi Pyle, Ed Lauter and Malcolm McDowell.Do not let the fact that this film is in black and white and silent deter you. The music is so perfectly matched to every scene, and still authentic to the era. In fact, you guessed it, the music is so good I am sure that it will be nominated for Music (original score). And while i am predicting this films chances at the 2012 Oscars, adding to what I have already mentioned, I expect it to also get nominations for Art Direction, Cinematography, Costume Design, Directing, Film Editing, Makeup and Writing (original screenplay). This is a film that can't be given justice with description, it must be scene on the big screen.

Dr. Johnson's Dog,"I liked this movie, but it reminded me a bit of Dr. Johnson's dog walking on its two hind legs: it was noteworthy only because it could be done at all. (The real dog in The Artist is one of the best things in the film.) Otherwise, I was principally struck by the camera work. The film seems largely true in its sets, costumes, music and, most especially, in the over-sized, operatic acting that is necessary for a silent. But the camera work is oddly, relentlessly modern. The filmmaker avoids antique devises (there was one iris-in; no wipes or dissolves). The editing is quick. There was a lot more tracking and dollying than I think would be the case in your average silent where the actors spend more time moving about in a static establishing shot.So we are left with an odd conclusion: the filmmaker (or the producers) evidently decided that we would pay money to see a silent film only if it was not VISUALLY true to the silent era. And, after all is said and done, we get exactly what the movie is: a modern film pretending to be a silent.",,Anonymous,Romance

The Artist is a once in a generation piece of film-making which will hopefully pick up the Best Picture Oscar.We've been bombarded with remakes, sequels and based-on-a-comic films for years now, there's a general lack of imagination and an overuse of CGI. Films sometimes have multiple script-writers and you just know that things have been tweaked and changed to please preview audiences of teenagers. The Artist takes us back to a time when cinema was about entertainment, when new technology was used to improve things rather than swamp the product with an 'aren't we clever with computers?' attitude.It has moments of great humour and great poignancy, many of these moments enhanced by a mere facial expression from the fantastic Jean Dujardin (Best Actor Oscar with any luck), ably supported by Berenice Bejo and ....Uggy the Jack Russell in a scene-stealing performance.

Performing Dog,"I saw this strange silent revivalist film in the cinema when it came out over a decade ago and was quite taken with it. There's an undeniable swagger to it, and a sense of pacing (at least initially) that still works tremendously well but it certainly suffers from a considerable bloat towards the end and retrospectively it should be viewed as something of a cosy one-hit wonder from a bunch of genre-spoofers rather than something truly revolutionary and the sheer weight of the awards now seem rather silly.

A modern masterpiece about a bygone era.,"Call me a new age critic, but I must have seen only a dozen black and white movies, half of which was re-mastered during the Technicolor era. Having said that, this movie has shot up to the top of my list – Perfect and flawless, yet deep and heart wrenching. What a fantastic and moving experience! This is not just a throwback to the early days of cinema; this movie embodies the heart and soul of cinema as we know it. For a B&W movie, ironically, it is very vivid in its message that no matter who or what we have become, we should never forget our roots.Written and directed by Michel Hazanavicius, this is the motion picture event of 2011 and for a variety of reasons. Hazanavicius' story is simple yet profound with several underlying messages. Set during the late '20s era of black and white films, it tells of the diminishing favor of silent movies as the film industry gives into the increasingly popular 'talkies'. As George Valentin, Jean Dujardin plays a famous but ageing silent movie star when he literally bumps into Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo). Although they form an instant bond, Peppy is overly charismatic and grabs the attention of studio executives with ease. Simultaneously, and with the advent of sound in films, Peppy is all the rage, while George maintains that talkies are just a fad. The inevitable happens when producer Al Zimmer (John Goodman) heralds in the new era of cinema, where Peppy becomes a major Hollywood star, sending George into a tragic downward spiral.If a picture can speak a thousand words, ladies and gents, this movie is that picture. For a silent black and white film, there is so much conveyed, all through astounding facial expressions made possible by brilliant performances. French actors Dujardin and Bejo are simply flawless without uttering a single word. More than just reincarnating screen legends like Charlie Chaplin, Gene Kelly, Grace Kelly or Gloria Swanson, together, Dujardin and Bejo has resurrected a period in history that faded in oblivion almost a century ago. Also worth mentioning are great supporting roles from James Cromwell as George's loyal chauffeur, Goodman as the studio boss and Penelope Ann Miller as George's uncompromising wife, with special mention to Uggie the dog – playing a vital and heart wrenching role.At the end of the movie, standing up and clapping is the least anyone can do in appreciating Hazazavicius' brilliantly crafted work. Without having to mention the staggering number of times this film has been acknowledged at various film festivals and award institutions, I can say that the performances, the story and the music are THE defining factors of this movie. Speaking of which, the original score by Ludovic Bource clearly sets the tone and hugely amplifies the already overwhelming emotions, throughout.With the Academy Awards just round the corner, I personally feel that ""The Artist"", ""Hugo"", and ""The Help"" are each worthy of being nominated for the ""best Picture"". A common thread between the first two is the obvious homage to the early days of cinema and an uncanny 'French connection' that binds them together. Even so, Hazazavicius may have turned the tables on Scorsese with this simple yet beautiful movie within a movie. Pun unintended. In narrowing that down to just one choice, my heart goes out to ""The Artist"". Sure, the likes of Brad Pitt, George Clooney and even Spielberg and Scorsese are often considered Hollywood's favorite sons, but having said that, Michel Hazanavicius and Jean Dujardin have more than reiterated the quintessential soul of cinema – its integrity, its origins, its essence and why it remains society's most powerful form of art.Watch it only because this is a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Isn't the message clear? Technology should be to the service of brilliant scenarios, directing and music.Overall this movie gave me hope that serious art will eventually reach the mass and we will leave behind our current era of superficiality.From a certain point of view, this movie brings post-modern art to the movie-watching masses. Being in black and white and the re-contextualization of the thematic elements makes it more than a simple homage. I am unsure if it's been done this successfully before; while Postmodernism has proliferated in contemporary music and art for a good 30-40 years now, in cinema it has largely been avoided,for commercial reasons. It is simple and charming, far from pretentious, slightly contemporary in its presentation, and certainly deserve its awards.Brilliant acting too by the way.

"Equal parts beautiful, Eerie, atmospheric, charming, and ORIGINAL","""The Artist"" is one of those films that you go into not expecting very much out of it, and, in the end, you're left truly moved, and inspired. This film is certainly unconventional, but that adds to what makes it so GREAT!The year is 1927, the place, Hollywood. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is one of the most successful and beloved silent movie stars, and along with his canine companion and sidekick, Uggie, charms his ways through Hollywood. While making his newest movie, George meets an up and coming dancer and actress, Peppy Miller, who dreams of making it big, and the two start an unusual friendship/partnership, which makes George's already jealous wife (Penelope Anne Miller) even MORE jealous, because she believes that there is something more between the two coworkers One day, the director of George's newest film, and a frequent collaborator and close friend (John Goodman) shows George something new, something that he calls ""the future""- movies with sound, or Talkies. For some reason, George is not willing to speak in the movies, and is convinced, as is everyone else, that he will soon become a thing of the past.Over the next few years, Peppy becomes one of the hottest stars in Hollywood, while George sinks deeper and deeper into obscurity. When his next movie, ""Tears of Love"" opens alongside Peppy's newest Talkie, and proceeds to bomb, he slumps into a deep depression that leads him to fire his butler and closest friend, Clifton (James Cromwell), and on two occasions, attempts to commit suicide, until Peppy comes to his rescue, and saves not only his life, but also his career.What makes ""The Artist"" so terrific is the director and cinematographer's decision to shoot the film in black and white, and make it silent, to add to the authenticity of the time period and the subject. The added bonus of VERY FEW duologue cards allows the audience the opportunity to create duologue between the characters. Combine that with Ludovic Borec's score, which ALSO fits the time period, and you have one hell of a authentic film set in the 1920s. The chemistry between Jean Dujardin and Bernece Bejo is ELECTRIC, and their performances speak magnitudes even though the film is silent. This is ONE HELL of an amazing movie, and it leaves you speechless after the film ends.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Reviews,"I have just seen ""The Artist"" and I liked it very much. It has some creative inventions like the genial part where, during a couple of minutes, suddenly there's sound, though not ""speaking"". The speaking mouths, a bit later, add to the dilemma. Wonderful. Superb acting as well.
Superb technics to convert to a really Silent Age movie. Original the thought.Then I went through ""User Reviews"" and I noticed all good reviews got 0 out of X were helpful.Now if someone dislikes a movie and has serious reasons to formulate higher objections against it in a comment that makes sense, I respect that, but just going through all positive reviews and clicking ""Was this review helpful?"", ""No"", that's vandalism. So I went through them and I clicked ""yes"", to give some counter weight, but this is the way live is in 2019, I fear. Don't bind value to TripAdvisor reviews, or stars for that and that place, or anything else ""validated by customers"", it's all anonymously paid for or just plain resentment.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The meta-level is delicately and subtly explored,"This little French film is a clever, romantic and enjoyable metafilm made with the methods and style of 1920s filmmaking (it's a black-and-white silent film), but with the perspectives of our modern era. The plot is spun around a simple love story about a generous silent film star named George Valentine (Jean Dujardin) who is too proud to make the transition to sound film when this technology takes over, and soon finds that his popularity, fortune and wife has deserted him. Meanwhile, a bright young starlet (Bérénice Bejo) who once made her debut in one of Valentine's films, partly thanks to him, emerges as the biggest star of the burgeoning sound film era. Despite her fame, however, she has never forgotten the silent star who gave her her big break.The Artist is at its best when toying with the vintage conventions on which the film's style and form is based. The meta-level is delicately and subtly explored, and thus never gets in the way of the charming and poignant, if simple, story. This is a clever move by writer/director Michel Hazanavicius, who resists the temptation of making too much of a statement with his retro style. Compared with the best films of the silent era it depicts, The Artist holds its own when it comes to story and soul, with strong, attractive performances by the two leads. To say it is innovative or even particularly creative would be strangely reactionary, but it's a fine film indeed.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"An Absolute Masterpiece, Brilliantly Written, Made, and Acted","This movie is tremendously entertaining. Goosebumps from start to finish. As soon as the movie ended, I could watch it again.However, I would like to comment on one particular aspect not mentioned in most reviews. This is a monumental and ground breaking achievement in the art of film-making and cinematography. I bet that from now on, this movie will be included in the lists of top-50 or top-100 movies of all time, and that all future filmmakers will study how this movie was made.For example, in this mostly silent movie, I could actually hear the dialog by reading the lips, as the actors spoke and brilliantly expressed their parts when the movie was filmed. Judging by light and shade complexity, this black and white movie was filmed in color using high ISO and high resolution equipment, and colors were converted to gray-scale B&W separately and differently, allowing the viewer to guess colors on the B&W screen.Next week we will find out whether it will win the Oscars. I predict it will sweep the Oscars winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Original Screenplay. Even though we may never know the actual Academy Awards voting tally, chances are, ""The Artist"" will win by the widest voting margin since ""The English Patient"".",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
What is the point?,"This is one of the most pretentious films I have ever seen. It is imbued with pointless clichés (the loyal servant, the love at a distance, the failed artist who burns his works, the dog coming to the rescue...not to talk about the tiring and old storyline of pride leading to downfall before final resolution). The two levels, narrative and meta-narrative, are utterly and inexplicably overlapped, mingled without making a point. The choice of making a silent film which speaks of ...silent films and of an actor who would not switch to the new techniques of sound is a very cheap option for a film which aims at winning an Oscar. What is the conveyed message? That silent films are still enjoyable? Or what...? I simply do not see any greatness in this film, only much pretentiousness.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Charm  of Silence,"I don't know if ""The Artist"" is the best movie of 2011 but it is certainly the most charming, original and unexpected. To make in 2011, in the age of the breathtaking and jaw-dropping video possibilities, sound techniques and rapidly becoming the common place 3D, the authentically looking and feeling black and white SILENT movie just like they made them back in 1927, takes guts, talent, and deep and tender love and admiration for above mentioned movies. It takes the director/writer who not only had a dream of bringing the long gone era of cinema's adolescence on big screen but made his dream come true. It takes two basically unknown to the American audiences French actors who were splendid as the stars of the silent pictures in the silent picture (Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo). They were helped by John Goodman, James Cromwell, Penelope Ann Miller, Missi Pyle, and Malcolm McDowell). Let's not forget one special four-legged artist (or there were three of them?) - the cutest, smartest, and most loyal dog that ever graced the screen.I wanted to see the film since I first read about and I expected to like it but I did not expect it to be not only technically perfect and very funny but also melodramatic in the best, sadly almost lost now, meaning of the word. I expected more lighthearted comedy but it is more tragic comedy. It is easy to overdo the melodrama but it never happened with The Artist. It is beautiful, romantic, funny, and spectacular. Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo are the best silent era couple on screen since well.. the end of the silent movies era.As I am writing, ""The Artist"" is one of the major contenders for the Best Picture of the year Oscar having received already the awards from many prestigious organizations and made the countless critics lists. Ironically, in the case of ""The Artist"" to be noticed and heard meant to go completely silent. Is it not miraculous? Another observation - language of cinema is truly international: one of the sweetest love letters to the Hollywood's early years is created by a European director, French Michel Hazanavicius. His film speaks the native film language that involves the images, gestures, eyes, faces, and most importantly - the soul to perfection. It speaks clearly and loudly to movie lovers everywhere. ""The Artist"" is artistique, fantastique, magnifique, et très charmant.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Actions speak louder than words,"I love this film. It's just as simple as that. But I'll explain why I found it to be so enchanting and perfect. I loved how they handled the subject of the rise of the talkies, despite the fact this film is a silent film....If I told you how that would be a spoiler for you. Jean Dujardin (George Valentin) and Berenice Bejo (Peppy Miller)had an amazing chemistry on screen. They really stole the show. But what has to be credited and ofter overlooked is that the fact they only are allowed to capture the audiences attention for about an hour and forty minutes with expression and movements only, no dialogue. That is impressive and not once did I find myself falling asleep, because the enthusiasm of Jean and the sweetness and jolly manner of Berenice was so enjoyable to watch and you know what the say, actions speak louder than words. Of course the dog, Uggie, was beyond brilliant. The music of course was also the star of the film, the music alongside the actions of the actors is vital in terms of trying to convey certain emotions across to the audience. It was so beautiful and perfect for what was taking place within the film. Don't let the fact it is a silent film put you off, because it is so much fun and it is so lively that you can't stop smiling throughout the whole film. The film meets up to the critical acclaim this masterpiece has received, it does not disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
simplicity is key!,"Thank you Michel Hazanavicius for creating such a beautiful and genius film.. It's always refreshing to go to the cinema and be able to experience a new piece of art, instead of the usual guns and explosions and sex. It's pure talent when an actor or actress can portray a message to the audience with no dialogue, but just with brilliant background music, and of course.. real acting! It's movies like this that prove you don't need any special effects, or CGI, or explosions to capture an audience... simplicity is key to this film and Michel plays with the concept of the silent movie era going onto talking so perfectly. Not to mention, there is an adorable dog with more talent than most Hollywood movie stars nowadays. The cinema was packed with old people, middle aged people, teenagers, and even children! And everyone just came out with a smile on their face. 10/10 for simple brilliance!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Aging Actors, Change, and Talkies make for a great time!","Change. It's something that happens, sometimes reluctantly to people who have lived an event so long it becomes faded, out of date, and is being passed up by the wanting of ""the new"". Change is the central topic of The Artist. There was a time Hollywood was innocent, filled with lightness and fluff. The paparazzi weren't trying to tear actors images to pieces for no good reason. Movies were made for the sake of having a good time, not worrying about being the most financially successful or who will win the most Academy Awards. The Artist shows us that time, and though it's a delightful film, it does cross into some dark territory.The Artist may look like is a bagatelle with no worries in the world, everyone is happy all the time. It does charm the smile right onto your face, but what surprised me is The Artist's gloomy periods of human struggle. The Artist also covers the subject of Hollywood Actors being discarded when their time is up. Studio executives treat actors like throwaway cards in their poker games. It's tragic when a person builds their entire life with one light guiding their every decision, then, without warning being dismissed forever. The smart choice The Artist makes is having a man experience this situation because it's cliché to think women only get this discrimination. It's the harsh fact of the entertainment business.Yes, it does cover some deep thoughts about Hollywood, but the quality that distinguishes The Artist is the style in which the tells us the story to us. Back in the days when silent pictures were all the film world had, ""talkies"" were the films everyone was fascinated by. The Artist proves the irony of today's society being drawn to the silent picture approach. Silent characters allows the film score to become the life of the movie. The way we react depends on the score and what it tells us. The score works toward the making the images accessible to the audience, and the visuals are just as pleasing as the musical composition. The imagination and creativity used to plan out and project the images of this time are glowing left to right, in the stunning black and white photography.The Artist's second life necessity to breathing is laughing. I felt like I was laying on a cloud and whenever they laugh, it's like you're being tickled with a me with a feather. It's a pleasure to sit through The Artist, you'll having a great time. The nostalgia for the days of silent movies is amplified even more through Jean Dujardin rocking the look of the classical actors. You have such fun watching Dujardin in the role, that you may not notice the acting the man has behind his character. He creates an uncompromising charm for the protagonist, as well as dwelling on the character's misfortunes in later scenes. Berenice Bejo is lovely in her role, as well, but doesn't quite have the well-rounded character Dujardin was given.Make The Artist you're #ThrowbackThursday, because it glorifies and eventually tears down a significant time in the history of entertainment. Michel Hazanvicius directs his picture with all the gusto to make us enjoy the time we're spending with the characters. He doesn't smother the picture, instead just lets the picture live. The ending is perfectly executed, progressing the moving times in a cute and classy manner. As soon as I parted ways with The Artist, the more I reflected on the time I spent watching it, the more I found a deeper appreciation for it.Rating: 8.5/10Grade: A",,Anonymous,Romance

Crafted to Please the Masses -- Failed to Steal My Heart,"The Artist was not nearly as bad or ""boring"" as certain IMDb viewers have reported, with their paltry 1-star ratings. Having said that, this movie leaned too heavily on the easy tricks that convince an audience to swoon. Bound up in its reliance on romanticism, the core plot was traditional and safe. And the adorable mutt (Uggie) who always seems to save the day (with his cuteness) helped to boost the likability factor.What can I say? It's the feel good movie of the year. But this does not a great film make. The Academy members recently elevated it to their top Oscar choice. Their vote was unsurprising, but disappointing.Regarding the charming actor Dujardin, whose eyebrows do little dances all their own, I would like to see more of him--in another context. The natural grace and talent of Bejo were lovely, but she and Dujardin did more than their fair share of hamming it up for the camera.Whenever actors try too hard to please the audience, a part of me shrivels up inside. But the actors cannot bear total responsibility for this. It's the producers and the director who issued this shallow interpretation. At times, it felt like some vaudevillian beast had taken over the stage, and the vibe was trying too ""vamn"" hard.Don't get me wrong. The film was pleasant enough. I suppose I'm glad it inspired many people. But, I was not so easily convinced. After witnessing the likes of Master Chaplin, I'm afraid that many others will pale in comparison.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The magical sound of a silent,"Starting off with visual quotes from ancient films like ""Metropolis"" and ""Frankenstein"" Michel Hazanavicius' ""The Artist"" shouts its message right in your face: ""I won't talk!"" In intertitles, that is. Yep, the protagonist means it. And he'll also stay in black and white. And in 1.33:1 aspect ratio. There you have it. Next stop: The silent era! And once we've arrived all of a sudden the period is alive and kicking like Frankenstein's monster, except that it will be sending jolts of joy through your body. What we have here is a magnificently unique idea, charming direction, a grandiose soundtrack, perfect costume design and Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo as the leads who must have time traveled to 2011 to be able to portray the 1930s and onwards so convincingly, as even without words their faces and gestures speak volumes.Cinema has gone through a lot in the past decades that gradually sucked art out of the medium: The breakthrough of the blockbuster in the seventies and the building of multiplexes in order to expand reaching and streamlining audiences, the growth of sensationalism for profit's sake, the inflationary distortions of reality spurred by ever present effects and increasing noise, the disappearance of the story in convoluted plots in order to be able to harbor some final surprises... Well, after all that a breath of fresh air is a blessing to anyone with a sincere love for cinema. ""The Artist"" goes against the flow and restores some of the art without appearing artificial. Time for some pure back to the roots entertainment of the grand scale and with its simple yet poignant story the film doesn't strive to be anything but. While back in the days black and white was dictated by the medium's limitations, it also signified a filter, a style, which now again - brought back via a postmodern lens - helps to see things differently than we are used to in real life. Music, not words, floats through the air and the picture prefers to conclude with a tap dance rather than a twist for a twist's sake. In all that ""The Artist"" serves as a reminder, a reminder of what we gain by taking a step back, by opening our eyes and ears to experience the beauty and the magic that reverberates in the sound of a perfect silent.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's All About the Image,"I went into this film with high expectations and came out disappointed. I attended an afternoon matinée expecting to have the cinema pretty much to myself but the place was full. The audience were fairly mature so I suspect there was a special admission price. On the face of it they might have been pre-disposed to like a film that referenced older productions. There was some very low key laughter at the antics of the dog but otherwise little reaction from the audience which I took to be a reflection of a general lack of engagement.I didn't mind that the story was corny and I really really liked the music, especially when they let it rip in the dramatic sequences. But I was very disappointed with the cinematography and that's what killed it for me. The best (original) black and white films, sound or silent, have a numinous quality about them which draws you in and can make you gasp at its sheer beauty (for instance Sunset Boulevard, which the Artist borrows from, Rebecca or Lean's Oliver Twist). As someone who likes to SHOUT rather more than I do has pointed out, the film-makers seem to have achieved a rather muddy image only getting close to a good high contrast black and white look in the last few minutes!The Artist is all about the image in more ways than one. The lack of dialogue didn't bother me but I expected the black and white to be rendered much more artfully. I suspect it's also about image in the praise it has received – the critics liked it and it and as praise is heaped upon it, it becomes more difficult to dissent.The Artist isn't a bad film. It's a great idea, let down by the photography which just isn't good enough. It deserves an audience and there is a lot of pleasure to be had in watching it but it just isn't anywhere near as good as most of the critics and reviews on IMDb suggest.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

We are completely aware that that the have "" made"" a silent movie. they couldn't convince us to believe it was a silent movie. All the efforts of the actors seems unoriginal.

The Artist Deserves the Praise! 10/10 from me!!,"I missed French comedy/drama The Artist (winner of the Oscar for best picture in 2011) when it came out, but I'm sure glad I saw it now. The film by Michel Hazanaviciu stars his wife, the bright eyed, expressive Bérénice Bejo as breakout ingenue talkie star Peppy Miller and the captivating, wide grinned Jean Dujardin as 1920s silent film idol George Valentin. Valentin's career has reached it's zenith and is on the decent as Miller's celebrity power is rising thanks to a cute meet, sage advice from George, and the advent of talkies. This beautiful black and white film is brilliant and vivid; each shot a work of art. It's a love story, an ode to film, with an adorable dog as a hero. Ludovic Bource's bouncy, dramatic score is a major player in this piece. The joyful creative production swept me away.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Modern audiences could learn a thing or two,"Most people do not watch silent films. In fact, most people do not watch black and white films. Judging by the box office lately it seems people are even giving up on theatrical 2D. So I know I have my work cut out for me when I say you must go see The Artist as soon as possible. It is silent, black and white, 2D and not even in widescreen. And it is going to be crowned the Best Picture of the year by the Academy Awards; if it doesn't I will have serious reservations about defending the Oscars' integrity.It is the story of George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), a silent film star who is pushed aside at the start of the sound era; the classic rouge hero is quickly forgotten as new star Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) takes centre stage working for Al Zimmer (John Goodman) and the Kinograph Studios.All of the performances, with Dujardin and Bejo at the centre, make this an extremely relatable film. Even modern audiences expecting to be frustrated by the lack of dialogue will be surprised by the expressive storytelling power that this film delivers. An equal partner to the actors is the film's score by Ludovic Bource, and director Michel Hazanavicius uses the music or removes the music with elegant ease.Many will claim it is for filmmakers and cinephiles only, but that is not true. Filmmakers and cinephiles are just at the head of the pack because they already watch silent films and understand that they should not be treated differently. A moment of silence will bring a hush to the audience, as it should, but that is no different than any other modern film. When a joke is funny, you can laugh. When a shock surprises you, you can gasp. A great film is a great film, and this uses every trick developed in a century of filmmaking to tell the most beautifully realized love letter to cinema I have ever seen. Only Hugo and Cinema Paradiso have come this close to recreating the exhilaration I remember from seeing my first movies.This silent, black and white, full-frame movie is a delight. I will be going back to see it again. I will buy it on blu-ray. I will make everyone I know watch it because, believe me, it is breathtaking.http://charlieposts.blogspot.ca/2012/01/the-artist.html",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

What used to be the norm back in the 1920's is now almost a groundbreaking experience. Stripping a film of its computer effects, lavish sets and even the dialogs, ""The Artist"" brings back a cinematic experience that is forgotten to the point that is almost foreign.The music is captivating throughout. The story is well presented, with much emotional depth even without the use of dialogs.

"Yeah, it received Academy acclaim!","In Hollywood's silent movie era of the 1920s, a movie star realizes that pictures where the actors can talk will destroy his career. Then he meets a dancer and the plot thickens!Writer and director: Michel Hazanavicius creates an absolutely entertaining, and early era romantic atmosphere with The Artist. The movie's lead actor, Jean Dujardin, is not only sympathetic to watch (no easy task without the benefit of a speaking role), but also gives a very fine performance. I loved the music in this movie. I'm not sure if I will have the same experience, but the music kind of makes me want to see other silent movies that actually came from that era!Prior to the Academy awards, I had seen about three interviews with Harvey Weinstein. It seems that, if not for his actions, The Artist would never have been so widely released and would never have made it to the awards show.

Very Okay,"Well, this movie was... okay. Not great, not terrible. It's an interesting idea to try making a silent film (in fact, I thought the places where the film did use sound effects were rather silly), but I think they should have tried to make a more substantial movie instead of relying on the style as a gimmick. The plot was rather thin for the most part and parts of it seemed a bit overwrought. I had no particular problems with the acting, at least not with the lead parts, but there wasn't a whole lot of interest to the characters because their roles were so one-dimensional. I'd be interested to see what could be done with silent films if the filmmakers weren't trapped in the idea of making some kind of ""tribute"" instead of adding something of their own to the work.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"exceptional, extraordinary, amazing, astonishing, astounding, sensational, Phenomenal","The words in the title of this review are just some of the ones that you might find yourself using after watching this film.I cannot even begin to describe how oddly simple and oddly amazing this film is. I was excited to go and see it 1. because it was nominated for so many Oscars and 2. that it was playing in 2 theaters in the City of Toronto right now. I can't believe how lucky I was to be able to see this at the Cineplex Varsity Cinema. I won't go into too much detail about the theatre but let's just say that the auditoriums themselves are very..intimate. There's maybe 100 seats in the theatre! Very tiny auditoriums. This is all relevant to the review though because, even though I was excited to go and see The Artist, walking into the auditorium was a bit of a let down.This feeling was short lived though. As soon as the lights went down and the movie began I instantly realized that this type of auditorium was probably the best way to watch this film in. Just everything about it. The movie really gives off that old school silent film vibe (obviously) and being in a very intimate setting made me forget about 2012 and made me pretend to be in the early 1900's.And that is another thing. This film forces you to insert-your-emotion-here many times. It knows exactly what it wants from the audience. This is obviously due to the fact that it is a silent film but the point I am trying to make is that it sucks you into it's story and everything with immense grace. I and many around me when I looked the odd time had a smile on our faces for nearly the entire film. You don't quite get this pleasure as much anymore in this modern day so I was pleasantly surprised and knew from the start that I would likely be smiling like a fool for the whole film!I walked into the theatre with high hopes and expectations on this cold Tuesday in Toronto and I left delighted.Simply blown-away by this masterpiece.If you have a chance to go and see this film before the Oscars I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND DOING SO. But be warned: you are going to leave feeling invigorated with amazement!10/10, 5/5, however you want to rate it: this film is near perfection.Cheers!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A sincere tribute to the silent movie,"""The artist"" will not be remembered for the originality of its storyline. The story of a filmstar whose career is ruined by the rise of sound films has already been told in ""Sunset boulevard"" (1950, Billy Wilder). The story of the upcoming and waning star has already been told in ""All about Eve"" (1950, Joseph Mankiewicz). In fact this story is told in ""All about Eve"" in a much more lively way and with much sharper dialogue than it is in ""The artist"". In ""All about Eve"" there is envy between the two stars, in ""The artist"" there is ""only"" romance. Finally, combining the two storylines into one story already happened in ""Singin in the rain"" (1952, Stanley Donen).It is however not the storyline that makes ""The artist"" memorable, it is the way it pays tribute to the silent film. It does so in a very thorough way, using elements such as intertitles and an (old fashioned) aspect ratio of 4:3.To fully understand this tribute one has to realise that in the early days recording sound was a complex proces, putting severe limitations on the acting and camera movements, thereby making the pictures much more static than they had been without sound. There were not only people who didn't manage to make the transition to sound (for example because they had an ugly voice), but also people who didn't want to make this transition (most prominent among them, Charlie Chaplin).""The artist"" was a huge success. So huge that only a year later another tribute to the silent cinema was released (""Blancanieves"", 2012, Pablo Berger). For the real film buff the film contains a movie quote to ""7th heaven"" (1927, Frank Borzage) when Peppy Miller (the upcoming star played by Bérénice Bejo) finds comfort in the suit in the dressing room of George Valentin (the waning star played by Jean Dujardin).",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Two years later, because of a change of the screen from silent to talkie, the popularity of George falls but Peppy becomes a top actressWhat it is important that though this movie was made in 2011, it catches the atmosphere of the movies in 1920s. The pictures in this movie is in black and white and the makeup of characters are the very same as the 20s. The discovery of story is a little simple, but the performance of actors and stage direction are great. Motions and expressions of Peppy are very attractive and appearances of George after lose his position are so pathetic. But, more than them, the best player of this movie is the Dog of George!",,Anonymous,Romance
A charming allegory of silent films,"I am amongst the club that prefers ""anthying but Hollywood blockbuster"" films that refuse to take themselves seriously, whose story lines are so simple that many would consider them insulting..... and yet ""The Artist"" is much of this when you get down to it. It IS a Hollywood story, but what is fascinating is the context of presenting silent film making through silent film production. The music tells us what we haven't already filled in for plot, extra dialog not framed for us, as well as character motivation. This is fantastic direction of artists, but an homage, not a new art form in itself. Our stars are very accommodating and overtly charming, but not amongst the numerous earth shattering performances that we're accustomed to seeing in Oscar winning experiences. Simply put, that would be out of context of the film, as would a true serious nature (and dialog, for that matter). ""The Artist"" is a story about the perils of pride and progress. The experience is a recreation of a well emancipated nostalgia. At the end of the day, ""The Artist"" is a cute and charming diversion.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Best Motion Picture of the 21st Century could well be a silent film!,"This is the first silent film I've ever watched. The last of the non- talkies were in existence way back in the 1930s and for ""The Artist"" to revitalize this so-called 'dead' genre is simply a marvellous achievement. I wouldn't be overstating it when I say it is possibly the best work in film-making in the 21st century.For starters, the brisk pace and sheer entertainment factor of this movie catches you off guard as it is something not usually expected of a silent film. The acting by both Jean Dujardin (what a well-deserved Oscar win his was) and Berenice Bejo (would have loved to see her win too; on reflection though, the competition this year made that virtually impossible in either category) is tremendous. The complex task of expressing emotions without the aid of verbal activity is a feat accomplished with nonchalant ease by the duo. The original score (don't bother with the baseless controversies regarding an alleged rip-off from the score of ""Vertigo"") by Ludovic Bource is as good as it gets, and landed him and the film another well-deserved Oscar nod. And finally, the screen writing and direction by Michel Hazanavicius is first-class; overall a stupendous work of art befitting the title of the film.Don't be put off by the superficial 'lack of punch' generally associated with silent films. Watch this and your respect for the classic silver screen cinema might just increase manifold.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Note-perfect love letter to the silent era,"George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is one of the biggest stars in Hollywoodland. His latest picture looks set to be a commercial success after he charms the audience after a screening with his on and off- screen sidekick dog Jack. Afterwards, as the press surge around him, a screaming fan, Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) drops her purse and finds herself alongside George, who grabs her and smiles for the camera. She causes a sensation in the press and lands a small dancing role in George's next film. But with the emergence of the talkies looming, George finds his role as Hollywoodland's favourite star threatened, and Peppy slowly rises and becomes a star in her own right. Unable to find work as a talking film star, George slides into infamy, but finds his path repeatedly crossing with Peppy's.The emergence of the 'talkies' is one the biggest events in cinema history. Cinema giants found themselves pushed out of the business if they didn't have the right voice, and had to make way for a new set of stars. Very few actors survived the transformation, with the likes of Charlie Chaplin and Greta Garbo managing to scrape through. This has been depicted on screen before, most notably in two very different masterpieces - Billy Wilder's homage-filled noir Sunset Boulevard (1950), and Stanley Donen's iconic musical Singin' in the Rain (1952). While the latter depicted an ageing former silent star verging on madness, and the latter a production company making the difficult transition from silent movies to musicals, what The Artist has going for it is that it's shot and acted exactly like a silent movie, and does so with such dedication and love that it transports you back to the time where you feel as if you're witnessing this change first hand.It would be easy to make a mockery of silent movies. As many greats as the era produced, they mainly consist of over-the-top acting, unrealistic sets and overly romantic attitudes (I said mainly, I'm not referring to the works of Murnau, Lang and Dreyer, but mainly the work that came out of Hollywood). But they were simple, passionate and often theatrical, and the works of Chaplin, Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton are still some of the greatest comedies ever made. Director Michel Hazanavicius is clearly in love with them, and even shot the film in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio, which allows the actors to dominate the screen. It is also littered with sly winks to the era and to the likes of Mary Pickford, who was possibly the biggest actress of the era, and Douglas Fairbanks (a scene from his The Mark of Zorro (1920) is shown as a Valentin movie, with Valentin incorporated into the close-up shots).The casting is a stroke of genius. Dujardin has such a perfect cinematic face that it is as if he was made for silent cinema. He simply doesn't need to speak, he has the ability to generate an emotion with an eyebrow movement, and has possibly the greatest screen moustache for many a year. If the Academy fails to recognise his performance here, I'll eat my own face, and I hope he goes on to bigger and better things. Bejo is not nearly as impressive, but charms her way through the film and is perfectly believable in her role. She has real chemistry with Dujardin, and the scene in which she has a small role dancing with Valentin, who keeps fluffing his actions because he is enamoured by Peppy, is truly beautiful. It is one of the most genuine and achingly romantic scenes I've seen in the cinema.It is too early to call it a masterpiece, but it is truly a stunning film and the hype is well justified. But I did leave wondering if I had just witnessed the death of cinema. Are we so devoid of ideas that we have reverted back to where we started? Well, no, but it did make me think. Cinema has come full circle, and I am now concerned that there is nothing else left to explore. With the emergence of 3-D, old classics such as Star Wars (1977) and Jurassic Park (1993) are being re-released into cinemas. Do we now have to look back for inspiration, rather than forward into the unknown? Perhaps people have wondered this in the past, only to then witness cinematic landmarks that have pushed the medium forward. I'm most likely, and hopefully, wrong, but for now I'll enjoy The Artist for what it is - a love letter to a time in cinema often neglected by the masses - and a brilliant one at that.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Completely overrated!,"It all started last Christmas when I, like many others started hearing a lot of hoo-ha about this new film coming out called The Artist which was silent, black and white, and up for all sorts of prestigious awards. I decided to give it a chance even though I couldn't really imagine how it could possibly be as good as all that, of course unless they brought something new and exciting to the silent picture, for why else would we have moved onto talkie films? To my utmost dismay, The Artist not only turned out to be ultimately disappointing, bringing nothing new to the table but also a member of that most dreaded genre- the tribute film. In other words, the type of film that says 'we've run out of ideas so let's just rehash old ideas and call it homage'. The tribute film is even worse than the remake and just one step up from clip shows in terms of unoriginality; and we all know how much we hate clip shows! I can just about understand tribute bands, they make sense. For instance, you want the Beatles live for your party, so you book a Beatles tribute band- not as good as the real thing but better than a CD.

Lives up to the Hype,"What with so many films up for awards being a big let down i was hoping The Artist was a film that at least , lived up to it's hype. Thankfully it did.George Valentin is a famous silent movies start who is loved by himself nearly as much as his fans. He meets , by chance , up and coming actress Peppy Miller and he falls in love. The problem is that Peppy is making it big in Talkies and George finds that silent movies are dying along with his career.I never thought i would like a silent movie as much as i liked this one. This is a very cleverly made film that keeps the audience spellbound by some fantastic backing music and three brilliant performances from Jean Dujardin , Berenice Bejo and a delightful little Jack Russel.I love the first 15 miniues of this film. Jean Dujardin is in his element both in the film and with his acting. The smile and swagger of George is superb and you cant but help like the man. Berenice Bejo is just the same. A lovely smile and wonderful attitude and you can see why any man would fall for her.The film does dip a little in the middle and maybe could do with ten minutes being shaved off it but apart from that The Artist is everything that people are saying.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Interesting, mild fun but overrated","""The Artist"" unfortunately cannot be reviewed at this moment in time without being aware of the hype manufactured by the Weinstein brothers - the producers of good-but-not-great movies that muscle their way into all of the award races. Unfortunately, as is usually the case with the Weinstein movies, it falls short of expectations.On its own, ""The Artist"" is a fun experiment: let's shoot a silent black and white film, using many of the mechanisms of that film era, from cinematography to screenplay. In particular it imitates that romantic films of the time, as opposed to the more influential satires and fantasy/horror films. It goes as far as incorporating a variation on ""Lassie"". The actors are charming and there are some interesting metaphorical shots. It is clever at times, amusing and funny at turns, cheesy at others, mildly suspenseful towards the end, but consistent in its style, and it delivers on the romance. The few moments of sound provide such a contrast to the world of silent film (are we in a self-aware movie?) that they become the most memorable and admirable parts of the film.However, it is so light that it would make Clara Bowen's ""It"" seem as heavy as ""Intolerance"". It is intentionally clichéd, but does not do anything with its references; we are expected to accept them as if we were a 1928 audience. We must accept the on screen relationships as such, and the characters do not escape beyond the 2-dimensional. There is little advantage taken of modern technology to develop more elaborate scenes.""The Artist"" succeeds as a moderately fun recreation of 1920s and early 1930s cinema. However, the experiment perhaps would have been more interesting had the silent treatment been given to a modern story or to a deeper screenplay.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Amazing,"Amazing - There's really no reason to go beyond that, but IMDb asks for a minimum of 10 lines, so I'll fill the rest in with gushing hyperbole.Jean Dujardin is just fantastic as a cross between Gene Kelly and Douglas Fairbanks Sr. The dog? What can you say about that dog? Or those dogs (there were three of them)? They are the canine equivalent of Jackie Coogan. Bejo, Goodman, Cromwell and Miller were so expressive. I haven't stopped smiling since I saw it - and that's what films were supposed to do in the silent era. OK, that's about 10 lines. So let's get back to basics - the film is an amazing display of filmmaking and a total joy.How cool will it be to have a silent b&w film win the Oscar for Best Pic?",,Anonymous,Romance
"In The Music, Lies The Gold. ♦ 71%","The story of The Artist has been captured on reel since time immemorial. And I cannot fail to mention how clichéd it look when it became the most awarded French cinema. That being said, the music soundtrack is one bomb- shell kind of a factor which solely wins the situation.Throughout the 100 minutes of melodrama about how a silent film actor goes down the line, the music stays to entertain. The highs & the lows of the orchestra and the crescendos induce sheer hearing pleasure to the rather hackneyed plot. And about the performances, Jean Dujardin got what he deserved. Such flawless acting with pinch of dance moves is a sure charm. The actress did very well, too. John Goodman supports well.As a whole, it gives a cool vintage projection for people who are more into the trend-driven yesteryear movies. Recommended!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Nutshell Review: The Artist,"Who would have thought that the trio of writer-director Michel Hazanavicius, his wife actress Berenice Bejo and actor Jean Dujardin, all probably better known for their comical spoof of the spy genre with the OSS 117 movies, could have pull out all the stops and made such an affecting romantic film that epitomizes all things great about an era of cinema long gone, providing that pitch perfect nostalgic feel and homage to the black and white greats of the old days where films meant dressing up, the acting almost always exaggerated, the reading of inter-titles, with a live orchestra at the front of the hall playing the soundtrack and providing the emotional cues of the film. The Artist has been picking up accolades and gaining traction in the cinemas toward the various award seasons, and it certainly deserves all the hype and kudos that are coming its way.Hazanavicius' story deals with the classic tale of rags to riches, and riches to rags, set against the backdrop of the old Hollywood and star system, where recognized stars can command just about the world's attention, and a junior artists can aspire to be at the top of the fame game one day if opportunities, chance and fate all smile their way. It's two stories joint at the hip, one focused on the story of famous mega film star George Valentin (Dujardin), ubiquitous hero of the silent film era, now faced with the possibility of extinction given his studio's growing interest toward the talkies, and his adamant belief that talking pictures is nothing but a passing fad, snug at his position at the top of his career. But this pride and arrogance bear no prisoners when audience attitude and technology change, and George soon fades into oblivion more quickly than his rise and stay to fleeting fame.The other, parallel story of course deals with actress Peppy Miller (Bejo), who literally bumps into Valentin during the premiere of his latest movie, and progressed from obscurity to a big break given by Valentin himself, who had also offered her a beauty tip that changed her career fortunes for the better, or rather assisted in her stratospheric boost in film fortune. She moves from cameos to support roles and finally marquee large productions, with a flamboyant personality to boot that helped her heaps, becoming the darling of Tinseltown and enjoying an equivalent status and perks associated that George himself had once enjoyed.Not everyone survived the transition from silent films to talkies, and The Artist doesn't sugar coat it all. With the transition, new stars get born while older ones faded away, especially when their real voices failed to match up to what audiences had imagined during their heydays, and rejection at the big screen was easy given a new lineup of stars all primed to take advantage of the new medium. While watching The Artist it brought back to mind some memories of the good old days where I took on a course module just so to watch Pulp Fiction, but got enthralled by the fascinating silent, black and white classic films such as King Vidor's The Crowd, and The Son of the Sheik starring Rudolph Valentino, amongst other greats.Technically Hazanavicius' film can't get any better than this, and his meticulous research during pre-production shows in the delicate touches put in the film, from costumes and dressing, to set and art direction, right down to the technical details of framing, camera, and transitional scene techniques used to tell the silent film story right. His story here is one that is filled with strong irony throughout, crafting an incredibly moving and humbling tale of being grateful to those responsible in any way for one's success in any form. For a modern filmmaker, Hazanavicius did everything right in recreating the spirit of silent films, complete with powerful, all-encompassing music by Ludovic Bource to set the tone, emotions and mood right from beginning until the final scene.Even the acting by the leads were all spot on for the era, who gotten it all right in both their larger gestures and subtleties. Jean Dujardin made his George Valentin believable as the famous movie star, and will have you feel for his character as he bet big on his own abilities and lost to the winds of change, and had to endure further whammies to his life in the form of the Great Depression. He possesses that flair and airs of the star from yesteryear, and is an absolute delight to watch on screen, more than justifying his Cannes Film Festival award for Best Actor. Berenice Bejo too owned her role, sharing fantastic chemistry opposite Dujardin as the woman is forever indebted to her idol for everything good coming her way, and is trying her earnest best to reciprocate as best as she can during times of dire straits. The support cast of James Cromwell, John Goodman and Penelope Ann Miller were great, but none stood out other than Uggie the Jack Russell Terrier who single handedly stole the limelight each time it's on screen!Ask anyone these days to watch a black and white, silent film and you'll probably be scoffed at, but to anyone who has not watched The Artist, it is truly their loss. I only hope that this will spur many of us who have been bedazzled by large scale special effects in almost every modern film, to take a look back into the rich and early days of film to identify the few gems yet to be experienced, and take that bold step to appreciate them once more. The ending couldn't be more perfect as it heralded yet another era of films, that hammers it all home again that The Artist had hit all its intended marks set forth, especially putting that belief in cinema back again. Highly recommended and a definite entry into any year end lists this year. Do NOT miss this masterpiece!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unique but not best movie,"This movie is an interesting art piece with a nice look at old Hollywood. The silent aspect makes one watch carefully the emotions and facial expressions. The story is simple and pleasantly predictable about one star on the rise and one on the decline at the era when silent films gave way to talkies.The plot of the first half is a bit frustratingly thin but the second half the story picks up. The infamous use of music from Hitchcock's Vertigo is good - actually makes me want to see Vertigo again.Dujardin as Valentin the screen idol of the silent screen looks the part. Berenice has a harder role acting wise. Both are good and dance well. Nice use of John Goodman and Penelope Anne Miller.Compared to the other good movies that came out this year eg War Horse, Midnight in Paris etc, the Artist isn't quite as good. It's only the timing of the release and the continental background that have people praising it beyond it's worth. I don't think it is best picture.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A thoroughly engaging and unique (these days) cinematic experience.,"It's been a long wait for this much heralded movie, the notices from Cannes were enthusiastic to say the least and early user reviews on IMDb have anointed it with must see status.So, I went along today with an open mind and a hope that it justified its early 8.5 rating on our esteemed website. I have to say that it doesn't; but there is much to love in this delightful movie novelty.First off, this is a novelty. Once you've enjoyed its fare you are left wondering ""what exactly was the point of making that"" because it has no real ""agenda"". I saw no political, religious or cultural allegory. What I saw was a lovingly crafted, beautifully photographic, gorgeously scored, excellently acted, art-house homage.It's kind of a big idea but without an idea, instead it's a film built around executional excellence and in that respect is often near to perfection with some lovely retro cinematographic and illusions.There's a particularly nice touch when Peppy Miller's movie opens in a cinema called the Reine (an in joke and nod to the production company that made it, La Petite Reine I suspect).I didn't know the story before I saw it and I won't spoil it for you here because the story is fairly slight and not that big a deal, it's merely the skeleton for a series of set pieces and fun.It's held together principally by the delightful Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), an up and coming ""talkies "" star who worships the ground that fallen idol George Valentin (surely a nod to Valentino) played brilliantly by Jean Dujardin walks on. However many scenes are stolen by the delightful Jack Russell terrier who is Valentin's only constant soul mate throughout the movie.There are also two good cameos from American actors John Goodman, as the studio magnate, and James Cromwell, who you've seen literally hundreds of times without perhaps realising who he is, as Valentin's loyal manservant.It's shot in a, 1.37: 1 ratio that these days, is virtually unseen, but was the format of choice in the 20′s. This, for me added further authenticity, as do the beautiful credits, captions and monochrome photography.Sound is used cleverly throughout and the final scene had me grinning from ear to ear.I really liked this oddball movie. No it's not one of the greatest ever made and I doubt will do much at The Oscars outside of the technical categories but it's a great hour and a half and an unusual and worthwhile feelgood movie experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Vibrant even though colorless,"What could've derailed into a drab and dry spectacle, perfectly executes everything it tries to accomplish in a serious and fun way. The Artist is an amazing homage to the classic silent films from the twenties and thirties, respectively. They are some of the simplest films, but pack so much in their context it's easy to miss a few beats.The idea of silent cinema is sketchy in 2011, but thankfully, The Artist never tries to present itself as a tongue in cheek parody or a goofy tribute. It is serious in its presentation and wants nothing more than to show that captivating cinema still exists and can work work wonders if done properly. Maybe it's because I have shot two silent films in the last year and am sympathetic to all the effort it takes to actually create one.The silent films I shot were for a Television class I took last year. They are nothing special and are pretty cheaply made. I loosely based it off a situation that really happened to my friend and I, and added a nice KISS song and threw in a few plot twists. It wasn't in black and white, and the editing wasn't this tight. I am open to the idea of more now that I have been schooled watching The Artist.Being that Jean Dujardin is a gifted physical actor and his appearance mirrors a real-life actor from the silent era only adds to the many reasons why The Artist succeeds on so many levels. He plays George Valentin, a silent film actor who has starred in many films over the course of the twenties with his scene stealing Jack Russell Terrier. Sadly, it's now 1927 and the silent film studios are suffering because a new fad of films that include sound, called Talkies, are the big thing.One day when George is being swarmed by the paparazzi, a woman gets pushed into him by accident. Instead of acting infuriated, which I can see many celebrities being now, he embraces the abrupt entry of the woman and poses for several pictures with her. The woman is then discovered to be Peppy Miller, played by the engaging and utterly beautiful Bérénice Bejo. George is so wooed by Miller's attitude and beauty that he auditions her for a role in his new film. After that, Peppy becomes more and more famous through roles of all different sizes in Talkies.Keep in mind, all this action, excitement, and suspense is captured through black and white film, many musical numbers, and a lens not in the typical widescreen format. Though the film is so engaging, I did not forget its silent nature but I do believe it is possible to forget the film lacks in dialog. Some very impressed moviegoers will be lost in the film's story and might be in for a rude awakening before the credits roll.The Artist is an enriching and delightful movie experience. Some will grow tired of the aspect but I can see many embracing it and craving more. The film has enough well-delivered action to not be called ""one note,"" and enough clever plot points to prevent the word ""monotony"" from coming in. It's subtle in its presence but massively entertaining in its delivery.Starring: Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Bejo, and John Goodman. Directed by: Michel Hazanavicius.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The premier piece of art of 2011!,"No one can silence me on expressing my jubilant emotion on the silent masterpiece modern movie ""The Artist"". It is pure artistry. So therefore, I have to voice that to me it is the best movie of 2011; and I am not the only who has been vociferous with that sentiment. ""The Artist"" stars a brilliant Jean Dujardin as silent movie star George Valentin. During the silent movie era of Hollywood, everyday was Valentine's Day for Valentin as he was admired & loved as that era's supreme movie star. Valentin was confident, charismatic, determined, and pretty much a pure silent showman. However, it was all the future talk that ended up ruining Valentin's career. When the silent movie days of Hollywood dwindled, and the talkies became the talk of Tinseltown, Valentin became a movie face of the past. After Valentin gets booted by the movie studio he was under contract with for many years, he decides to keep the silence alive by developing a silent film which he produces, directs, and stars in. When that experiment bombed, all kept spiraling downwards for poor Silent George; he loses his house, his wife, his fame, and even to a certain extent his legacy. At the same time- Peppy Miller, an aspiring actress which George had given her first break by briefly appearing in one of his last silent movies, becomes a megastar in the new Hollywood talkies. I guess one can say that her Peppy Talk was the talk of Hollywood. George and Peppy's careers go through opposite pathways, even though Peppy continues to admire George even throughout all his trials & tribulations. The epitome of man's best friend has to be George's cerebral dog who is not only George's pooch confidant but eventually his savior. Director Michel Hazanivicius' orchestration of ""The Artist' is one for the ages and for all ages. He is able to formulate a wondrous silent movie in modern times and to make it as magnetic and enticing as it is was simply movie magic. It is the best direction of the year and it will be very hazardous if Hazanivicius does not garner a Best Director Oscar. Moreover, the vicious Hazanivicius also pulls of another cinematic impossible- scribing a spectacular and lively screenplay to a modern silent film; translation= Another Oscar. There is a lot to love about Dujardin's expressive starring performance as Valentin. Dujardin is definitely due a Best Actor Oscar nomination. Berenice Bejo was very nice with her stellar work as Peppy Miller, there is no doubt that Bejo won't be to lejo of the Kodak Theatre come Oscar time; she is a shoe-in for a Best Supporting Actress nomination. ""The Artist"" also got more support from the great ""silent but medley"" performances of John Goodman as the studio mogul, James Cromwell as George's chauffeur, and Penelope Ann Miller as Mrs. Valentin. Another guiding force in ""The Artist"" was the grand musical score of the flick orchestrated by Ludovic Bource. The Bource Musical Identity was of Bource Supremacy and the sound of this music should rejoice in the Oscar mountaintops with an Academy Award for Best Movie Score. Many have called ""The Artist"" a love letter to ""old school"" Hollywood. And yes I do concur with that analysis, but the new school of Hollywood should reward ""The Artist"" as the movie valedictorian of the year 2011. So go ahead and. enjoy the silence! ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Dujardin is Extraordinary in a Silent Screen Tribute Made from the Heart,"To state that French filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius appreciates the artistry and emotional appeal of classic silent cinema would be a severe understatement. He devours it like only a true cineaste would and brings a unique deftness to such a long-forgotten medium that he singlehandedly brings it back to life if only for this one instance. Mostly silent with title cards and shot entirely black-and-white, this stylish 2011 dramedy starts in 1927 Hollywood as pre-Depression audiences were still enraptured by the heart-palpitating derring-do of matinée idols like Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. and John Gilbert on the silver screen. As Norma Desmond said in ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""We didn't need dialogue. We had faces then."" And indeed Hazanavicius has found the appropriate doppelganger in his constant star Jean Dujardin portraying an amalgam of Fairbanks, Gilbert and Rudolph Valentino with a touch of Charlie Chaplin (notable in his comic scenes with the dog) and a little Gene Kelly-style hoofing thrown in for good measure.Dujardin plays George Valentin, one of the silent screen's leading lights whose charming braggadocio is more than offset by his popularity. At the premiere of his latest romantic espionage caper, he has a ""meet-cute"" run-in with the fittingly named Peppy Miller, a pretty extra fumbling for her autograph book on the red carpet. He is immediately impressed with her beauty as well as her moxie, and in another ""meet-cute"" run-in, by her terpsichorean talent as well. Once their mutual attraction is established, the plot follows a standard ""A Star Is Born"" storyline by showing his career in decline while hers is on a fast rise with the advent of talkies. There is a buoyant spirit that infuses the story and sideswipes the more tragic elements one would expect from previous versions of this tale. That's how Hazanavicius manages to engage the viewer even though the film slows considerably during the middle section despite his meticulous efforts. There are also recognizable tributes to silent classics like F.W. Murnau's ""Sunrise"" and King Vidor's ""The Crowd"" and even a wink to the classic breakfast montage in Orson Welles' ""Citizen Kane"" to illustrate how Valentin and his icy wife drift apart.Some of Valentin's most vulnerable moments are beautifully rendered like the puddle of liquor on the glass table, his window reflection against the tuxedoed torso of a mannequin, and a sure-to-be-classic nightmare scene where he hears every sound except his own voice. The movie jumps back to life with a surprisingly exhilarating ending that subtly explains the key dramatic point of the story. Dujardin immerses himself completely into the essence of his embattled, vainglorious character without a trace of irony. It's a genuinely exquisite performance that could have easily disintegrated into self-parody in less assured hands. What's more, the man can really dance. Bérénice Bejo (who also happens to be the director's wife) is lovely and vivacious as Peppy, although there are moments when she comes across as a mite too contemporary to be truly convincing as a period character. Take, for example, the fist pump she shows when she wins her first audition. At the same time, when she puts an arm through the sleeve of a jacket on a hanger and caresses herself with a hand she imagines to be his, she handles this piece of pantomime with true aplomb.The two French stars are surrounded by familiar American faces like John Goodman as a Jack Warner-like, cigar-chomping producer; James Cromwell as Valentin's dutiful chauffeur; Penelope Ann Miller as Valentin's shingle-haired, ignored wife Doris; and Missi Pyle as a Lina Lamont-style starlet, appropriate since this film covers the same fertile ground as ""Singin' in the Rain"". By the way, that's Uggie who plays the playful, clever Jack Russell terrier, an obvious paean to Asta from ""The Thin Man"" series. Kudos also need to be given to Guillaume Schiffman's accurately evocative cinematography (unlike other pastiches, the film looks like it was made in 1927), Laurence Bennett's production design (including an inventive use of the vintage Bradbury Building in downtown LA), and Ludovic Bource's swooning music score, which includes a snatch of Bernard Hermann's ""Vertigo"" score over a climactic scene. Even with all the praise heaped on this film from the critics, it's not a film for everyone's tastes. Silent cinema, by its very nature, beckons a certain patience from the audience that some will find tedious, and even at a running time of 100 minutes, the movie still feels a bit long. At the same time, for those who can appreciate it as an art form, Hazanavicius has really delivered quite a treat.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Artist wins Best Foreign Film at 2011 Stella Artois St. Louis International Film Festival,"If you've heard anything about this movie, which won a Palme D'Or at this year's Cannes film festival for Best Actor, it's probably the fact that it's silent. As in no dialogue. As in WTF? This may explain why its screening on a Sunday morning in Cannes failed to fill the house. Apart from Mel Brooks' gimmicky ""Silent Movie"" in 1976 , isn't there a good reason we haven't had a silent feature film in almost 100 years? We don't generally revert back to obsolete technology; no one longs for the good old days of 8 track tapes, right?To be honest, I wasn't all that excited about going to see a silent movie. Had it not been for the facts that it starred Jean Dujardin, was the opening night film for the festival, and being a French movie, I would not have rushed to see it. It's a good thing there were greater forces at work because this movie is wonderful! And I urge you to see it opening weekend, in a large, full theater. This movie is best seen collectively; it's the closest we may ever come to experiencing what it may have been like to see a movie when movies were new.Jean Dujardin plays silent film star George Valentin (the name perhaps a wink to silent screen star Rudolph Valentino?). Dujardin's theatrical experience gives him the chops to carry this film without uttering more than one word. He brings the same David Niven-like sophistication he brought to the OSS films he also did with director Michel Hazanavicius without the boorish-oaf element. (I loved those movies and highly recommend them: ""OSS: Cairo, Nest of Spies,"" 2007 and ""OSS: Lost in Rio,"" 2009.)Unfortunately, his performance is weakened because it is difficult to read his lips; this contrast becomes apparent when John Goodman appears on screen. We don't need to wait to read the dialogue card to know what his character is saying. Bérénice Bejo, (another English-is-not-their- first-language actor) who plays Valentin's protégée, Peppy Miller, has the same liability to a lesser degree. However, this issue will not, should not be cause for interference. (I just wanted to give you a heads-up.)I'm not going to go into much detail about the plot; the preview I've linked to hints that it concerns a silent screen star's issue with the transition to ""talkies."" Let me just encourage you to take note of one of the most beautiful shots I've seen in a movie all year: George is standing on a stair landing at the Kinograph studios; the frame encompasses three stories, he is the only still being in a hive of activity. In a film in which the story is told by everything but words, it is a sublime moment.1920s Hollywood is recreated with ""Mad Men""-like attention to detail minus the wink to the present day. It's great to see a little less of John Goodman so we can enjoy his performance rather than worry about his health. Other than my previous criticism, there is not a false note, nor wasted moment in this entire movie.Finally, this movie begs for the creation of a new category at the Academy Awards: Best Performance by a non-CGI-created animal: Uggie the dog would be a shoo-in.",,Anonymous,Romance
Maybe the best silent movie ever made,"I watched this movie because it was only about one and a half hours long so it fit perfect in my evening. I expected not much of a silent black and white movie and had my doubts about the 5 Oscars.Hell, I was wrong!This movie achieves that I am interested in the story and the characters without the need of tone and dialogue. The music is great and the actors perfermance is insane.And then there is the love for an old but not forgotten genre: The silent movies.I am personally not a fan of these movies but I have great respect and watched many classics from Buster Keaton to Charlie Chaplin. This movie portrays the transicion from those silent movies to movies with tone and does a really good job. It's getting emotional, it's never getting boring and you will never forget it!Just watch it!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A less-than-fitting tribute to a great age of innovation and artistry.,"A unfitting tribute to the age of silent cinema and the rise of the ""talkies"". The Artist is a surprisingly funny and dynamic film considering its limitations, although it is surprisingly thematically one-dimensional considering it is ultimately a meta-commentary on the film industry. And, of course, it isn't nearly as good as the real masterpieces of silent film.It's score is obviously designed to be cliché and dated, but I would have liked it to be less so.The cinematography doesn't feel as powerful and beautiful as some of the great innovators of cinema, like Joan of Arc, Sunrise, Nosferatu, or Man with a Movie Camera.Overall, The Artist is an okay if stilted tribute to a bygone age - but don't expect the greatness of the real thing; in the end it is basically like an good Elvis Tribute act.

"This silent movie is a twist to the technology heavy era, but how well they executed this defines the success it has achieved. This movie, is one that should not be missed","I was blown away. I can't recall the last time I enjoyed this much watching a movie with so much entertainment, originality, freshness and skill. One can safely say now that this little experiment has paid off, but to push forward such an idea and to execute it to the way it had turned out requires a lot of conviction.George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a silent movie superstar who is on top of the Hollywood tree with his huge fan following and never ending box-office success. His world comes tumbling down with the dawn of the talkies which he doesn't take too seriously. His find Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) is a new star overnight and the stock market crash doesn't help his cause either. While his life descends into depression and loss, his pride blinds the love shown by Peppy Miller who is now the hottest property in Hollywood. Can he come out of his shell? Can Peppy Miller express her love? Can they have a future together? Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo are two extremely charismatic and talented actors who can switch gears so effortlessly from little subtle expressions to over-the-top requirements of the era. The attention to detail starting from sets to the type of film used to get the right look is done with precision. The same story has been told in many different backdrops before, but the format presented here is quite fresh. Another challenging aspect that is overcome with excellence is the screenplay, as the writers mare not used to tell a story in this format. Best moments to look out for:1. Introduction of Peppy Miller and when she romances George Valentin's suit.2. George Valentin's realization of Sound as the future in his dream.3. The way Peppy Miller blackmails the producer.4. Expression of Peppy Miller when she races to George Valentin's house before climax.4. Climax duet dance.This silent movie is a twist to the technology heavy era, but how well they executed this defines the success it has achieved.

A Contrarian Review,"As everyone has said, this film is a beautiful tribute to the Silent Era of movie-making, although I think it had precious little to do with the production aspect. But, very well done, I concede.The problem I had was the plot--and the spectacle of seeing a mature actor despondent because he is no longer marketable, and, later, joyous because his career has been revitalized and the audience is cheering again.When in reality, the character has merely kicked the can down the road a bit. How long will his revitalization last? Another year or two? When he becomes unmarketable, as all actors do sooner of later, will he become suicidal yet again?I would have preferred him transitioning to a career independent of the whims of the public. Instead he remains its slave. His joyous return to stardom is, in that sense, pathetic. I felt even more sorry for him at the end.Another thing that bugged me was his casual treatment of his dog: walking across the busy street with the dog unleashed, letting the dog trot after him in very crowded sidewalks, never appearing to feed it or to give it water, oblivious to its safety when he sets a fire.... It just bothered me.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A sad insult on the era of Silent Films,"It should be titled ""The Emperor's New Film"". Contrary to what some of you may believe, the actors that lived in the time of the silent films actually did speak, could hear sounds, and the world was actually in color. For a movie to accurately portray their lives and how they were affected by the advent of speaking films it would have to represent their real lives, not the result of what their lives would have been without color or sound. To appreciate the films of the silent era, you watch those films. To create a farce such as this to feed the arrogant intellectuals that have so much power in the movie industry and the presentation of paid for awards is insulting to the people that truly appreciated the art of the silent era. What is next? Will we go to a theater to see a blank screen and a sound only version of a film representing the real lives of old time radio show personalities? This was just an insulting attempt to show that today we can make a better silent film than they did originally.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Almost a masterpiece,"We sit watching the adverts and the trailers for the latest awful Hollywood rubbish - the ghastly War Horse and the UK's over-hyped Iron Lady (great impressionist is Ms Streep but that's it). Then, the curtains pull in - that's unusual - we go to 4x3. We go from Glorious colour (on the very day Kodak go into liquidation - I really cannot believe this). And, we small group of film lovers in a club for film lovers - The wonderful Harbour Lights in Southampton - become silent. And, for the next hour and forty minutes we do not watch so much as live in a world of no- colour and no dialogue. Left therefor to concentrate on the visuals and occasional subtitles. We enjoyed the endless subtleties and not so subtleties, the actors expressions and movements. We titter and some sob. And, some of us wondered why we needed colour (let alone 3D) or the constant noise and distraction of dialogue. So, why almost a masterpiece? Well, it was a little self-indulgent and there were some over-laboured scenes (presumably to help of US cousins to understand it). The conversation in the bar afterwards was so so positive - a rare thing. Tonight, I watched Ken Russel's Elgar - also B/W though some BBC fool had stretched it to 16x9 - though it was well graded. It was 43 years old and it was beautiful if clumsily operated. It too reminded me of Kodak and the end of an era.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
With Pleasure,"Greetings again from the darkness. Remember the last silent film that received this much adoration, acclaim and publicity? Of course you don't. It was 1927 and Clara Bow starred in ""Wings"", the most recent silent film to be nominated for Best Picture (it won). My guess is, that streak is about to end thanks to French writer/director Michel Hazanavicius.No doubt many will avoid this one since it is a Black & White silent film. What a mistake that would be. It offers a wonderfully entertaining and captivating story, and two outstanding and expressive lead performances. Jean Dujardin is remarkable as George Valentin, one of the biggest movie stars in 1927 (when this story begins). It's around this time when the ""talkies"" begin taking over. Valentin is a very likable character, but foolishly believes talking movies are a fad and his fans will remain loyal to him and his traditional silent films. Not only do talkies take off, but the Great Depression also hits. Valentin finds himself out of work and broke.The most fun in the film occurs when Valentin and Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) are together. Their characters have a chance meeting and there is an instant spark. Valentin gets her the first break of her career and before long, she is on the rise as fast as he free falls. Only Valentin's dog and driver (James Cromwell) remain loyal to him during the tough times, but Peppy refuses to let the bond die.It's impossible to watch this film and not notice the influence of ""Singin' in the Rain"" and ""Sunset Blvd"". Also, Dujardin's Valentin looks to be a cross between Douglas Fairbanks and Gene Kelly, replete with the electric matinée idol smile. Both Dujrardin and Ms. Bejo (who is the director's real life girlfriend) have the elastic face and bright eyes necessary for silent film stardom. They really allow us as viewers to forget the silence and enjoy the characters.This is a fully realized story with excellent character development. You might wonder how this is possible with no dialogue, but that's why this is a must see film garnering an abundance of critical acclaim. It's very easy to access and is purely entertaining ... with both moments of happiness and sadness. It has everything a really good movie should have ... just with fewer lines of dialogue!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Masterful - one of the best of 2011,"What chance in the world does a movie in which virtually no words are spoken and is filmed in black in white have to succeed at winning the hearts of Academy Award voters? If any of them bother to watch The Artist, the chances should be astronomical. This is more than a work of art. It surpasses the medium and our expectations. First, let me explain about the mechanics of the movie. Like its ancestors, it is not really silent; music accompanies just about every scene. Sometimes title cards appear to indicate what a character has said, but these are employed infrequently. Even ambient noise, like a cup being placed on a table, are not heard. Each actor ""speaks"" his lines, and the most basic ones are easily understood by the expressions. It's not as difficult to follow as it may sound.In The Artist, Jean Dujardin plays a silent-film actor named George Valentin (sort of a cross between Rudolf Valentino and Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.). He is the star of his time and makes a good living. He's married to his frequent costar, played by Penelope Anne Miller, and he has an adorable Jack Russell terrier (a nod to the Thin Man movies). In an instance of kismet, he meets fan/aspiring actress Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), for whom he finds a job as an extra in his movie as a dancer (her name itself is probably a nod to the great Ann Miller). And meanwhile, his wife Doris is, shall we say, unhappy with George, noticing the chemistry between him and his new friend.Reminiscent of A Star Is Born, Peppy becomes popular while, with the advent of talkies, George becomes less employable. No one wants to hear people talk, he rants at his boss (John Goodman). He vows to make his own movie – silent – with his own money. It opens on the same date as Peppy's big film, and it doesn't do well.The plot is a simple rise-fall-rebirth drama. Its lack of complexity is a huge asset here, as so much must be expressed visually. And what visuals! The elegant shots from cinematographer Guillaume Schiffman evoke sympathy, stark reality, compassion, humor, and love almost effortlessly. The music is beautiful and well selected. This is a movie about movies, after all, and, much like Singin' in the Rain was about one actor's approach to the new-fangled talking pictures, The Artist shows us a different approach: George Valentin, realizing his career as he knows it cannot continue, simultaneously understands that he is not fit for the future, either. He cannot change, can he? Who, indeed, would want to hear him talk?I mentioned earlier that virtually no words are spoken. As in Mel Brooks' Silent Movie, there is some dialog near the very end of the movie. But Dujardin and Bejo are so astounding, graceful, and sparkling on screen that no sound is needed, let alone actual words. They are a remarkable couple, she with the big eyes, coquettish wink, and impish personality, and he with the debonair stare, the chiseled chin, and all the raging self confidence that a stylish leading man should have. They are perfect in this movie.I cannot stress how powerful and moving this movie is. It's a stunning achievement and wildly entertaining. It's enthralling, capturing a far- off time with impeccable, glistening accuracy. Director Michel Hanzanavicius doesn't miss a step in directing his cast – some of whom are quite seasoned. There's Goodman as the studio head and Miller as the wife, and other familiar faces show up, such as Missi Pyle, James Cromwell, Ed Lauter, and Malcolm McDowell. Hanzanavicius' movie isn't just evocative of the old 1920s films – it really seems to transport you to a theater in the early part of the 20th century. It's a lavish, loving film that is absolutely packed with emotional scenes. It is, at turns, joyous and devastating, but it is always, always a huge treat to watch. It is, most definitely, one of the very best films of 2011.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Vintage Tour That Guarantees To Put A Smile On Every Cinema Lover's Face.,"Winner of 5 Academy Awards including Best Picture, The Artist is an awe-inspiring ode to the silent era of cinema and is filmed with such fine elegance & precision artistry that it was too difficult for me to wipe the smile off my face while watching it. An enthralling work of indelible charm, every frame of this silent feature pays its tribute in the most respectful manner possible but also succeeds in carving out its very own identity in the process.Set in Hollywood during the years when talkies were being introduced into cinema, The Artist focuses on the relationship between a major silent film star & an aspiring young actress who bump into each other during the premiere of the former's latest film. But when their production house decides to do away with silent films & usher in the new era of sound, the career of these two actors turns upside down as one heads for ruin, while other rises to stardom.Written & directed by Michael Hazanavicius, The Artist opens in the same manner like films of that era used to & it even feels like you're watching a feature from that golden period. Paying attention to the smallest of details, it's an intriguing look at how production was carried out in those days, and if the excellence in the production design wasn't enough, its two lead actors manage to take it to a whole new level with their expressive & energetic performances.Coming to the technical aspects, cinematography captures the whole picture in the same aspect ratio & frame rate as was standard in 1920s, black-n-white photography has a vintage feel to it, the first half of the film is exquisitely paced while the second half stumbles a little but makes a sharp return in its final moments to culminate on a high with a memorable final shot, and Ludovic Bource's background score wonderfully captures the era this story is set in.As far as performances go, both Jean Dujardin & Bérénice Bejo are a revelation in their respective roles of silent film star, George Valentin & aspiring actress, Peppy Miller. With no words to speak on camera plus complete reliance on body language & facial expressions, the two actors make their characters work stunningly well & even share a sizzling chemistry together. Of the two leads however, I liked Bejo's work much more than Dujardin's.On an overall scale, succeeding not only as a marvellous silent film but also a heartfelt drama with romance at its heart & nostalgia written all over it, The Artist is a skilfully executed cinematic feat from a passionate filmmaker who admires the beauty & art of a bygone era, and is a triumph in all filmmaking departments. Definitely one of the best films of its year & absolutely deserving of all its accolades, The Artist comes as a must for every cinema lover out there.",,Anonymous,Romance
An Honest Take on Silent and Noir,"I liked this film. I didn't love this film. It had some great aspects, was historically accurate as far as i could tell and it was definitely very reminiscent of its time. The ability this film has to capture the era of the silent film but also tell a story that works with a modern audience is actually very good.Since the setting of this film (1927), so much has changed in the filmmaking and storytelling world. Not only how we tell stories through acting but also how we tell stories through great soundtracks, costumes, and impressive cinematography.Where the film didn't work for me, and i often find this, is the pacing. At points this movie felt as if it was lacking substance, at other times it felt like i was being blasted with crucial information. Chronologically speaking, if this films key plot points were more evenly dispersed (which isn't always best) I would have enjoyed it more and probably added a star or two to my review.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An analogue admirer's analysis,"After waiting for about 2 months since I first watched the trailer and more than 5 since I first heard about it, I finally managed to watch ""The Artist"". Between then and the night before last, I've grown accustomed to hearing only the superlatives and most glorious adjectives in reference to the movie. Although none from my close friends, I am referring to my favourite pastimes like Facebook, Twitter, American Cinematography Magazine, Total Film, Time Magazine to just name a few. Apart from setting unimaginable expectations in the sub conscious, it did generate a sense of delirious excitement in me, while I sat down for the experience. Here's what I think, how it fared.The Artist is an accomplished piece of work that should / would appeal to a wide spectrum of cine goers across the world. But ""a lump in the throat"" is reserved for the absolute fanatic of the craft. In my books, I consider myself a member of such a make belief club. Before I indulge in the sparkles and the fireworks, the movie managed to create while watching it and right after, let me get into some of the facts.This is as much as some may hate to accept, is a French production shot on location in Los Angeles and includes various craftsmen from both French cinema and Hollywood. But in true heart and soul this is an American story of the industry that sells dreams and most successfully so.There have been many stories about it in the past and so will be in future; that may have or will manage to tell it successfully and some not so much. The Artist, I perceive will have a special place amongst them all, a first among equals if You'd like. At a time, where the advent and renaissance of ""Social Media"" has brought fans of cinema and the ones who don the grease paints to unbelievable and sometimes unacceptable proximities, the process has inadvertently led to considerable degeneration of the mist that surrounds them and their lives outside the spot light, between ""cut"" and ""action"". And at such times, ""The Artist"" is a breath of fresh air and works as a reminiscent of what movies right after its conception, stood for. A celebration of one such art form, from one such factory that has outlived itself in many ways in the past millennium. he story itself is about an indispensable act of nature, ""change"" and how it affects the one's who take success and in this case fame and admiration for permanency or as some would call it, granted. In life as much as in the world of glamour, nothing is constant. The protagonist's fights with his inner demons about accepting change is projected in the simplest of manners which is why it works. Research of how it worked in the 1920′s and technical excellence in achieving the feel of those times more than the costume, make up and body language which we have come to expect of movies these days, makes it a product par excellence. The fact that the makers shot it at 22 fps as opposed to the standard 24 fps, helped them achieve what they did and is a serious case in point. Although its USP, ""a silent film"" will manage to draw the crowds and more so with all the nominations it has been getting, what would make them savour the experience is, how good it is, at it. Michel Hazanavicius who held this dream / passion project close to his heart for long before it came true chose his confidants for the lead roles, Jean Dujardin & Berenice Bejo (who also happens to be his better half). They have achieved major success in the OSS 117 series in France before this. Along with that some very familiar faces that constitutes the important players list includes the likes of John Goodman & James Cromwell who by the way pull off excellent character roles pivotal to the story line. Special mention to Uggy the Dog, who by the way has his own IMDb page now. But by and large Jean Dujardin with his impeccable sense of timing besides an affable charm, the original score produced by Lodovic Bource and performed by Brussels Philharmonic and most of all, Michel Hazanavicius who did not have to depend only on intertiles to tell a silent story, should be held high, very high in respect to what they have given us, the fans. Come February 26th, people who watch movies and follow them for what it is worth, will wait to see if ""The Artist"" stakes claims at the 10 Oscar categories it has been nominated for (including BEST Picture). My only concern is, people should not give it a miss if it does not get some of them ""Gold Statuettes"" in the bag because for once, let's not make The Academy the yardstick of its excellence and achievements. Martin Scorsese for all I care should have earned it long before for far better works than ""The Departed"", for which he did. Lets for once, stand up and applaud ""The Artist"" wherever You are, until it deafens the ears that have grown accustomed to appreciation of the mediocre, because this one is not it. It is quiet truly and literally if I may, in a league of its own.Check out more review http://mayurdeep.com",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ingenious but Lightweight,"So, let's make a silent movie. We have all the state-of-the-art stuff that allows us to fall back on something that disappeared around 1929. It disappeared because Jolson talked and others couldn't and we were on our way to what we have now. The limitations of cinematography created in silents demands that were hard to overcome at times, but through genius, the likes of Griffith and Murnau were able to trump those with varying degrees of success. Some of the best of these were silly comedies and, hence, that's what we have here. What we've asked it what the actors of the new sound era were asked, except in reverse. This is hardly a true silent movie. Because of the huge budget and the ability use techniques that are tried and true, it comes off slick as a whistle. I really enjoyed this but let's face it, not only as the technology passed, so has the era that spawned it. So by making this a period piece, I can only respond ho-hum. I think this is a creative piece with nice acting and some cool plot twists (though a little too much pride for my tastes), but I feel that the other Best Picture nominees should be suing.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Such magnificence!,"Such magnificence! As advertised, The Artist is an enthralling love letter that captures the silent film era of cinema with such aplomb; a captivating recreation of a time long passed. I can't even say that I'm an enthusiast of silent cinema, but the throwback here by writer/director Michel Hazanavicius and everyone else involved makes me want to be. He fills it to the top with such charm and loveliness, it's one of those films where you can feel the adoration of it's creator pouring over every frame. The film is getting a lot of attention and appreciation for this unique style, but it also excels in the very basic ideas of what makes a film work.The Artist is built around the story of George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), a silent film star whose light begins to fade as talking pictures arrival in Hollywood and what begins as this charming love letter to silent cinema becomes a fascinating and emotional journey with a complex character. Valentin is charming and handsome, but his success has led him to become quite smug and arrogant, mugging for the cameras and ignoring everyone who helped him get where he is. When the spotlight moves away from him, and towards new stars like Berenice Bejo's plucky Peppy Miller, he's forced to take a look at himself and what he doesn't like what he sees.French star Jean Dujardin takes this character on a roller coaster emotional journey and the road he's taken down has some very strong emotional highs and lows. Critics of the film have often cited that it's ""too light"", but I couldn't disagree with this more. I was surprised by the depths of despair the film took me down with a Depression time period giving it an interesting social relevance and some heartbreaking moments of devastation for Valentin. In spite of all of his arrogance, the man still seems to have a heart of gold and Dujardin plays him with a charm that won me over pretty quickly and got me very invested in him.The film is certainly the child of Hazanavicius, whom you can feel in every moment, but Dujardin is a revelation in the leading role. The character of Valentin goes through a wealth of development during the film and he plays each scene expertly, fully embodying this person. When we meet him he is all about mugging for the camera and basking in his spotlight, all charm and no depth, but as he sinks further into depression and isolation we begin to explore what the man is made of deep down and it's a fascinating journey into his mind. Stripping away an actor's use of speech, you would have expected it to be a very internal performance, but I was blown away by how outwardly emotive Dujardin was able to be here.This is one of those roles that you feel someone was born to play, as he uses his body language and that unbelievably expressive face to portray a wealth of emotions, along with some intimately internal work along the way. With his unique, charming and winning chemistry with all of the actors, from the glowing Bejo to James Cromwell as the resilient driver to Uggie the dog, he commands every moment of this film. Hazanivicius is responsible for all of it, but Dujardin completely owns it.The Artist is memorable in just about every way, especially in it's astounding recreation of an era long gone. Film has evolved so much over the decades, but somehow everyone involved here was able to transport themselves and the audience back to the silent era. It's truly remarkable, even just on a technical level. From the way it's shot and edited to something as basic as the way the actors act, going for broad strokes as opposed to the more ""natural"" acting we experience today.With this, we were given a gift of a film that one hundred percent feels like it comes to us from another time period. With a bounty of instantly classic scenes, from the dancing legs to the climatic ""Look what you've become..."", this is a true winner that is an absolute crowd-pleaser but also surprised me with it's dark themes and emotional depths. I have to admit that this didn't seem like the kind of film I would have taken to, but it absolutely won me over in every way.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Charming and warming story told with style and a wit that rises above it being a gimmick,"From a viewer's point of view this time of the year is a blessing and a curse. It is a blessing because so many good or worthy films are out in the cinemas because the awards season is just arriving – so it sort of works as the opposite end of the spectrum to the summer season where all the ""special effects"" movies gather, December/January is where all the potential award winners clump up. The downside of this is that some of them can be overly worthy button pushers looking for awards in a shameless way but also that genuinely good films can be over-hyped. This unfortunately happened with The Artist – the praise was all at an extreme so of course the backlash is equally extreme as people go expecting the film to be the most perfect thing ever, only to find that it is only a really good little film.And this is what The Artist is – a really good little film that tells a simple story in an effective and charming way, using the device of being a silent film to very good effect. I'm not sure what some of those criticising it expected to see, but I guess it is hard to not be disappointed whenever every poster on every bus and every review in every newspaper seems to be suggesting it is the most brilliant thing ever – which it isn't. I really enjoyed it though and thought it was as clever as it was simple, producing funny bits but also moments that I was surprised they were as touching as they were. The plot sees a Hollywood actor in the silent pictures at the top of his game who falls on hard times when talkies see his fans deserting him – all as a young starlet who he gave a break to rises in popularity thanks to her part in the talkies. It is a simple story but it plays out very well and the lack of dialogue really doesn't hurt the film at all – it just helps create the era for the viewer.It is never hilarious but it is consistently amusing but of more surprise to me was how moving and sensitive it was - the story is simple but yet it engages and charms. The cast are a big part of this because they give performances that match the ""big expression"" nature of silent film acting but they also deliver in the smaller moments so that it is not just the words they are saying that they show, but also their feelings and thoughts. Dujardin in particular does so much without a single word and I very much enjoyed how he led the film. Likewise Bejo is very OTT in her expression but manages to make it work while also being charming and natural at the same time. I'm not sure why faces like Goodman, Cromwell, Pyle, McDowell and others were all in here but they were nice finds in supporting roles. As director and writer Hazanavicius has done a great job and he deserves his Oscar nominations for this.Overall The Artist is a lovely little film with a simple story that is told with invention, wit and charm. No matter how many awards it wins it will not cure you of your diseases or change how you approach life – so if you walk in with that expectation because of the hype then you will be disappointed, but come to it for what it is and you will find that it easily charms and entertains you.",,Anonymous,Romance
Don't miss!!!!!,"The Artist is a wonderful movie. I can't say too many good things about it. It is funny, sweet, endearing, sad and lovely. I'm surprised at how moved I was. The leads (Jean Dujardin & Berenice Bejo) radiate charm, you can't help but root for them even when his pride get the best of him and she gets a little big-headed. Maybe it's just me but Jean Dujardin reminded me a little of Gene Kelly. Uggie (the dog) is marvelous - I don't know why he hasn't been nominated. I would call it a 'movie lovers movie', it has nods (or maybe winks) to 'Sunset Boulevard', 'Singin' in the Rain' and 'The Mark of Zorro'. Although this is a silent movie, there are moments of sound playfully executed. The story is relatively simple - how does an established star cope when trends and technology change faster then he wishes they would? There are a couple of nits I could pick, but why? Please do yourself a favor and see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Engaging and affecting but unoriginal,"Okay, so it's paying homage to silent films. But to really do that, you have to step up to the task and outdo the genre or it doesn't work. Just as Scream was better than most of the horror films it was mocking and Singin' in the Rain was possibly the best musical ever made. That's why they worked - they respected the past and improved on it. Speaking of which, this film was very reminiscent of Singin' in the Rain - to the point of feeling like a weaker version that made me want to watch the original. Much of the story and tone overlap. But of course, Singin' in the Rain came out 59 years earlier, had colour and singing and dancing and was hilarious and clever and still managed to pay homage to silent films.Jean Dujardin is very comically talented, a really good and charismatic actor (he coincidentally looks and smiles a lot like Gene Kelly). Bérénice Bejo was also very good and seemed to suit her role. But The Artist lacks a strong pull of its own. It's not particularly insightful - you learn nothing new about cinema. It doesn't make you think more deeply about the way we view films. The ending is a bit anticlimactic and too weak to make any kind of meaningful statement.There are quite a few hilarious moments, almost solely due to Dujardin. His timing and natural facial expressions are joyful to watch. The movie is quite engaging but that's largely because it's well-shot and looks nice, not due to a sweeping or profound or original story. The music is generally good but is still mere imitation and doesn't breathe new air into the style it's mimicking.It's ironic that The Artist reminds me of how unnecessary most dialogue is in films in general. Most films are full of vapid dialogue to an obscene degree. This has almost none and you can easily follow it and connect with the characters. So many movies would be better with all the talking cut out. The Artist believes in the magic of movies. It's very romantic (in the way that it's filmed). My eyes were glued to the screen much of the time. It understands the power of a silhouette, a gesture, a smile, a moment. But those are naturally powerful. It just takes a little guts to stick to them without trying to get flashy. But a great film still needs to say something with those things.There were a handful of times where it neglected to show what a character was saying - I couldn't tell at all and watching a person talk at length with no sound is incredibly dull and pointless. In those instances, they should have either ""spoken"" non-verbally (with posture and expressions but no speech) or, if it was so important, the words should have been shown!Unoriginality was the main weakness here. I immediately recognised the music from Vertigo which was casually used for what felt like 10 or 20 minutes. That music was written for another film. I was thinking about Vertigo and how good it is and how I wanted to watch it. That's a bad sign. Yes, Bernard Herrmann based his themes for Vertigo on Tristan und Isolde, but that was only his starting point. He didn't simply use it as it was. Plus, that was an interesting and meaningful artistic choice that he made. Here, using Vertigo's music was distracting, inappropriate and harmfully unoriginal. Yes the images and music affected me but put nice music to any vaguely emotional imagery and you get the same effect. I can't believe a film that does something like this could win an Academy Award. Imagine a film winning Best Picture which has 10 minutes of dialogue taken directly from a Tarantino movie. Music is its own language which deserves just as much respect.Another small scene was a direct rip-off of Citizen Kane. Again, it wasn't a homage because it wasn't as good. It reminded me of the other film and how much better it is. Raiders of the Lost Ark pays homage to earlier adventure mediums successfully, it was the best adventure film ever made - it earned the right to play with the genre. In contrast, unfortunately, The Artist's most powerful scenes are when it blatantly imitates earlier films, following the existing tropes without adding anything. They're nice but not as powerful as their ancestors.It's not anywhere near as funny or poignant as Chaplin's or Keaton's films. It's not as provocative or beautiful or haunting as many other silent films I've seen. It won't be influential. It makes no profound statement about silent films or life or anything else. However it is quite charming and heart-warming and enjoyable. It's a good movie. It reminds you of how powerful films can be - to make you cry or laugh within seconds.It'd be really great to see Dujardin in a comedy with an original story, a role which uses all his skills. He's extremely likable and funny although clearly not a dancer (he did very well but I could tell). It'd also be great to see a new silent film which isn't about silent films but is simply silent because that's still a powerful and valid way to make new movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Uplifting and refreshing an oasis of a movie,"From the opening credits, the audience is instantly transported to the golden age of Hollywood. We then follow the story, set in the 1920's, of George Valentin, a renowned silent era actor who refuses to adapt to the new technology that introduces sound to the films and pays the price, and his acquaintance with dancer Peppy Miller.I would rather stick to impressions of the film without further references to the development of the story out of concern it might spoil it for those who have not yet seen it.As one watches ""The Artist"" feels like being part of another era, bygone, of cinema; the glamour, the originality, the ambiance is all there. The story line flows seamlessly and is enriched with elements of emotion, tension, consequence of pride, as well as struggle with conscience. The audience is not just in for a great film but will be effortlessly seduced by its abundance of charm. Though silent it speaks loud and it will also move, perhaps even stir its viewers. In times where hi-tech visuals often carry the weight of films instead of its actors, it was refreshing to see a movie where technology actually serves hypocritic talent. To the above we must add spotless performances by the leading actors and an exquisite cinematography, whereby every scene is skilfully and beautifully shot.All in all, this movie is a cinematic delight that will cause joy, sorrow, sadness, even anguish, thus leaving the theatre with a sense of exhilaration. And that's no little feat.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Smart, funny, warm...and a pale shadow of the great silent films from the 1920s","The Artist (2011)This is a movie Woody Allen would have liked to have made. And if he had, it wouldn't have been his best.A fantasy and a romance, a time trip (with some intentional slippage with fact), and an homage to silent movies and to early musicals, which of course were not silent.The leading man is tremendously alive and talented, though he has that French leading man quality that American audiences do not quite warm up to. The leading woman is the kind of French woman all audiences love--full of life, an over-sized smile, a big heart.I think silent movie fans will be torn. I mean, this is essentially a silent movie, but anyone familiar with silents from before 1927 will know a different kind of intensity and sophistication. Even a different and better kind of plot. To some extent, this dumbs up (no pun intended) the silent movie aura, making fun of the industry, turning meaningful plots into clichés. Even as visually beautiful as this movie is, it doesn't match the best of the old silent films for depth and surprise, at least at times.But then, ""The Artist"" does pull off a relatively rare feat, making the most of what seemed like a genre long gone. It doesn't use affected tricks like add scratches to the film or extra camera shake. In fact, there are little techniques that are wholly modern, like the very slow tracking-in shot when a character is going through some important thought or transition (this has become a standard, almost inevitable technique in the last 20 years).I'm not talking plot because the plot is almost insignificant. It's fun, it's warm. And it's a rehash of a lot of man meets young pretty girl who then makes it in the world of theater, or dance, or yes, the movies. And there are so many references to that other, better, homage to silent films, ""Singin' in the Rain,"" it's almost painful. Or just sheer lightweight fun.I didn't really love this movie, as you can tell, and I really love movies. It's really well made, sincerely artistic in its own 2011 way, and enjoyable. The sold out audience where I saw it last night loved it and applauded at the end. That's where most people are at, and if you go, you'll be happy. But I'll throw in that if you really do like the silent film aspects, and not just the referring to silent films as a kind of homage, you should look at some of the great ones from the 1920s. Really, truly, originally great ones.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sorry if I wanna watch a silent movie it will be one with Buster Keaton/Charlie Chaplin/WC Fields. I could not eject this movie from my DVD player fast enough! How this movie ever got made is beyond me it was that bad. I am bewildered as to how this film won so many Oscars let alone the Grand Prize!

Never Before Have I Seen Something This Unique---,"I must say, I was a bit skeptical walking into 'The Artist', for as I glanced at the members of the audience, I just saw many senior citizens. I expected it to be much like The King's Speech, which I strongly disliked due to its genericness and overall boring tone. I am young, 13, and I was almost preparing myself to be disappointed. This film, however, automatically won its way to my top 10 of 2011 list. I was completely blown away Jean Dujardin's performance. He was absolutely outstanding, and it's a shame that people believe George Clooney tops him. He really is a breakout star with his incredible performance in this film. His facial expressions, his movements, he became the character: A greedy, self-obsessed film star who must come to terms with the fact that his career is dying, under the brand new impression of 'talkies'. Meanwhile, Berenice Bejo casts lightning with her profound ability to act out Peppy Miller a 'Peppy' (pun intended) girl who is on her way to becoming a true star. She really does capture the screen in each scene she is in, with both her beauty, and her true emotions that are extracted as time plays out on the screen. The original score- Marvelous. The costume/set design- Incredible. I could go on and on forever about how great this film was, but I will just sum it up in words. The Artist, is a unique, creative piece that provides relief from big-budget action films, bringing long-time film lovers and brand new audiences into the simpler time of the silent film era. Thriving off the performances of Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo, The Artist is a one of a kind masterpiece.*****/*****",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great film.... it was over too quickly,"This film was over much too quickly and created a world I didn't want to leave. It is a demonstration of the film- makers art to be able to explain everything visually. After seeing The Artist I wondered if we ever needed sound in films. George Valentin's smile is infectious. Without speech, facial expressions are everything. The sequence when sound is added is visually witty and funny. Above all the music is great. Rather than reproduce music from the time, the elements of the 1920s style have been reworked into an original and thoroughly enjoyable film score. Elements of the film could stand alone. It could be enjoyed in complete silence. The photography is stunning. The clothes and sets are stylish. The music is great. Together they sparkle.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"More sound, please!","I hate to be a party-pooper but for me this is not the greatest movie of recent times. Yes, it's charming, even beguiling - and it's got the most appealing dog in cinema history! - but it's kind of slow and kind of, dare I say, not very original. One man's ""hommage"" is another man's piracy: SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, A STAR IS BORN and SUNSET BOULEVARD are a bit too strongly ""tributed"". Berenice Bejo's Peppy has an androgynous quality that reminded me of Jack Lemmon's Daphne in SOME LIKE IT HOT!The scene where George has a nightmare with actual sound is surprisingly disturbing, and it's easy to guess there will be another sound scene towards the end. For me the lack of dialogue - and the period Muzakal score - became more than a bit monotonous. It might have worked better if George's scenes had been the only silent ones, with Peppy's and the studio scenes having sound.The acting - with its ""hammy"" evocation of the silent era - is brilliant, as is the direction and the cinematography.

Can a silent film really win Best Picture?,"Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland Thank God for new ideas! With aspects of sound films such as ""Singing in the Rain"" and ""Citizen Kane"", as well as almost every silent film I ever saw in film school, ""The Artist"" is a silent film inexplicably released in 2011; and a modern masterpiece to boot. Without audible dialogue director Michel Hazanavivius creates a visual feast for the senses, merging his vision with a stellar soundtrack, which navigates the viewer through a whirlwind of emotions, just as a more conventional/modern sound-film would. ""The Artist"" tells the very intriguing story of George Valentin, played by Jean Dajardin, an actor with the charisma of a Rudolph Valentino, but with an attitude that rivals Chaplin. In 1927 Valentin stands as the biggest star of the Hollywood silent era, making countless films with his sidekick, a happy-go-lucky dog. But with the emergence of the talkie (the talking picture), and many younger actors, specifically a young actress named Peppy Miller, played by Berenice Bejo, Valentin fears that he will not be able to (and frankly doesn't want to) make the transition into a future dominated by sound films. Hazanvivius has constructed a very entertaining as well as historically accurate storyline, all while paying homage to the groundbreaking era in which this story takes place. Using old fashioned wipes and cuts, he allows the audiences (even some who haven't seen silent films) to experience a slice of film history (the silent era) as it should be experienced; in a more or less silent format. And in this day and age, where the Hollywood formula seems to be either an abundance of explosions, which destroy the senses and/or sexually irresponsible teenagers being moralistically decapitated, ""The Artist"" demonstrates a refreshing acknowledgement of how movies can be fun again with some simple yet visually breathtaking storytelling. This is very much cinema at its richest. What can I say? ""The Artist"" made me smile.""The Artist"" is a silent film about silent films; that is not entirely silent. BUT how these rare introductions of sound are interwoven into the story demonstrates a real stroke of genius from Hazanavivius. In fact, there are many broad strokes of genius at play during ""The Artist"", from the director's intricate attention to detail, in terms of the striking look of his cinematic vision, to the actors who all give performances of a lifetime. Everybody is perfectly cast (yes, even John Goodman, who is only in the movie for a short period). In fact, it would be very difficult find better lead actors in 2011 than Dujardin, who is polarizing as the once prolific Valentin, and Bejo who is phenomenal as the strong rising star/love interest Peppy Miller. Both show off their strong acting skills as they play necessarily overdramatized and flawed characters, without resorting to campiness. Furthermore, if there was a best supporting animal performance, the dog in ""The Artist"" would be sure to win. And if the dog is worthy of an award, shouldn't that be the truest sign of a great ensemble cast? Final Thought: Please don't disregard ""The Artist"" just because you heard that it is a silent film. This film breaks down every generational or genre barrier known to man. This is a comedy with genuine laughs, a tragedy with genuine tears and a drama that is a monumental achievement in modem cinema. I don't get to say this much, in a year filled with failed Adam Sandler productions, but this film is damn near flawless. And while ""The Artist"" may not be my favorite film of the year, it is damn near close, and would not surprise me if it won for Best Picture at the Oscars, as well as best director and best lead actor.

The Artist,"The movie is a mix between The Call of Cthulhu (2005), Ed Wood (1994), Chaplin (1992) and Sunset Blvd. (1950). It takes place around 1930 and tells the story of silent movie star that has to deal with the introduction of film sound and talking movies. The movie itself is made like a silent movie from that period and the technical side is great (although they didn't go so far as The Call of Cthulhu did in ""aging"" the film; also, notice that only the early scenes are sped-up a bit like the old movies).The entire production value is excellent (scenery, clothing, makeup, cars, houses), making the movie feel very authentic right from the start. Solid direction, good cast and excellent score (totally deserves the Golden Globe it got). My only complaint is that movie didn't maintain the amount of interest I felt in its beginning; I don't know if I should blame the script or the director, but more than once I felt that I'm losing my interest. Perhaps some scenes were just too long.IMHO this movie doesn't come close to the level of Ed Wood, but all in all it's a good film and I recommend it.5.5/10 Recommended",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Artist: When Actions Speak Louder than Words,"This film is highly recommended."" Dreams can come true again, When ev'ry thing old is new again. ""Lyrics by Peter AllenMichel Hazanavicius' The Artist is a fine homage to the heydays of early cinema. It is 1927 and the arrival of ""talkies"" is about to change the silent film industry and those who are unable to transition to this new process. One of those soon-to-be victims is Hollywood movie star George Valentin ( Jean Dujardin ). A top matinée idol ( ala the real John Gilbert ) accustomed to fame and the fortune or misfortune it brings, Valentin meets cute an adoring fan named Peppy ( Bérénice Bejo ). Soon Peppy becomes a rising ingénue on the road to stardom while his life begins to descend into alcohol and poverty.Yes, the plot is mighty familiar, but bear with it. With the film being basically silent, the overall visual look of the film must greatly compensate for the lack of words and dialog. And that is just what happens in this marvelous film, as it captivates and transports the moviegoer back to a more innocent time.The Artist is a rather conventional mash-up of Singin' in the Rain with A Star is Born. Yet it completely won me over with its masterful direction and period details. ( I realized this about 20 minutes into the film during one terrific dream sequence where sound effects abruptly broke the ""silence"" barrier. ) Shooting the film in 1.33:1 ratio and in glorious black & white, just as those silent films were initially seen, is more than a mere gimmick in Hazanavicius' vision. He takes his appreciation of his film subject seriously and adds his modern spin to this film while staying entrenched in that revered cinematic style.The film is done mostly without dialog, albeit title cards playing a significant role as does a continuous musical soundtrack that highlights the action on the screen. The director, who also wrote the screenplay, tends to borrow too heavily from some musical choices (as with Hermann's Vertigo score ) and some film masterworks ( like Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, The Mark of Zorro with Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and Wilder's Sunset Boulevard, loyal chauffeur and all. Some may say these touches are only inspired from other sources, others might question the film's lack of originality. )But the film has certified moments of pure genius intermixed with scenes of high melodrama. There are scenes of such wit and charm ( a musical dance number remindful of that of Astaire and Rogers ; a slightly surreal moment with a young starlet embracing a coat-rack that seems to come to life; a dinner table scene that owes much to passage of time tableaux from the aforementioned Kane, etc. ) that dazzles the movie audience. ( At the film's end, there was spontaneous applause heard throughout the theater. )Another plus to the film's winning demeanor is the central casting of the two main actors. Dujardin plays Valentin as a proud and vain peacock of a man. He can emote like the silent film stars of yesteryear, brandishing his handsomeness and profile to extremes and the next moment bringing a Chaplinesque quality to the more vulnerable side of this man's personality. Bérénice Bejo radiates that sunny and ""peppy"" quality needed for her character to become fully realized. Her loving and caring nature provides the essence for romance within the story. ( Special mention goes to Uggie the Dog for proving once again that we humans can be so easily upstaged by our four-legged friends.)The Artist is an affectionate love letter to the silent film era and Hollywood itself. As the old adage says, ""Silence is golden."" And so is this delightful film. GRADE: B+NOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Charming and endearing, but shallow, predictable, and overrated","This film was delightful and charming in many ways. It made me feel good. The dog was cute --- extremely cute. Bejo was a revelation, a woman whose charm and style transcends mere fashion in any era.But --- Best Picture? You have to be kidding. Where was the story? You could sum it up in 5 lines. Where was the depth of characterization? There was virtually none. What motivated the characters? Why were they so shallow? What reflection was there of the incredibly complex world events that characterized that era?Granted --- the field was extremely weak this year. When Clooney's well- crafted but ultimately tepid ""The Descendants"" is getting raves---well, you know it's a thin field.This lightweight little French pastry belongs firmly in the middle of the ""three star"" category, and deserves nothing more. (Although the dog certainly deserves Oscar consideration.)Every year now, it seems, the Academy gets a ""grand idea"" in its head, and then votes accordingly.A few years ago, the grand idea was to have a Female Director win, and the result was an Best Picture award for the searingly dramatic but unrealistic and deeply flawed ""Hurt Locker.""Last year, it was ""The Charm of the Royalty,"" as the workmanlike ""The King's Speech"" won out over movies like ""Winter's Bone"", a film that was utterly riveting from the first frame to the last, and directed and acted with absolute brilliance.And this year, it was ""Ode to Hollywood"" time, evidently.Perhaps the most telling point about this film is that the guy writing the film's score (I won't dignify his efforts by listing his name) ran out of ideas at the film's most critical juncture --- its dramatic conclusion. So what did he do? He lifted Bernard Herrmann's brilliant music from Vertigo! A fine choice, indeed. But it put into stark contrast the distinction between the genius of Hitchcock and Herrmann, and the rather modest contributions of this film. Half the people writing rave reviews here probably have no idea where that music came from.Consider ""Psycho"" and ""Vertigo"".

Wordlessly Brilliant,"When was the last time you actually saw a black and white movie? Don't worry, I didn't remember until I saw this one. The Artist film (silent) is certainly an Oscar winner, it was directed by French, Michel Hazanavicius. It took place in a vintage, black and white Hollywood air. With not so many good graphics nor dialogues the movie spoke by itself, the actors played very well their roll, the soundtrack was lovely and it was also self-understanding in a mesmerizing way; however, the movie had few invaluable scenes; as a result, it went a just a little bit long for my taste.On the other hand, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) along with Peppy miller (Bérénice Bejo) drove a pleasant scenario where tears and laughs came along very well. Both were classically dapper, they acted delightfully surprising. Moreover, a swooning soundtrack by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra backed up the romance film. The way music merged with the scene was truly enchanting.In conclusion, old movies seemed to be a little bit dull for me, yet the Artist changed my whole perception. The characters transported me to 1927 without a single word; as for that reason, and many more, it was in every sense of the phrase an original, outstanding and a beautifully hand crafted 4 stars film.Eric Rivas, Dominican Republic.",,Anonymous,Romance
The apogee of silent cinema,"This movie tells us through the drama of the main character what was the the tragedy of many actors and actresses of the silent cinema who haven't adapted themselves to the talkies when they came because of their voices and not only that (Greta Garbo of all). Some performers and directors rejected also the talkies for aesthetic reasons considering it was not good cinema. Silent cinema marked an epoch and even shaped a life conception. In my opinion it wasn't only a starting stage of the cinema as an art but also a different kind of cinema and which could therefore have coexisted with the talkies. The visual technique employed in it, the expressionist performance of actors and actresses, the romantic nature of most stories, all of that was its peculiar mark. Director Hazanavicius has opted here to tell the story in terms of a silent movie using for that all the usual visual and performing techniques proper to that kind of cinema which makes the viewer to integrate himself better in the story atmosphere and even to understand better the drama of the silent movie's actor who not only doesn't feel ready to act on the talkies but also that rejects their aesthetic value which makes him to sink in moral and material misery. His drama is stressed by the fact that the girl he loves from the beginning and that was brought by him to the cinema suddenly became a talkies' star. A good movie to which we cannot demand more since the story is somewhat limited.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's the same wine in new bottle, just that it caters to tast of the new audience which is 'said to be intelligent'.A simple conflict of whether an artist likes sound in movies or not, is drawn to magnanimous proportions and one scene where the glass sound, the laughs of girls come along portray how much he is stuck and in love with silence. He is overtly adamant about silent films than being passionate about them. He hates the sound so much that he goes to even end his life, on hearing people speak. Such a character is tough to portray and Jean Dujardin does emote exceptionally well.The dog named Uggy who is the hero and as written in the film, ""He owes his life to the dog"" has done a remarkably good job. The art direction was outstanding and so was the choreography. The music complemented each scene well whether it is the initial part of cinema where he performs for audiences, the comic sequences or the dramatic part. Also, the screenplay just flew.Having said all the above, there are a few dislikes of which few are 1) This film has a completely predictable storyline, in fact me and my friend were talking to each other what would happen next and it turned out to be same 2) The story in itself is too very common and so is the treatment 3) The actress Berenice Bejo was good at places and at few times was just awkward, example the way she speaks to George Valentin on the stairs was like making a spoof of the old silent films. 4) Oh yes, its just too melodramatic, the final climax where she rushes in car as if she would definitely do an accident was uncalled for.So going out with 3/5. Having said about the flaws, I would still say it's a must watch for those who love cinema for the way cinema is. I loved it, coz I go for cinema to be taken into it and pulls me into a path that it builds for me, and this movie did that in every sense to me. This is for sure, is the best actor movie I saw in recent times.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Unconventional and beautiful, but rather uninteresting","Of course, the director Mr Hazanavicius and most of actors (especially Ms Bejo, Mr Goodman, and the dog) have done excellent job, but the storyline is rather simple and predictable. Similar to most of European (incl. French) films, there is a lot of romance, feelings, moods etc, as well as profound variances such as routine vs innovation, pride vs humbleness, past vs future. But due to few text lines and long scenes, I was quite eager to use forward function and got the whole picture in about an hour.The film is not bad, but 5 Academy Awards is slightly exaggerated, in my opinion (as most other nominees were state-of-the-art films as well). Critics have praised it a lot, but audience figures have been modest everywhere.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The dog was good.,"I had been looking forward to watching the Artist, I'm not sure why except for the quirky nostalgic angle that in today's world someone was willing to make a silent movie... the last tip of the hat to the silent era I remember from my youth being the Mel Brookes comedy. I dusted off the projector so I could watch on the big screen as my own little tribute to this movie as I watch most films now lazily on my 13"" laptop. I sadly found the film very disappointing and struggled to watch it through to the end. (I actually fell asleep halfway through). It felt like the story was one that had been told before way back in the day that it was reflecting and I questioned the need to reproduce what was already done so well back when the silver screen really was silver. Worse than my reaction to the film though was then to remember that it had won so many awards and been so highly praised by near all critics. How on earth did this film win Oscars and Golden Globes galore? A black and white movie that all had seen with a rose coloured tint? After seeing that the film had an 8.1 rating on IMDb and 98% on Rotten Tomatoes I felt compelled to have my say in an attempt to balance out, in my opinion, this highly unjustified acclaim. Indeed after seeing it had been so loudly applauded my own rating was nudged from poor to poop!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely Splendid,"I don't think I have seen a single negative thing written about this film, so going into the theater, it is fair to say that I had high expectations.""The Artist"" fulfilled all of them. The acting is fantastic, reminding us that body movements and twitches can convey a great deal of emotion. George Valentin's (Jean Dujardin) expression and posture slowly change as his life falls apart, helping the viewer feel what he is going through viscerally. Pippyy Miller's (Bérénice Bejo) smile conveys spunk and charm in a way that many actors cannot with large chunks of dialogue at their disposal. John Goodman portrays an incredibly stereotypical business-oriented Hollywood director brilliantly, his comical frustrations supplying much of the comedy present in this movie.From a cinematographic point of view, ""The Artist"" is stunning as well. Memorable shot after memorable shot showed up on the screen, whether it be a couple of fictional native Indians appearing on a bar counter to harass our protagonist, a suit fitting a reflection of him wonderfully, or a screen separating our destined tap dancers. The director, Michael Hazanavicius, also plays with sound wonderfully, with a lovely soundtrack providing plenty of audio-stimulation. However, in the climactic scene, there is absolute silence, actually provoking surprisingly strong emotions in the viewer. The last scene is absolutely brilliant on a number of levels, but I will not mention it here because it is worth experiencing without being told what happens.But as well done as these two elements are, it is conceptually where this movie excels. ""The Artist"" tells the story of the change from silent films to ""talkies"", and the difficulties it could cause to some of Hollywood's past stars. It's key message seems to be: ""Go with the flow"". Pride and vanity will leave you by the wayside, and in the case of our principal character, suicidal. It is ironic (and certainly not accidental) that this is a silent movie about the transition to ones with talking, and it uses a great mix of 1920's style scenes with ones that are undoubtedly modern and current, showing that the movie itself is not afraid to do what is new or unexpected (and then, of course, it is funny that a black and white silent movie is totally out of the mainstream now).My only gripe would be that the all-knowing dog is relied upon too much. I understand that it is an exaggerated character designed to emulate similar plot devices from the time period, but although it works greatly as a sidekick, when it takes over the action, its charm wears off.This was a pretty poorly conceived review, but it includes all of my basic ideas about ""The Artist"".

With Pleasure!!!,"There are so many wonderful aspects of this film, not sure where to start! First, I can say this film is an instant classic. There is no doubt about that as a fact. The production values are spot on, it feels like you are immersed in the world of the 20's.The Cast performed in what might seem simple, performing their role without speaking. Au contraire, their faces, body language and nuances speak volumes. The other big supporting character in the movie is the Music. The Music brings so much emotion and depth to this great picture.Some reviews here say the story is overrated. I am not sure they saw the same pic I saw. The story is wonderfully played out from beginning to end. A quick side note, if you see this movie and enjoyed it you may wish to watch some of the Silent era films on TCM. Every Sunday night they broadcast a silent film. The films pull you into another world, another aspect of the human condition. You see these films without voice sound but there is wonderful Music and acting that will make you laugh and tug at your heart as any great film from today would do to you.

A Formidable Task,"Even the most lavish aristocratic banquet or the excessive intake of special drinks of variable alcohol content in any decadent soirée would not have caused this Herr Graf to imagine that, during the first decade of the XXI century, silent films would come back in fashion after having vanished almost 100 years before.""The Artist"" (2011) is the picture in question and Herr Michel Hazanavicius the director; a silent film that has won considerable success with the public and the critics all around the world. Amazing that in these modernen times with its endless procession of noisy gadgetry that such a film has achieved vast approval. And if we add that ""The Artist"" is a French production concerned with how the coming of sound affected many actors, namely ""American"" actors, then this Her Graf doesn't understand a word, although probably the reason of this was that the film in question has French intertitlesHowever, while this Herr Graf was watching ""The Artist"" at the Schloss theatre, he felt something very strange in his stiff heart, a turmoil of different and contradictory feelings that gave him a particular sensation or as French commoners said, a ""déjà vu"".This German count does not, in any way, want to lecture or to rant about the tricky aspects of a film such as ""The Artist"" or what is supposed to be the quintessence of a silent film, and how this particular vision is almost a parody of its subject and uses many stereotypes about the era. Rather, since the film is celebrating silent movies, this Herr von can only applaud Herr Hazanavicius. He accomplished a formidable task given that most people today have never even seen a silent film or even one in black and white. He had to approximate a silent film in a rather cliché' way in terms of story and the style is more like a talkie than a silent but this had to be done to overcome the prejudices of modernen audiences.So, consequently the fact that a ""new"" silent film like the ""The Artist"" has been given the support and approval of the public is fit sociological subject. Will this lead to the new longhaired generations appreciating silent film? If that does happen it will be the most incredible and shocking news to this Herr Graf since his fat and rich Teutonic heiresses decided to get rid of their corsets.And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must put on again his old but now fashionable tuxedo.",,Anonymous,Romance
Jean Dujardin is amazing...a must watch movie,"The work of Jean proves that an actor is like water and no matter what role they get they should be able to complete it. We should admire the zeal of the other actors besides him, but we can say this with no doubt that Jean has put them down during the process of his masterpiece. On the other hand the movie itself isn't that bad either with lots of comedy and drama it illustrates that an actor does not need a voice to perform and is an amazing movie. In my opinion one of the greatest and a must watch. While most of the other movies in the same year are better than The Artist, this movie explains a lot of other goods in a movie that can be done by great directors and great I mean absolutely great actors.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Can somebody please give a Oscar for the dog?!!,"The first time I heard of this film was in 2012 Oscar's ceremony, I thought the Academy was exaggerating giving Oscars for this movie. ""A film black and white to win five Oscars, while old classics never won one?"" As I was being stupid about it, I decided to watch the movie to judge it and make a bad review about it, I was determined to do it ... I'm a very different person today. After the end, I was delighted me with a FANTASTIC film, I was surprised with everything. Michel Hazanavicius, who directed the ""OSS 117"" films, recreated the magic of the old cinema in a fantastic way. Grab on classics like ""Casablanca"", ""Citizen Kane"", and ""Charlie Chaplin"" films, mixing them all, and pum ... The Artist born, and born-it good. The greatest example of the old cinema in this film is the fact that there is no sound, only the background music to acting, movie magic alive every second of this movie. Jean Dujardin fully deserves his Oscar in this movie, the way it fits in the film and his character, and makes it so alive and so real ... is perfect, just that. Bérénice Bejo also not left out, she's quite superb, as John Goodman, James Cromwell, and the entire cast is fantastic in their roles. I laughed, I cried, I was completely charmed by the film. I recommend to all to all.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
a technical feat with an overused plot,"We have seen this story lots of time: A Star is Born. So the director decided to do it as a silent movie. The performances are very good and Dujardin is amazing. The actors are so good that there is almost no need for dialogue and you know both in terms of plot and emotion what is going on without explanation. As a technical feat, this silent film is 10 stars, but you need to tell a story with depth as well. Dujardin does practically all the heavy lifting in this movie, but I just never got caught up in the drama of his descent or in Peppy's attempts to save him. I just felt like paint by numbers (maybe that's why silent pictures died).So enjoy the craft of the actors, the feel of Hollywood as it transitions from silent to talkies, but not a great movie.

If this were released in the 1940s it would have been huge and I probably would have enjoyed it if I lived then.

We sadly live in an era where most people would overlook this gem of a movie either because it's in black and white and has no special effects or because it's mute. But if you ask me, it is truly amazing that films like this are still made! I found it incredibly funny, witty and brilliantly acted, especially Jean Dujardin. He gave the performance of a lifetime, as much as some of you say he didn't deserve the Oscar for Best Actor in a leading Role. Another great thing about it it's the soundtrack-so engaging and appropriate, going from uplifting to dramatic. Please do not miss this movie.

Movie makers always speak of making a motion picture which will ""capture the audience's attention, lure them in, make them laugh and cry."" I am happy to say that this movie has done all of that and more! Never before have I seen such a splendidly made movie! The Artist is very reminiscent about the great Silent Movie Era and how an actor of the genre struggles to find happiness after ""talkies"" are the new craze. Love, loss, and a new found discovery of happiness play a big role in this fantastic movie. Michel Hazanavicius clearly understands that it is neither action nor special effects which determine the success of a movie, but rather the feelings it conjures inside the viewer and a dynamic and intriguing story! This is definitely a movie I will remember for years to come, truly an undying instant classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The way the dialogue was shown on screen,just like in the 1920s, was very well done.This made it feel like A movie of that era. The costume design felt as it was very authentic.

A triumph that may never be replicated,"This is an audaciously original movie that succeeds spectacularly but it is hard to see how such success could ever be replicated. In the age of American widescreen blockbusters with glorious colour, crashing sound. sharp dialogue, and computer- generated special effects, who would have expected the creation of, let alone the acclaim for, a Franco-Belgian 1.33:1 aspect ratio, black and white work with (virtually) no sound and only old-fashioned visual effects?Above all, this is a triumph for writer and director Michel Hazanavicius. Much of Hazanavicius' television and film work is a pastiche of earlier cinema and ""The Artist""is a homage to a past era. It is set in Hollywood at the time that silent movies were being being surpassed by the talkies, a transition that ruins the previously-feted eponymous, handsome George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) but plays to the strengths of the winsome newcomer Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo, the director's wife). In France, Dujardin is something of a national treasure but, until now, he has been largely unknown outside his Gallic homeland. The two French leading roles are supplemented by those of two familiar American actors, James Cromwell as chauffeur to Valentin and then Miller and John Goodman as director of both. But the fifth star of this most unusual work is a talented canine who gives us the biggest laughs: a Jack Russell terrier named Uggie.Those who know their cinematic history will delight in the many cultural references, perhaps above all to John Gilbert who failed to make the transfer from silents to talkies. Those who have longed for a movie with a plot that one can understand, despaired at trying to catch snatched lines of dialogue, and feared that too much contemporary cinema is callous and cynical will thrill to a simple and humanist work which has its share of pathos but leaves you with a huge smile on your face.",,Anonymous,Romance

"""With pleasure...""","Writer-director Michel Hazanavicius' valentine to silent-era Hollywoodland, circa 1927, wherein bright young women who were fast-on-their-feet could find movie-work as extras, perhaps even meet a genuine film star along the way. Filmed in flat black-and-white at the ""Academy ratio"" of 1.33:1--with a modicum of sound and vocal effects, but with a smashing score--""The Artist"" is a genuine oddity for modern audiences, and may put some viewers off before the simple-but-sweet plot unfolds. Hazanavicius himself is a bit hesitant in getting things started, and an early scene with movie mogul John Goodman ordering aspiring starlet Bérénice Bejo off the lot is just a series of cuts back and forth without a grip on the narrative. Ludovic Bource's score (with an enormous tip of the hat to Bernard Herrmann) and Guillaume Schiffman's cinematography come to the rescue on several occasions, yet it is the performances of the dashing Jean Dujardin as George Valentin and the delightful Bejo as Peppy Miller which take the picture from an anomaly to a must-see (most especially for film-buffs). Embodying the never-say-die qualities of early Hollywood before the stock market crash, Dujardin pops off the screen like a cross between Fredric March and John Gilbert (with the voice of Charles Boyer!). It is nearly inconceivable that heretofore-unknowns, regardless of their talent, could pull off an honest-to-God silent movie (presented in the correct time and place) in the year 2011 and come up with results this lovely. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
What the heck. I didn't think it would be that good!,This film was a creation that isn't very chosen in this generation of film. How they use very little sound but are still are able make the the film portray different messages and sometimes even more messages than Talkies are phenomenal. The use of black and white makes it so much more authentic. I love how In specific areas they use sound to change it through the realms. Like in the dream sequence how they add sound to let the audience know about them thinking that. I finished the movie with a great satisfaction about how i had just been teleported back in time back to when the silent films were still around. At the end of the movie with the set scene it really shows an example of the progression from silent movies to talkies and is a perfect representation.

I was prompted to submit it after watching the end credits, then scrolling through them several times in search of a name and not finding it.The work of legendary music composer Bernard Herrmann, namely his love theme in Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo, is used prominently and unmistakably in a lengthy sequence in The Artist, but never credited to the late Mr. Herrmann. Acknowledgment likewise could not be found in the credits in the IMDb article, nor in the article under Bernard Herrmann's name (unless I missed it, but I don't think I did).I'm mystified by this slighting of Herrmann, whether it was originally an inadvertent oversight or a deliberate lifting of his artistic creation.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sophisticated Silence in a Sea of Technology,"With 3-D movies becoming so ubiquitous, the magic of cinema is wearing off as more and more humdrum flicks are poured at us from every box office orifice. Previously, CGI perfection and action sequence bombasts became formulaic and jaw-achingly dull for the average cinema goer. Thankfully a wonderful piece of film making has emerged in the form of The Artist. This is modern cinematography stripped bare of all whistles and bells: no 3-D, no CGI, no colour, barely any spoken dialogue, not even filmed in wide-screen. This, far from holding back any enjoyment of the theatregoer's experience, rekindles their long lost passion for cinema in its pure form. Indeed, the film is set in Hollywood(land) of the 1920s and 1930s, straddling the last major technological milestone in cinema since the digital revolution: the advent of talking pictures.Every player in The Artist is, necessarily in a film with almost no talking, visually arresting. Jean Dujardin cuts a suave dash as George Valentin, a huge silent star unwanted in a new era of vocal acting. With landscaped chin, lacquered hair and moustache clipped to an eyebrow pencil line, Dujardin's face and physicality fascinates throughout the film's 100 minutes. His acting is comic without being farcical; tragic without being hysterical. His co-star, budding blossom Peppy Miller, played by an engaging Bérénice Bejo, remains charming, demure and level-headed even when achieving the heights of talkie fame. She never forgets the role of Valentin in her success and watches, while trying to attenuate, his private demise as he witnesses her very public ascension to super-stardom. Bejo does this with an unbent sensitivity, her engaging mouth filling the screen with her smile or quivering with unfettered sadness at the man left behind.The supporting actors, although less physical, all have faces full of depth and character. Even a flash appearance from Malcolm McDowell as a jobbing extra delivers a comic vignette full of facial subtlety and wrinkled brilliance.The director, Michel Hazanavicius, cannons a well aimed, pared down shot straight to the emotional core, uncluttered with dialogue. The depth of the monochrome montage screams sophistication and the soundtrack swells and dips with the action on screen. Hazanavicius brilliantly portrays an enormous sense of fun and excitement from the start with clever editing and use of movement to compensate for the lack of Foley sound or speech, which is never a disadvantage in this film. This makes almost every moment edge-of-seat tense which does lose fervour in the middle, possibly in order for the audience to catch breath before being shot at again during the dramatic ending. The director himself has been quoted as saying that he has used the silent format not as an homage to bygone days but a storytelling tool. He does just that, making an amazingly refreshing new film and helping audiences of all ages to rediscover the raw and beautiful art of cinema at its purest.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Brilliant And Imaginative Film,"It is absolutely impossible to watch this film without being astonished by how well made it was by director Michel Hazanavicius. When you think about it, this was a risky project. In the second decade of the 21st century how many movie goers would actually be impressed by a silent movie? And I must admit that for the first few minutes I was tentative as I watched this, wanting to be impressed but holding back on my admiration, almost as if I wanted not to like it for some reason - but then succumbing, and having to admit that it really is a brilliant piece of movie making. And Hazanavicius deserves great credit for that. He took this very old and worn style of movie making and made a very new and fresh style of movie out of it. Once you're hooked - which you are very quickly, if not right away - you're hooked.This is a great story. If you know anything about movie history, you know how true to life it is as well. How many silent actors just couldn't cope with the advent of the talkie? How many careers went down in flames almost literally overnight as the talkies took centre stage? In ""The Artist"" it's the fictional George Valentin who's facing this sudden upheaval. Valentin is a huge silent star for Kinograph Pictures, when all of a sudden the studio simply tells him that it's over. Everything they have - all their resources - are now being put into talkies, and George - as big a silent star as he was - just doesn't fit. As arrogant as he is in many ways, you still feel so sorry for him. His life crumbles; his marriage crumbles; he loses everything (except the love of his dog, who stays loyally by his side through everything.) He struggles to keep going. When Kinograph cuts him loose he tries directing and producing his own silent movie. I think the saddest scene in the entire film is the premiere of this effort, as we see an almost empty theatre watching. He WAS a big star - but no one cares about him anymore. The movies have passed him by. It would be the equivalent of people suddenly losing interest - all interest almost overnight - in George Clooney or Brad Pitt. There's a rawness to that simple shot of the almost empty theatre; it truly cuts at the viewer. And you wonder how many silent actors had this (or something similar) happen to them as the 20's suddenly became the 30's - and no one cared about them anymore. French actor Jean Dujardin was wonderful in this role. He silently captured Valentin's pain and bewilderment and sadness as the life he knew totally collapsed around him.And, of course, there was the other side of the coin - represented by Peppy Martin (played by Berenice Bejo, who reminded me very much of a young Joan Collins.) Peppy was a fan of Valentin who managed to give the mega star a peck on the cheek, which photographers captured. That earned her some work as an extra and finally a scene with Valentin in one of his movies. Then - the talkies that destroyed Valentin were perfectly suited to Martin. She rocketed to superstardom even as Valentin collapsed into obscurity. From time to time their paths would cross, each time the different trajectories their lives and careers had taken becoming more noticeable. Bejo was also perfect in the role. She pulls off the hint of arrogance so natural for someone who's just become the hottest ticket in Hollywood, pointing out to reporters (as Valentin - unbeknownst to her listens) that people are tired of silent movie actors and all their ""mugging."" But she doesn't forget Valentin. She falls in love with him and rescues him, finally using her currency as Kinograph's new mega-star to insist on making a movie with him - or else. It can't be a talkie because Valentin doesn't do talkies. But it all leads up to an absolutely breath-taking dance routine between the two near the end of the movie.Brilliant. Just brilliant. The supporting cast were equally strong - from James Cromwell as Valentin's (and later Miller's) chauffeur to John Goodman as the head of Kinograph Pictures to even Uggie as Valentin's loyal little pooch. A great movie. I found it just a little hard to get into at first, but I think that was my fault more than the movie's as I struggled slightly with the whole largely unfamiliar silent medium.

A step back in time to put us all back on our feet....,"You got to hand it to the producers of this film. It was a gamble. Cinema is awash with 3D, special effects, big name stars and so on. Yet this film dusts off the old shoeboxes and brings back out the old.We have here a beautiful story with slapstick and mime as our silent stars in this snapshot of the 1920's to show us that film still very much has heart. The story is about the pride and reluctance of an old silent movie star to make the move to sound, and the tragic consequences to his career. On the other hand we see the rise of an actress who makes the move seamlessly, and as her star rises his wanes. She's besotted with him, and we become just as besotted but with the film and story.It's not a purely 1920's style film, there's lots of modern touches to the filming, but the film's a ode to a nostalgic past. It's a real treasure, and there is little to criticise about it without being churlish.All who will see this film will love it, especially the coolly funny sidekick dog who seems to steal the show.Give it a go, you'll really love this paean of love to cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A wildly enjoyable dose of cinematic magic,"Looking back at the ride that was this year's TIFF, I continue to find multiple errors in judgment in regards to what I could have seen versus what I did see. While I saw some extraordinary works, I find that I missed out on some truly incredible films. One such loss was The Artist, a decision I regretted immediately afterwards. I have heard nothing but praise since the film's debut at Cannes, and missing out when I had a remote chance was a terrible mistake. Luckily, I only had to wait a short while before getting another chance to see the film. And let me say right from the start, if you have the chance to see this film, do not think twice about missing out.George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is at the pinnacle of his career as a silent film star in late 1920s Hollywood. He is a megastar, beloved by his fans and loathed by his studio. On chance, he literally bumps into Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) and helps get her film career started over night. But as talkies start to take over and Miller's star rises, Valentin's starts to fall.It does not sound like a lot, but the simplicity of The Artist is where the film finds its charm and its wonder. Michel Hazanavicius, a relative unknown on this side of the Atlantic, has composed something truly extraordinary and ridiculously unique by 2011 standards. Who would have thought that creating a silent film would provide one of the most enjoyable experiences you will likely have at the movies all year?Of course, the most widely discussed item regarding the film is its use of silent film tropes and language. This is a silent film about a silent film star. Hazanavicius takes his cues from the pioneers of cinema, and wisely and effortlessly fuses together a film that would not look entirely out of place should it have been shown in the late 1920s or early 1930s. Where filmmakers have been using a widescreen canvas since the 1950s, Hazanavicius stubbornly sticks to the method of the time and displays everything he needs to in the 1.37:1 ratio. I imagine the film would look great in colour, but again, he stays true to the time and gives the film a glorious black and white image that shines brighter than any colour image ever could have. It gives a certain aura of authenticity to the picture that borders on being a gimmick not unlike 3D, but instead allows the film to become all that more special and unique.I must confess that I have watched very few silent films, a hurdle I envision many audience members may face when they see The Artist. But right from the opening frame, Hazanavicius makes it incredibly easy to put those fears to rest. Through the lovingly created and often nostalgia-inducing visuals, I found myself swept up and deeply engrossed in what was happening. While I could read the lips of some actors, I found that you never really needed to in order to get a full grasp of what was being conveyed. It may sound a bit pedantic of me to even consider discussing the semantics of my literal viewing experience, but it is something that demands to be noted. This film is not an easy sell, and its silent nature was initially a little startling of an idea for me. I do not know if Hazanavicius envisioned this problem from the offset, but I cannot imagine the film would be anywhere near as enjoyable had it had sound.While Hazanavicius does deserve a lot of praise for the sheer fact that he made this film, I find an equal if not greater amount of praise should be bestowed on Dujardin. Without letting us hear him say a word, he is simply marvelous from beginning to end. He is a true artist, brilliantly using his emotions at every turn. He hams it up when he needs to, and then goes deeply serious even quicker. He works twice as hard as any actor working today to really make his plight from silent film icon to a distraught and lost has-been truly believable. His actions, whether wholesome fun or downright depressing, are one-of-a- kind, and make us truly appreciate what icons like Charlie Chaplin, Lou Chaney and Harold Lloyd had to go through when they made their films. The expressions on Dujardin's face are simply astounding, and are more than enough reason to see the film, if there were not already more than enough.While Bejo's chemistry with Dujardin is the stuff of magic, I found that she was nowhere near as strong without him. She does some great work, but she never really comes out as a character that I truly believed in. I found that I was watching an actor act her way through a silent film, as opposed to Dujardin whose work simply transcends the medium. It makes for a slight disappointment, but thankfully she shares the screen with him enough times that it makes up for her fumbles on her own. Supporting turns from James Cromwell, Penelope Ann Miller and especially John Goodman are all above and beyond great, but again, simply pale in comparison to the artistry on display by Dujardin.It may be overly clear already, but rather simply put, The Artist is every bit as good as you have heard and probably even better. There are a few minor elements that simply do not add up, and a bit too much of a lull in the middle act, but this is a really wonderful film unlike any other this year. It is wildly enjoyable from beginning to end, and packs one of the best performances of the year that will leave you astounded. This is the kind of movie magic we see all too rarely. Do not let it pass you by.8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A must see for film buffs.,"The talk of Tinseltown right now is critical darling The Artist – a black and white silent film charting a black and white silent film star's struggle with the 'talkie' phase that hits Hollywood in 1929. It's a lovingly made picture by French writer-director Michel Hazanavicius and is unsurprisingly attracting huge Oscar buzz. However, putting aside the undeniable nostalgic value it holds for cineastes, is it actually entertaining? Well, yes, although not quite as much as the rumour mill would have you believe. The opening act is breathlessly exciting and the middle segment holds its own – a nightmare sequence which features some sound design is a highlight – but the laboriously repetitive final 30-40 minutes is a real slog. Jean Dujardin is fantastic in the title role that will surely see the flood gates open for his career and, like the audiences within the movie, I was awestruck by Bérénice Bejo's young starlet Peppy Miller. A must see for film buffs.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Is This Some Kind of A Joke?,"*** THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A SPOILER .... PLEASE READ AT YOUR DISCRETION ***I had seen a ton of cinema....beginning from the 1890s to present day to American, Italian, Japanese, French, German, British, Spanish, Latin American....etc, etc, etc...including lots and lots of silent pictures, therefore my film education is very well versed.Harvey Weinstein's executive money management campaign always works.....a little bit of proper marketing money does the trick. Personally, I think this film is an insult to the silent cinema, not a tribute. Anyone that had film education and saw at least the films of Charlie Chaplin will have a tendency to agree with me.The storyline, while it exists, carries very little substance.As far as acting goes: Dujardin does deserve a Best Actor Oscar...the film holds entirely on his acting. Directing was decent, although I do believe in order to make a film more interesting, the cinematography (or the way it is shot), could have been a lot more innovative, but since the filmmaker resorted to attempting to ""copy"" silent films, the entire cache of the picture got lost.**** WARNING - SPOILER BELOW ****But the story.....well here it goes: The film basically shows our protagonist who is on top of his acting game and is a ""superstar"", who then ""bumps into"", or rather she ""bumps into him""....an ""extra"" or an onlooker on set, whom he is charmed by....of course our film's leading lady, and our film director's wife in real life. Next thing we know, the silent era is over...the talking era begins and she becomes famous and he becomes nothing by becoming an alcoholic and a wimp.....literally a wimp. As soon as they start making ""talking"" pictures in our film, our protagonist can no longer work all of the sudden......but why? So a successful superstar turns into a wimp overnight.....that does not hold true for Hollywood.....please DO NOT underestimate the effect of star power.....please take a look at Mel Gibson's case and how long it took him to destroy himself, despite all of the ""charades"" he threw out publicly....and if you wanted to compare this film to the times of Charlie Chaplin would still be absurd....Chaplin never lost his ability to make films, even when ""The Great Dictator"" came out in 1940. That was not a silent film...it was a talking picture, which is one of Chaplin's most infamous pictures to date....check it out via Criterion Collection, yet Chaplin was a silent actor/filmmaker, but somehow still managed to make good, quality films that were talking pictures.Continuing... Then our leading lady comes and rescues our leading man, yet until the very end of the movie, it is really unclear (when you think about it) why he is the guy she should be rescuing. He does not ""give her a start"" in the movie industry...just because he adds a ""birthmark"" above her lip in the beginning (clever Cindy Crawford copycat citation there by the way....) does not mean she should be rescuing him.In the end...everyone's happy....the wimp is rescued by a ""strong"" lady who was always obsessed with him, she didn't actually love him, she loved ""the image"" of this successful man....in today's real life example for instance, it would be the same as a regular girl obsessed with George Clooney or Brad Pitt, but the story in this film wants to make us believe that she loves him, when she actually does not, but only in a movie can they attempt to get away with something like this.The bottom line? Best Picture? I don't think so....nice try though.Of course, for people that go to movies in a movie theater ""on a date"", when they are all ""into each other"" and are concentrating more on each other's lips and are boiling with emotions because they can't wait to finish the movie and go home and shag....add a little popcorn and soda and smiling characters on screen with somewhat existent story line in today's day and age will pass for today's average viewer, but for someone that understands what makes a real film work, I would say....pass....or see it only for Dujardin's acting.To close....I was not disappointed to be honest after I completed watching this because after getting used to so much garbage that comes out on screen during the course of the last 10- 15 years, finding a truly unique picture with a profound storyline these days is a surprise, therefore I did not expect much...but was curious why George Clooney lost the Oscar to Dujardin.3/10 ... Sorry Mr. Michel Hazanavicius, I meant no disrespect to you or to the film, but it is the job of the viewer to give each film a sober and honest review, otherwise what good are our opinions?",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
'The Artist' is a flawless masterpiece,"'The Artist' is a pretty daring film. It has appeared almost out of nowhere with a relatively unknown cast and director and has taken the world by storm... And did I mention it was a silent movie? It's already tipped to be the big winner at the Oscars after taking best picture at the Golden Globes earlier this year. But amidst all the hype, is it actually any good? And can it possibly be as good as everybody says? It turns out that it is. After a few viewings, the joy felt when watching 'The Artist' still remains. You find yourself sat watching the film with a big grin on your face that will last for most of it's running time.Jean Dujardin plays George Valentin, the biggest movie star of the silent period. The film follows his success in the mid-20's and how it turns on him and his life with the introduction of talking pictures in 1929. That is the film in a nutshell. But really, it is about the nature of fame, ambition and the inevitable moments of reality that face everybody in life. Jean Dujardin is perfect in his role. He is smooth, charming, reflective and incredibly human without even saying a word. Rather than dialogue, his facial expressions do the talking and it's very easy to see why he has an Oscar nomination for this role. Watch for moments of subtle humanity beneath his celebrity exterior when he is preparing for his roles or in a beautiful scene towards the end of the picture which I won't spoil for you. All the other performances are predictably superb with Berenice Bejo and John Goodman supplying the charm expected in old silent movies.Another reason the film is so captivating is in the attention to detail with all the technical aspects. Firstly, the film is presented in the aspect ratio all old movies were screened in, to not only capture the essence of the time but to put greater focus on the performances of the actors. It works. The audience will feel every bit of emotion in this film because of it. Additionally, the music is one of the best original soundtracks I've heard in a long time. The 80 plus minutes of music from this film is almost like a character itself; a scene can be viewed as serious or comedic just by the use of a few notes. A final factor worth noting is the cinematography, which makes this film look like it could have come from 1927. It is shot in beautiful black and white which gives the film an extra texture and depth that today's digitally shot coloured films cannot capture.It is possible to write for days about 'The Artist' but all that needs to be said is how moving, beautiful, joyful and brilliant it is. For a film to come out as daring as 'The Artist' in 2012 and be only half decent is a good result. However, it does much more than that. It captures the essence of cinema itself with it's ability to entertain, surprise and engage audiences all over the world, myself included.A Classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The sweet sound of silence,"Kudos to director Michel Hazanavicius. He had the audacious idea to make a black-and-white silent film more than eighty years after movies had begun to talk. And then he executed that idea brilliantly. The film had the potential to be a cheap, if interesting gimmick. It proved to be so much more than that. It proved to be a great film. The fact it was so unique only added to its allure. Helped by a terrific cast Hazanavicius produced true movie magic.There are so many ingenious things about The Artist but the smartest thing the film has going for it is its subject matter. It's a silent film about silent films. And that opens up so many delicious possibilities. The film's star, Jean Dujardin in a truly mesmerizing performance, is playing silent film star George Valentin. Valentin is on top of his game and on top of the world. The biggest star of his era, adored by legions of fans. One of his biggest fans is a young woman, Peppy Miller, who audaciously sneaks in a kiss with him outside the premiere of Valentin's latest smash hit. Little do either of them know then that they are two ships passing in the night. The silent movie era is about to end. George Valentin is on the way to ruin. Peppy Miller is on the way to stardom.Peppy starts out as an anonymous extra on one of Valentin's films. From there her star slowly rises. Meanwhile his star burns out completely. The world forgets George Valentin. But Peppy does not. She remembers that man she once so admired. They had but a brief connection but it meant the world to a young woman just getting her start in the business. If anyone can save George Valentin it is Peppy. With a little help from George's wonderfully cute four-legged friend Jack the dog.All of this is told so wonderfully and, to modern eyes and ears, so uniquely. Producing this particular story as a silent film was simply ingenious. It's both a love letter to old-time Hollywood and a thoroughly modern film. The film has so many nods to that long-gone era but still works so well for a modern audience. When characters in this film dismiss silent stars as just mugging for the camera it reinforces the point that this film's stars are not doing that. Yes, it's a silent film but unlike any we have ever seen before. And yet with enough of those old silent movie touches to make it a worthy homage. A very delicate balance was required and Hazanavicius created that balance perfectly. Of course it never could have worked without the right cast. What a challenge these performers had, doing something quite unlike anything they had done before. And they all nailed it. Dujardin was simply amazing. Bérénice Bejo, playing Peppy, matched him stride for stride. What a delightful pair they prove to be. James Cromwell gives such a heartfelt performance as Valentin's loyal chauffeur. And as head of Valentin's film studio John Goodman manages to be a loud presence even in complete silence, he's simply perfect for his role. Helped along all the way by a wonderful old-time sounding silent movie score the film gives you comedy, drama, romance. And often does it in ways only a silent movie can, Hazanavicius taking full advantage of his medium. Intertitles are used sparingly but to great effect, most notably in the film's most dramatic moment which so cleverly becomes the film's funniest moment. That great silent movie moment serves as a reminder of what films can be with a little imagination. Hazanavicius had the imagination. And he had the talent to bring his vision to life. It all adds up to a wonderfully unique, incredibly entertaining and supremely charming film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
like reading a wonderfully written drama and/or romance,"yes! i did feel like reading a well written love story with black inked words on white papers. when you read a novel, it's soundless and silent, all you have is an inner sound, inner voice of your own. when a story well crafted with nice storyline, scenario, plot and well edited, the inner sound of your silent voice will become so clear to be heard by you. by watching this black and white almost voiceless movie that only come with sound track background music, i was moved deeply, and heartfelt touched just like reading a good romantic novel. the male actor is one of the best french male actors who i have enjoyed to watch him playing different roles in the french movies. choosing him to play this role is one of the best casting jobs that movie industries really showed how the casting agency indeed is very important to the success of a movie. this movie also reminded me that george valentin actually open the door for the later Broadway shows and musical movies and also created big opportunity for those Hollywood dancing stars. but none of the later male actors could surpass his achievement. people would also like to compare him with charlie chaplin, but i think it's a wrong comparison, just like orange and apple, the looks and the tastes were absolutely different. i just couldn't believe that i have completely been intoxicated by this silent movie. it's a quite unique and delightful experience.i wish this movie could win many Oscar awards.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Yes, it really is a silent film","The Artist (2011) was written and directed by Michel Hazanavicius.It's awkward to give a lukewarm review to a film that's received multiple Oscars, and carries a impressive IMDb rating of 8.4. Nevertheless, I was disappointed by this movie.It was a stroke of genius to conceive of making a silent film in the 21st Century. All credit to director Hazanavicius for that. However, the manner in which the concept was carried out left me somewhat bored and disappointed.The Artist touches on a situation that we've seen before--the trajectories of a young woman and an older man cross as she is going up and he is going down. (Think of ""A Star is Born."") So, that's a somewhat tired concept. Hiding it behind the ""great silent star, but couldn't make the transition to talkies"" doesn't cover up the fact that the plot is an old one.Also, the director has chosen to make the film not just silent, but in the less-than-subtle style of many silent films. It's purposely obvious and melodramatic. I respect the thinking behind the decision, but I don't enjoy watching obvious, melodramatic movies--silent or with spoken dialog.Finally, the film is 10 or 15 minutes too long in my opinion. Some judicious editing might have improved it.The two stars, Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo are very good. Ms. Bejo is very beautiful by 21st Century standards, but manages to also look beautiful in a way that would have worked 80 years earlier. It's difficult to comment on the acting, because the actors are in a new movie where they have to act like actors in an old movie. That's hard to manage, and hard to evaluate.All in all, this is a movie worth seeing because it's unique. Just don't go to it expecting more than the film can provide. We saw it on a large screen, in the restored Star Theatre in Dansville, NY. The Star was built in 1921, and did, indeed screen silent movies. The theater ambiance helped me enjoy the film. However, The Artist will work well in a cineplex or on the small screen.Addendum in 2013: Figure skating fans already know that The Artist figured prominently in the 2013 World Figure Skating Championship held in March in London, Ontario. Denis Ten, a skater who represents Kazakhstan, won the silver medal when he used the music from this film in both his short and long programs. The brilliant choreographer Lori Nichol created a situation where the short program represented the beginning of the movie, and the long program represented the middle and the end. You would think that someone before Nichol would have thought to create a continual story line between the short and long programs, but no one had ever done this before.Of course, in the final analysis, it was Ten's superb skating that brought him the silver medal. (I didn't much like the movie, but the use of the music for figure skating really worked!) Red-125",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The future of filmmaking? 72.5%,"I'm guessing that the world has been screaming out for silent, black and white movies this year in the wake of slow and plodding cinema releases recently like ""Hugo"" and ""Tinker, tailor, soldier, spy"".This movie deals with the historical transition from silent movies to ""talkies"", in the late 1920s, and the effects that this has on an established star of the silent movie era (George Valentin, played by Jean Dujardin).Even though this movie is in black and white and is, for the most part, silent, it's entertaining enough, in its own way. Dujardin must be a good actor, because in one scene, in front of a mirror with an attractive woman, he is actually looking at the woman's reflection and not himself in the mirror...the narcissistic nature of the acting profession means that that sight is as rare as hen's teeth. He is also amusing in the moments where he readies himself to be filmed for a scene. The cast do tend to recreate the acting styles of the silent era and one could say, perhaps, that Dujardin's eyebrows are more expressive than Laurence Olivier's ever were...that's a joke...not in the sense that Olivier's eyebrows were peerless...never mind...Dujardin's face is quite ye olde expressive, even if his eyebrows may not be...which I don't remember in any case!I did enjoy the scene where rising star Peppy Miller (played by Bérénice Bejo) has a moment with Valentin's coat. Nice.The film does lightly touch on some significant moments of the era, like the Other event of 1929.Some people just seem born for this era of filmmaking...can you imagine how big a star Fran Drescher could have been at that time?Anyway, this movie has some good physical comedy and ""lines"". Many critics are mentioning the dog as being a star of this movie.Did manage to predict things in this movie...e.g. the kind of thing to happen when the feather dropped...what was in that locked box in Valentin's house.If there is actual sound recording of the cast of this movie acting, that might be fun as a DVD extra for this movie...I would definitely give that a burl!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Finally a movie that really deserved the Oscar !,"Finally the Oscar goes to a good movie. Kind of Ironic it is French and silent. But it is very touching. First of all, it has something that the recent movies of Hollywood lack: a good story that is well told. Not only did they have a good plot, excellent cast, a ""four legged actor"", but they also manage to tell the story in a comprehensive way with the right amount of details to depict the life ( from glory to downfall and then back to an emerging career again ) of the main character. It has also brought fun back to the big screen, a romantic story without being too dramatic and yet able to capture the atmosphere of that changing time. It is a truly remarkable production, something we did not see for a long time in the big screen. I just can thank all of those who got involved in this project and truly believe that the seventh art is beyond mere special effects ( which are important, of course, but should not be considered as the sole reason of making a movie, as it has been lately ) – Thank God it is NOT in 3D !! - I know the movie industry is going through changes nowadays. Perhaps the answer is in the past, as it concerns which direction it should take.. Anyways, it's a great movie and the art is back to the Theaters !!!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Mostly Celebrating Hollywood's ""Golden Age""","Pros: Obviously, a 1920's-style silent film is going to depend even more upon its acting than your average modern movie, as it doesn't have the benefits of advanced visual effects, sound effects, Technicolor, or, you know, dialogue to flesh out a story. That being said, this movie did a great job of casting the leads with actors who could fairly effortlessly convey emotions and thoughts merely through their facial expressions, body language, and general pantomiming. Jean Dujardin especially had a very expressive face, and the director hit a home run in casting his dog, which was, of course, adorable.My favorite part of the movie was probably the dream sequence, which pretty deftly sums up George's mental and emotional state. That being said, I also enjoyed viewing the film with an eye for any anachronisms within it. They were clearly trying to mimic a 1920's production, but there were some things that they did in the movie that would not have been possible in a silent film from that era. There is a fun list on IMDb of actual anachronisms in the movie, which people- with-way-too-much-time-on-their-hands have noticed and detailed. God bless IMDb.Cons: I know I said the acting was strong enough to carry the film in spite of the other missing elements that we have all taken for granted with modern movie making, but if I'm going to be honest... I like those other elements. A lot. Specifically the spoken dialogue part. It allows for so much more depth in a movie, and a significantly higher entertainment factor. Also, in order to properly convey emotions and thoughts in a voiceless movie, actors are forced to be pretty campy and mug at the camera a lot. I've just never been real big on that kind of overacting, which was prominent in earlier movies, also due in part to the legacy of stage acting in film.Overall: I appreciate the attempt to rekindle an older style of storytelling, but I'm pretty confident that there was a good reason for the advancements in movie-making technologies, and I'm generally appreciative of the effects of science here. Now, I'm aware that the mere presence of these technologies does not mean that every movie these days (or even the majority) contains those extra layers, but luckily they're still available. While I don't regret having seen this movie, I wasn't particularly enthralled during the viewing, and I have no overwhelming interest in seeing it again. In the end, I couldn't kick the feeling that it was just one giant exercise in glad-handing the glorious history of Hollywood, so I glad-handed it a 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Well done, but what's the point?  Watch Chaplin instead.","This was a very well done movie visually, but the story was simplistic and predictable, and if you're going to try and pull off a silent, black & white movie in 2011, then it had better different from all the other b/w movies that have been made before it. What makes this movie special was that it was made in today's age of in-your-face big special effects and CGI bells and whistles, but in the end, it doesn't stand out as one of the great silent movies ever made. If you haven't seen a silent b/w movie before then don't waste your time on this, see the master -- see Chaplin. Chaplin is much more clever -- he offers multiple story lines and brilliant, original comedy; amazingly fresh after all this time.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Don't hesitate because it's B&W or silent. It's also a very lovely film!,"So it's black & white and silent. Silent?!? Yes. It has music to accentuate the scenes, and the sparse dialog that is essential is shown in text frames between the shots. Just like old times! It made me hesitate for months before I got to watching it. That was a mistake!The Artist is certainly different, and it takes a few minutes to get used to, but with 'losing' sound it hasn't lost any of its potential to grab the audience and pull it into a true cinematic story from the old days. Rather, while the story is quite simple the lack of dialogue forces you to actively 'see' what's going on, which engages the audience (us!) much more, and much more intimately. You don't need to be a die- hard 1920s fan to be entertained by this film!The film itself is a simple love-story between a proud actor (obviously modeled after Douglas Fairbanks, I thought) who falls hard when Hollywood switches from silent to 'talkies', and the upcoming actress he discovered who shines in the new, talking, cinema.So if you hesitate because it's a silent B&W (or because you, rightfully, think 5 Oscars out of 10 nominations was a bit of an overreaction): don't, you won't regret seeing it!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The artist review,"Hello, Silent films are obviously by far a thing of the past and with the dawn of new 21st century technologies, like 3-d and imax, you would think the format would never creep back onto the silver screen again. Until now. The artist has shovelled past the half hearted 3-d action and animation flicks that have flooded the autumn/winter box office and is now the 'talk of the town'. 'For how could a black and white silent film be any better than a film in colour and shot in SPECTACULAR 3-D!!!' Easily! And here's why... Film making today isn't what is used to be, today, production teams are littered with high tech equipment (like 3-D camera's!) That for some reason, (needed or not) they think is a necessity in the film. But what's to say we can't go back to old roots like the artist has done? Simply because companies don't want to lose money, that's why the artist is such a big risk. But the risk has defiantly paid off as new films made with new technology are being overlooked as this new film with old technology is stealing the limelight and its such a nice sight to see. As of course the artist is one of the best films I've seen for a while. Its such a breath of fresh air to see such a film which along with a heart warming story line delivers great acting performances around the board especially from Jean Dujardin (and of course Uggie the dog!) But the aspect I really loved about this film was the screen play and the overall style in which this film was shot. I especially loved the opening sequence in which ( however corny it may sound) I really felt as if I was actually in a theatre of the time with the band playing live in front of me. By seeing this scene at the start where 'George Valentin' is happy and charismatic, it means that we can really relate to the character throughout the film going with him though his highs and lows . Overall I think this film was beautiful, a real unlikely masterpiece for a film of the 21st century. One that will always stand the test of time and one that should defiantly win the awards for best film and of course to Michel Hazanavicius for best director. They most certainly do not make them like they used to!****Calum.R",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Marvelous and completely enchanting!,"The Artist has been an awards favorite for some time. It's a silent film in the way of 1920's cinema, so what's there not to like about it? It's a very simple film, but all the more glorious because of it.The film is essentially about a silent film star who starts fading into oblivion when the ""talkies"" start taking over. On the other end, he forms a friendship with an upbeat and cheerful Hollywood-hopeful, who starts becoming the new big thing. Even though the film has been critically praised, I've heard some criticisms about this film. I've heard some critics call it too light, too simple to be anything incredible or meaningful. Some even call this a gimmick in some sort. I had some reservations because of that, but I couldn't disagree more. The film may have a simple plot with a simple arc, but it's directed with incredible energy and talent. I never once looked away, and no other film this year has made me as happy or had me smiling as much as this. It's not just because of how happy it is, but it's such an amazing technical achievement. The art direction is fantastic, and the cinematography even experimental at times. The music is amazing, and it had me grasped in it's ever-changing tone and melody.The entire supporting cast is great, but it's the two lead characters who hold our attention. Bejo is charming and quite loving, but the real star here is Jean Dujardin. He commands the screen with his changing facial expressions and the pitch in which he performs. I haven't seen someone as charismatic in a very long time, and he has delivered what is the best male performance of the year.Believe the hype. I sort of expect some sort of inevitable backlash by some people for a film like this winning major awards, but it is quite simply, one of the best of the year.

Truly Artistic! - Brilliant & Courageous...,"Brilliant and courageous!! Courageous - because in this 21st Century with CGI effects, color, 3-D and wide screen available, who would attempt to make a black-and-white silent movie? It's mainly the result of the amazing direction, terrific acting, well-synchronized background score and Jean Dujardin's irresistible smile. And hats off to the dog!It takes you to the silent-movie era where the effect and feel of the movie wholly depended on the expressive actors and the music (given by the live orchestra, in the theatre itself). Well, this is the first silent movie I've seen and I truly loved it! It has humour, drama, romance, everything... Makes you wonder, how you sat through the whole movie without hearing a single dialogue.The movie basically shows the transition from silent movie to talkies era - something similar to ""Singin' in the Rain""... ""Singin' in the Rain"" was basically a musical with colour, sound, dance and everything... I'm not comparing this movie to that. ""Singin' in the Rain"" will remain a timeless musical classic. But 'The Artist' has good character depth and many other unique characteristics.This movie is for people like me who love Cinema!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A very good film...but,"This is one of those films which deserves a ""10"" for originality, execution, acting, and overall brilliant filmmaking. Many reviewers here rated it that way. It is no doubt a great concept – a silent film about the silent film era whose mood and tone perfectly emulate the genre of the time!The story line is more allegorical than real. There are some allegories that can pack a punch, hit you on an emotional level. For me, this film is not one of them. Unfortunately the very qualities that give the film its uniqueness also interfered with my ability to become engaged. Too self consciously original, perhaps. It screamed out, ""Look at me, look how clever I am!"" Even as I watched and respected the film, I found myself drifting. To its credit, I imagine months or even years from now I will remember this film while totally forgetting other more engaging films that kept me riveted from beginning to end. Nevertheless, unless a film keeps one wondering, anticipating, caring – in short, feeling – I don't believe it deserves highest honors. It is more memorable as a curiosity than as a work of art. Certainly a creative and original concept is to be admired. But a truly great film must also reach out, give you an experience, change you.""The Artist"" is a very good film, not to be missed. It is not a great film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A Wonderful comedy, A romantic love letter, a cinematic treat...","While this film isn't particularly deep, it isn't mere empty style . Re-watching the film the other day I was struck by how George being replaced in his industry due to technology is actually a fairly universal experience. Sure the film is self-consciously modeled on Hollywood history but it is applicable to many other things. Anyway, the story of the aging silent film actor falling in love with up and coming talkie actress feels like a classic Hollywood myth and the story is wonderfully engaging. That the film is very funny, what with the cute doggo and board humor.Now it is true that the film has a ton of style. It makes many allusions to classic films-Grand Hotel, Citizen Kane, Vertigo to name a few-and it is artificially silent film making (for the most part), not widescreen and in black/white. People who love classic Hollywood will find a lot great in jokes here. It is also a fun game to try to guess what films the director is thinking of. Films about films can be a little twee put here this feature just makes the film utterly enjoyable.The film really does feel like an unearthed silent film from the (late) 20's. It's amazing on all technical aspects in this regard. Hazanavicius really knows how direct action to give information visually. (Having seen a few of his other films, he really is chameleon-like in his ability to invoke period) There is just so many places were the film is effortlessly cinematic; where the story is all about behavior, actions and movement.Wonderful Best Picture.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Are you kidding me?,"Hi, This is so absurd, making a movie that looks like being invented before the World War 2 doesn't make that movie a masterpiece.....If this movie have been released in 1930 it would have been a disaster.

Movie remakes like Evil One, Total Recall and Freddy was never required, yet they polluted the big screen pure and simple. But to have the audacity to pull back from the grave big picture techniques outdated without giving the audience further twists and original ideas is plain stupid.Yet this movie is elevated as one of the best movie experience ever feel????Hey prominent Hollywood producers, forget the noise, forget the color, forget the high resolution, certainly forget the 3D (wait maybe if I do a silent movie in black and white with 3D effect, I might win an Oscar!!!), do something ancestral colorless, oh, and resuscitated this daguerreotype and your favorite nearest museum, then you could create a masterpiece!!!!Si Cadaver",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
I Must Be Missing Something,"This must be a case of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". Someone thought this was great movie making, so everyone falls in line? This was nothing more than novelty. First, the story cute but nothing that would ""WOW"" me. ""Avatar"" was blasted for stealing its story from previous screenplays, but not this movie. I saw ""Singin' In The Rain"" (which was much more entertaining) and ""A Star Is Born"" blatantly in this story. Nothing original here. The acting was adequate but Academy Award worthy? My favorite performance was Uggie. Finally, big disappointment in basic movie technology. Video standard screen size? I go to the movie theater to see widescreen. Audio only coming from the front; what happened to surround sound? (If you state that the intent of the movie was to see it as a silent movie then why was it filmed digitally.) I should have waited for the DVD. I guess with all the hype my expectations were much too high, but I have seen far superior silent movies on TCM.

The ARTIST and the Golden Age of Tinseltown,"The Artist is a little gem of a silent film that was shot in black and white. This clever throwback to old Hollywood was the work of a French production team with American support and headed by director Michel Hazanavicius. Not since Mel Brooks had the clout and audacity to make his Silent Movie in 1976 had a silent film been shot on a grand scale. Brooks had the advantage of blockbuster name recognition from his previous films and enlisting A list stars to do his film in color no less. The Artist has no superstars, and instead the film relies on telling a compassionate story that is surprisingly accessible to modern audiences.In 1927 Hollywood, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a matinée idol whose films are popular with the masses. At one Hollywood premier, he shows off his loyal dog (Uggie), and at the red carpet, he bumps into a fan, Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), who has dreams of making it in movies. George's home life is not so happy as his eccentric wife (Penelope Ann Miller) disapproves of his carefree antics. Meanwhile, Peppy auditions for and wins a bit part in a chorus line and by chance meets Valentin again who hires her for his film despite the grumblings of the studio boss (a wonderful John Goodman). During a dance club scene, the two have instant chemistry and a romance is blossoming even as Valentin has doubts and feeling guilty as a married man. When the studio begins to embrace the sound era, he refuses to change with the times and finds sinking box office grosses and waning popularity while Peppy is a fast rising star. When the stock market crashes, Valentin is ruined financially and, his career in a heap, all hope is seemingly lost until a shining beacon comes to his aid with a novel plan.This is a silent film that caught everyone by surprise with its deceptively simple plot of romance, drama, comedy, and pathos. If that sounds like a Charlie Chaplin film, the kind of film they don't make anymore, it's because they haven't for over eighty years! People who respond to this film owe it to themselves to rediscover the classic silent films like Chaplin's City Lights and The General by Buster Keaton. The Artist is an ideal introduction to these and other masterworks.The film borrows liberally from past cinema, and its main plot is right out of A Star Is Born. When Valentin is seated at the dinner table with his judgmental wife, it begs comparisons to the famous transitions at the dinner table in Citizen Kane. The scenes where the studio is switching to sound pictures is reminiscent of the same dilemma in Singin in the Rain. The dog, who steals the film, is terrific as comic relief and figures in a scene where he attempts to rescue his master from a burning building-Rin Tin Tin anyone?Although the musical score by Ludovic Bource is quite good particularly in the playful main theme,it uses several minutes of a love theme from Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo for a climactic sequence. It works just fine, but purists who recognize Bernard Herrmann's haunting score may find it a tad annoying. There are also a couple brief instances when actual sound is employed to great effect.There are memorable moments including a loyal chauffeur (James Cromwell) who refuses to leave Valentin during his decline. There is a sentimental scene where Valentin has sold all his belongings and stands wistfully at a pawn shop, his refection superimposed with a tuxedo on display. And this may be one of the only times you see someone flip the bird in a silent film!Sure, some of the scenes are filled with old fashioned movie clichés, but what is noticeable throughout the film is an energy and enthusiasm that becomes infectious even after the novelty of watching a soundless film wears off. And consider this-an engaging silent film with no nudity or violence that is riding a wave of sentiment and love all the way to the Oscars.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
a wonderful throwback to a unique era in cinema,"Out with the old...in with the new...make way for the young...in the late 1920s silent film era this is slowly becoming the philosophy in Hollywood, much to the chagrin of narcissistic silent film star George Valentin, who refuses to accept the changing times and discourages the ""talkies"" emergence in cinema, but a chance encounter with a fetching young woman completely alters the course of his personal life and once thriving movie career. Without the use of audible dialogue the actors must convey their performances through subtle gestures, facial expressions, and body language, a feat which they accomplish with flying colors; this can be viewed as both a crowd-pleasing tribute to the magic of a defunct era in filmmaking, as well as a study of two immensely talented individuals and how they deal with the differing trajectories of their respective careers. Charming, funny, and riveting with a fantastic score, and a standout ""performance"" by Dujardin's endearing canine companion. ***",,Anonymous,Romance
The Artist (2011) : A review,"Reviewing ""The Artist (2011)"" is a tribute to the filmgoer. It's a film about films. It's a film about silent films.The story is set in Hollywood, 1927. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a silent movie superstar. The advent of the talkies will sound the death knell for his career and will eventually set his oblivion. For young extra Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) it seems he sky's the limit, major movie stardom awaits for her. This film on film tells about their interlinked destinies.This film won many of the major awards globally. Cannes film festival, Golden globes and Academy awards were given to these film. In france it was nominated to ten 'Cesar Awards'. ""The Artist"" has received the highest number of awards than any other french film in history.Why I love ""The Artist"" is it's simplicity, humour and energy. In 2011 I was in a fresh state of mind. I was not exposed to many films. I watched ""Singing in the rain (1952)"". But this is different.

Um, duh? Get a job? Make an adjustment? Apparently the worst possible fate in the world is to not be able to work as a movie star.It's a shame because the main characters are likable.

Not all the hype is true.,"Unless you've been living in hole, you'll be very aware of The Artist. The principal issues that have been widely reported are as follows: It is a black and white silent French film about the silent Hollywood era, a fading star and a rising starlet, there's a cute dog, it is winning just about every award going and is hysterical, absolutely amazing and the must-see movie of the year.Not all of that is true, however. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is Hollywoodland's biggest heartthrob but the arrival of the talkies ends his career as the starlet he helped launch, Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) rises to prominence. He sulks and wallows in his self-pity, the big bad studio boss (John Goodman) sacks him and it becomes entirely predictable there on. Oh, and the dog has two tricks that it repeats ad nauseam.Yes, it is black and white. Yes, it is largely silent other than the music, a few moments of audio brilliance and the two French students who talked incessantly behind me. Yes, there were a few forced laughs when the Jack Russell did its thing but it felt as though the minority who did laugh felt as though they were supposed to. Yes, it is winning the majority of the awards, it swept the BAFTAs and is likely to do the same at the Oscars.But, no, it is not brilliant. I don't think it will even rank inside the top ten at the end of the year, bearing in mind we're only in February and it is already ranked lower than Tabloid, Shame, The Woman in Black and The Descendants in my chart. In 1997 Titanic swept the Oscars, taking eleven in total. It wasn't long before reason overtook hype and the world realized LA Confidential and Mrs Brown had been robbed. I'll give it two years before the world realizes the same is true this year of The Descendants and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy.There are some lovely touches, particularly when sound is introduced, and the stylized look of the film is perfectly crafted. There are some fine actors present, performing in a melodramatic style of the period, and the smiles and music make it thoroughly engaging but nice legs, a good dance and a wink at the camera do not a great film make.The Artist is good, nice, sweet, light and entertaining but that counts for little when the hype promises excellence, greatness and ground-breaking perfection.And if you want truly entertaining non-humans, The Muppets is a far better option.Another film review from The Squiss.

"A simple, charming film that deserves the praise it gets","I would love to see a transcript of the pitch meeting for The Artist. A silent film, you say? Why? We have digital cameras and CGI and 3D and this and that nowadays. Why would you want to downgrade the technology?The thing is, people were entertained by silent films in the 1920s. Children today are still entertained by films from the early era of colour like The Wizard of Oz and Snow White. Star Wars is forty years old and still entertaining. It's A Wonderful Life remains a Christmas staple.Good stories are good stories irrespective of the technology used. Good film-making will always be god film-making. We rightly praise the special effects-heavy blockbusters like Star Wars for being visual spectacles, but silent films like Metropolis have effects and visuals that hold up today: George Lucas was not alone in borrowing plenty of imagery from Fritz Lang's masterpiece.So now The Artist. A modern silent film. It's unashamedly a homage to film history. While it shuns dialogue, it has been updated for modern tastes with panning camera shots and tracking shots (things rare in true classic silent films), relatively short scenes and plenty of title cards. It's edited largely like a modern film to keep the pacing and conventions that we are used to.The plot is simple: a egotistical silent film star falls on hard times as the talkies become popular while a young actress rises in fame. If that sounds like Singing in the Rain then you're right: it is. There's nothing to 'get' about The Artist. It's a simple, undemanding plot. It's not pretentious.There's nothing really not to like here. The acting is superb, featuring the talents of John Goodman, Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo, among others. The casting is perfect: you can fully believe that these are people fresh from the 1920s. The film is beautifully directed and nicely paced. The soundtrack is wonderful: a nice combination of a original score by Ludovic Bource and period pieces. The set design demonstrates a real attention to detail (and while a few anachronisms a present, unless you're an expert or overly pedantic you won't notice).Silent films are pure pieces of film-making. 'Film' ultimately consists of a string of still photographs produced by the interaction between light and chemicals contained on, y'know, camera film. This is what it is: moving images - movies. The audio came later. Being able to appreciate silent cinema is being able to appreciate the most pure form of film.It's widely noted that nowadays people's concentration spans are shorter. Classic silent films are often extremely long with long drawn-out shots where relatively little happens, something modern films would edit out or replace with a throwaway line in a few seconds. The Artist does dispense with a lot of this to cater to modern tastes, but even so, a lot of modern viewers will be urging the film to get a move on.To those people I say: calm down and take the opportunity to fully watch the film. Look at the actors' gestures and expressions, note what's going on in the background and just enjoy the music accompanying the visuals. You can't do this in most modern films - they just move too quickly. People enjoyed these films a hundred years ago and there's no reason we can't enjoy them now.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Heartfelt History with an Eternally Pertinent Theme,"An excellent, caring, deeply nostalgic look at the changing of the guard in 1930s Hollywood. Though the primary narrative focuses on the shift from silent film to full-blown ""talkies,"" The Artist serves as metaphor for so much more. Truly, every generation endures this brand of major tidal shift, with the forward-thinkers rewarded for their daring while those set in their ways are swiftly discarded and forgotten. Presented as a silent film itself, the production delights in toying with its audience, no sooner establishing its own rules before testing and bending them. While the cue cards and light accompanying score are, initially, something of a distraction, as the film moves along it becomes remarkable just how restrained and appropriate they both become. Perhaps my greatest surprise wasn't that nothing was said, but that nothing needed to be. Costars Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo, both duly recognized by the academy for their roles, spill chapters with their bodies, expertly overcoming the potential handicap of the format and running full-bore with the premise. They sparkle, both together and apart, in two very different roles, and are essential players in nudging the finished product from ""good idea"" to ""borderline classic.""",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Good,"This was a very good movie. I think a lot of the success this movie had was due to the fact that it was done as a silent film which got it a lot of hype, most films aren't black and white any more obviously and nobody does silent much so when it did these things it got a lot of attention, obviously especially in Hollywood because they go nuts for any movie that's about Hollywood and movie making in general. It's amusing to me that the movie was all about Hollywood and set in Hollywood but made by the French. Also this movie is not a silent film! A movie is either silent or has sound and this movie was not silent for the entire film, the last scene has sound and dialogue. I know that is picky but a film can't have any sound at all in my mind if it is a silent film. I also wish there were more scenes with John Goodman and that he got more attention for his supporting role. The actor deserved the Oscar win, the lead actress was great too, and the film deserved winning for best picture, but it was also a weaker year.

A Triumph,"I have fallen in love with this film. It is touching, sad, yet witty and enigmatic. It is quirky. In short, it is one of the best films I have seen. The last time I said such a thing, it was about Inception, which is in itself a truly wonderful film, but if I tell you that this film beats it into the ground, then you are halfway there to understanding how brilliant a piece of cinema this is.From seemingly nowhere come a triumphant lead, Jean Dujardin, and a truly astonishing talent in Berenice Bejo. They play their characters with such belief, such conviction, and such sensitivity that it is simply a pleasure to watch. In fact, the whole cast produce something very special and I doubt if they will ever make such a film again.The camera-work was exceptional, and deserving of the BAFTA it won last night. Indeed, all the BAFTAs the cast and crew won yesterday were truly deserved, and they probably should have got more besides. Even the dog should have been rewarded for some truly heroic work! In what is essentially homage to something no-one really remembers, Hazanavicius creates a world which we can see, enjoy, even take part in, and there is no cheesy symbolism or anything like that, it is all very subtle. Not so subtle that only a select few will get them, but in a way that makes you impressed that you noticed.The black and white was illuminating, and at times was so bright it almost felt like colour. All of the awards and praise it has received has deserved. The film is also clever, and the dialogue, which you would rightly expect to be minimal, is only transcribed when absolutely necessary, which is surprisingly not often. The beauty of the film is that we know what everybody is saying, we know what they are feeling, which is also the true beauty of the silent film.I can honestly say that there was only one thing that I did not like about the film, and I will not spoil it by telling what it might be, but I will say that stylistically, it is perfect for the moment, and merely a technique that I personally do not like. That said, overall, this film exceeded all expectation. This is a film which is both beautiful and funny. And I applaud it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dustcovers,"I am spending a lot of recent time with my list of essential films, reviewing and enhancing it. Several readers have suggested this film for that list.It has several characteristics that appeal. It is a movie about movies. It is made with movie-making explicit: the thing is black and white, silent, uses lenses and positions from the era (mostly). That era was before Hitchcock and Welles, so the camera has no curiosity. The sets include some that while they depict 'real' life, are clearly stage sets. The acting early in the film, in both the film itself and films within are exaggerated. This and some other effects add up to highly selfaware presentation. Because this is done competently, it becomes attractive to me.Using French actors to portray remote Americans is rather brilliant. That they both are unattractive people who present attractively matters as well.More. Within this context, some rather powerful dramatic effects are woven, the most impressive being a foreboding dream that imposes the inner world on the outer. The effect is repeated later, more weakly. But thrown in are some gratuitous and cheap tricks. His shadow walks away at one point. Miniature characters from one of his movies haunt him while drunk at a bar. They cross well over the silly line.The frame is intended to overlap that of 'Singin in the Rain' and it really would have helped if they had made this more explicit in the middle, so that at the end we would have known where we came from.But doggoneit, with all the power this filmmaker turned on, he went nowhere with it. We do have an acceptable enough love story, but it gives us nothing of love. In fact it is hard to know what is going on between these two, and rather than ambiguity we are forced into disbelief. The love of the chauffeur was more genuine — and strange since it comes from the stereotypical lawyer type.This is worth watching because the machinery is powerful, but the machine doesn't help us do anything with our lives. It should because it could.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Romance
The Artist,"i wasn't extremely pleased with this film. it's a very good tribute to silent cinema. the performances are very strong by the whole cast (the leads were a perfect match for each other), including the dog. it's an original and audacious idea to make a silent, black and white film, with the 1.33 format, in this day and age. that's something to admire, but i felt that the film tries too hard to be affable and charming, presenting a pretty schmaltzy and uncreative script; the protagonist predicament completely misses the point of gaining the viewer's sympathy, he rather comes off as a stubborn fool who's not willing to leave his comfort zone without any real reasoning (talking could've probably advanced the story a lot, but oh well).. the separation between George Valentin and his wife is also poorly justified; around that time, the film got a little too bleak without any effect. the jolly moments were pretty, well assisted by the music; but even those were a little excessive, i thought. that's probably not the film's fault, though, because maybe i wasn't really in a jolly mood... i seem to be focusing on the things i didn't like more but still, it managed to draw a smile on my face on quite a few occasions.it's surprising how quickly the charm and cheerfulness wore off.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cinema in its most chemically pure state,"Hitchcock used to say that the silent movies were the most perfect state of the cinematographic art. And, of course, this is an undeniable truth.In 2011, a French director, obviously a movie buff, sketches out this profound, touching, brilliant recreation of a time, a set of techniques and a filmmaking community long ago gone.The Artist is an exercise of style; despite the fact that some of the shooting techniques from the silent era cannot be reproduced now (for technical or commercial reasons), director Michel Hazanavicius shows to our unaccustomed eyes the life and the work of the men and women who made movies even before the modern film language was invented (by Hitchcock himself).The traumatic and difficult transition between the silent and the talkies is portrayed here from the point of view of a great silent actor, who is dubious about his ability to talk on camera and keep being believable. This membrane shakes the entire industry, and even the companies have to decide whether to keep making silents or retrain their entire productive process into the sound. There is a beautiful love store embedded in, and a superb directorial work, mixing ancient and modern techniques to configure a shining piece of visual narrative, a real time travel to the past and a heart touching tribute to those pioneers. The only obvious anachronism is the modern make up (I'd rather like the kind they used to wear back then, so full of contrast and flamboyant to the naked eye, but not for those lowly sensitive film emulsions), but, letting this aside, the entire movie becomes a highly developed piece of art, fluid and flawless.Great acting of the entire cast (that Argentinian beauty Bérénice Bejo will left you breathless many times), with all the craftsmanship of John Goodman and James Cromwell... But watch out particularly for Uggy the Jack Russell Terrier, because the little guy is perfectly capable of stealing your heart. As a matter of fact, the dog is just another main character in this film. He cannot talk, but the humans don't, either.Also, watch out for the last ten minutes of the music score: the trained ears of classic moviegoers will found a revered master there (two of them, in fact). And lots and lots of cinephile winks and tiny tributes for the eyes capable of spotting them.All in all, a movie about the movies, the filmmakers and the actors, and a great artistic work almost perfect in itself.Worth watching? Of course yes... twice.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not really bad, but against it for best picture.","Usually, I hate these kinds of movies. The kind that people make, knowing the academy and the critics will go crazy over them. This movie was made because the director knows that the academy jerks off to these types of movies. The academy is so predictable. However, I took a look at this because it is nominated for best picture, and it actually, surprisingly was not as bad as I thought. Though not really my type, it was enjoyable enough.Has a pretty decent story I guess. In the 1920s, silent movie actor George Valentin becomes a dying star when sound comes into cinema, upsetting him and his career. Meanwhile, young mistress Peppy Miller becomes the top star of the generation.The movie operates like a 1920s film, by using title cards to display what people say throughout. Gets kind of annoying, but some are into that, (espcially the academy and critics) but whatever. Very good acting performances. Since most of the movie is silent, the actors have to act out really spontaneously so the audience can tell what they're feeling, which works really well. Sound is implied on important occasions, some good, some really weird.So you might be thinking, ""what are my reasons for not liking this as much after all this good talk about it?""I do not want this movie to win best picture,just gonna come out and say it. Not because I don't like it as much, or because it's not my type, but because it's so obvious that it's gonna win. The academy eats out these types of movies that represent old cinema. The director probably purposely made this film because he knew the academy. The academy doesn't care what the better movie is. All they need is a typical mello drama, like the King's Speech. Social Network was 10x better than the King's Speech...too bad Social Network isn't a mello drama. Why did Hurt Locker win and not the better movie, Avatar? Because The Hurt Locker was directed by a girl. So obvious. The academy could not be more predictable. The Artist has best picture written all over it, but for the wrong reasons. It's like there's no purpose for it to exist except to win best picture. The academy needs to be less predictable, for real. The minute I saw the Artist, I said, ""best picture winner"" and same for The King's Speech.The movie itself is not that bad, though I still hope it doesn't win best picture. It plays out well, and it has great performances, but it's just not my type, and it's just so obviously fit to be best picture. :/ Performances: 9/10 Screenplay: 7/10 Music: 7/10 Overall: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A breath of fresh air,"My first 10 rating. The Artist is wonderfully refreshing. The black-and-white presentation takes you to a past time but the movie retains a vivacity that is lost with the films of the silent film era. Know what I mean? Watching a silent film from back in the day is always like watching home movies of your dead relatives. Not so with The Artist. It is very much alive, thanks to the standout work of Dujardin, Bejo, Cromwell, Goodman, and Uggie. Bejo especially adds infectious vitality to her role. Dujardin is also quite likable. Cromwell is a sentimental and loyal manservant. Goodman uses his talent at facial expressions to great effect. Uggie? Who wouldn't want a dog like him? He is a role model for canines everywhere.

"cunning, clever, and beautiful","This film was absolutely incredibly crafted and beautiful to watch. The story shows the transition from silent films in a creative abstract way by playing with audio and the character development. All the sound used in ""unusual"" places represent something in some way and it is so interesting to pick apart and have those ""aha!"" moments over and over again. The attention for detail is mind-boggling and allows you to be able to watch it multiple times from several different perspectives.

It was a foreshadowing of the future to come and was eerie and sad at the same time.

The masterpiece of the silent film!,"This is the work which the times of the changes from a silent film to a talking film were drawn on. It is described in a silent film style and conveys the charm.The good point of this movie is two. The first is that back ground music is used effectively. The music playing through the whole book at most time is sometimes light with beauty and is sometimes sad. It becomes the thing to the feelings of the character and draws us into the world of the story more. In addition, to the contrary some scenes are silence on purpose, it attracts a glance and do it in the impressive scene.The second is an expression of the actors. Because the works is silent films, there are not the lines. Therefore the personality of characters becomes clear, and the expression is rich. The feelings of two people of the leading role in particular are plain.This movie does not depend on lines.

It grows on you. Great movie.,"Korean girlfriend insisted on seeing this, so I caved. Thought I was in for a yawner, Cannes film festival, put your feet to sleep, ""let me out of here!""...etc.Now, in all honesty, the first 15 minutes may have you looking for the exits as this experience is...well...unique, and initially boring (for anyone will all their teeth). Anyway, as the picture progresses you'll find yourself more attentive and involved, probably more than you've ever been before, because this movie demands your ""active"" as opposed to ""passive"" attention. No great special effects or digital wizardry to mindlessly delight the senses, just great facial expressions, body language and stage presence to convey emotion and meaning (with the odd dialogue box thrown in when necessary).In my case, by the time we got to movie's end the only word that came to mind was riveting. The Korean audience were literally awe struck by the picture, judging by the looks on their faces as they stayed in their seats and actually sat through the credits (usually it's a mad dash for the exits as soon as the lights come up). I felt the same way. I have seen some black and white comedy (Charlie Chaplin) on the nostalgia channel, along with some snippets from other silent films, but I've never sat through an entire production like this and really gotten into the story.For you guys with gals, this is a great way to score brownie points with your girl (going to an apparent ""chic flick"").

"Why won't you talk, George?","The Artist – 2011 – Michael HazanaviciusIn 1927, The Jazz Singer became the first film with synchronized dialogue. A few years later, ""talkies"" became popular and silent films died. Not too many actors made a successful transition from silents to talkies, and often those were comedic actors like Laurel and Hardy or Charlie Chaplin. Silent film acting was a different style. With no audible dialogue and no way to convey tone of voice and subtlety, actors had to rely on facial expressions, hand gestures, and overacting. Some actors didn't simply struggle to make the transition, but rather refused to do so. Such is the case of actor George Valentin in The Artist. The film opens, not coincidentally, in 1927. George (Jean Dujardin) is a nice guy, but proud and somewhat egotistical and cocky. He helps out an attractive young actress, Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo). Peppy's star gradually climbs while George's fame suddenly crashes at the advent of the talkies. Meanwhile, George's unhappy and bored housewife (Penelope Ann Miller) leaves him and he goes broke. He becomes suicidal, and Peppy tries to save him. There is almost no audible dialogue in this movie and very little sound save the accompanying orchestra music. It is shot perfectly like the silent films of old. There is one wonderful scene in which the music stops and George is attacked by the ordinary sounds of setting a glass on a table, his dog barking, laughter, the wind. He is overwhelmed by this. It's the best scene in the picture. The cast is wonderful and includes character actor James Cromwell (L.A. Confidential, The Green Mile, and dozens of others you've surely seen) and John Goodman (the most underrated actor in Hollywood). Not sure why Malcolm McDowell was put in a 30 second role. There isn't really anything wrong with this movie except for there really is no time and place to enjoy it. It may have been best enjoyed in the theater. If you have a very short attention span, you might have trouble watching it. There are a few humorous moments, but nothing that will make you laugh out loudly. It's a highly original movie and I think that's why it won so many awards. It is so different from anything else that Hollywood is pumping out nowadays. But despite practically no flaws in this movie, it's hard to give it a super high rating and that's mainly due to the pure entertainment factor. It would make a great companion film with Sunset Boulevard (1950), Mel Brook's Silent Movie (1976), or any actual silent movie. I give it 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
What Is It That Movies Are All About?,"The Artist searches the ultimate fountains of movies. If you take everything else out, what is the essential? Could we take out the sound? The dialogs? The images? No, not the images. But is that what movies are all about? The reason to be? Not quite, at least I don't think so and I don't feel this way. We could not take the images, for sure, but that's because it's the media, the supporting language of movies. But maybe it's not yet the essential.I studied language a lot at the university, it would be very boring and inappropriate to discuss it here, but it would be very useful to comment something about it. It's the ""old"" discussion, the ""rivalry"": which says more, or means more to us? Words or images? Words and images or silence? Images or music? If we put that way, though, it would seem that all these languages, all these ways to express feelings, thoughts and actions would be in an endless battle against each other, competing against each other, but it is not true. One media, one language, helps the other, works with the other. This is art and culture, this is language.So, when we see a silent movie, it doesn't mean it has no words or dialogs. If we could see it, there would be an intense interchange of words, between silent movies and audiences. Words are all over it, in the big screen and in the atmosphere of the theater. We are all the time trying to put words in it, to understand. There's no way one could understand images, even sounds, without looking for words.Sometimes they just aren't in the first plan of things, but they are there. There is just a difference in the focus, in the emphasis of what is being told and the way it's being told. Sometimes best communication comes with silence. But there are words deep inside the silence and all around it. So the essence of movies could not be just the images or just the silence. Also, it's not essential that you spell all the words, sonorous ones.By watching The Artist in 2012 we spontaneously start thinking about those things. The answers or maybe the new questions should come from the story, from the movie. I actually made a list: audience, entertainment, art, magic, dream, visual effects, comedy, drama, adventure, mystery, there are a lot of very important roots composing the essence of movies. They are the elements of movies that combine in very different proportions in each project, like a DNA.There seems to be, however, one element among all the others, that made movies what they are, that made movie industry and its alternatives what they are. Of course we know it, it's romance. Not always in the first plan, sometimes not visible in any plan, but it's there, like the words, it's the essence, what makes us understand movies. Even when it's denied, fought against or destroyed; it's the energy that works underneath. Or when there's a silence about love and romance in a movie, we miss it. But when it comes to the surface, we finally meet what we were looking for, what gives meaning to a not ordinary but very special life.This is what movies are all about. None of us really want an ordinary life, we want it to be special and happy. We are not all the time thinking about love and romance, but that's the road where everything else we care about is. And that is what made The Artist a great movie. It is a wonderful story, a meaningful one, working with all these elements, roots and, of course, the essence of movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A worthy best picture of 2011,"This film works on every level for me. Funny, entertaining and moving at times with a great love story. I know what some of you are thinking, but this is NOT the usual pretentious artsy film, snobby British film like The King's Speech or obvious Oscar bait. At it's heart is just a fun movie made by someone that clearly loved that era of cinema; the film just emanates reverence to that time and excels in it's tribute. I'm certainly not a fan of over the top musicals and it's not that either. It had just the right amount of dancing and was done in a really interesting, fun way. The film really just brought that time to life to me and I don't think I've seen anything quite like it to be honest; it's just very original (I know, ironic, given it's an homage film). And I love movies that show me something I haven't seen before or in a different way and this does that; really, really well.I like this a lot because it doesn't take it self too seriously and that is necessary I think for this to work on a mass level. It's really a mishmash of a lot of the great things about movies from that era and surprisingly works really well. I was always entertained and never bored or uninterested (which I was very worried about heading in). And the actors did a great job of taking the viewer through the film. No matter the moment, the expressions, gestures and the musical score kept you in interested in what was happening.Both actors were incredible and Jean Dujardin deserved his Oscar in my opinion. He had all the classic Hollywood actor features and traits; the smile, the charm, the humour, the look and most importantly, the acting when it mattered. I've seen a few of these films (and scenes of certain films) and he nails it; in every way. In a weak year I think Bejo would've snagged an Oscar, but not this year. She hit all the right notes and fit the mold of the era as well (had the look and the acting chops to match). I look forward to seeing what else she can do, she's clearly talented. Together, they make this film work with fantastic performances. And let's not forget Uggie! (the dog) who was just hilarious. The things they got him to do were pretty impressive and added a lot of light moments to the film.You don't have to love silent black and white movies to really enjoy this, you just have to love movies. I just had this overwhelming sense of joy when I was watching it; something that is really rare in film today. It just made me feel good and I love it for that. For once in the last few years I've agreed with the best picture winner. And besides, it's a movie about actors falling in love in Old Hollywood as it evolves from silent to modern film. I don't think the Academy had the will power to not fall all over it self rewarding this film. But fortunately for us, the movie is actually deserving of it's best picture Oscar (unlike that highly overrated, pretentious The Kings Speech last year). And yes, I'm still annoyed that won.So to summarize, this is an instant classic. A throw back tribute to Old Hollywood and is not to be missed. And yes, it's the best film I saw last year.www.themoviesnob.ca@the_movie_snob",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"An almost perfect movie, even though silent","French director Michel Hazanavicius's beautifully self-contained film manages both to pay homage to the style and structure of silent films while still telling a fresh and warm story that succeeds as a modern film on its own merit. It is a silent movie not just in the absence of dialogue but in the entirety of its look and feel, and that makes it all that much better. Everything worked: the titles (in English), the squarer screen aspect, the music, and the acting.The homage is never less than respectful. It succeeds in being charming, funny, melancholy, and sweet all without being derivative or striking a false note. And by setting the story at the end of the silent era and the transition to talkies, The Artist becomes a wonderful complement to Singing in the Rain.Jean Dujardin, who won the Best Actor award at Cannes, could easily earn a Best Actor Oscar nomination. As the silent film ""artist"" who glides through his life, he is smooth, stylish, amusing, and amused. And as the film moves forward in time, his characterization remains compelling. Bérénice Bejo, Hazanavicius's wife and collaborator, is almost his equal as the young ""peppy"" ingénue ready to launch her career. John Goodman is equally good as the head of their studio.I say ""almost perfect"" because I thought the director could have cut six to ten minutes from the movie's second half. But that's a small nit to pick. This is an outstanding film. I don't see many movies more than once, but this is one I will.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A  Real Peppy Movie: Bringing back the Art of the Silent Film in the 21st century,"Suphie Wesner 9/16/2012My Film Review of Berenice Bejo/Jean duJardin/certain other stars in Michel Hazanavicius' Oscar-winning film, The Artist..Among the blockbuster stars in this film include fat-faced, sarcastic-personad, of Roseann's ex-husband in their comedy, Roseanne, as John Goodman, and Uggie, the dog...In general, this cast is so good because they are all extremely talented; also, Monsieur Hazanavicius is excellent as director, told by his award that he won for best director of the 2012 Oscar nominations, and Du Jardin won as best actor, a first- time event for any French actor crossing over into the American movie industry. The film is basically self-explanatory, the dog is really cute, du Jardin and Berenice Bejo (Peppy Miller in the movie), excel as dancers, and even John Goodman is really good as the film's casting- call, director within the film, who calls du Jardin a has-been, namely because he can only do ""silent movies"" while the industry is heading into the direction of eliminating silent, calling them old-fashioned, and instead wholly doing ""sound-based"" films. ""Uggie,"" the dog, knows a million well-rehearsed tricks, which is why he was chosen for the role, I suppose, and he must be a springer spaniel, or some sort of a Jack Russell Terrier, or, something. The charming aspect of this film is that most of the characters don't talk, they use their gestures, their faces, their eyes, instead, to relay the message they want to relay. At one point, Du Jardin puts a revolver in his mouth because he chooses to commit suicide, feeling so bad about the fact that he is no longer in demand. Fortunately, or for whatever reason, the revolver doesn't work, or, he no longer has the will to do it; the dog, for one thing, starts barking his head off when he sees his master in distress. Also, the film makes a point to show that Bejo cares about him and loves him, as they formerly were lovers, and she wants to prove the point that she is willing to follow through for him now; indeed, the movie shows that she has him in mind when she drives like mad, tongue literally in cheek, on her way to come save the day. It turns out, that, though she fails to rescue him in the end (it is he who saves himself), she had a thought-process that was correct, that he was in harm's way, and that she herself would make the effort to save him. . . Indeed the film is a lot about ""saving grace,"" about people coming through for others when nobody else will; about faith; about working together to create something bigger, about, well, getting along. It is appallingly long for short-tempered modern-day audiences who might balk at going without sound for over an hour; I myself thought that the film would go on for 27 chapters, but I guess I was wrong. The charming smile of Du Jardin, or, rightfully, George Valentin, and Peppy Miller's dance moves more than make up for that. The uniqueness and the creativity that went into the film, I think, the fact that modern-day actors and actresses can make such a sparkling revival of silent film is this movie's ""lucky star."" Uggie, the dog, who is able to play dead, seek help (like Lassie), and even, when ashamed or abashed, put his head between his front paws, is also a remedy for people seeking something new out of today's modern-day cinema. But when George Valentin (pronounced to rhyme with Valentino, I believe) suffers smoke-inhalation, I don't believe that he was severely burned, honestly, from a house fire started by his desire to burn off his own collection of personal movie reels he regrets having made with Peppy; things go to Hell and the film winds down. There may be a little bit of professional jealousy within the couple itself; he may have been hurt by the fact that she started winning all the roles with the skills and the talents imbued in her by him. But, all, in all, one has to admit that they work well together as a team on screen, and even come across as your modern-day Bonnie and Clyde, or, alternately, Fred and Ginger. A lot of time and efforts went into hair- dressing and special-makeup effects, too; Peppy herself lands a role in a film entitled, ""Peppy's Beauty Spot"" or something like that. France 24 also had a hand in this film, and it is clear that a lot of acting parts were used. Johnnie Burke and Arthur Johnston wrote a cute number entitled, ""Pennies from Heaven,"" and Ludovic Bource wrote the musical score. Indeed, Jon-Paul was the gang-leader, so, as you can see, there are many parts in this movie which are technical and skilled, and those often went to the French workers, it is just reality to say, and the parts that were more involved with acting, even small roles/bit parts, went to the Americans. One of the most sinister parts in the film, when Peppy arrive at Jean's mansion only to be hinted at by his maid that he is ""occupied"" is when it looks like it might be over for them. It is a cute film, rather slow-moving and wholesome, and rated pg-13 and produced by French studios in conjunction with American distributors ( in fact, there is one film studio in the whole thing entitled, ""La Class Americaine,"" but that isn't really a real American studio). It is the most-awarded French film in history, apparently, as said by internet researchers; it came out in 2011, but officially had a 2012 release date in America. It has English inter-titles on it, as well as, it is the first feature-length black-and-white film since the dawning of Schindler's List in 1993, by Spielberg. James Cromwell also plays a bit role as the butler of Jean. It is a great, jazzy little film with a lot of good musical numbers. The End.",,Anonymous,Romance

Some things are best left unspoken.,"The Artist actually does all the things that it shouldn't be doing if it wants to appeal to the generic herd of moviegoers - monochrome, silent and not consisting of any cinematic behemoth to carry the mantle of wooing the audiences. It is undeniable that the allure of a black-and- white film of the silent era remains highly esoteric. 'It died for a reason,' one might say. 'Sound killed it.' Agreed. But the fact that The Artist does better than almost all the other movies of the year comes across as a rather delightful irony.The transition of movies from silence to sound has been remarkably captured through the various perspectives of a plethora of those affected by Singin' in the Rain and Sunset Boulevard, to name two. The Artist seems inspired from the former, with its quirky sense of humour and all, while has a protagonist who shares the dogma of Norma Desmond as far as 'talkie' movies are concerned. The man is George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), a conceited, debobair, illustrious actor of an era where facial contortions and subtitles did most of the talking. While celebrating the success of his latest movie, he bumps into Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), who later turns into the luckiest of his throngs of worshippers. There is the spark of romance there, but that flame is left unkindled, since Valentin is married to Doris (Penelope Ann Miller) despite rather unhappily. But his tidal wave of confidence soon tosses him ashore with the introduction of sound in cinema, with Peppy being one of the harbingers of the winds of change. With the writing on the wall being all too clear, it is Valentin's amore-propre that blinds him, as the zeitgeist sweeps through like a storm, leaving him stripped of everything but his vanity, as the artist now has to learn the artform of survival.The movie is like a monologue of how change is inevitable and how we must adapt or get run-over by it. It preaches this lesson by drawing parallels between the old and new. The initial comparison is between wordless movies and cinema after the inception of sound and how the unfortunate former perished at the hands of sound. However, this comparison is also personified, as it betrays the appearance of a metaphor between the characters of George and Peppy - the former an imploding star, the latter a new sunrise. 'Out with the old, in with the new. Make way for the young!' Peppy says, as George overhears her. Just like soundless movies were annihilated out of existence unceremoniously, George realizes that it might be his turn to suffer the same fate if he doesn't embrace the change.The performances are fabulous, with a special mention going out the dog, who deserves the honour of being the best canine I have ever seen. Dujardin with his pencil moustache gives his act a certain authenticity, while the gregarious, affectionate Peppy is right in her shoes. The differences brought about in the acting, as compared to regular movies due to the absence of a voice are palpable - subtlelties are paid special attention to, physical movements flow like a cadence and the eyes convey most of the emotions. Though the acting might seem overdone, with all the accentuation and exaggerated movements, one must remember that it does justice to its requirements and to history, and is hence befits the film.But the movie has its shortcomings, some of which are too blatant to ignore. Primary of these is the rather hackneyed storyline. If you want a movie that talks about what a silent-movie-icon goes through once sound is introduced, you need to look no further than Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard. The only thing that movie did different from The Artist is track the downfall of its protagonist into insanity, while The Artist doesn't go that far. The parallel subplot about a youngling shooting to stardom as another falls has also been done before, though not to death (A Star is Born, for instance). So, that's hardly a surprise too.Since the film begins as a comedy, and masquerades like one for a sizeable proportion of its run-time (heck, it won the Golden Globe for Best Picture Comedy), once it gradually descends into a tragedy, The Artist fails to get its viewers along, who happen to get stuck in a limbo between laughter and sympathy at the protagonist's fate. The seriousness that one needs to empathize with Valentin is amiss because the movie begins on too much of an upbeat note. This failure, arising from trying to balance on two rafts at the same time, unfortunately, makes it a case of being lost in transition.The Artist isn't merely a movie with a message, it is also an ode to movies of the day when Hollywood was popular as Hollywoodland. The movie exudes an air of the late 1920s and early 1930s - every third man wearing bowler hats, the paparazzi hobbling around with archaic cameras, movies that ended as soon as the director got bored of shooting. The film has a panache, a vivacity, that one rarely gets to see in modern times. However, the salute is accomplished when the film makes its final move - outdoing most other films of the year in terms of excellence, which shows that Valetin, actually, might have been right.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

It wasn't exactly the same, but it felt like a bit of a re-telling. Also, because the theme music from ""Vertigo"" is so incredibly familiar to me, I felt distracted when it started playing on the soundtrack (""hey, that doesn't belong there!).

I thought the movie had very impressive performances and a solid musical score, both of which are crucial for a movie like this.

He shows us how the silent movies were and how the talking movies started in Hollywood, and has shown Hollywood in the 1920-1930 excellently,how the movies were shot in the sets,how the locations have changed from then to today and he deserves some recognization for this movie.The Background Score For This movie had to be spot on and it did not disappoint as music director Ludovic Bource has given very good music in the movie, and should get the award for best original score.Finally, The Movie for me is one of the best of 2011 and has Hazanavicius has re-invented the magic of silent movies through this, and through great acting from the leading actors, this is bound to get many awards.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Film That Says A Lot By Staying Silent,"I'll be short and unusually sweet.I like the way this movie was made. I like it even more that others have not tried to replicate it since (so far). I'll keep my 'talkies' thank you very much.From a technical side, the 'full screen' aspect ratio didn't take too long to get used to, in part because the film itself didn't take too long to get into. The design of the picture, everything about it, brings you back and allows you to believe. That's the great thing about movies, they can carry you to a time and era you've never experienced just so you can experience it.I noticed right away how 'plain' the set decoration and lighting were back then. It would pain me to light a project like this because it's so simple and dull. The DP, Guillaume Schiffman, did do a fantastic job, and like the actors, had to learn a new technique to do his job I'm sure. It's so simple, it works on every level.About half way through I began to realize how difficult acting in a silent film really is. As an actor in a silent picture you have to work really hard at getting your point across to the audience in actions, and not words; ""mugging"" as character Peppy Miller puts it. In saying that, the actors in this film would have had to train a little differently at being a silent film actor because all they've ever known are 'talkies' and their training as actors follow that basic necessity of today's movies - sound! In today's world, acting is more than just movement.The Oscar for Best Picture is well deserved. Although this isn't a movie I'll watch over and over, it was a nice switch.",,Anonymous,Romance
An intentionally gimmicky throwback,"Although it won best picture a decade ago, 'The Artist' belongs in a cinematic universe from many decades ago. In what amounts to Hollywood paying homage to an era of silent films at the dawn of the ""talkies,"" the Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo-starring film may feel a bit gimmicky, but it's gimmicky in an intentional way.Sure, watching this film is not super fun. It's incredibly boring in parts and requires the audience put in extra effort to follow along given they are not able to use one of their most important senses for the viewing experience. That said, 'The Artist' does a good job telling the story of a leading man whose star fades as a leading woman's star rises in a form of generational commentary (""Out with the old!""). Yes, it's a bit linear, but that's all we can hope for given all of the other abstract elements that are at play here. James Cromwell also is a friendly face as the assistant and driver to Dujardin's George Valentin, and John Goodman doesn't disappoint as the (assumedly) boisterous director. But the real star of the show is Valentin's loyal canine companion, who has a knack for playing dead.Sure, 'The Artist' is intended to be, well, art. It will probably not be remembered as a standout film years from now. At the very least, it managed to capture accolades from Hollywood's elite.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Reminiscent of Singin in the Rain: a clever and fun film for the ages!,"Set in 1920s Hollywood, silent film actor George Valentin, played by Jean Dujardin, quickly feels the rug pulled out from under him when the ""talkies"" start taking over the silver screen. His career falls by the wayside to up and comer Peppy Miller, played by Berenice Bejo, a newbie unafraid to let herself be heard.What was so interesting about this movie though was not the plot. It was the style. This movie was in all black and white and (almost) completely silent! It even had the text windows that old silent movies used to have. I loved it! It really emphasized the drama and body language. Not having words to rely on made me all that much more aware of the thoughts and feelings of the characters. Dujardin was brilliant in his depiction of a washed-up silent actor. His eyebrows had a life of their own. Bejo was so cute, the ideal 20s flapper girl.I thought that this movie was similar to the timeless classic Singin in the Rain for two reasons. Reason #1: both movies are about silent actors coming to terms with the advent of talking pictures. Reason #2: Jean Dujardin had something very Gene Kelly-ish about him. As I watched The Artist, I really felt like I was watching Gene Kelly with a mustache. Maybe it's his eyes. Maybe it's his smile. I don't know but I kept thinking of Gene Kelly throughout The Artist.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
frustrated but average 🤝,"A very strange movie, frankly, the soundtrack and cinematography were very good, the acting was also, it did not document the moment of transition from silent films to talking films, as well as the bad psychological state that an actor might reach if he was abandoned, but frankly a disappointing movie, I was looking forward to better than what I saw, the events were slow, also the story of the movie was very simple.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"The ""Hollow"" Artist.......Is An Escape Artist","This is entertaining, but its a highly flawed movie. The story is very thin... everyone knows silent actors struggled badly when the ""talkies"" arrived. The two lead actors...Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo...are outstanding. The photography, music, direction are all good. I certainly did not believe that this should have won the Best Picture Academy Award. Its basically a bit of a mess...daring.?? YES brave.?? YES. One either goes hook..line..and sinker for the way Dujardin is left in a ""silent world"". Or, like me you see this as an clever way to show the audience just how hard the transformation effected some of the biggest stars. It IS quite entertaining...no question about that. Its just that its not in any way...near the mark...about what really happened in early Hollywood, and as it skips along at a fast pace one is aware of the hollow nature of the story.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

There are hundreds of better silent movies made years ago... what's the buzz here? Giving the film won so many Oscars is really an insult to the other nominated films. Just because the Weinsteins have power in Hollywood isn't enough for me to blindly follow the opinion that this is a ""brilliant"" film... very far from it.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Love, love, love.","Oh my! I'm going to ruin the ending to my own review by saying I absolutely loved this film! No suspense or skirting around the issue, it's absolutely fantastic.From the offset, I was transported into a time I wish I'd lived. The theatre was so busy, I had to sit at the back where I could here the projector, which only added to the ambiance. The irony of a silent film documenting the coming of sound is perfect. Sound in film is all we know of today, lest we forget, it ruined a lot of people's careers (Norma Desmond, even though she's a character, is a prime example). Single scenes show the transition of two peoples entire emotions and it's done beautifully, not rushed, just beautiful.I really have nothing bad to say about this film, I'm giddy just writing about. Not having sound (or even the way they use it in doses) helps you to appreciate the subtleties. Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo are sublime, I even loved the dog. If only films like this could come along more often than a blue moon.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
When Silence Talks,"It is not uncommon in times of crises, to look for solutions in the past which, as a rule, had always been better than the dreary past. And so it is not much of a surprise that, in an America tortured by economic crisis and its decreasing importance in the world, the most celebrated film of the year, the one Hollywood throws every accolade on it has to offer, is a black and white silent movie looking back at Hollywood's golden age. Alas, it was made by a Frenchman and its star is French as well. Even Hollywood, it seems, can be made better abroad. In a year that has seen remarkable films dealing with a society's identity crisis, the many awards may appear as a sign of escapism. Or maybe The Artist is just this good?The film tells the story of Hollywood's biggest silent movie star, George Valentine whose career is cut short when he refuses to join the new talking movie era. He goes through a major identity crisis, almost commits suicide but survives through the help of those who love him and even gains new success by finding a language of his own which allows him to cut out a place in the new film era – or to put it shortly: by reinventing himself. Maybe there is a message for our uncertain times.Be this as it may, The Artist works on so many other levels. In the beginning it is hard to remember that this is not a film from the 1920s, so spot on does it capture the esthetic of storytelling, imagery and editing – and, of course, the expressive acting style required by silent movies and brilliantly mastered by the films cast, especially Jean Dujardin, a movie star somewhere between Rudolph Valentino and Groucho Marx, and Bérénice Bejo, whose starlet Peppy Miller is a fascinating mixture of dumb blonde (although she isn't even blond) of adoring lover. Both seem to come straight from the silent movie era, Dujardin's George Valentin certainly would have made it there. And so would George's dog who is there in the comedy and the tragedy, an animal clown and a loving friend – and the secret star of this film. Nothing here is ever only one thing.The Artist is, of course, first and foremost an homage to the silent move to a time where actors did not need dialogue because they had faces as a character in Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard once put it. The film is full of reminiscences, styles and scenes taken straight out of the era's greatest films. The fascination, the wonder that early audiences must have felt, it is captured here, as the viewer also must learn to deal with the absence of the familiar. When, at the start, we witness a film premiere which culminates in thundering and yet completely silent applause, the modern viewer may, for the first time, learn that silence can be heard and that it can be painfully loud as in that scene towards the end when George and Peppy, who represent the old and the new, finally come together, without a sound, not even music.Director Michel Hazanavicius manages a perfect balance between the comic and the serious, moves effortlessly from slapstick to tragedy and back into romantic comedy. It is a mix of genres in which everything from the world of silent movies finds its place and still it is more than a series of quotations. There are memorable scenes such as when Peppy helps George's empty coat to engage in a sensual embrace or when, in a nightmare, everything begins to make a sound yet George remains silent. The whole film keeps coming back to the language-silence topic: From the opening scene, in which – as part of a film – Russian spies try to torture George's character into speaking but he remains silent. Repeatedly, speaking appears as frightening, threatening, unbalancing.And yet, at the very end, George says a word, in a thick French accent, which may explain his refusal to speak on film. So maybe it wasn't his pride, his insistence on being an artist rather than a puppet, after all? Who know? All we do know is that this is a fascinating eye- and ear-opener which works as an homage to an art form long lost, as a parable on the necessity of change, a declaration of love to love and friendship and, I'm sure, on many other levels. Maybe, at least once in a while, seeing things in black and white is not such a bad thing after all.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A great film and an instant classic!,"The Artist is a film that took what I thought was going to be a gimmick and turned it into an experience. The movie is about a famous actor in the twenties that struggles to continue his career when movies start to use sound. this is a topic that was also talked about in the classic ""Singing in the Rain"" but this movie sets itself apart in the fact that it is filmed in black & white and is actually a silent film. I went into this movie thinking they were going to try to hard to be artsy, that the whole silent thing was just a gimmick and would quickly get old or annoying if not done right. To put it simply I was dead wrong. This movie isn't only great but it proves that the silent film isn't dead just yet. The characters are fun and lovable, the writing is brilliant and the cinematography can be surprisingly brilliant at times. The camera work is done flawlessly with the idea of a black & white in mind meaning that we get to see some beautiful shots that plays with the color limitations. the acting is also extremely well done. Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo have great chemistry on screen together and there expressions really takes this movie the extra mile. when these characters are sad you can feel it through that sincere look in there eyes. the writing was again great. It came together very well but if i had any problems with this movie it would be the resolution after the climax. I won't give anything away but I will say it is a bit ridiculous. all in all it is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Silence speaks volumes,"""The Artist"" is a movie about which you could honestly say, ""They don't make 'em like that anymore"". In an age of CGI-enhanced blockbusters, it's almost unfathomable that a silent picture would be greenlit at all. The fact that it wound up garnering five (well deserved) Oscars likely surpassed even the filmmakers' wildest dreams.At once both timeless and contemporary, ""The Artist"" is a treasure for movie lovers. Although the plot borrows liberally from ""Singin' in the Rain"" and ""A Star is Born"", the story is nevertheless highly engrossing. Comedy and drama are expertly mixed to create an affecting love story replete with the feel of good old Hollywood entertainment.In the film, silent movie star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) finds himself left behind by the advent of talking pictures while spunky newcomer Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) watches her career take off. Although they share a common bond, George's stubborn pride seems destined to keep them apart.The leads are fantastic, especially Dujardin, who found himself rewarded with an Oscar for his efforts. His effortless charm evokes memories of Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn. Bejo, meanwhile, contributes a sterling performance of her own. In supporting roles, there's notable work from John Goodman, Penelope Ann Miller, Missi Pyle and, particularly, James Cromwell as George's steadfastly loyal chauffeur. And let's not forget Uggie, the dog (seriously).In terms of filmmaking craft, the movie is exceptional. The Oscar-winning direction of Michel Hazanavicius is continually playful and inventive. Being a silent film, the score is especially important, and composer Ludovic Bource did not disappoint. His Oscar-winning score is one of the movie's strong points. Another Oscar was awarded for the period costume design, while the cinematography, editing & art direction were all recognized with nominations.Taken altogether, the movie excels both as art and entertainment. While I feel that the combination of comedy and drama may not be quite as finely balanced as it could be, that is a minor point in the scheme of things. ""The Artist"" is a deserving Best Picture Oscar winner and well worth anyone's time, regardless of their feelings about silent movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"The Amazing, The Astonishing, The Artist","When people hear of a black and white silent film produced and starring French actors American audiences go running for the hills. Haven't we moved into the 21st century? Are we not at an age where million dollar explosions and masked do-gooders gallivant across the screen in full fledged 3D? Why then would someone be as esoterically pretentious as to make a film like ""The Artist.""Because its freakin' awesome that's why! OK...Let me rein in some of my enthusiasm. The tale begins with silent film star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) on top of his game at Kinograph Studios. By chance he bumps into a would-be actress (Berenice Bejo) and helps her break into the business. But as 1929 rolls in, the invention of talking pictures derails George's career and threatens to destroy his life.The story is as familiar as a piece of chocolate cake yet it is told in such an innovative way. Compensating for a lack of dialogue, the actors are forced to emote with every jaunty gate and jovial face crinkle. The music by Ludovic Bource follows along with the unfolding plot punctuating specific moments where it should. The implanted symbolism and confident camera movements recreate eerily similar tableaux from classic films like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Grand Hotel"" and ""The Mark of Zorro"" with aplomb.It's a love letter to film and everyone should be reading it. Or rather watching each perfectly constructed frame. While some may believe the silent format is limiting, director Michel Hazanavicius proves it is anything but. He plays with the medium, toying with the lights, shadows, sounds and shades like an elaborate puppet show. Watching ""The Artist"" was almost like unveiling a Jackson Pollock on a cave wall. The canvas might be obsolete but the painting itself is stunning, striking, even provocative.And as for pretension? This film is anything but. It's candy swathed in plain wrapping. A sugary sweet concoction well hidden in the upper cabinet of a gourmet kitchen. 100% pure entertainment for all ages or at least anyone who dares to laugh in silence and dream in black and white.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Just because it is a 'silent film' doesn't automatically make it great; still, it's usually fairly fun and is certainly well-made.","'The Artist (2011)' doesn't necessarily fully capitalise on its stylistic conceit, considering that there are several moments that break the silent film styling and that the plot itself would've been better suited to a hybrid approach (perhaps even an exaggerated one) similar to that seen in some movies made in the tail-end of the silent era. The style of the piece is pretty impressive in general, despite the fact that it certainly isn't as visual as it could've been, and it proves that the silent film is still, to this day, a genuine art-from that should be explored more often, perhaps even from a perspective that doesn't try to ape cinema's earliest pictures (which this feels like it's doing but it often misses the mark) so much as use their restrictions to tell an interesting - and not necessarily 'industry-commenting' - tale. This aesthetic is the only real reason the flick has any 'Oscar-worthy' merit, though. The piece's ending sort of arises from nowhere, even though its seeds are planted earlier, and brushes several serious issues of a central character aside in a way which pretends everything is suddenly okay essentially just because it needs to be for the plot. This makes it feel rushed and slightly unsatisfying. There's some difficulty in understanding a specific character's motives and, therefore, a central struggle of the narrative, too, which mitigates the engagement of the experience and makes for some questionable moments that often tie into the breaking of the established style and world (sometimes, it seems like our hero is surprised that he himself can hear people speak, even though we obviously can't). One of the largest issues actually seems like it would be one if the most incidental. The movie uses an incredibly famous musical score from an incredibly famous film during what it perhaps its most important - or, at least, intense - sequence. This jarringly pulls you right out of the world and totally ruins the impact of said scene, especially considering that the music doesn't fit with its tone at all - even if you don't consider the fact it's supposed to be a romantic track. It also feels extremely lazy and the music is very poorly chosen as the flick it's from isn't even silent and, as I mentioned, is one of the most recognisable in all of cinema, one especially renowned for its soundtrack. Overall, the picture has a charm to it that can't be denied despite its problems. It does seem like most of the praise seems to be levelled at the fact that it looks and sounds (or doesn't sound, if you will) like a silent film, but that isn't really enough to make a film great in my opinion. By that logic, all silent films are great. In reality, silent film has, like anything else, hits and misses. When you compare it to its quiet peers, this flick is middling, to say the least. While it's usually fun and always well-made, it isn't perfect and lacks certain elements that would really make it shine. It doesn't help that it's essentially 'Singin' In The Rain (1952)' without the songs. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A classic of warmth, wit and charm","'The Artist' is a sheer joy to witness from beginning to end. Why? Well, because it feels like such a breath of fresh air. In recent years, we have become accustomed to overblown CGI-fests, increasingly unfunny comedies and irritatingly saccharine melodramas. Then, out of nowhere along comes Michael Hazavanicius with a silent film shot entirely in black and white letterbox 4x3. To everyone's surprise it became an unprecedented hit both in terms of box office and critically, eventually garnering seven BAFTAs, three golden Globes and seven Academy Awards, winning Best Picture in the case of each, becoming the first silent movie to win the Best Picture Oscar since 'Wings' and 'Sunrise' both did so at the very first Academy Awards and the first black and white film to win since Steven Spielberg's 'Schindler's List', in 1993.Sharing similarities with the brilliant 'Singin' in the Rain' and 'A Star is Born', the film centres on George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) a silent film star much-loved audiences. His fame is soon scuppered, when, in 1927 silent cinema is replaced the ""talkies"". Despite this, George decides to continue with what he does best, whilst Peppy Miller (a radiant Bérénice Bejo) a young actress rises to fame as the ""talkies"" continue to rise in popularity.Akin to Martin Scorsese's 'Hugo', this film is clearly in love with early cinema, however unlike that film, Michael Hazavanicius populates 'The Artist' with irresistibly charming characters, and yes, that includes Uggie's enthralling turn as Jack. From the moment it begins to its wonderful finale, the movie's heart never stops beating. Its deep love for silent movies reverberates off the screen, helping to transport us back to an earlier time, immersing the viewer in the story.It is also propelled by its two main players, Dujardin and Bejo. He gives George the movie star charisma with one gleaming smile, not entirely dissimilar to sleek good-looks of Gene Kelly. Even in his quieter and most thoughtful moments, the brilliance of his performance never falters, applying the character with depth and ripe emotion, despite the seldom appearance of title cards. Despite being a relative newcomer (she also appeared Hazavanicius 2006 spy-parody 'OSS 117: Cairo Nest of Spies'), Bejo manages to epitomize the kind of female film star that was so popular; she is positively gorgeous and captivating to watch, enjoying some great scenes with Dujardin. A third-act dance number between the two is a pure delight to witness. There are also appearances from more-familiar faces throughout, such as Malcolm McDowell, John Goodman and James Cromwell. Also worth a mention is Uggie who plays Valentin's dog Jack, offering some of the film's most amusing comic beats.But this is more than just a love letter to silent cinema, because when you put aside all its old-fashioned filming techniques, this is an emotional film about love and loss, something our leading man has to grapple with over the course of its narrative. However, this is not some kind of dour drama, but the sort of film that leaves you smiling from ear-to-ear by the time the credits roll. It was so uplifting in fact, that during the closing scene, I found it difficult to remain seated the joy was so much. What a wonderful film 'The Artist' is. It is truly magical; a cinema lover's dream and also a fantastically enjoyable film for more casual viewers. I absolutely adore this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I went into ""The Artist"" with high expectations; sadly, I was left empty and wanting more.","""The Artist"" has received an abundance of praise and awards since it's limited release back in late November. Knowing that, I saw the film with high expectations. Sadly, I was left empty and wanting more.""The Artist"" follows the life of a silent film actor, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin). George is the ""it guy"" in the 1920's vision of Hollywood; he's good looking, charming, and has a bad-ass mustache. The opening scene sets you right into this silent world with the premiere of George's new film, ""A Russian Affair"". As George's film, ""A Russian Affair"" ends, George comes on stage and entertains the audience by saying a few words and doing a little dance; The audience loves it. Later that same evening, George is outside the theater posing for pictures for the press when a young woman, Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), drops her purse. As she goes to retrieve it, she gets bumped and is pushed right into George. George laughs it off and poses for pictures alongside the young woman. Peppy wants to be an actress; the next day she goes to an audition at Kinograph Studios and coincidentally has another encounter with George. Al Zimmer (John Goodman), the Studio's boss, isn't to intrigued by Ms. Miller, but with George's help she becomes the next big thing in Hollywood. From that point on, George's life is in a downward spiral. As she rises, he falls. With ""Talkies"" starting to become the new form of cinema, George loses his job, his house, and his wife. Given that ""The Artist"" is a silent film, it's a pretty dark and intriguing tale of a washed up actor.""The Artist"" -to put it bluntly- is a piece of art. It's beautiful, funny, and suspenseful without even trying too hard; It's a true achievement in filmmaking. Another thing that is worth mentioning is how natural everything feels. Whether it be the acting, the music, the black and white film alongside the four by three aspect ratio, it never feels like an anachronism.Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Bejo and John Goodman give beautiful performances. There is no spoken dialogue that can be heard, so you might want to learn to read lips (only with image captions that pop-up occasionally is when you can understand what the characters are saying). Otherwise, you only know what's going on by watching the actors' facial expressions and movements. There were more than a couple times in this film where I felt great sympathy for Jean Dujardin's charismatic character, George. You feel sad when George is sad and you feel happy when he's happy; he's that kind of character. James Cromwell plays Clifton, George's faithful butler, and he's great as well. There's a scene with George and Clifton, I'm not going to spoil it, but it's just pitiful. Bérénice Bejo doesn't get as much screen time as Jean Dujardin, but believe me, she does leave her mark.Even though The film uses the four by three aspect ratio with no color, the cinematography is a delight to look at. Like I said, there is no sound, except for the score that composer Ludovic Bource provides. To be honest, It's not exactly my kind of music, but it replicates the era perfectly (The same goes for the costume designs).I've done nothing but praise this film, so what's the problem? Well...I really don't have one. I'm willing to admit something that no one ever seems to want to own up to: maybe it's just me. Maybe it was the lack of dialogue that threw me off, maybe it was the music. Regardless, ""The Artist"" deserves the praise it has gotten and will receive.

The Artist: Valentin's hubris or pure pragmatism?,"This film's plot seems to follow a familiar tragic pattern of foolish pride leading eventually to recognition and redemption. The pride would have to do with Valentin's old-fashioned and, it would seem, aesthetically-based disdain for talkies, just as Peppy's scorn for the mugging that goes on in silent films derives from a more progressive take on the future of cinema.But the protagonist is a kind of Anglo-French hybrid. Described in the trailer voice-over as the anglicised 'George Valentine', in the cast list he is the intermediate George Valentin, and this seems but a minor displacement from Georges Valentin, a completely French name. And of course he is played by one Jean Dujardin.The only words he utters, in the final dance scene, are a heavily-accented 'With pleasure', and with such mangled pronunciation he evidently IS French, and at a potential disadvantage. Which leads one to ask the question: 'Did he despise the talkies, or did he fear that they would be the death of him, as soon as he opened his mouth?' Certainly actors like Emil Jannings and Heinrich George beat a hasty retreat from Hollywood at the time, and indeed were in no hurry to return there from Germany even during the rise of Nazism in the thirties. Nor had the time yet arrived when Maurice Chevalier's English accent would be deemed cute.Hence Valentin's heroic efforts to turn back the clock with Tears of Love can be seen as a reasoned attempt to reassert the primacy of the one of the two genres in which, because of his palpable foreignness, he could continue to reign supreme.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
When a silent movie leaves you speechless,"I wasn't a big fan of silent movies, to be honest. I thought that words were too important, but since I had to see it at school, I decided not to be too influenced by my opinion.
But this movie left me literally speechless. The way it is made!! Michel Hazanavicius made a fantastic job playing with the sound effects, and I particularly enjoyed the dream part, one of the only two scenes where you can actually hear sounds and voices. I found some of the shots extremely genius; especially the one where Valentin (Jean Dujardin) reflects himself on the table and then pour on it the glass of alcohol, as a sign of his desperation for himself.
The scene were Valentin was about to shoot himself with the gun meanwhile Peppy was running on a car to rescue him, left me amazed; you saw a ""Bang!"" written on the screen and you couldn't help to feel worried that the protagonist might have killed himself.
I loved the acting of the two main protagonists, the facial expressions, the way their bodies moved, it all reminded me of a real old movie.

Not fully rewarding my expectations,"The Oscar nominations are out. ""The Artist"" is a nominee for Best Film besides 7 other movies. When I watched the trailer I got really intrigued and decided to see it as soon as possible.Although, I expected it too be a mega-hit movie from the start, it didn't quite satisfy my so called hypothesis before watching the movie. I must say, it was a pleasant change to see a black and white, silent movie and the music was superb. But the plot was one of the most common and I feel as if I have seen something similar before. Maybe it's just looking from my point of view but I expected some tragedy, unexpected events, mystery. Something I didn't expect to see when I watched ""Black Swan"" last year.Nevertheless, the actors were great. Especially, I liked the leading actress because I believe she has a so called actors face - with a lot of appealing facial expressions.Taking the fact that this movie is nominee of 10 Oscars I believe that the big guys really love it. And even if I don't admire it so much, I would still recommend you to see it, just for comparing of opinions. And the end seen was terrific!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant old-fashioned black&white movie,"Despite of being shot recently, the movie brings back the atmoshpere of the traditional black&white movie in a brilliant way.The main actor Jean Dujardin totally deserves his Oscar for his acting in this film and the main actress (whith whom he's already played other movies with) is very convincing as well.The plot is easy to follow and overall the story is amusing and dramatic in the same time.With a great cast and fantastic soundtrack, you won't get bored and enjoy this movie even if you're not an amateur of the black&white genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wonderful yet destined to fade from the public's memory,I had this movie on my watch list for at least 5 years but I never got fully persuaded to watch it until now. Funnily enough it took hearing a podcast talking about how it had been forgotten to remind me. And maybe it does have that forget-ability built into to movie but that doesn't mean it is without charm. It's a simple enough story of movies transitioning into the 'talkies' from the silent era and how a man doesn't know how to change with the times.Being a silent movie the visuals and music is all you get so initially a bit jarring. But quickly I found the viewing experience to be engaging in a different way than seeing a modern movie. It enjoyable as a true film rather than just being an homage to that era of film.It is worth seeing despite it quickly fading from the public's memory. It's a fascinating movie but probably only worth one viewing. Sorry George.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Modern and outstanding silent film,"Silent film, black and white, French, made in 2011 shows, in an excellent direction, the time of the early silent film, its evolution to the spoken one, this generated culture of admiration for the actors, the wealth and fantasies, the crisis for the person that can not adapt to change, its decline helped by the financial crisis of 29 to lose all the tangible goods, its rejection by pride to accept a new world, a new technology (all past times were better), the hidden support of the fan who wins because she can adapt to the innovative projects in the industry, and the happy ending (characteristic of those early days of this new art).

Beautifully directed and amazingly acted masterpiece,"It should be made clear: many consider this film to be the best of the year. Masterfully made, ""The Artist"" soars in just about every redeeming quality thinkable: character development, exceptional acting, etc. It's difficult to talk about such a masterpiece without including a string of compliments. Actors in the film mostly use gestures and expressions rather than words, but it is still clear how they feel about something. It's full of surprises and is primarily a romance story, although it contains just as much comedy and drama. In one instance, music from the score of Alfred Hitchcock's film ""Vertigo"" is used, but it ends up still fitting well with the scene it accompanies.

What you get with a silent ode to the silent era of Hollywood.,"I finally got around to see this French production of a modern silent movie. It's a visual treat of old-fashioned, black and white cinematography in a picture perfect Hollywood setting.There, we see an aging, Douglas Fairbanks look-alike star, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) who is unable to transition from the silent era to talkies after 1930 and who gradually fades from the scene, literally and figuratively. On the way down and out, he meets an aspiring, vivacious young actress, Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) who makes it big, especially when the industry moves to sound. The fairly conventional plot then takes the viewer for a ride through the ups, according to Peppy, and downs, according to George, of Tinsel Town.Along the way, we are hugely entertained by an Oscar worthy dog (George's constant companion), extravagant costuming, great music to accompany the silent movie, a bevy of well-known Hollywood actors, excellent acting and proof, once again, that a movie is always visual art, first and foremost.Jean Dujardin is superb - a perfect portrayal of a silent screen star. He's so good, it defies adequate description. His co-star, Berenice Bejo matches his performance, but is always overshadowed when together – except perhaps in the dancing scenes. There's a good balance between comedy and melodrama, with most of the former provided by Uggie, the dog.Blending it all together under the direction by Michel Hazanavicius, the result is a cinematic experience that will probably never be repeated equally well, if at all. Sure, the story is ordinary, but structure, montage and mise-en-scene make this movie extraordinary – almost to the point that one feels transported back in time. That's entertainment, folks, and not to be missed, even if you've never seen a silent movie.No movie is perfect, but this one deserves nine out of ten. Recommended for all.February 12, 2013",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Silent movies are for the past?,"No, they are not. All though movies with sound are great, there are still some silent movies that are a must-watch. This is one of them. I am generally not a big fan of silent movies, but I had no problem enjoying this masterpiece.
I love how Michel Hazanavicius plays with the sound, while the movie is still remaining a silent film most of the time. Another thing, that makes this film so great, is how he plays with different camera angles. He, for example, often tilts the camera a little bit to express the emotion of the protagonist. That makes the film so much better to watch.
Also, I know it's sometimes really hard to implement an animal in a film, especially if you want to put it in one of the main roles. Michel Hazanavicius however, does a perfect job with that. The dog of the protagonist George Valentin is one of the best animal-actors I have ever seen.
The only thing that bothered me a little bit is that sometimes there are very long dialogs with too few intertitles in it.Still, I can recommend this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A long walk for such a short black and white story. An Oscar?! Are you sure?!,"Yikes! I was expecting something more to the plot from such an Oscar winning movie. Sure, they nailed the look of old B&W movies of that era but that novelty soon wears thin with the simplistic story line I had to endure with four others in my small town local theater. I mean the ""Munsters"" TV series nailed '30's era B&W with better plots told in 30 minutes.""The Artist"" only ran one short week in my small town Texas theater ONLY AFTER it won the Oscar for Best Picture before it was quickly replaced by newer releases.The long wait and heavy media buzz may have unrealistically raised my expectations but I don't think so even if it is considered an homage to the history of cinema which is sort of ironic since silent movie's had to rely heavily on a well written story with intricate and compelling relationships and plot lines to keep audience's attention for over an hour.Just read some IMDb story lines to a number of Lon Chaney flicks they could've borrowed from like ""The Unknown"", ""Unholy Three"", and ""The Penalty"". They're more involved and complex than what's shown at most Sundance Festivals.""The Unknown"" left me dropped jawed throughout most of the movie because I couldn't believe the level of intelligence written into and acted out in the story line. There were some really smart folks writing and producing silent movies back in the '20's and '30's.

The Artist is funny and dark, and everyone included, even his dog, played such pivotal roles. Who needs movies with a dozen stars with zero plot when there's gems like this.George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is the king of silent movies in Hollywood in 1927 and he knows it. Audiences just adore everything George is a part of. Along comes Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo) who you just know is going to be a huge star some day. George and Peppy work together on one film as George not only takes her under his wing, but an undeniable spark develops between the two.

The movie exudes charm as it develops and then grabs the viewer with its story and symbolism. It turns far darker then I expected and maybe runs a bit long but that doesn't diminish my overall fondness for this picture. Yeah, that's right, this is one swell picture with a cast of good eggs!

It brilliantly depots you to the era when silent films were made,more importantly tells the story of transition of cinema from silent to talkies. it makes you feel the pain and agony that actors of that era must have undergone when talking movies popped in and they had no choice of either scaling up or quitting .Charlie Chaplin also underwent such a bend in his career when he was not ready to commit to talking movies. while pleasing the movie you just cant stop yourself crediting the actor Jean Dujardin for portraying the character so elegantly.he's remarkable in the role of a celebrity star of that era who carries the pride on his shoulder's effectively wearing a smile even in the hard times.there is an impeccable charm around him in the movie you just cant get your eyes of him.he deservingly won an academy for this. i just hope too see him around,hes got bunch of a talent..

My rating: 9,"Bravo for the movie! Very positive and interesting, this film takes us to a time of silent black and white movies. With the difference that the character in silent films loses his voice for a brief moment of time, and in the end everyone start speaking by making the transition from silent films by including speech in them.The storyline revolves around the theme of love and reconciliation between the two types mentioned earlier movies. Directing shows interesting techniques as the main idea remains to return to the silent film in which the actors play similar to that of theatrical counterparts - it is much more expressive. Interesting experience is also the point at which the viewer hears sounds from the others in the room due to the lack of sound in the film.The film is really interesting experience that will definitely knock out of the field of the dangerously capturing trivial.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not Talking' in the Rain,"As Hollywood makes the transition from silent films to talkies in 1927, a silent star is not able to adapt. Not only does this film cover the same theme as ""Singin' in the Rain,"" but Dujardin looks like Gene Kelly. While nicely crafted and well acted, much of the praise that the film has garnered is due to the gimmick that it looks like a silent film. There's a reason silent films have not been made since talkies emerged. Talking adds an important dimension to films. Without this dimension, this simple film runs out of steam half-way through. Dujardin is expressive, but his character is too aloof and self-centered to elicit much sympathy. Bejo is charming. The dog is adorable.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Artist: A heartfelt ode to silent cinema,"""Less is more."" No phrase can better describe this magnificent movie by French director Michel Hazanavicius. In the years, decades since movies gained their voice, what has been produced as a result? A lot of good films, as well as a lot of bad films. Definitely nothing perfect, but after so many years of seeing the same formula, one always looks back to simpler, happier times. The 1920s, otherwise known as The Roaring Twenties, when jazz, liquor, and the movies ruled the United States, was such a time. With filmmaking having transformed, no longer a form of artistic expression, but a scheme for making money, how, just how, can that artistic value be saved? The answer, according to Hazanavicius: take it right back to its roots, back to where it all began.The Artist compresses the entire history of the transition of silent film to the age of ""talkies"" within the course of just under two hours. It's about a silent film star, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), who, in 1927, is a superstar, with his chiseled good looks, jolly attitude, acrobatic tricks, and his faithful, energetic dog (Uggie). While greeting his fans and the press after a premiere, Valentin meets a pretty young woman, whom, after trying to find her dropped purse, finds herself right in front of the famous film star. Ever the jovial spirit, Valentin poses for pictures with the girl, Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), which makes headlines the following day.Peppy, an aspiring actress, is inspired by this encounter with her idol to audition for roles. Although initially turned down by the producer, Al Zimmer (John Goodman), she soon gets a role as an extra with Valentin's assistance. Valentin continues to be a big figure in Hollywood while Peppy is, at first, put in small roles. Then comes the introduction of sound......And to say more would be giving away too much.In addition to having the technical aspects, The Artist has the soul and feel of a silent movie. It tells its story mainly through imagery, and just a few necessary cue cards. When we see how Valentin reacts when seeing the sound recording, his look plants worry, both in him and us. Likewise, when viewing a montage of posters, we see just how the fortunes of characters change.The acting is nothing short of superb. Arguably, the face that will stay with you long after the movie's over is Jean Dujardin's, as George Valentin. He takes a leaf from the books of Douglas Fairbanks and Rudolph Valentino, giving Valentin a confident hero's smile and merry personality, though unlike the above actors, Dujardin doesn't focus merely on the actor side of Valentin. He goes deep into the human side of Valentin, that concealed, vulnerable side which Fairbanks and Valentino never let the press take photos of. As we learn more about his personal life, Valentin, whom we greet at first with just simple admiration and consider a hero, gradually becomes a sympathetic, real human being, someone who warrants our compassion and our (no exaggeration here) love, and who we want to succeed in the end.The other important actor in the film is Bérénice Bejo as Peppy Miller. The actress has that lively energy that goes hand in hand with Dujardin's, and their chemistry is flawless. Their characters are the other's anchors; they keep each other up in times of misfortune for either of them. Likewise, Peppy, who starts off as just a girl who wants to make it in the big time, becomes a person who, like Valentin, deserves our sympathy. She remains a sensible individual, and never loses herself in her dreams even as they become reality.The supporting cast is comprised of many great actors, all of whom do a great job, even if only for a few minutes. Among such well-regarded actors include John Goodman as the stereotypical overweight, bureaucratic producer Al Zimmer, James Cromwell as Clifton, Valentin's loyal butler, and Penelope Ann Miller as Doris, Valentin's strict, emotionally distant wife.It should be noted that, although The Artist is filmed in the U.S., it's primarily a French production. Certain actors, like Goodman, Cromwell, and Miller, and executive producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein, are American, but the lead actors (Dujardin, Bejo) and director Hazanavicius are big names in French cinema. But therein lies the magic of The Artist: the silence unites all actors, and all notions of nationality are forgotten. The silence makes them universal, so there's nothing foreign about them.The Artist is one of those films that's so different from other films of its time that it merits recognition and praise. A silent movie that's made in a time when silent film is considered obsolete, The Artist is both a touching, heartfelt homage to silent cinema and a beautiful, emotionally profound film.So I'd like to end this review by writing a famous quote that's said in a few certain theaters before showing a film:""Silence is golden."" Yes. Yes it is. Rated PG-13. Four stars out of four.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The times change...,"The Artist by Michel Hazanaviciusis a film that succesfully represents the period of transition from silent films to talkies and the way it affected the different studios, actors and actresses.In the case of George Valentin, played by Jean Dujardin, he has to go through the fall of his career as he refuses to act in ""talkie"" films. Dujardin does a great job acting out all the emotions that his character go through, making it easy for us to understand what's going on. Same can be said about Bérénice Bejo, the actress of Peppy Miller.The main reason that I don't rate it higher is because the lack of talking made it hard and tiring for me to keep up with everything that is happening, so lost interest after a while.

Best picture Oscar for a B&W silent movie? Hollywood is nuts,"I think Hollywood has lost it's collective mind by giving a best picture Oscar to a black and white mostly silent movie in the 1.33 to 1 format. There is a reason movies started to move away from that format in the 1930s - IT IS BORING and is like looking at TV dramas from the 50s. What has happened here is that the Hollywood elite and the critics and not real movie goers have gotten all caught up in the artistry of making an old time movie today. Aside from the technical issues, the story itself is just barely interesting and can't keep your attention thru the whole movie. Do yourself a favor and save your money.

A very original piece of story telling,"A genuine original, clever, witty and engaging - rather like me in fact.Original and witty in the way The Artist tells its story and that is what makes it so engaging. The story about some of the biggest stars of the silent era being unable to make the transition to talkies is as old as the hills. This way of telling that story it is as fresh as a daisy.The way the audience engages with the film is noticeably different. In places you're almost lip reading. The Artist also underlines the point that is the story and how it is told that makes the film and not colour, FX, 3D, etc.The theme is how the world inevitably changes as some people benefit because of some change while others do not as they are unable to adapt. George Valentin's (Jean Dujardin) flaw that leads to his downfall is his overly conservative attitude and refusing to believe the tastes of the paying public are so very unlike his own (reminds me of a few film critics). As the paying public quickly take to talkies George rapidly becomes a dinosaur.Of course it is essentially a love story. Berenice Bejo does a great job of playing Peppy Miller the reason why George gets his life back together.The Artist is an uplifting tale told in an original way. The fact The Artist makes use of the conventions of the silent era suggests that it is not entirely forgotten.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The best thing in 3D times,"In a world where movies are converted to 3D just because this is the new trend, where we hardly see any hand-drawn animation, where acclaimed directors start using 3D, a black-and-white, silent (2D) movie really stands out. I can only imagine how Martin Scorsese must've felt at the Oscars.The Artist is a wonderful film, highly emotional, funny a lot of times, enjoyable and technically well done. It is definitely worth watching: amazing performances, great story, stunning visuals and magical music. The fact that the movie is silent, makes it even better, because sounds and silences have a way deeper meaning this way. (You can't really eat popcorn to this film, though. Everyone will hear your crunching.)It is a very good thing that The Artist was able to win the Oscars, it's just kind of sad that it failed at the box office.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Fun and Fitting Tribute to Hollywood's Golden Age,"If someone had told me at the beginning of 2011 that the best picture of the coming year would be a French-made tribute to silent era Hollywood, I never would have believed them. And if they said it would be a silent movie, I would have thought them quite mad. And I don't think I would have been alone. Which is why it's both a shock and a delight that for the first time since the inaugural Academy Awards, a silent film has swept the Oscars and become the toast of Hollywood.And how could it not? It's the ultimate exercise in nostalgia, albeit for a time few if any of us are old enough to remember. It's a portal to a simpler, more innocent, and more glamorous time, even if that's only the way we remember it. It pays tribute to practically every genre of the time, from swashbucklers and safari flicks to high society romances and the dance numbers of Fred and Ginger. True, its story of fading silent film star George Valentino and rising talkies actress Peppy Mills wouldn't have been all that original even then, yet that only adds to the timeless feel. Because the Artist doesn't hearken back to the silent era, it recreates it in near perfect detail.The costumes, the sets, the title cards, all are all straight out of an old-time two reeler. The dances are exactly as they were in the twenties. The musical score, heavy on jazz and vaudeville, sounds like it was penned in Tinpan Alley. Just like a real film from the period, the footage speeds up during tense or frantic scenes. The only clue that the Artist belongs to the twenty first century is that the picture quality is so high; lacking the graininess and occasional dark spots of the old celluloid reels.Even the cinematography seems to be from a bygone era, eschewing pans, tracking shots, and smooth transitions for the static camera shots and quick cuts that predominated at the time. Although this dedication to using period techniques does limit the variety of shots that can be used, the filmmakers compensate by filling the shots with movement and interaction between the actors. This is epitomized by a cutaway shot of the studio offices. As the protagonists briefly converse, dozens of figures pass them in every direction along two hallways and the wide staircase joining them. With more movements than the eye can keep up with, the scene reminded me of the grand spectacles of Metropolis and Modern Times.And the stars are simply wonderful. Their gestures are broad and exaggerated, their faces wonderfully expressive as they convey shock, anger, or sadness. With a hesitant smile or a smug lift of the chin they say nearly as much as they could by speaking. As George Valentin, Jean Dujardin bears an uncanny resemblance to Douglas Fairbanks, with just a touch of William Powell thrown in. At the beginning of the picture, he radiates strength, vitality, and the joy of a man doing what he loves. But as the years pass and his career fades, the lines on his brow multiply and his prominent chin seems to recede. It's almost like seeing Mark of Zorro and Prisoner of Zenda side by side.Leading lady Bérénice Bejo doesn't strike a strong resemblance to any particular starlet of the period, but rather could pass for any young woman of the roaring twenties with her toothy grin, narrow hips, and flapper haircut. And of course the real star of this picture is Uggie, who may be the most photogenic canine since Nick and Nora's terrier Astra. His tricks are as impressive as any Lassie or Rin-Tin-Tin ever did, and even more adorable. I'm hopeful that this won't be his only role.Although it may not be the deepest or most complex of films, the Artist is surely among the most magical and delightful. Its attention to detail and love for its medium make it a treat for fans of the silent era, and its simplicity and sweetness will endear it even to those less familiar with the classics. It would seem that this year in Hollywood, all that's old is new again.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Imaginative,"I thought this was a really interesting film. Did a great job storytelling with some really dedicated actors. I loved the scenes where the silent film wall was broken, where you could really see the impact of the transition of movie culture. Enjoyed this entire movie and thought it was told very well. I would go as far as to say this movie could be remade as a thriller, where silent film actors are forced into a world of talking films and they are haunted by the everyday implications.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The artist is an intreaguing film,"The artist is a movie that really makes you think about how everyone these days is so used to sound that we never think about how amazing the older silent films are.

"Awful, awful, awful!!!","This was an absolute waste of time, I found the central character repugnant and the lead actress to be wooden and two dimensional, the style was kitsch, story was predictable so I hated every minute of 'The Artist'. I enjoyed James Cromwell (as ever) and others in the supporting cast where there were one or two moments where I had a brief chuckle (hence the 3/10 otherwise 0/10) at some small joke but there was very little in this to endear me to it. I write this as an avid silent movie fan (Chaplin, Lloyd etc. etc.) but this movie from the first moment had me wanting to punch the smug central character full in the face! I see there are one or two people who have written low score reviews on IMDb going against the groundswell of favourable opinion, but in my view this had little or nothing to recommend it as an experience and I almost want to see it again to check whether it is actually as bad as I experienced it today! I suspect this movie is a little like Marmite, you either love it or loathe it there really isn't much in between. I watched about five minutes of 'The Artist' before I started to think about leaving the cinema and going home (something I've done only once or twice over 35 years of going to the cinema!). To sum up this was a cinema experience I can barely believe and I'm looking forward to seeing anything at the movies just to erase the memory of this as the last film I've seen!",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
A master-piece in charm,"(93%) A wonderful homage throwback to early Hollywood cinema, with a superb spot-on eye for detail featuring scenes that really wouldn't be out of place in one of the better actual silent period movies. The set design, the costumes, the soundtrack, are all so finely integrated into every single shot, and the performances are absolutely terrific as the talent leaps from the screen without (almost) a single word said. Script wise it's very clever, and very well structured without its complete lack of the spoken word ever hampering its ambitions, or detracting from its abundant charm. A true, pretty much perfect slice of cinematic joy.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simply brilliant!,"I can honestly say that I haven't enjoyed a film as much as I did 'The Artist' in a long time; from start to finish this movie is absolutely superb. From the attention to detail in recreating the era of silent movies (it's black and white and even presented in 1.33:1 aspect ratio) to the mesmerising acting, it is a loving homage that can't fail to entertain and charm. Dujardin, in a surely Oscar winning performance, is George Valentin a silent movie actor, who along with his dog (another scene stealing performance) is a big star, so what could possibly go wrong? Well the invention of the talkies and its rising starlet Peppy Miller (Bejo). Not only does George have a hand in the discovery of Peppy but he also falls madly in love with her. As her ascension continues Georges fame wanes and after a failed attempt to hold onto the old ways he admits defeat and becomes washed up, an outdated relic in a medium that's embracing the future. With amazing cinematography from Guillaume Schiffman it's a joy to watch as it recreates perfectly the films and feel of the time and while cleverly presenting a traditional love story it is both gripping and fascinating to watch. The music also goes a long way to help give it the desired effect as, apart from two scenes with sound, that is all you hear. In an age where we talk about the death of cinema and gimmicks like 3D are trying to woo audiences it's just so refreshing to see something that not only has a story but lacks the CGI that Hollywood so readily relies on. It was apparently the directors dream project and it shows but it was also clearly a labour of love for everyone involved making 'The Artist' simply one of the best films you'll see all year.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Thoroughly Enjoyable!,"I have never written a review of a current film, but if there ever was one that deserved the time it takes to input this, THE ARTIST is it! It's outrageously terrific and the film-makers deserve 10/10 for their audacity. Jean Dujardin is wonderful in the role of a silent screen star and the sets, costumes and ambiance are very true to the period. There are many memorable - in fact, unforgettable - moments in this gem. At a screening in Los Angeles, John Goodman said that, like in silent films, the actors were improvising dialog as they went but because Dujardin and Bejo were speaking in French and Goodman in English, it was very difficult to concentrate. Bejo added that director Hazanvicius had music playing during filming. Hazanavicius has shown from his homage to the O.S.S. spy films of the 60's, that he can recreate filmic styles. THE ARTIST was a much more difficult venture. To even attempt a silent black and white film is completely counter-intuitive in today's marketplace, but trust the French to pull it off! The bottom line is - it REALLY WORKS.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I really recommend you watch,"This film is a silent and black-and-white movie. This story is love story. Of course, there are no lines, however, instead of using lines there are much background music. Those music are very nice, I'm deeply moved those. Thanks to a lot of background music, we can feel character's affections. Moreover, even if there is no color, we can feel color through background music and cast's expressions. Those music and expressions show very sensitive feelings. I think those are the special aspect of silent and black-and -white movie. Though cast's acting is awesome, I think the best actor in this film is a dog. I'm really surprised it because it's really look like human actor. I can't call the dog as It, I should call the dog, He. I've never watch such a good dog actor in my life. I think this film is a surely cinematic masterpiece. Everyone should see this film.",,Anonymous,Romance
A Masterpiece,"Since the French invented cinema, its only best they pay tribute to the silent film era with this lovely, amazing film about the transition from silent to sound. Jean Dujardin earns his Best Actor Oscar, and the film earns its Best Picture Oscar with this amazing production. Berenice Bejo was absolutely stunning.I can see why it was such a hit when it came out.If this was American-made, it would have sacrificed story for character exposition. Since its a French film, it is an artistic study of an artistic time in Hollywood, when it was about the art (to a degree). A seventh art look at first film American art, so to speak.It is a shame the silent film revival trend ended with this film. One would think that it would spur Hollywood to venture out and try it out again, but Hollywood is no longer brave in that technique anymore, and everyone prefers talkies. Still, for 2011, it was quite a worthwhile risk.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Way Overrated,"This movie slogs along on some tried & true Hollywood tropes & lots of long slow stretches of treacly sentimentality. The ""hero"" is supposed to represent an icon from the classic period of silent film but from the few movies you see him performing in it's hard to tell if he's supposed to be Fairbanks, Chaplin or Valentino.I think The Artist would have worked better if he had been a consistent character with backbone & spunk because ultimately he just turns out to be Norman Maine, from A Star is Born, wallowing in self-pity.Harold Lloyd made many films in a similar vein but every scene was filled with inventiveness & humor as well as pathos.The dog should have received the Oscar.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Silence is golden,"When I first saw the trailer for The Artist, it convinced me to go see the film. I didn't know it was a ""silent"" movie. I only found that out later. Then I became more intrigued. How would they pull this off without losing the audience? As I sat down in the cinema, nothing could prepare me for this wonderful movie. I don't make a habit of watching dramas. A trip to the pictures is too expensive for me, so I only go to see something special. And this was it. Beautifully directed, with a smart and inventive script, and mesmerizing performances from the elegant and very funny cast. But as if that wasn't enough, something else happened inside that cinema. Something magical. People stopped tapping and rustling and talking and... listened. It was the first time I have ever heard a cinema so silent. This film is genuinely affecting. Funny, moving, sad, joyous. And a little tap dancing thrown in for good measure! So my thanks to the filmmakers for such a great evening.

Sometimes the script is not all that important,"There's a problem with the rating system, I'm not saying I can offer a better one, but still.

There's no need to excuse the black and white, or the lack of speech in the film, not only because it makes cinematic sense, it practically works for the film and improves it. The cinematography is super, the acting is superb, with the two leads excelling beyond everyone else, mostly because they do have great characters written for them, but obviously also because they're up for the task.Go see this film, and try not to dwell too much on what's missing in the story, what we do get to see is so well done it makes up for it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not only in films that evolution we live, the world is changing every second, but we have learned once again that in the game of movement, we also evolved, there are many who have trouble, but if we are lucky to find that people who motivate us again, we will return to the track of our days at the perfect time dance movement.

"‎""The Artist"" - far better than your average Hollywood mass-production, but lacks the important qualities of a true cinematic masterpiece...","""The Artist"" is one of those movies often misunderstood for different reasons by different groups of viewers.One group that got ""The Artist"" wrong was those simple souls who honestly complained: ""What? A silent movie about actors?? With a weird music and a silly story set in the ancient 1920s when people wore strange clothes and even did not have cool iPhones yet??? And just I missed my favorite TV show because of that so-called masterpiece????""On the opposite side of the specter were those who ecstatically muttered something like ""Wow! A silent movie about actors!! With a heavenly music and a charming story set in the Roaring Twenties when people wore beautiful dresses and those nasty iPhones were not yet invented!!! Oh, this is so much better than that primitive show that I quietly watch on TV every day in deep secret from all of my super-sophisticated esthetically advanced friends!!!!""It took me a while to find a suiting metaphor for ""The Artist"", but eventually I came up with the ""antique furniture"". Many people enjoy antique furniture – wealthy collectors and curious museum exhibition attendees alike. Antique furniture is often a finest, elegant, unique work of an imaginative and resourceful artisan, a work full of style and harmony.However, there is a clear distinction between a mere craftsman and a genuine artist, between the finest piece of antique furniture and a true masterpiece of art - a painting, a sculpture, a poem, a piece of music.Back to those who misunderstood ""The Artist"" - the ""antique furniture"" metaphor turned out to be a helpful tool for better defining the two groups of viewers mentioned above. People in the first group were not even capable of noticing the tastefully refined, unique, and overall very impressive antique trinket. People in the second group did notice it, but mistook the exquisite, nicely made knick-knack for a piece of true art.At the end, ""The Artist"" does for the slightly more sophisticated audience the very same thing that the endless cookie-cutter comedies and action movies mass-produced by Hollywood do for the slightly less sophisticated audience: it simply entertains, nothing more and nothing less.Yes, ""The Artist"" admittedly entertains the target audience more elegantly, with impeccable style, in more refined and sophisticated ways than many other movies. It boasts strong, clever directing and exquisitely smart screenplay filled with sparkling humor ( Michel Hazanavicius), great acting ( Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Bejo, James Cromwell, John Goodman, Malcolm McDowell and others), and is quite distinguished in many other areas: from music (Ludovic Bource), to costumes (Mark Bridges), to art direction (Laurence Bennett, Robert Gould), to cinematography (Guillaume Schiffman).Nevertheless, ""The Artist"" lacks something fundamentally important, something that made ""SunsetBoulevard"" (the famous 1950 movie with a similar premise - a former Hollywood silent movie star fading into obscurity) a masterpiece - the power, the depth, and that elusive magic of a true master work of art.A great work of art mysteriously molds the content, the form, and the execution into an indescribable heavenly harmony beyond mere mortal's comprehension. While the creators of the ""The Artist"" can be commended for the superior execution, both the form and the content of the movie demonstrate certain regrettable weaknesses.Neither fish nor flesh, the film ends up as a funny sentimental fairy tale - not hilarious enough for a great comedy, not serious enough for a great tragedy, and not deep enough for a great drama. It is entertaining but unmoving, elegant and stylish but superficial.I liked the ""The Artist"", but I was far from falling in love with it. It was cute, unique, and charming but far from overpowering or irresistible.Far better than your average Hollywood mass-production, ""The Artist"" can be a great entertainment for those able to appreciate the movie at its true value. It nevertheless lacks the important qualities that mark a true cinematic masterpiece.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Comedy, love, and a bit with a dog.","It is the late 1920s, and a silent screen idol is at the height of his fame when a chance encounter with a girl in the crowd starts her out on the road to stardom, while his own hubris will cause him to risk everything when the coming of sound changes their fortunes.If a few months ago, I had suggested that the best film of the year would be a completely silent movie shot in black and white, with intertitle cards, a 1.33 aspect ratio and all the rest of the 1920s movie trimmings , what might have you expected? Most likely a cunning spoof or skit on early movies, made with a knowing wink to a modern audience? Or perhaps a resolutely technical exercise? a slavish copy of the authentic article, perfectly reproducing every nuance of the form for a minority group of buffs to stroke beards sagely in appreciation of?The wonder of Michel Hazanavicius' slice of silent heaven is that all the skills needed for the above, and more, are deployed invisibly, seemingly effortlessly, in creating pure, unabashed entertainment. This is a simple, but expertly honed tale of fame and fortune, of loss and despair, of romance, friendship and second chances. It is exactly the sort of charming, snappy caper that they (we are oft told) don't make 'em like any more, and the seemingly bold move to make a movie, about silent movies, as a silent movie, is no arch piece of artistic grandstanding, but a spot-on decision from a master craftsman to put film-making form totally at the service of the story being told.Great performances abound across the board. The central couple of Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo are wonderful as the debonair, self-obsessed matinée idol, and the perky starlet-in-the-making. John Goodman has never been better cast than as a cigar chomping Hollywood producer, and the ever dependable James Cromwell oozes quiet dignity as a faithful assistant. But it is no poor reflection upon any of these uniformly superb players to note that they are nonetheless repeatedly acted off the screen by a Jack Russell named Uggie!Whatever you may be expecting, whatever misgivings you might have about the idea of sitting for two hours in a darkened room watching what one could reasonably imagine to be some kind of quirky satire or art-house indulgence will swiftly be forgotten. The Artist is a perfect little gem of a movie, a joy for anyone who loves cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Artist transition from Silent to Talkies.,"The Artist: I hear of people who see Charlie Chaplin movies and Laurel Hardy movies but i don't recollect watching full movies of them , a little glimpse here and there when i was a kid. The artist is really an exemplary experiment. A charming dashing silent hero whose smile warms the cockles of ones heart is slowly rendered obsolete by the talking movies. Who knew so much can be conveyed with not ...one word being said.The charm of silent movies where a live orchestra was played while the film rolled and theaters had these charming glamorous round balconies with people dressed to the nines is brought out really well. Will the pride of the dwindling star send him to oblivion or will he reinvent himself and change with the times with the helping hand of a guardian angel Peppy Miller the new star of talking movies. Watch to find out. I thought that ""The Artist"" was an original thought but it seems to by super-heavily inspired from the movie ""Singin' in the Rain"" a 1952 musical.It has the cheerfull-ness of the 1920's in Gene Kelly's smile and easy nature and in the high pitch of the actress's voice. SITR also talks about the transformation of movies from silent to talkies but in comparison unlike Jean Dujardin in Artist which is self destructive and gloomy, the transition for the actor Gene Kelly is much at ease probably due to his constant companion Cosmos who provides comedy and support to Gene's character and the actress Kathy his love interest. In ""the artist"" tap dancing is shown to come to their rescue at the end of the movie. In ""singin in the rain "" it is a part of the narrative in the middle of the movie which helps them transition from silent to talkies.It's an enjoyable watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Goodbye to cinema,"I can not believe my eyes. An average 8.4 rating in IMDb? This? Really? I think the only answer to my bewilderment must be the marketing campaign behind this title, and the prestige the Oscar give to it. And how can this movie, with a commonplace script (so simple, predictable, and slow it makes you nervous), with a story so old fashioned and a staging so plain I was taking glimpses of my watch within 40 minutes into the movie, knowing already how the story would evolve, and what would be the ending, how can a film like this be nominated and win so many prizes???? My only answer is, ironically, the cinema era is finished, and we have produced nothing more valuable that this. I say ironically, because the The Artist dwells precisely in the same spot, the crisis cinema went through when it went from silent to sound. Now, I think we are living the end of the big cinema industry, and the emigration of every talent to TV. The aesthetics of The ARtist can be spared, though. Specially the protagonist dresses, really marvelous, the faces and smiles of both protagonists, really gorgeous, the black and white silent (with music) elements, and the 4:3 screen, to celebrate old times. But at the same time, it is an insult to those marvelous silent movies, to Chaplin, and Keaton for example, with stories so exciting and original they are still modern today, and of course, to Sunset Boulevard, the wonderful B. Wilder film about the decadence of golden era film stars. That was ART. This is only a (succesful) attempt to make money.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great homage to the silent era, gripping narrative and fantastic use of sound, when it is used","The Artist (Dir. Michel Hazanavicius, 2011) focuses on the career of a silent film star and his transition into the classical Hollywood era where ""talkies"" dominate. His career is contended by the incredible performances of a new star, Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo). The film progresses, following her rise and his demise.The Artist is colourless and silent which can be off-putting for the generic film going audience who would prefer to watch another Transformer film. The story is an interesting one and pays great homage to the films of the silent era. Through the lack of sound I became more engaged with the plot and characters of The Artist as there were no conversations or sound effects to distract ones eye or ear from the films narrative. When watching it, comparisons between The Artist and Singin' in the Rain (Dir. Stanley Donen & Gene Kelly, 1952) cannot be overlooked. They both contain very similar narratives, where one actor is forced out by ""talkies"" while another succeeds.Unlike silent movies from the early 20th century, this film does incorporate scenes of sound within in the film. Counting it up after watching the film I believe there are in-fact only two scenes in the whole hour and a half that use diegetic sound. One scene occurs early in the film where George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), the film's protagonist, suffers a nightmare on how he won't cope with the transition to sound. This scene is superbly produced. All the objects Valentin contacts with, in the dream, make sounds as he interacts with them, but he himself cannot speak. This scene is hauntingly spectacular as the footage that precedes and follows this scene is silent and accompanied but a music hall soundtrack. This nightmare scene, however, has no soundtrack and only the diegetic sound of the objects Valentin touches.The camera work and editing techniques are similar to that of film- making in the 1920s. Modern techniques are, however, used within The Artist as well. At multiple points newspaper headlines are layered onto the film so as to provide more of a narrative. These techniques were used in early cinema, but not to the extent or effect that they are in The Artist. As I mentioned before, this film pays a great homage to the classics created by the first film-makers.Another noteworthy aspect of this film is the acting. For a French film there is a large number of popular American faces. This will be due to the film being set in the United States. Actors John Goodman and James Cromwell play producer Al Zimmer and Valentin's butler. These actors are fantastic, along with the previous mentioned Dujardin and Bejo, and create an unforgettable film. Another actor that needs recognition is Valentin's dog. It is one of the most important characters in the film and also provides great comic relief; the inter-titles near the end of the film states that Valentin ""owes his life to that dog"", referring to a house fire. But subtly I think the inter-titles are implying that the dog helped make Valentin's career.The idea of silent films is often off-putting for a generic film audience, as mentioned. But this film should seriously be considered for anyone who enjoys a good film. I also heavily recommend viewing it at the pictures as cinema is the medium films like this are intended for.If you enjoyed this review then check out my other reviews on: http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Amazing Homage to Old Hollywood,"When I was in college, I tried to convince my friends to come together and do a silent, black and white short film project as a little homage and a bit of fun. I was shot down repeatedly and told that no one shared my interest in the classic style, and I'm so glad that THE ARTIST came along and proved them wrong in a big way. As I'm sure you're already aware, THE ARTIST is a silent film and presented in black and white, going so far as to include the piano music we expect with your usual silent film. THE ARTIST is a great movie and I was excited to see it garner so much attention (and a crap load of awards including the Academy Award for Best Picture). It's nice to see that a movie that could be considered the polar opposite of mainstream in any real sense would be so popular. The film is set in Hollywood in the late 20's and early 30's when silent film was at it's peak and the introduction of talking pictures was on the rise. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is cinema's top leading man, a class act with his trusty dog. Valentin is the most beloved actor of his time, but when talking pictures become the next big sensation, George finds it all a little far-fetched and decides against joining the fad. When talking pictures leave silent film in their dust, Valentin's star dims and the world obsesses with Peppy Miller, a beautiful and charismatic young dancer who made her big break as an extra in a Valentin film.THE ARTIST is a wonderful film in a myriad of ways. It's a true homage to a style of filmmaking that's been gone for decades. Most people probably haven't even seen a silent film, and I know I've encountered a dozen or so people who won't even watch a black and white film because it's ""old"" or ""boring"". THE ARTIST and all of it's awards/attention might be enough to get people who wouldn't otherwise give a silent film their time the motivation to give it a chance. This is a beautiful film, no doubt about it. It glitters and shines like you'd expect from an old school Hollywood spectacle back when it had class. You can't help but smile as you watch the film because the characters are so charming and the fun is contagious. This is an ultimate feel-good movie, even when it reaches its darkest point. Director Michel Hazanavicius has created a glimpse into Hollywood bright and shining history. The stars, Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo (whom I didn't even recognize as the lady-in- waiting from A KNIGHT'S TALEman, she's come a long way), are fantastic. Dujardin is charismatic and fun, you are drawn into his struggle when he becomes Hollywood's old news. Silent films are out, and Valentin is too stubborn and set in his ways to change. His replacement, Peppy Miller (Bejo) is everything you'd want in a Hollywood starlet. She's beautiful, perpetually happy, with big eyes and an infectious smile. Plus, she's got talent. She quickly rises through the ranks to the top of the movie scene, where a dejected Valentin can only watch with regret.While THE ARTIST is a pretty amazing movie, it's not without a few minor flaws. Really, my only complaint with the film was that it did feel its lengths at times. Towards the middle of the film when Valentin's downward slide is nearing it's conclusion and the stage is being set for his eventual revival, it feels a little long but not unbearable. You just become eager to see the next phase of his struggle. And one minor, albeit aggravating complaint, on my part: why is Malcolm McDowell given billing on the home video and marketing materials when he is literally in the movie for a minute? Seriously, I was excited at the prospect of McDowell in the film but he has a brief cameo assupposedly a butlerI'm not sure. He's just sort of sitting in on an extra's casting session. He's there and then he's gone. Still, the movie boasts an impressive supporting cast with James Cromwell and John Goodman, both putting in great performances. There is a lot to love about this film and I'm sure it deserves plenty of recognition but I'm sure that there are some out there that will say it's only being held in high regard because it's the first silent film in years and it panders to old Hollywood. That might be the case, but I couldn't care less as it's a really enjoyable film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Silence is its strongest power,"This is the first film that I chose to review during my Oscar Marathon 2012 and already I can tell this is the contender to beat.Knowing a thing or two about black and white films, I am already amazed by how much The Artist manages to preserve all the classic characteristics and techniques of the films from the era it supposedly represents...for instance the static shots on a typical set of a staircase that you can only see in old films.Acting is flawless (All lead actors nailed their roles throughout) and some scenes are very cleverly shot using the essence of silent movements in the movie. But above all, this film has in its entirety paid homage to a very important history in movie-making (change from silent to talkies), and even though it utilizes musical score synonymous to a typical orchestra accompanying silent movies of those era, the visual appeal and body language alone are its strongest communication tool.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Silence of Love,"On the surface 'The Artist' is a simple love story; a period love story set during the times of turbulent transition when cinema broke its silence and acquired a voice. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) the swashbuckling star of silent films is unable to make the transition to talking films and finds himself upstaged by his upstart costar, the effervescent Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo). How Peppy's love for him, ably aided by a totally adorable canine, helps Valentin redeem himself is the essence of the film. The challenge before the director Michel Hazanavicius, who has also written the screenplay, is to get all the emotions - pride, anger, jealousy etc – typical of a love story, across to us in a silent film.Yes, 'The Artist' is a silent film in black and white. It is this painstakingly constructed retro format that gives a classic texture to the film. Unusually for a silent film, the inter-titles are very sparse and the director relies heavily on the music to convey the emotions of a scene. And the musical score of composer Ludovic Bource, ranging from sombre symphonies to lilting melodies majestically rises to the occasion. Since music is the only sound of the film, it leaves a lasting impression on the mind Sound does make a stunning entry, twice in fact, during the film and catches us totally by surprise. The first is a cleverly disguised dream sequence about 30 minutes into the film. Valentin dreams that he has lost his voice, and how better to convey this than introducing sound to the inanimate objects! The second appearance of sound is in the very last minute of the film, when the director shouts CUT! And you are left with a disconcerting feeling of having watched a film within a film within a film.'The Artist' is anything but a hackneyed love story and there are layers to be peeled away, if you like, to get under the skin of George Valentin. Why he does what he does is a mystery and more mysterious is the transformation wrought by the silent words of a cop, whose mouth is shown in an astonishing close-up. There are several uncomfortable questions to be asked and answered, without in anyway diminishing the enjoyment of the film.But, 'The Artist' ends sweetly and gives you a feel good factor of love having triumphed over everything. It is also about the magic of moving images, the magic so lovingly captured in the numerous shots of anxious faces glued to the screen. Hazanavicius pays tributes to hoary legends of cinema by making references to their works.

A delightful slice of nostalgia,"I am a big fan of The Thin Man series, and connected instantly with Valentin's pencil thin mustache, cocky little smirk (in the first half of the movie), and the dog! Of course, the story line is very different. It is a simple story really. Boy at the pinnacle of his career meets struggling girl and gives her a helping hand. Then boy meets girl once again, this time as he is going downhill and she is climbing up. This midpoint is captured rather literally although still prettily on the screen with a set of staircases with Valentin coming down after a disappointing business meet and an upbeat Peppy bouncing up the steps. I won't go on with the rest of the story so as not to play a spoiler. It is an old fashioned love story - you will come out with a broad smile.A note on B&W silent cinema - no sound, little animation or special FX - with so little to work with, the best directors of the time wove magic on the screen. And this retro gem of a movie does the same. Comedy, drama, and romance all come together in a clever mix. The acting was top notch - the two main actors were superb. The movie swept me up and took me back in time into the 1920s and 1930s Hollywood as old superstars of the silent era gave way to the new talking stars.Catch it in the movie halls if you can.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pay tribute to the classic,"To be honest, it is somewhat unfair to make classic silent films. After all, the era is developing. With the continuous development of science and technology, the technology of films is advancing rapidly. People are slowly dazzled by these advanced film technologies. Many people's technical requirements have also improved. People gradually forget the appearance of black and white films. Suddenly, such a black and white film appears, It can really change the taste of the audience. The structure of such a film is very simple, which makes it clear to the audience at a glance. The distinction between the two opposites is clear. The humor of the hero and the fashion of the heroine are all expressed in a very good way. However, there are some uninteresting and meaningless lines and dialogues. It can only be said to watch a new and simple ordinary film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An obnoxious stunt film,"In a modern age of cinema, directors sometimes opt to go with black and white for artistic reasons, and it often works for those films. I rewatched Schindler's List after seeing The Artist for the first time yesterday, and the 1993 Best Picture winner was totally worthy of the honour. A silent film for the sake of ""artistic"" reasons, on the other hand, you pretty much never see, until this. There's a reason we stopped making silent films, after all, as it's generally a lower form of art. A film, at least for me, is usually defined by its dialogue, and an actor by his/her delivery. And it's the way drama is supposed to be. If you went to a Shakespeare play at the Globe Theatre, would you be able to hear the actors, or would you just see them mouth their lines, occasionally with cards held up indicating some of what they said?The Artist explores a cliché concept, a silent actor struggling to adjust to sound, that we've seen done before, and better, with Sunset Blvd. (1950) and Singin' in the Rain (1952). This one is simply distinguished by an obnoxious stunt, being silent (or mostly silent), with the usual problems that come with it. Most of the dialogue is not only inaudible, it's not written on the cards, leaving you to guess what it is, unless you're HAL 9000. And to tell a story not worth retelling. What was the point of this film, aside from anything we hadn't seen before from Sunset Blvd. or Singin' in the Rain? Just to see the cute little doggie? A low point among Best Picture Oscar-winners, to claim this is better than The Descendants or A Separation baffles me.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
celebrating the beginnings of cinema as an art form,"The Artist is not trying to be an authentic silent film, but instead wishes to present a novel but respectful nod to the silent era of Classical Hollywood. It is full of references and reads like Hazanavicius' love letter to an era of filmmaking which he – and we – are indebted to. In a time when films like Avatar are attempting to revolutionise cinema by making IMAX 3D the next coming of sound, I'm surprised The Artist was even made. But I'm glad it was. To me it serves as a much-needed look back at the essential beginnings of the art form. Already receiving considerable popular success, The Artist could herald the beginning of an era when mainstream filmmakers and audiences alike become more aware and influenced by the origins of cinema. Apart from all that, The Artist also stands alone as an altogether sad, funny, compelling and entertaining film.http://ionlyaskedwhatyouthought.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pure Retro Joy,"George Valentin is the silent movie star. He and his dog, Jack, are the stars of many a hit film. They are loved by their public and boy, do they know it. But George's life is about to be turned upside down by the advent of a new technology - sound. George's pride and arrogance make him blind to the fact that the audience want to hear their stars as well as see them, and so begins his slow slide into obscurity.The story to the Artist is a well worn one, and one that was a staple of many of the melodramas of the period it recreates. It is a good enough story, well told and well acted even if it drags a little towards the end, but it is not where the true joy of ""The Artist"" lies.The Artist is wonderful for a huge number of reasons. Firstly the performances from everyone involved are superb, delivering their (silent) lines with the perfect collection of facial expressions and body language. You may not be able to keep up with what they are saying, but you understand what their characters are feeling. Those of you who may be worried about enjoying a silent film, don't be. The film draws you in and involves you with the characters and their story. You don't miss a thing.Though the entire cast are spectacular, especially Jean Dejardin and Berenice Bejo as George and Pepe, I felt a special love for Penelope Ann Miller as George's wife Doris, James Cromwell as Clifton, and a fantastically curmudgeonly Malcolm McDowell as an unimpressed extra. Auggie the Dog though, as George's most loyal friend, is spectacular. He delivers a genuine performance as opposed to just seeming to be a collection of cute tricks. What could have been cutesy or mawkish comes across as genuinely believable.On the technical front the film is unusual and innovative. The film makers commit to a historically accurate 4:3 ratio image, to title cards and simple graphics to highlight their story, but this also allows them to play around with the conventions. The locked off, fixed cameras of the silent era is often mixed in with more modern dolly shots; there are hints of colourisation, occasional graphic touches appear that were beyond film makers of the late 1920s. All these little touches highlight a point, emphasise a character or underline an emotion.All of this technical detail is enhanced by the wonderful score which swells, drops, meanders, dances, mopes and soars along with the audience's emotions. Because of the lack of dialogue and sound effects, ""The Artist"" highlights the power of music and moving pictures to deliver emotion to the audience.The re-creation of early Hollywood and Burbank is detailed but not glorious. Unlike beautiful re-creations such as LA Confidential however, the Hollywood of ""The Artist"" feels a busy, lively and warm place. There is a sense of community throughout the film: people may forget who you were, but they don't forget that you are a person.This is key to the film's charm. It isn't mean-spirited. It reminded me of ""It's a Wonderful Life"", a film that never fails to make you smile.But most importantly of all, it reminds you of the power of moving pictures. One wonderful sequence is a long static shot of two floors and an interconnecting staircase on which our leads stand, conversing. Around them, above them, below them, past them, rush busy people. All this movement all around the frame just serves to underline the immobility of our romantic leads - so involved are they in each other, the world is literally passing them by. It is wonderfully romantic, warm and delicate scene, but achieved without the use of sound, speech or even our leads in focus.It isn't perfect, some on-screen prompts come across as clumsy and the shallow plot sags just a bit in the final third, but the charm and wit of the piece easily surmounts this minor quibbles. It is hard not to dislike a film that delivers its fair quotient of zingers via the medium of text.The film is warm, romantic, witty, smart and utterly charming. It deserves to win many an award.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely delightful,"If you're a fan of old movies, or even if you've been afraid of being put off by them, ""The Artist"" is a great way to ease yourself into the medium. The size of the screen, the typefaces, the quality of film, the gestures, all the graphic design, the sweeping score, the dazzling acting -- all of it is pure vintage Hollywood.The lead's smile is pure Gene Kelly but his style is absolute Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Tremendous style and panache. Poppy isn't nearly so true to the art form (I was disappointed to see that no woman bit the back of her hand, the standard indication of horror, surprise, or shock in the silents!) but is still winning as George's true love.The picture is primarily delightfully comic, with even a terrier-like dog reminiscent of Asta from the ""Thin Man"" movies, but has elements of pathos borrowed from ""A Star is Born."" The story bogged down a bit about two-thirds of the way through, but quickly got back on track with driving energy reaching a wonderful finale.My last point is merely a comment on what a treat it was to go to the movies and not be jolted in my seat by the sound of explosions or experience sensory overload with special effects.

Thunderous silence,"With every change in technology and popular tastes, there are those who are left by the wayside when they are unable or unwilling to adapt. And, in contrast, there are those who quickly find themselves better off than they were before. We, of course, know what happens to the latter, but what of the former?On his way into the theater for the premiere of his latest film, silent movie star George Valentin (played by Jean Dujardin) encounters young aspiring starlet Peppy Miller (played by Berenice Bejo) and the two are photographed by the many reporters by the entrance. By the next day, Miller (Bejo) is on the cover of Variety with the headline ""Who's That Girl?"" Valentin's spouse, Doris (played by Penelope Ann Miller) is annoyed while Peppy (Bejo) is ecstatic. When she auditions for a role in Valentin's next movie, the studio is hesitant while Valentin is insistent. Over time, Miller's popularity increases to the point where she no longer needs Valentin's patronage. In the same amount of time, Al Zimmer (played by John Goodman), the head of the studio holding Valentin's contract, announces they will be halting production on silent films in favor of sound. Valentin believes sound is a fad and decides to produce his next silent film without the studio. Only to have the opening go unnoticed thanks to Peppy Miller's latest offering being released on the same day.I haven't seen any of Dujardin's or Bejo's previous films. And, while I recognized members of the supporting cast, their roles were much less significant. Also, given that the majority of the film is silent, it was an unusual experience. I was tempted to switch on my iPod at times, but somehow I didn't think AC/DC was compatible with the tone the film was trying to set. Leaving all that aside, this is a brilliant film and I enjoyed it immensely. Though I would hope it's not the beginning of a trend as silent films could be disastrous in the hands of less competent professionals. See this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A pleasant surprise,What a pleasant surprise The Artist is. I was expecting something pretentious but what I got was a charming and entertaining romantic comedy. The fact that it is shot in black and white is silent (it has a very good accompanying original orchestral score with a slice of Bernard Hermann thrown in for good measure) and framed in a non wide screen academy format only adds to the movie.   The cast are universally excellent especially the two leads Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Miller excelling in their roles with James Cromwell and John Goodman  giving  great performances. The direction is spot on and really does portray the style of movies form the late 20's early 30's and using authentic locations really helps.   I watched the movie in an almost full cinema on a very large screen. The audience laughed and gasped throughout the screening and there was a spontaneous round of applause at the end. I would recommend seeing the movie in a cinema with an audience to get the full impact. Highly recommended.,9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Black and White Sound of Silence,"What's amazing to me – something I would never have guessed – is how positive the reception is for 'The Artist'. It isn't just a black and white film. It's also a silent film. Those are two of its achievements. A third one is there's nothing to tell this apart from any of the films from the dawn of the last Century. It is a perfect simulacrum of the films it aspires to imitate.Truthfully, I wasn't blown away, just as I wasn't blown away by the other films I've seen from the 1920s ('Metropolis', 'Battleship Potemkin', 'Nosferatu'), the age into which 'The Artist' could easily camouflage itself. But I did enjoy myself and I did feel for the central character.The story is this. George Valentin (no doubt a play on Rudolph Valentino, the real-life silent film star), played by Jean Dujardin, is Hollywood's ace actor. Audiences love him, though not quite as much as he loves himself. While promoting a film, Valentin falls for a fan, Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo). He embraces her and they pose for photographs and she revels in the attention. She goes on to audition for a bit-part, wins it, and becomes a sensation – not an overnight one, but her name gradually appears higher up credit lists.Valentin is shown what his studio believes is a breakthrough: 'talkies'. He laughs wryly when he hears the sound of words in film for the first time. He genuinely regards it as a gimmick. People come to the movies for him and nothing else, he says. Little does he realise that sound would signal the end of silence.The manipulation of sound is the single most impressive aspect of 'The Artist'. After witnessing his first 'talkie', Valentin has a revelation. He has lived in a world where sound was redundant, and when he hears the world, it's loud. Director Michel Hazanavicius makes this point by not allowing us to hear Valentin's voice.Hazanavicius is clever in another way. He uses visual metaphors to convey the points in the story. The one I loved comes when Miller has confirmed herself as star and Valentin a fading one. They meet on a stairwell in their studio. The camera pans back to a long shot, allowing the whole stairwell to fill the screen, making it look like a sort of dollhouse. Miller ascends the stairs, Valentin descends them; one goes up, one goes down; one rises, one falls.Further in the story, Valentin's continued refusal to acknowledge sound causes him to fall out with the suits (led by John Goodman, who is very good as a mute considering he is famous for his voice), highlighting the message that stars have and will always be the studios' playthings. Valentin decides to use what pull he has left to become a director and a producer.But he does so in vain. Talkies didn't only signal the end of silent films, they also heralded the demise of the old stars associated with them. New blood, crucially new young blood, would introduce the sound revolution. Valentin loses everything: his wife (a lovelorn Penelope Ann Miller), his fame, his bankability. As if that wasn't enough, the stock market crash swipes his wealth, too. All Valentin can do is drink and rue his situation. He becomes a living relic.Miller provides succour to Valentin, not because she owes him her career, but because she sees a helpless soul who needs the touch of angel to be reborn. Miller offers a solution, which is delightfully ironic: the musical. Valentin regains all that he lost, but now stars in a genre which was itself a new movement in motion pictures. And so we have a wonderful riches to rags – and back to riches again – story.I saw the film with what I perceived to be an audience with an average age of fifty. I mention that for a reason. The critics are going nuts for this because many of them will be old enough to remember watching nothing but B&W as children. Roger Ebert, the best-known – and I think best – film critic wrote lovingly and with erudition about B&W.I'm of the view, however, that the question of a film's value isn't one concerning the head, but the heart. So I think Ebert's intellectualisation of the merits of B&W versus colour, although compelling, is redundant. It's a childhood thing. What your eyes laid upon for the very first time, what one grows up with, is the thing one will most love.'The Artist' isn't the start (or re-start) of a silent or B&W renaissance. We've moved on from those styles. 'The people are never wrong' says John Goodman's character. 'The Artist' is like its lead character: nostalgic for a bygone age.www.moseleyb13.com",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Artist is both entertaining and proof that hey do still make 'em like they used to!,"Brilliant. This creative and imaginative use of silence really shows us what modern films are truly missing out on. The casting was mostly acute, and Michel Hazanavicius was ingenious as he recreated the 'golden age' of Hollywood. I felt the characters chosen and the story told was creative and inventive. All though not all the facts were accurate, cleverly the story could appeal to modern day dim-witted viewers while still reflecting the classical 30's era. Jean Dujardin was absolutely sensational and his acting was all on par and he definitely deserves the awards he received. Berence Bejo on the other hand did not meet the standard that the other actors, director and camera work set. I felt as a main part she was over shadowed by other workers and I was not all impressed. However this did not affect my overall experience of the Motion Picture and my complete recommendations to anyone wanting to see the film. As a summary; The Arist is both and entertaining and proof that they do still make 'em like they used to!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

I think the answer is that I have seen most if not all the classics of non speaking movies, the Jazz Singer, all the Charles Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, Gloria Swanson, the Cecile B DeMille collection, Fritz Lang, the Cabinet of doctor Caligari, etc, etc.... The Artist is a boring movie, nothing else, nothing more. In my opinion it doesn't deserve the awards and critics it is receiving.Good movie for bed time.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Star is Born,"Now, this is a throwback. Filmed mostly silently while also telling a story around the conversion of silent to sound pictures in Hollywood (notice, they never make movies about the conversion to color or widescreen). It is a gimmick film, for sure, but beyond the gimmick is a surprisingly involving story of change and loss. It's a modified form of the well-worn story from A Star is Born with an established star losing his place to an up and coming younger woman, but it's charming and fun and even touching.George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is that star of the silver screen. He's a charming lead of a long series of adventure romances mostly paired with his leading lady Constance (Missi Pyle) and his faithful dog (Uggie). He is on top of the world, and after the premiere of his most recent film, A Russian Affair, he bumps into Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) on the red carpet, causing a small scene that gets on the front page of Variety wondering who this mystery woman giving Valentin a kiss on the cheek could be, angering Valentin's producer Al Zimmer (John Goodman). She uses her quick bit of celebrity to help her get her first job in the movies as a dancing extra, meeting Valentin once more who defends her from Zimmer's anger at having pushed his movie off the front page. This is her first step in a steady climb to movie stardom. It just happens to occur in 1929, right on the verge of the introduction of sound into the industry, a change that Valentin valiantly stands athwart yelling stop at by directing and producing his own silent film in the sound era.Now, to talk about this film's embrace of silent film mechanics. It's really quite good and could almost fit in the era. Perhaps there's a bit more cross-cutting than would be normal in a Hollywood film (there are definitely examples of it, but they seemed to be a bit more rare with most filmmakers preferring longer single takes from further away), essentially making this feel like top tier and very refined silent film work. It also plays with sound a surprising amount. There's a sequence at the end of the first act where Valentin ends up amazed at folley effects as he is in his dressing room. It's perfectly placed in the film to imply that the rest of the film is going to be some kind of more straightforward sound film, but it ends up a dream. There's real wit to how this movie is constructed.Anyway, Valentin's career goes down the tubes while Peppy's career shoots up, and she becomes one of the biggest stars in Hollywood, her latest sound picture completely dwarfing Valentin's grand silent protest of the sound fad. Valentin's wife Doris (Penelope Ann Miller) leaves him. He has to sell all of his stuff (there are two sequences that seem logically out of order, his great auction of all of his stuff in his house coming after he's penniless in his bungalow, but whatever) and fire his loyal driver Clifton (James Cromwell) who goes in protest despite not having been paid in a year.The focus of the final act is a surprisingly focused and effective look at a man who has lost everything and watched as the world has simply passed him by. Becoming a drunk and desperate, he does something nearly fatal, entering Peppy's notices once more. The hook of this is the attachment between the two who only have three scenes in the front half of the film together to build a solid attraction and potential relationship, and it works. There's a dreaminess to their interactions, two people helping each other in different ways over the years (he getting her start in the business and she rescuing him from the depths of his despair) so that the connection, while built on only a few isolated incidents, can have the emotional depth to sell the movie's final moments.So, yes, this is more than just a silent movie made in the twenty-first century. It's a witty comedy, a penetrating character study, and a delight of an entertainment. It's a throwback, but it's a well-built one. It has what must be call-backs to Singin' in the Rain since Valentin is the swashbuckler like Gene Kelly had been and Missi Pyle is made to look like Jean Hagan. It just has some weird bits here and there (like the order of events around Valentin's possessions), though.Overall, though, a delight of a picture.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A charming film, which combines a very beautiful story, good technical execution and artistic notes of great merit.","This was one of the best and most charming movies I've seen in recent times. It is one of those films that harmoniously combines the beauty and magic of a good story with excellent technical execution and artistic brilliance. It is also a kind of homage to one of the great upheavals in the film industry: the transition from silent films to talkies, a change that meant the sudden end of the careers of some stars (not as many as you think), such as Charles Morton, or the loss of momentum of actors like Nils Ashter and Antonio Moreno, who were greatly affected by their strong accent.The script was very well written and starts by introducing us to George Valentin (I don't know, but I felt that the character was slightly inspired by Douglas Fairbanks or Rodolfo Valentino, at least in terms of the name and dimension of their careers), a movie star, rich, famous and successful. His career - and also his personal life - collapses like a sandcastle with the advent of talkies, the end of silent film production and his persistence in not adapting to the new times. Meanwhile, a young actress he helped cast becomes one of cinema's greatest figures, surpassing him in some ways. However, even though he is proud and feels hurt, she admires him and is determined to help him.The film is a French production, and one of the most beautiful and interesting French cinema has made (that I've seen, of course) in recent years. Directed and written by Michel Hazanavicius, it was critically acclaimed and won an intense list of awards, including five Oscars (won Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Costume and Best Original Soundtrack, and was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress, Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Art Direction), six César (Best Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Soundtrack, Best Director and Best Film) and seven BAFTAs (Best Costume, Best Cinematography, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Film and two special awards for director and soundtrack). It's a huge and prestigious record!The cast is elegantly led by Jean Dujardin, in a work full of talent, in which the actor takes advantage of all his physical and facial expression to make us understand what he does not say in words. Equally expressive and charismatic, Bérénice Bejo was impeccable in the role of a rising film diva. The film also features John Goodman and James Cromwell and a cameo by Malcolm McDowell.On a technical and artistic level, the film has immense values that deserve to be observed very carefully, starting with the way in which all the cinematography and the visual part was worked by the director, in order to remain relatively faithful to the old films. For example, the film never uses the zoom, because it was a technical resource unavailable in the silent film era. Being a film with virtually no speech or sound apart from the soundtrack and some very specific sound effects, it is natural that the soundtrack was an important point and where all the production was concentrated. The result of that effort is one of the most interesting original soundtracks I've heard in a long time. However, I found it curious that they used a famous portion of the ""Vertigo"" soundtrack for the most depressing and tense parts of the film. And finally, a word of praise for the grand dance sequence at the end of the film!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A novel but mediocre effort,"This production was a throw-back to Hollywood's ""golden era"" and for that reason I understand the industry-based acclaim. The dancing, the irresistible smiles, the romanticization of Hollywood filmmaking and the highs and lows of the roaring 20's, all, create an unique ambiance that an audience cannot collect from other modern films. Furthermore, the story is significantly advanced by brilliant performances from Dujardin and Bejo. But when one takes away the film's novelty, i.e., the black and white silent format and full screen captions, the only thing remaining is a dry and simplistic love story. The production should be applauded for endeavoring into a risky product. However, the risk alone does not justify a positive review.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely BRILLIANT!!!,"Absolutely brilliant!! At first I thought it rather strange watching a black and white silent movie in this day and age, but I couldn't stop watching as the film instantly hooked me!With the film being set during the silent movie era, they shot the film exactly the way it was done back in the day, making it feel more authentic. Even the score and lighting were reminiscent of 1920's films! Director Michel Hazanavicius paid attention to every bit of detail. I'm sure he must have watched loads of silent films prior to making 'The Artist'. With very little dialogue, you have to guess what the characters are saying for most of the film, yet it is actually so easy to follow. There are so many delightfully funny moments, and the dog is just adorable!The film revolves around actor George Valentin - considered the best silent movie actor of his time. Valentin is fantastically portrayed by French actor Jean Dujardin - who at times reminded me of a young Sean Connery. However, with the move to talkies (films with sound), there was no more room for 'silent' actors, since no-one wanted to hear these silent actors speak. It was time for fresh faces. Such a face came in the form of Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), who met Valentin by chance a few years ago before she landed her first acting role. With Peppy now a superstar, and Valentin's career dwindling, fate has a plan in store for these two characters...'The Artist' was an absolute delight to watch!

Aaargh Why?,"Where do I begin, well for starters I can say that I am a huge fan of Jean Dujardin. However, as I lack any artistic bones in my DNA the black & white silent style of this movie just did not appeal to me.The silent era as well as that of B&W, is a bygone era and for a good reason, it has been surpassed by better technology. I can certainly appreciate B&W photographs, for the most part, I prefer to shoot them that way. That, however, does not mean I want to watch a movie in this format.Even as a kid I found Mel Brooks' Silent Movie to be somewhat annoying, but in the end, it was entertaining and funny - that said I only watched it once.

Superb and Sublime,"I give out 9-star ratings quite sparingly. Films like this are why. For my taste (YMMV), it is flawless in every respect. The story is simultaneously fanciful and gripping -- that ALONE is hard to pull off; the tone and pacing are perfect. Even the soundtrack decisions are pitch-perfect (no pun); every sound you hear (generally background music with deliberate exceptions) is painstakingly intentional. There are many subtle touches that may not be apparent on a casual first viewing.This is obviously a retro film in terms of the story, but also in terms of how people thought and acted in those days. People really did tend to wear romance and idealism on their sleeves, or at least look up to those who did.Not only is this film excellent technically, the folks who made this made it look EASY (and frequently carefree); that is even more impressive. So why not 10 stars? Well, this film is technically an homage, not the ""real deal"". Of course it's better than many historical silent movies, but there are some that surpass this. So I'm allowing a tiny bit of headroom for such profound classics.It was great fun to see modern tech used to recreate the flavor of such bygone days. Bravo!

captures A time of simplicity when movies reflected creativity and imagination,"French director Michel Hazanavicius' surprise hit The Artist is a charming recreation of the silent film era of the late 1920s that focuses on how the advent of talking pictures spelled the end of careers for those silent film stars who could not or would not make the transition. Shot in color, then transferred to black and white, the film's combination of form and style captures a time of simplicity in which movies reflected creativity and imagination as much as their ability to make money. The film introduces the wonderful French actor Jean Dujardin to Western audiences and he is irresistible with his broad smile, thin mustache, and snappy dance steps that suggest Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire.The artist in question is George Valentin (Dujardin), a silent screen star who downplays the advent of talkies to his gruff producer Al Zimmer (John Goodman), calling it a passing phase. George still has thousands of loyal fans who swarm around him at every opportunity and lives a life of comfort with a huge house in Hollywood, a lovely wife, and a loyal dog. All of these comforts are threatened, however, when George meets Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), a dark-haired beauty who is a talented dancer and actress with potential star power.Valentin begins a flirtation with her and, much to the chagrin of George's wife Doris (Penelope Anne Miller), they are photographed together in Variety magazine, an incident that reminds Doris of how unhappy she is with George and eventually leads to the breakup of their marriage. George is called yesterday's man by his producer and, as Peppy starts to climb the ladder to success, George's star recedes, but he does not give up easily. Refusing to participate in talking films, he leaves Zimmer and sets up his own company to produce a silent adventure film but it bombs at the box office while people line up to see Peppy in her debut films.As a result of George's reluctance to act in talkies and the stock market crash of 1929, he loses his loyal driver Clifton (James Cromwell) and falls into bankruptcy and flirts with alcoholism. One member of the family always by George's side, however, is his loyal dog, a loving companion whose swift-footed action saves his life when he is trapped inside a burning house. Peppy remains his friend and looks after George when he is injured in the fire and brings him to her house to convalesce. Though she admittedly used him to get her break in the industry, Peppy sincerely wants to have George get back into acting and offers him a script reluctantly approved by Zimmer, but he demurs.Before despair takes further hold, however, the film takes you where you would least expect to go and surprise follows surprise. An homage to the comedies and musicals of the silent era, The Artist is a film that bursts with enthusiasm and life. Though it may be lightweight (some have even called it ""fluff""), it can nonetheless break new ground if it can serve as a reminder, not only of what we have lost in our films with their increasing subservience to technology and corporate greed but, more importantly, of what has gone missing from the quality of our lives.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
black and white,"""..with an open mind i headed into this year's 'almost cert' Oscar movie 'The Artist'. I personally had only heard bad things although i had been told that it was receiving rave reviews. I wonder why. I love old black and white movies, but ones with a good story. The Artist simply took from many, many b & w movies before it and simply re-made it. As i watched the movie unfold before me i did ask what many had seemed to ask already...What is the point. If this does win numerous awards at the Oscars this year then yet another remake or imitation does it again. Yes, it is well made BUT..with the technology that the studios have today, this would be an easy feat. Was I entertained..no not one bit. In fact i was so desperate for some sound...which says a lot for the movie. As i write this piece i am still wondering what on earth was the point to all of this. Was it a way of ribbing the current film industry. Was it a just trying to be clever. Was it trying to be different (and do we need that). What was it trying to achieve. Those who give it high praise must be seeing something i am certainly not seeing. Those sad geeks out there that spot the 'references'...good luck to you. All i spotted was a nice imitation of what has already been and gone...and done much better than this attempt. 2/10 (for effort) TV is proving a far more powerful medium than the movies these days-Great Expectations, Boardwalk Empire, Downton Abbey, Treme, The Hour etc etc p.s. I did notice a dog doing tricks, the same ones performed at the Golden Globes. Now THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT or is it.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Artist Review,"I thought that this was a visually stunning film and it really captures the time it was set in. It was a little too slow paced and I didn't care that much about the characters, but I love the style of it and the cinematography. It should be considered a film and not a movie.The performances from Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo made the film feel even more like it was from the 20s/30s. With no words, they did an excellent job articulating their emotions and actions through body language and facial expressions. Though both performances were good, but I enjoyed Bérénice Bejo's far more. That may be because I didn't care about the romance and was much more interested in Peppy's life and career.Also Uggie did an amazing job as Jack the dog. I feel like the story could have been more interesting, because I thought that the dog was the best part. And when you care more about the dog in a movie, the human's story is probably a little boring. Unless it's something where the dog is the main character, like A Dog's Purpose or PAW Patrol.There were so many incredible shots. I loved the black and white style. It really does capture the feel that those old silent films had.The ending was very well executed and felt like Schindler's list where most of it was done in a specific way but then breaks it so slightly that it becomes very impactful. The fact that it is silent and has just the last few lines spoken, made me think about how George only works in silent films and at the end he is open to making a talking one. I thought that this was a brilliant touch to The Artist.Overall, I enjoyed this film and it's hidden Easter eggs. It was a lot to sit through a film with no dialogue, but it was very well done.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""...Black and White films suck, they're boring.""","""...Black and White films suck, they're boring.""Yes, sadly. These were the words of a now ex-human being, It's sad really that any film that is 'Black and White', to be tossed to the side or branded as ""Boring"", During the screening of 'The Artist' in my local cinema, I was bombarded with questions from friends as to why I would watch such a film, I didn't really respond or pay any attention to their arrogant remarks or annoying cackles. Instead, I went to the screening, with a healthy dose of optimism.Afterwards, I waltzed out of the cinema, with an expression of satisfaction and smugness, in the knowledge that some brain-dead individuals are missing out on a masterpiece. 'The Artist' truly is a fantastic movie. Brilliant acting paired with an unique idea really created this film. Its incorporation of many different styles of cinematography and of course, its classy, vintage theme was a certain breath of fresh air for me. This remarkable spectacle of a movie will remain a favourite, it is certainly a favourite in the eyes of many as well. I recommend it to all, I stress to you to watch it in the cinema first, instead of DVD; it will lose a good portion of its charm on the small screen.I'm going to give it a 9/10. My only complaint is, after watching the movie, the sudden, heart-breaking realisation that we no longer dress like 'George Valentin' struck me.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
In three words; Mesmerising – Compelling - Brilliant,"Set at the end of the 1920's George Valentin is one of the top silent movie actors working in Hollywood and he enjoys the attention and success which this brings him. He accidentally bumps into aspiring actress Peppy Miller who idolises George and they begin to work together. He sees something in her, he knows she is talented but she needs to stand out from the crowd. And with George's help she does just this.However, as Peppy gets more work and starts to become successful George has peaked in his career and as studio bosses stop the silent movie productions and move to the new 'talkies' he finds himself out of work. As he falls out of favour but Peppy is a sensation in the new medium and she becomes the biggest star in Hollywood.We see George losing his wife, his home and dignity. However, always by his side is his dog and butler Clifton (Cromwell). At times George's canine companion is a scene stealer but he is magnificent to watch and brings humour even in unlikely scenes and you can't help but smile.Shot in black and white and in 1:33 aspect ratio the film is true to the early days of cinema. From the wonderful opening credits through to the brilliant score which complements the story. Hazaanvicius has really captured the essence of the silent movie, a daunting task which is made easier by his excellent cast. Dujardin and Bejo excel in their respective roles and their chemistry is a joy to watch. Both are not only excellent actors but mesmerising dancers with routines which Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers would be proud of.I sat in a cinema which only had a few other patrons in it. I was able to sit at the back of the cinema directly under the projection booth. This added to the atmosphere as I could hear the workings of the projector, the mechanical sounds really complimented the silent film and I would urge anyone who goes to see this film to sit as close to the projector as possible.Please go and see this film. It is a master class of early cinema which is compelling and enjoyable to watch. This film will not appeal to everyone and I had my own reservations about it before viewing it. However, I'm glad I did and you will be too.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant Masterpiece and Experimentally Risky,"A brilliant movie. Bringing the film back to its roots created a legitimately respectful movie. A lot of people would struggle trying to watch this movie and i understand where they are coming from. But saying that this movie was a masterpiece. The music was a continuous emotional joyride. The cinematography was old school styled, much like the rest of the movie. The story line is carried well by each character and the feelings and emotions of the main characters are seen and pre- exposed. I really enjoyed this movie and saw the risk that the crew had in making this. They pulled it off as i would recommend this to serious movie watchers.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Uggie Still Rules The Film!,"This film was more silent and black and white unlike today's films. This film paid tribute to Hollywood's early silent years. Jean Dejardin, a French actor, plays George Valentin, a silent film star in the twenties. French Berenice Bejo plays Peppy Miller, an up and coming starlet. George and Peppy's romance rules the film. The French leads have a great supporting cast. The film's biggest star is actually the dog named Uggie. George takes his dog everywhere. The film was beautifully done and worth watching. You find something new every time. This film depicts early Hollywood. I love George and Peppy in the film.

When Old Fashion is also refreshing,"The Artist isn't an homage to old movies, as you may read or hear around. The Artist is considerably more than that, and it's brand new. The Artist is creativity in its maximum expression, going all the way through from screen writing, directing and acting, since the very first minute to the last. The script is really fantastic and the director's vision of how to put that script down to images is even better. In a movie where there are no dialogs, every scene is crucial, and the director seems to understand that. Emotions are so well transmitted through the screen to the audience, that it really makes us think if dialog is fundamental in movie making. Well, the answer is no, when the execution is so perfect, but this is top notch movie making and especially top notch acting, which is probably the main feature of the whole film. The actors in this movie are so expressive that they don't need to talk to make you understand. You'll understand by only watching. You will laugh and you will cry, but more than anything, you'll probably love this movie, just as much as I did.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Warm, entertaining homage to silent cinema","This French made homage to silent movies is a bit of a gimmick, being a silent movie itself, but is extremely well made. It would be easy to dismiss it as an amusing stunt, but director Michel Hazanavicius's hand is so sure and his actors so engaging that the movie deservedly won an Oscar for best picture. We are in 1927 and George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), the artist of the title, is a leading man of the silent cinema who is about to hit it tough when talking movies arrive. Bérénice Bejo (an Argentine born actress who is married to Hazanavicius in real life) is the perky, spunky Peppy, an irresistible starlet who rises to fame at the same time that Valentin falls. Also costarring are John Goodman as a Hollywood mogul and James Cromwell as George Valentin's butler (they are all very fine). The authentic Los Angeles locations, the reconstruction of the 1920s and the extraordinary photography help a lot. My only complaint, is that the happy ending seems quite weak, a bit of a concession to the public, given what went on before, though, of course, a sad ending would probably be even more disappointing.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Silence Is Golden,"In 1927 Hollywood, dashing silent film superstar Jean Dujardin (as George Valentin) celebrates his latest premiere amid crowds of fans at the theater. After a chance meeting, Mr. Dujardin gives pretty, star-struck actress Berenice Bejo (as Peppy Miller) her first big break. Dujardin even provides Ms. Bejo with her trademark ""beauty spot"" by taking a make-up pencil to mark her otherwise perfect face with a distinctive mole. Neither know it, but ""talkies"" are poised to take over Hollywood and stamp out the ""silents"". Dujardin's fame and fortune will crash with the stock market while Bejo becomes the next big thing...Michel Hazanavicius' ode to silent films won a lot of awards, deservedly. This film successfully takes us back to that time when movies began to talk. Much has been said about how certain actors had the wrong look or ""accent"" for the new medium; here, we have something much closer to the truth. Moviegoers accepted Greta Garbo and Maurice Chevalier with their accents. Stars like Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford were unsuccessful because they were perceived as too old and/or could not develop their acting skills...Dujardin as ""The Artist"" looks very much like Mr. Fairbanks. He also mirrors the popular star's manners. Although this story is supposed to take place behind the scenes, we mostly remain in a silent film mode. In total, it is a visual beauty that presents as a nightmare. This is evident in the opening, when ""The Artist"" refuses to talk; his refusal is so adamant, it carries on after the scene ends. Later, Dujardin suffers a nightmare with sound. The sound effects and music, by Ludovic Bource, are brilliant. In the late 1920s, an art form froze in time. That era's synchronized sound effects and film beauty are here, again...Still, you know it isn't real...They give you ""Vertigo"" (1958) and a happy dance, which just seems wrong...Then, you remember this only the stuff that dreams are made of...********** The Artist (5/15/11) Michel Hazanavicius ~ Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo, James Cromwell, John Goodman",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A smile from ear to ear, from beginning to end. :)","A film like The Artist doesn't come along very often, but when they do sometimes to novelty can be overrated, not here, after viewing The Artist I think it lives up to any type of hype that is associated with it, it exceeded all my expectations. The lead actor is really really exceptional, his suave face and charisma is so fitting for the 1920's and he has an extremely handsome face to match, Berenice Bejo is just darling as it girl Peppy Miller, both actors are so extremely well cast that it just wouldn't have worked with anyone but them, and the supporting cast do well in their roles, in particular Missi Pyle.I am a fan of silent films so I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to watching a silent film but even non enthusiasts would be charmed by this lovely film. Also worth mentioning is the scene stealer, the dog, hands down the greatest animal in film ever. This film is very funny, from the get go I was smiling and was charmed off my socks. The production is perfect, everything is recreated exactly the way it would have been back in the flapper days, the music, the costuming, everything is perfection.After seeing The Artist it gives me faith that films like Return To Babylon could finally get released, how great it would be to see that film on a big screen, so hopefully with the success of this it may finally after so many years get a release.Just watch and enjoy, you'd have to be a serious grump if you couldn't just go with it.

"An homage, disguised as a great movie!","It all seems so unlikely; not only making a movie about the silent movie period but also doing it completely without sound as well. A true daring and not so everyday project but it's however a gamble that truly paid off really well!Clearly this is an homage to old Hollywood movies, of the silent- but as well the early black & white, talking era. But it pays homage by becoming the like the movie of its era, which it is paying homage to. It doesn't ever get into your face about it that this is supposed to be a love letter to old Hollywood. The movie is far more subtle than that really and greatly put together with lots of care and eye to detail on its own. It's simply being a great movie on its own, which in itself is perhaps the greatest homage the movie could had paid, to a time that is long gone.It's a movie that does take you back to a time when movies and watching movies was still a totally different experience. A sort of carefree time, when movies still had a real innocence over them and were only made to purely entertaining its audience and give everybody a great time.Watching this movie makes it very obvious that the filmmakers had obviously been doing their homework. I was able to recognize many different general film styles, from mostly the '20's and '30's in this but also styles handled by some well known directors of its era. It's a movie that truly references to some great movies of its era, whether it is with one of their characters, its story or simply a certain shot. But this all is done in a totally non-distracting way and everything works out beautifully and smoothly together.Everybody could of course make a black & white movie, done without sound but making it look good and work out convincing as an old fashioned silent movie is of course a totally different thing. It's all about the details to get the look and feeling right and I believe this movie absolutely nailed it. The way the actors look and act in this movie is spot on but also some more subtle things, such as its lighting is absolutely perfect and helps to truly give the movie an old look. Yes, this movie truly looks and feels as if it got made like a true movie from the late '20's, also not in the least thanks to its music as well.Its story definitely had a kind of ""Sunset Blvd."" to it, which is also a movie I absolutely loved. It more or less features a similar sort of concept, with of course as a big difference that this movie is without sound. It doesn't mean that any of the emotions or drama comes across as anything less. It's simply a beautiful, warm story, with real human emotions to it, which are all very sensible.And just like ""Sunset Blvd."", this also a movie about filmmaking and gives you look of what went on behind the camera's in Hollywood, at the time. It shows the time when the big transition between the silent and talking pictures was taking place. For some it was a blessing, to others a curse. Careers got made during this era but just as many got destroyed. This movie shows both sides and what happens when a big star falls down and a young new star rises to the top.But I also do admit that the story is what's keeping the movie still a bit down. It by no means is one of the best written or most original stories but it simply is executed extremely well and effective, so it perhaps isn't even a real complaint.For the lead roles unknowns Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo got cast but the movie also still has some surprisingly big names in it, such as most notably John Goodman and James Cromwell. Surprising, since this of course was a low key production, with a not so everyday idea and approach to it. But no matter whether the actor is well known or not, everybody played their roles really well and all seemed perfectly cast in their roles.A truly daring project and I'm glad to see its getting all the recognition and praise, which it truly deserves. It's way more than just a gimmicky movie. It's a true astonishing accomplishment and a beautiful piece of love and deep devotion to an extinct genre, from director Michel Hazanavicius. I'm sure of it this will be a movie that I shall watch countless times again, for years to come.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The golden hue of black and white silence and old-school charm,"""The Artist"" is an artist's film; a tribute to the golden age of movies. In 1927, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a silent film star at the height of success. When the studios turn their attention to talkies, George isn't ready to make the transition. He continues to watch the world in black & white and listen in silence.If you haven't realized it yet, ""The Artist"" is a silent, black and white film, and it's great. Our hero, George Valentin, was created in the vain of the swashbuckling Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. He is funny, charming, charismatic; he can do comedies, dramas, action-adventures; he has a wife, adoring fans, and a dog. The dog is star number 2, capable of playing dead or dancing in step with George.An adoring fan finds herself absorbing the spotlight after a chance meeting with George. Not only can she keep up with him, but the world is ready to hear the voice of Ms. Peppy Miller. She is not named ""Peppy"" by accident.We have a delightful story of love; love of success, love of movies, and love between George and Peppy. Dujardin has a wonderful comedic touch to everything he does in this movie that the simple story line is helped along with a healthy dose of comedy. He turns serious when The Great Depression hits, but ""The Artist"" keeps chugging along with its original, uplifting score, inventive scenes, and a finale that brings us into the future.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Technically a foreign film (hint; this one!) has won ""best picture"" before","George is a famous and widely adored actor in the silent-film era of the 1920s. He gives one of his fans, Peppy, a moment in the spotlight and it unexpectedly creates a path for her into stardom. As Peppy rises, George falls. He does not adjust to changing circumstances or new technology, and the advent of sound in film leaves him broke and alone. Peppy is the last person that still has faith in George and she reaches out to him, but he may be too far gone.Shot in black and white and virtually without the sound of anyone's voice, this alluring, unconventional and heartwarming film surprises and delights. Jean Dujardin (George), Berenice Bejo (Peppy), James Cromwell, John Goodman and Uggie (Jack Russell terrier), reveal the power of communicating without speaking. The Artist is a true gem. My girlfriend and I saw it before it was widely released. It felt then like the film was going to be as heartwarming for others as it was for us. Winner of five Oscars including best picture. Seen at the Toronto International Film Festival.I love Parasite and am overjoyed that it won best picture, especially because it is a foreign and independent film, but technically at least one foreign film won an Oscar for best picture before Parasite, right?! Hardly anyone talked in The Artist, so it really can't be said that it is an English language film. Perhaps it was not considered a foreign film because the setting was in California? In any case, The Artist is an amazing and daring film. It is daring because there are virtually no voices and is a throw-back to another era.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Delightful,"I'm a big fan of movies I would describe as realist, and liked many of the films made under the Dogme95 manifesto (which was all about not using certain artificial techniques). And when I look at old movies, it often strikes me how clumsy and un-natural they feel. Yet stick a camera in front of real life and its unlikely that the edited footage would ever be worth watching. All film-making is art and artifice; they may be different (technology- or self-imposed constraints), and a different impact desired, but the film that appears realistic is just one possible style. Viewed in this light, new technology makes new styles possible; but can also lead to the abandonment of art-forms that had their own validity and purpose in favour of the shock of the new. And 'The Artist' proves this: a modern day film, made in the style of a black-and-white, silent movie that manages to be funny and emotionally affecting in spite of the director's deliberate choice to ignore the advances that (mostly) mean that films like this one simply aren't made anymore.Self-referentially, the film takes the end of the silent movie era as its own subject; of course, this is not an unknown theme in Hollywood (think 'Sunset Boulevard', for example, although the back-story in that film is the primary narrative in this one). It's clever, but not just in a show-off way; what's noticeable is the attention paid to the smallest of details (for example, in the fonts in the movie posters on display); of course, there are talkies where the director has clearly worried over every visual detail, but in this film, it's obviously essential, and they can be enjoyed without competition. Director Michel Hazanavicius and male lead Jean Dujardin appear to have a great understanding of the positive qualities of silent movies (aside from the absence of sound). This isn't the deepest movie you'll ever see, but it's one of the most delightful. And when Berenice Bojo smiles her flapper smile, I challenge anyone not to feel a ripple in their hearts.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Revisit this Silent Classic,"As you start contemplating which current Oscar contenders to check out, might I recommend a recent Oscar winner THE ARTISTI know, quite a few of you are saying ""but, it's a SILENT movie! I want SOUND!"" I am here to tell you – ""NO, YOU DON'T"". A picture is worth a thousand words – besides, how many words are there in those comic books you read!For those of you with memory issues – The Artist is a black and white SILENT movie set in Hollywood in the waning days of the Silent Movie era and the burgeoning days of the ""talkies"". It follows a dashing Hollywood Silent Movie Leading Man, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin in a deservedly Oscar-winning turn) as he stubbornly refuses to acknowledge the change to ""talkies"" and the consequences that ensue. Dujardin is appropriately charming in this role without being annoying and he becomes the kind of hero that you will want to root for.The surprise, to me, in this movie is Berenice Bejo as Peppy Miller – the up and coming actress that embraces (and, in turn, is embraced by) the ""talkies"". In what could have been a standard ""A Star is Born"" turn, Bejo gives Peppy a spunkiness and charm that shows on screen. Remember, this is a SILENT movie, so anything that any of these actors do has to be conveyed through their faces – and Bejo's face speaks volumes. She was nominated for an Academy Award for this performance – and lost to Meryl Streep's powerhouse portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in THE IRON LADY – while I really enjoyed Streep's performance, and thought her Oscar was deserving, I preferred her performance over Streep. I can't believe I'm saying that, but it is true, nonetheless. I encourage you to judge for yourself.As far as the other performances go, John Goodman steals just about every scene that he is in (of course) as the head of the studio, Al Zimmer. Goodman had a good 2011 having scene stealing supporting roles in not only this movie, but FLIGHT (a must see) and ARGO (an even bigger must see). Another supporting player that clearly steals every scene he is in from DuJardin, Bejo, Goodman (and everyone else) is Uggie, the Jack Russell Terrier as Valentin's faithful friend, confident and savior. I usually turn a cold heart to animal performances, but this one was touching and effective without becoming cloying.I went into this movie with my arms folded across my chest in a clear ""I hear this is good, it better be"" attitude and was rewarded with a charming, fun, nostalgic and often-times touching experience. I would strongly recommend this to you and your family (certainly children in their teenage years would/should enjoy this). 9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis).",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Wonderful feel good movie!,"This movie is a gem. Bravo to the French, their movie industry is alive and kicking, and French people actually go and watch French films, not only US blockbusters with lots of CGI and special effects. I'm not French, but I like the guts of men like the producer and director of ""The Artist"" to embark on the adventure of making a silent b&w movie in these 3D times... Of course, with a lead actor as versatile as Jean Dujardin, they couldn't go wrong. That guy began as a stand-up comedian, went on to star in a very successful sitcom, then created a hilariously funny character called ""Brice de Nice"", a parody of a wannabe ""surfer"" beachboy with bleached hair (no way you can surf in the calm bay of Nice...). Director Hasanavicius, co-star Berenice Bejo and Dujardin then teamed up for the first time in two funny and anarchic spy spoofs, ""OSS 117"". And now this global success for the Artist - I'm sure neither director, producer nor stars would ever have dreamt to scoop up ALL the great movie awards. But they did, and rightly so. And in the midst of all this hype, they remain nice and modest. I was amazed (and happy) that the Academy in Hollywood recognized the quality of this film - just such a pity that on the message board, there's so much anti-French venom.

See Hugo for a better homage to silent films - walked out of this scam,"Initially this movie is an interesting experience in sensation and perception, playing with what is silent and what is not.But once you are accustomed to the gimmick, it is nothing more than boring movie with minimal plot stretched out extremely long. The plot idea (one star sinks while another rises) has been done before, and this one had nothing new to add. Additionally, the story was shallow because there was almost no interesting dialog enriching the plot -- any time there was a conversation that might be of interest, most of the time dialog cards were NOT shown, so we could only guess what they said, the result being a very simple cartoonish-level plot. There can be a lot of potential in this rising/falling star plot, but the story didn't mine any of that territory.The only time the plot sparkled was when the director did something interesting with sound and sight about 30 minutes in (don't want to give it away for the victims of this scam who might watch it) - at that point I thought the story and perceptual experience was finally going to be interesting, but the director abandoned that promising approach.Two weeks ago I saw Hugo, and the silent film excerpts and shooting scenes in that movie were interesting and enthralling, and the ones in this one were not. And the overall plot and camera work were much better than in this one.I walked out of this after an hour. The only reason I am not giving it one star is that I can imagine even worse productions.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Very Charming Stars, but Don't Expect Too Much from the Story","""The Artist"" is the odds on favorite now to get the Oscar Best Picture crown, since it had just won the Producers' Guild nod. Everything about it will make you think twice before watching it. It is a SILENT film, in BLACK AND WHITE, with unknown FRENCH actors. Thanks to the awards hype it is getting though, audiences will search this out, as did I.The story is not the biggest selling point of the film. It is silent, so there can only be so much that can be told by facial expressions, big actions and the occasional dialog card. The story line is very simple, and very familiar, and can be summarized in one sentence: It is about a silent film star who will eventually be surpassed in the industry by the girl he helped get into films, just as silents gave way to talkies in the 1930s. If this same story was told in the current way, it would have been panned. So the novelty gimmick of director/writer Michel Hazanavicius worked in this case, but I do not think it will revive a trend for black & white silent films.The lead character George Valentin is played by Jean Dujandin. The starlet he helped launch Peppy Miller is played by Berenice Bejo. The lead actors were both very charming. They possess the facial qualities which convince us that they were indeed from that era of film. The debonair Dujardin, in particular, goes through the gamut of emotion without a word uttered until the very end. This will make him a prime candidate for Oscar's Best Actor, a prize he already won in Cannes. Much have been said about the character of Valentin's dog, played by Jack Russell terrier Uggie. He's cute alright, but to push him for Best Supporting Actor is a stretch.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Loved it.,"The Director Michel Hazanavicius wanted to show the audience by telling them the story of how the silent era became talkies.
In the beginning of film, we see George Valentin retrained, the title slide that reads
... I won't talk! I won't say a word! ...
This is a clear indication of a person (or a film company) refuses to accept change into modern era of technology - using sound. = Changing of the times.
At first, I almost believed this was Based on Ture story, in way it is. About the industry.

Actually I had no choice, but that's another story.So, after 1h and half of a silent film, I was stunned. You can feel how difficult was the transition between silent and talked films.Dujardin and Bejo, incarnate so well their characters, it's amazing. They represent the collision between these two ages.

The jazz singer 1927,"The fact that a silent movie was made is uncomprehending.perhaps the director should have done a little research and find out that a talking feature was made in the year 1927. Making a talking movie a few years after that is acceptable given the price. but now that was 84 years ago. just because a movie is silent does not mean that it is good. following the plot of this movie was not a problem for me at all. it was very simple. this review is not condemning the plot of the movie it is not terrible, but its not great either. This movie is a joke and the academy is only nominating because they are a bunch of snobs. their decision they make for choosing movies isn't based on what they enjoyed. it is decided based upon what makes them smart. for instance the academy would never chose the movie ""Drive"" because choosing that would make them appear as non intellectuals. the academy and anyone who likes this movie calling a film for the century is a snob.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Powerful Visual and Auditory Romantic Drama,"8 April 2012. As the intellectually and visually gritty drama of Another Earth (2011), The Artist is as emotionally and musically riveting resonating on the more universal and familiar themes of human existence. Whereas Another Earth tells of a traumatic and unusual intense unfolding of the intimate human drama of tragedy, The Artist displays more of a silent and artistic version of the popular bigger than life love romance and adventure of The Titanic (1997). Whether or not The Artist will hold up in time is another matter because there is the ""different wow"" factor in play here. Being an unusual contemporary silent, black and white film with a huge reliance of music melodies, The Artist brings forth a substantial different movie experience based on rhythmic tones and gorgeously timed tempos of musical auditory emotions (like radio) allowing for less of the mental machinations than the emotive inner vibrations of sight and sound. The Artistic is able to take advantage the rarely used medium of music and silent dialogue which forces the audience to tap into a much more reflective and emotionally visceral level. Nevertheless, some of the film's creative and emotionally compelling drama and renewal comes from that sudden burst of the audience having to use rarely used sense over the duration of the whole movie. However, The Artist may have the fortune of retaining its brilliance and flair for the unique in its genre, much like Brazil (1985) has been able to retain is imaginative power and classic claim or Lost In Translation (2003) for its minimalist plot and immersive authenticity.However, The Artist doesn't have the exclusive patent on the effective use of music or silent dialogue or emphasis on pure behavioral performances to make its resonating connection to the audience come across. Evita (2005) was produced with only singing throughout the movie. The Monkey's had their surrealistic LSD tripping movie, Head (1968) more than 40 years ago. Wall*e (2008) the animated non-dialogue version had that even more difficult time of creating emotive impact without the fine details of a live human actor's presentation. There's even Wait Until Dark (1967) with one of the best thrilling literally black climatic scenes in movie history with minimal dialogue or the horror film 1408 (2007) finds John Cusack alone by himself trapped in a hotel room for most of the movie. Solaris (1972) is also notable for its long passages without dialogue. Even Buffy: The Vampire Slayer (1999) in its fourth season in ""Hush"" had no audible dialogue for most of the episode or Apocalypto (2006) with Mel Gibson had little use for dialogue has his character fought for survival or Jarhead (2005) that relied more on the ambiance and setting for its emotional impact than dialogue, or Touching the Void (2004) where most of the vivid power of the movie comes from the solo survival drama on a mountain slope. As for music, The Devil Wears Prada (2006) and even The Cooler (2003) with Mark Isham's score have already accomplished a great synthesis of music to film. Of course 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) likely can claim the musical backdrop and minimalist use of dialogue in capturing its audience in a vision beyond this earth and human understanding.Both Another Earth and The Artist use share the strong element of the use of irony, where characters in the movie do not know of the whole events taking place, where the character George Valentin is in the dark much of times as to what Peppy Miller is doing whereas in Another Earth, John Burroughs is unaware of the identity of the Rhoda Williams in connection to his tragedy. Another Earth operates on a different level, focusing on the mental level and the internal emotions of thought and feelings while The Artist takes its power using the behaviorist, externalize primal visual and auditory feelings that propel this movie with its intense resonating emotions.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"perfect movie to see the world of the ""silent film"" better","Personally, I really liked the movie because I have not seen anything like it before. I just found it incredibly well done, as the history of filming has been shown throughout history. Personally, I did not hear anything about this film in Germany and was therefore very skeptical. But in my opinion, the film is highly recommended.
The acting performance of the actors of Peppy Miller and George Valentin is impressive. Because we now have a similar project in the classroom, you realize how much work there is and we have it a lot easier today. For me it was not 10/10 points, because I partly did not understand the story, but the film is already very close with 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Artist,"Having watched this soon-to-be Oscar winner in the local cinema (after repeatedly brainwashed by its trailer in the multiplexes), indeed it's my third encounter with silent films behind SUNRISE (1927), and FINANCES OF THE GRAND DUKE (1924). The film is masterfully presented from the very beginning until the NEAR-end. THE ARTIST is among the laureates of 2011's film territory without any doubt.But, in my very own opinion, the much-anticipated Oscar sweep is simply a victory of nostalgia. If it had been made decades before, say 60 years ago, it would be boosted as a silent version of A STAR IS BORN with an excellent cast and splendid score, smooth and melodic, and be ascertained as a major contender but with little likeness to procure the sure-fire ultimate winner kudos which it has now in 2012, when audience has been accustomed to talkies for ages. THE ARTIST is defying all the regular habits to remind cineastes that a silent B&W film could be so potently entertaining and watchable. My point is that I don't think the film itself should take all the credit, though the team behind does have a genius concoction to evoke the retro fixation to its core targets, film-related mass which are the pillar of the film industry (academy included for sure). I doubt who in the field will not love the film? It's a crowd-pleaser for filmmakers, especially the elderly rank. (Actually THE ARTIST and HUGO are holding the same slant here, but Martin Scorsese utilizes tons of money to invest a monolithic fantasy while a foreign no-name Michel Hazanavicius and his troupe achieves the same effect through a more lightweight and unconventional approach, so if the ballots are leaning towards THE ARTIST, no one should scratch their heads.)Also another edge of THE ARTIST is that despite of the pungent situation of both film's languid box office income is embarrassing no matter who will win the game eventually, there is an essential difference between them, that is THE ARTIST has no difficulty to retrieve its meager budget ($15,000,000), meanwhile HUGO seems to be on the right track of becoming another commercial flunk like THE GOLDEN COMPASS (if not more) even though it's a Scorsese vehicle, which is not an encouraging exemplar for Hollywood tycoons to bankroll their future projects.Digressing back from the film itself, Jean Dujardin is my current winning for BEST ACTOR, whose protean flair of balancing between comedy and drama is admirable and compelling; Ms. Bejo's ambiguous leading/supporting status maybe hamper her ballots but she is impeccable in the film.The said ""NEAR-end"" incident concerns my thought of the final scene of the talkie moment, which is a regretful anticlimax for me (although sound and words are plied flawlessly during the middle session to underline the conversion to the talkie era), but Mr. Dujardin's French accent last word is not attuned with his character at all, which downgrades the film as well.Anyway, I could have rated the film higher, but my heart goes with HUGO, but who cares?",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A Unique Picture but I Wouldn't Consider it a Best Picture,","The Artist is a great movie with a very well written storyline and an impressive cast.The movie is very unique for today's standards,its a silent movie,which of course are never made anymore,and it was interesting seeing the fall of silent films once the talkies came in,I know these characters are fictional but I'm sure certain aspects are quite legit to what really happened.The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture of 2011,up against some great contenders (Moneyball,The Help,Hugo,etc.) and I honestly don't think it should have won,the film is certainly unique but I don't think any performance apart from Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo are very impressive and also the dialogue in the movie is nothing outstanding.The dog Uggie also deserves some huge credit,not only is he adorable but he's also a very talented dog actor,there's a scene where a character is attempting suicide and when Uggie starts barking trying to get him to stop it looks so genuine,I didn't feel like he was just trained to do that.The Artist is an enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great drama or romance.A silent film star falls in love with a young dancer,but the advent of talking pictures changes their careers.Best Performance: Jean Dujardin",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A mesmerizing masterpiece; please go enjoy this homage to silent film,"George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) has a dream halfway through The Artist with real sound. He sets a glass down on the table and it makes a noise. The phone rings, the dog barks, and it all sounds so harsh and shrill. Both George and the audience wait for George to wake up and end these horrible noises. Please, take us back to the wonderful world of silent film in black and white whose only sound is the soothing cinematic orchestral score.Yes, The Artist is silent. The actors are moving their mouths but only every now and then does a dialogue screen pop up for the audience to read. The effect of this throwback is a mesmerizing masterpiece. Just as Hugo was homage to the earliest films and George Melies, The Artist celebrates the late 1920s silent film era and appears so accurate it most likely could have been released in 1927. The giveaway is that everybody in the movie theater on screen is smoking. Nobody in Hugo's Parisian train station was smoking which is good for the kiddies, but kills authenticity.George is the silver screen's golden boy. His motion pictures make a ton of money, the audience loves his swashbuckling heroes, and his incredibly well-trained Jack Russell Terrier usually stars right along side of him. Through a series of unlikely events, an aspiring actress, a perfectly named Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), appears on his studio lot as an extra and they develop a noticeable level of chemistry together, though there is no sign of adultery because this is 1927. George is a married man and while he may be distant from his wife, there will be no vow breaking here.If you are familiar with Singin' in the Rain, then you know what is coming – the talkies. George takes one look at an early prototype of an actress speaking on screen and laughs at is as a gimmick. Nothing could replace silent film and besides, the audience, ""his audience"", would never stand for it. How wrong he is. Soon enough, studio boss Al Zimmer (John Goodman) fires George choosing to begin the era of sound in film with fresh faces, such as Peppy Miller.The depression strikes, George blows through his savings on one last ditch attempt to save silent film, and he is done for. He is not alone though, his reliable dog is with him as well as his now unpaid chauffeur Clifton (James Cromwell). Peppy is never far either. She remembers who was responsible for her meteoric rise and is perhaps playing some Fairy Godmother role in George's life even though she is much younger.The plot seems a bit thin and silly as I write this, but it comes across as much deeper than it sounds. George and Peppy are wonderful on screen together and The Artist is just so much fun to sit back and watch. The doubters will naturally stay away from it no matter what anybody writes; the combination of black and white and silence is just too scary to think about sitting through even though this is leagues above the common denominator.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Seriously??,"I really cant understand why anyone rate this movie as higher than 4.
As a silent movie its really REALLY not worth watching.
Clearly director Michel Hazanavicius forgot to watch a silent movie first, and any silent movie would helped him.While watching this movie you have to guess what the plot are, if there are a plot, who knows.The acting don't give anything away, and the rare boards with explaining text are more annoying than helping.The actors does a marvelous job, really, they are really good, if there had been sound!The plot, if there are any?, most likely works really good too, WITH SOUND!The scenery, filming, costumes, directing, the music basically everything looks good, if it was SOUND!With sound (speak instead of music), this would be closer to the score IMDb have (currently 7.9) 
I love black/withe movies and I like silent movies, but in this combo it really don't work. 
Feel free to try again, but then with actors from theaters or opera, they have body-language that fits silent movies way better.Sorry to the actors, you guys does a marvelous job, but I cant rate this as anything else than a really REALLY crappy silent movie.Serving out one star and a deserved spot on the shame list, the never watch this again list :!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A glorious tribute to the era of silent movies, 'The Artist' pairs a classic love story with brilliant filmmaking technique and is simply one of the best movies this year!","There was a time when going to the movies was a guaranteed feel-good experience, where you laughed, cried (sometimes because you laughed too hard) and swooned at the characters and their guffaws. Such was the experience when silent movies in the 1920s were still the rage, and 'The Artist', a black—and-white silent film, is a glorious throwback to the wonder of that age when the medium had just started working its magic into the hearts of people around the world.George Valentin (played by French actor Jean Dujardin) is a film idol of that era, and when we first meet Valentin, the year is 1927 and he is on top of the world. Valentin is also a showoff, not in the arrogant sort of way many of our celebrities are today but rather someone basking in the public's love and attention lavished on him. It is at the height of his popularity that he meets an aspiring young starlet Peppy Miller (Bejo), who breaks the line of fans outside the cinema and accidentally bumps into him. His false affront quickly melting into a golden smile, which she reciprocates with an equally radiant beam, finds its way to the front page of the next day's Variety newspaper with the headline 'Who's That Girl?'.Turns out she's also auditioning as an extra for his next movie, 'A German Affair', and an irresistibly charming on-set encounter where he imitates her dancing moves behind an opaque white screen blossoms into an immediate attraction between Valentin and Miller. He also practically hand-twists his boss Zimmer into giving her a bigger role in the movie, and soon the duo are seen shooting a scene in multiple takes while cracking each other up.By this time, we guarantee you that you would already be won over by their romance, charming and delightful even without the utterance of a single word. Sure, there are the occasional inter-titles to punctuate the music on the soundtrack, but by and large, director Michel Hazanavicius simply trusts in his actors' movements and expressions to convey their characters' feelings for each other. Till this point, the mood is light, buoyant and upbeat, but Hazanavicius isn't content just with a fluffy silent-movie tribute.You've probably heard of the story of the silent film actor, who unable to make the transition to talkies (or movies with dialogue) falls into a sad state of booze and drugs and eventually to obscurity- and so it is with Valentin. ""I'm the one people come to see. They never needed to hear me,"" he says, taking out his own movie to write and direct a big- budget silent picture that unfortunately few come to see. Meanwhile, Peppy's celebrity marquee soars, with Zimmer embracing her as the studio's future-, and her new picture, which opens alongside Valentin's, easily trouncing the latter.It's a sad tale, but one that is no less relevant then as it is now. To stay in favour means to pander if necessary to the demands of your audience, and the lesson Valentin learns in the film is also an admonishment to the fickleness of us the viewers. Besides his Jack Russell terrier, Valentin finds that only two people have stuck by him- one, his loyal butler Clifton (James Cromwell); and the other, Peppy. Yes, there's a lot more heart to Peppy than what meets the eye, so don't be too quick to rebuke her and what she represents for causing Valentin's fall from grace. The age-old adage goes that pride comes before the fall, and indeed it is ultimately Valentin's pride that causes him to resist the goodwill of his few remaining friends and descend even further into self-destruction. The ending here however is solidly Hollywood old-school, as befitting of the movies of that era 'The Artist' tries to emulate as well as a perfect panacea for these gloomy depressing times of late.Hazanavicius' film is as much about the story it wants to tell as its method, and it excels as much in the former as it does in the latter. So much is conveyed using so little, amazing it is to realise how much can be told just through moving pictures. There are also brilliant analogies here- in particular, one where Valentin is standing at the back of an almost empty cinema trying to gauge the reception to his latest movie, while the screen shows his character sliding slowly into quicksand stretching his hand out for help. The technique here is as rich as the emotions on screen, and establishes Hazanavicius as a bona fide filmmaking talent.Of course, Hazanavicius has some generous help from his lead actor, Jean Dujardin, who gives one of the best performances of the year. He portrays with subtlety, grace and nuance the transformation of his character's fate from adulation to apathy, an even greater achievement especially when you consider his comedic flair in the film's first half- hour. This flair is well-matched by his co-star Bejo, sassy with a positively infectious vibe at first and then surprisingly affecting later on.In 'The Artist', Hazanavicius has created a film to be loved by both cinephiles and casual audiences alike. Those with both love and knowledge for the medium will certainly appreciate his many references; while those with less of the latter will still be taken by his panache for telling as much, and perhaps even more, of a story than many of today's films without sound. At its heart is a touching love story, one drawn out of the ilk of the enduring love classics of old and infused with modern-day wit and zest. Mark our words- 'The Artist' could very well be next year's Best Picture, so don't let this work of cinematic art slip you by.www.moviexclusive.com",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A very good throwback to Silence,"Rating-8/10The Artist is a silent film that although remains quiet throughout, produces a very fun little story and a dazzling acting display from the leading man. This film mixes comedy and drama, brings emotion and even action and makes a film that is actually for a movie we never see or haven't seen for near a century, pretty damn good. I felt this movie was strongly very good, and here below is why so.The story is short but fun and as it goes along it reveals the emotion from our main character and who and what is making him sad. With a comedy vain running through it this is actually quite funny and just little bits can make you laugh, but also really feel something for the characters involved. This is a great homage to the silent movie generation and it's basic demise, this is shown in fantastically choreographed dancing and acting scenes which just add to the big show that unravels before our eyes. One last thing I liked about this was that it somehow mixes a bit of slapstick to drama to create a film that doesn't overdo either thing.Jean Dujardin does a fine job in the main role as George Valetin and no wonder he won an Oscar for this, he just somehow fits silent movie acting to a tee. Berenice Bejo playing the role of Peppy Miller is good but overshadowed by Dujardin who just seems to take all the credit with this film, and he fully deserves it. I would have liked to have seen more of John Goodman but with his trademark voice being drowned out in silence maybe it is OK, one of the best characters if not the best is Jack the dog(Valentins pet), he is such a fun dog for the film and the chemistry between Dujardin and Jack is just perfection, best animal duo for a long time.Michael Hazanavicius directs and writes this wonderfully and he couldn't have done this much better with it's fun script and just little things he has told the actors to do that make it so much an adventure. With it being silent you may think this would be boring or hard to understand the plot, but the score for this move is one the highlights of this film and leaves you saying ""if this doesn't win best score at the Oscars, then I don't know film"", such a fantastic thing to accompany great acting.I felt with this that although it is very good, it doesn't escape criticism, it isn't the most smart plot and you may see this is rated very highly but I did feel the story is fairly straight forward but still fun. See with this also with many it hasn't really got things wrong, it is just it's entertainment level and I know some will dislike it being silent for that long, but I also think criticism is up to you if you watch it.People should enjoy this if you want a fun Comedy/Drama with a little Romance as it turns out fun and adventurous. Those who will dislike, well it is a silent film and I can imagine some won't want to sit through it all, albeit it is a short film though. This is a throwback of course to silent cinema and so anyone who maybe likes this era of cinema will love it as it couldn't be any different to back then, just good fun.Overall I give this a 8/10 meaning it is Strongly a Very Good film, bordering on being a great. With this you get silent cinema at it's very best and to say it is made in 2011 you may think it wouldn't live up or feel like it like others, but it actually is and makes you feel good after watching it, a true adventure. A final thing to say is that just have fun with this, watch it in a big happy mood and you will thoroughly enjoy this, and remember, look out for the scenes with George and Jack, cinema gold.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
So much fun,"I confess that I'm a sucker for films about filmmaking; I love them in every form, shape and color. As a result I probably would have liked The Artist no matter what. It's a good movie by any measure, though; a beautiful homage to the Hollywood of the 20's, made with incredible amounts of love and respect. The black and white cinematography is perfectly gorgeous; it echoes the style of the 20's but with a more sensitive modern touch that makes every shot a work of art. Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo both deliver wonderful performances; Dujardin in particular was clearly born to act in silent films. James Cromwell is also terrific, even if some of the others, like John Goodman, don't fit in as well. The Artist is entertaining, funny and also quite touching, Dujardin delivering huge amounts of emotion without talking.It's not a masterpiece, though, nor is it the best movie of the year. The basic premise was explored long ago in Singing in the Rain, and The Artist doesn't have the same kind of timeless staying power; nor does it have the cynical wit of Mel Brooks' Silent Movie. The Artist is first and foremost a homage and a call-back, and it could have easily have gone for a completely different plot. It works for what it is; some clever things are done with the format, especially the first dream sequence. But in its basis it remains not much more than a very good silent movie, lots of fun for cinephiles and film history lovers - actually, scratch that: it's lots of fun for everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The thing that makes it different is the story about changes in cinematography, kinda reminds me of ""Singing in the Rain"" or even ""Once upon a time in ... Hollywood!"".
However, there wasn't enough relationship story of the main characters, which makes the whole movie a little bit strange for me. Still great, though!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo are Artists,"This movie is absolutely exceptional, even though the plot and the fact that it was black/white and silent was not very appealing to me( I am male, 25) ""the artist"" is a wonderful movie that brought me to tears.The good thing about the fact that the movie is silent is that it makes you keep your eyes on the screen because you are forced to read the actors emotions from their faces. (sometimes you have to lip-read too!)I have never watched a movie with Jean Dujardin or Bérénice Bejo, but I am definitely going to look at what else they did, they did a fantastic job and John Goodman should be nominated for best supporting actor.The story was great, the music and the acting was absolutely amazing!Must See!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
black and white boring product,"If you really fancy silent movies from long long ago en do not mind the lack of sounds in general en lack of voices from people talking to each other and you like the thin story's from 80 years back you must see this film. If not you will probably find this movie terribly slow and non dramatic. Drama is normally (among others) built around or grounded in sounds and voices. That's why the introduction of movies with voices was such a huge step forward! The Artist is really an almost complete silent movie with storyboards (!) tot tell the story. For reasons unexplained, the spectator is brought back in history, between 1927-1935. Not by the story which is situated about 80 years ago, but by the philmographic techniques. No zoom, no sound (except some music, which is OK), black and white, storyboard, etc. Thus it is very difficult, if not impossible to connect with the characters. Characters are also cardboard and the story is very simple and flat, as in more movies about 80 years old. With a running time of 100 minutes the movie is too long or at least feels far too long. I found the movie very boring. It is certainly not the best movie from this year",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Golden Age of Hollywood!!,"I have a rule, and that is; once I first put on a movie I must watch it till the end. And so I did, I thought what the F*** is this, the first 8 minutes, but then I was stuck. It caught my attention several times, and it stayed interesting. George and Peppy are two very charismatic characters and you want to know more about them as soon as they enter the spotlight.I thought the actors and actresses input were great and I admire Michel Hazanavicius the director. It's so incredible well done! I felt like I lived during the early era of movie making - . AND I LOVED THE WAY IT WAS EDITED!I highly recommend this! It's great, and I don't want to spoil anything but I think the ending is fantastic!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent!...,"I found this film a breath of fresh air; it took me back to Saturday morning TV when they used to show the odd silent movie. A simple love story with some great acting and a brilliant musical score really hit the mark. I did find, though, that George's decline went on a little too long, just when you thought he'd hit bottom there was a little further to go. But that's the only criticism I have, it's beautifully made in the style of the time and, although it may not be for everyone. A marginally lower score this time around; I guess it didn't quite have the same impact it did on the big screen Still well worth a look though!SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.4/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Très artistiques!,"A refreshing film so beautifully made that it's easy to be enchanted by its simplicity. You may wrinkle your nose up and be tempted to give up on it when you realise that it's a silent film depicting the era when silent films were being replaced by 'talkies'. But I encourage you to persist in watching this magic unfold with beautiful imagery that has been skilfully crafted by a talented crew. French director, Michel Hazanavicius's vision was explicitly carried out with exquisite costumes, sets, and impressive cinematography by Guillaume Schiffman. My favourite shot was when Valentin pours his drink over the glass table. Such creativity.The story is simple yet captivating – enriched by fine acting from Jean Dujardin who won an academy award for Best Actor, and Bérénice Bejo, nominated for an academy award. I have to give special mention to Uggie, Valentin's dog, who no doubt stole many hearts as the unsung hero in the film. Dujardin plays the role of George Valentin, mega star of silent pictures who is mercilessly dumped by the studio head, Al Zimmer, played by John Goodman, when 'talkies' become the next 'hot ticket'. By this time, Peppy Miller, played by Bejo has risen to fame, from an extra to a leading lady, with the help of Valentin.The film is not just about the end of silent films, and the end of an actor's career, but about loyalty, pride, change, despair, triumph and tragedy, and finding hope through love. That is what brings colour to this beautiful black and white film. It also honours the beautiful architecture, costumes, fashion, cars, and elegance of an era long gone. It is ironic that this film has won so much acclaim in this modern world we live in, where the old is tossed aside, as Valentin was, only to be revived by someone who cared enough to see the value of showing the newer generations the evolution of technology and the stability of human love, (let's not forget the loyalty of man's best friend). Our world is so noisy and busy that it takes a little while to adjust to the film's lack of dialogue. The importance of music is clearly apparent in helping the film to flow as there was a moment where there was no sound whatsoever and it stuck out like a sore thumb. It's strange how complete silence can make us feel abnormal.It is also a lesson to scriptwriters, that copious dialogue does not enhance a film and is completely unnecessary. Skilled actors can tell a story with expressions and body language. The Artist is a pleasant surprise and another gem to be added to the collection of classic films. I encourage you to watch it, after all, it was nominated for ten Academy Awards and won five, including Best Picture, and Best Director.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautifully told story,"A silent film, in black and white, led by two French stars that are virtually unknown in the United States, it doesn't seem like the kind of movie that, outside of art-house buffs, would catch on with a broader audience. But, the Weinstein instincts were right on as the movie played like gangbusters to critics (who applauded several times through the screening at Cannes), but moreover, Hazanavicius' film is a pure joy. Wildly entertaining, with a big generous heart, ""The Artist"" is not just an exercise in old school filmmaking, it's a beautifully told story that is classic and timeless in feel.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sucker punch!,"This film is so captivating without ""Sound"" it just slaps the normal films in the face. The plot is not novel yet once you start watching it, you can't take your eyes off even though you can see what's coming miles away. Second viewing is as much pleasurable as the first because this film does not rest its appeal on gimmicks, plot twists or tension. It's just a joy ride even when it's sad. The beautiful acting and the unforgettable scenes just ask it to be viewed again and again. You get so stuck on this film just like Valentin gets glued to Peppy Miller in the ballroom scene. There is music throughout the film yet never does it steal the focus from the visuals. A story told silently, it puts the films of today to shame which use colors, CGI, sound and now even 3D. The film shows what films should be about first and foremost - storytelling.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Consummate Example of Pure Cinema.,"""The Artist"", directed by Michel Hazanavicius, is an exquisite love letter not only to silent cinema, but to the Golden Age of Hollywood. Inspired by the likes of ""A Star is Born"" and ""Singin' in the Rain"", this five time Academy Award winner, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor, successfully uses silent film technique to enhance the story rather than using it as a gimmick to attract attention.If there is an artist in this film, then it is the director for brilliantly using all the devices of cinema to create a world that does not need sound: it is a world unto itself, inhabited by people like Jean Dujardin, who seemingly effortlessly make us understand his psychosocial and emotional state through his body language. It is a difficult task for any actor, but Dujardin pulls it off with aplomb.The direction too is outstanding, fully utilising all manner of cinematic tricks to show what can be done; this is pure film using images to convey the plot without relying on dialogue.In fact the only two uses of sound are marvellously handled: the first, in a wonderfully surreal dream of Valentin, his fears plague him with a nightmare about the coming of ""talkies"" to Hollywood. Then normal sound is restored in the very final scene and the effect is like watching your very first movie: magical.The score by Ludovic Bource is very, very good, underlining the emotional resonance boldly, adding another layer of excellence to the film.If it has any faults, it is that in quoting such a vast array of cinematic legends, from Fritz Lang to ""Citizen Kane"" (1941), ""Sunset Boulevard"" (1950) to Douglas Fairbanks, it sabotages itself by being too sophisticated and knowing; this is not a film that could ever have been made in the 1920's. However, it is a small flaw when put into perspective against the joy and freedom of expression found in the silent film technique that overflows onto the screen.This is a consummate example of what the cinema can do when all of the film's makers are at the top of their talent and skill; breathtaking.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""I'm not a puppet!

Is ""The Artist"" a good movie? - definitely. Is it worth of the awards it won? - definitely. Now the main question - was it wort of winning the Oscar for the Best Movie of the year? In my opinion - no.As i said, ""The Artist"" is great movie, charming movie, made with a good idea, wonderful performances of two leading actors, and with a nice score. And yet, i would prefer ""The Descendants"" of taking home the Oscar for a best movie. It's when i first time heard all the buzz about ""The Artist"", and the love it portraits to Hollywood's ""history"", i could bet on everything that we already have a Best Oscar winner for 2011.

The Artist - Review,"Every person who is obsessed with movies and filmmaking has that one movie that made them interested in the medium, and for me, that film was The Artist. The film came out in 2011 and it was a black and white silent film, the same way movies were used to be back in the 20's and 30's, in fact, the film takes place in the final days of silent movies when the talkies started to rise, which is how they used to call movies with voice audio, the film is about a famous actor of the silent era and his downfall when this films slowly disappear, and we also see the rise of a young actress in the talkies era and a big part of the film is the relationship that forms between this two and how it changes through the years, what I love about this film is that it feels so much as a love letter to Hollywood and filmmaking in general, even though it was released on 2011, it feels like a piece of cinematic history. The acting is across the board excellent, everyone does an excellent job in convening emotion without saying words and this also comes from excellent direction, you can tell the director really love the medium, the music is also great, it really captures the style of the era is representing. Something that should be noted is that I never felt the movie was slow or boring, I felt constantly entertained, there was always so much movement in every shot, which makes sense considering this was a silent film, this is something very, VERY few people are familiar with nowadays but the pacing felt just right, there isn't really a scene that drags in my opinion. Overall the film is just fantastic and I can't really find much wrong with it, this is the film that awoke my interest in filmmaking and made me start to appreciate films in a way I didn't even considered before.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simply Irresistible,"I loved this film. The lead character was charming, and made me understand completely what my parents and grandparents found so interesting about the cinema of their day. This film never really let me go, from beginning to end. It had a very specific tone, that was never violated (except for a purpose), yet never did I feel it was boring. Its surprises were (usually) subtle, probably appreciated more by those familiar with early cinema. Yet, even those who aren't, could be drawn into the story. Seems like everyone loves this film, and so there is little I can say about this film that hasn't been said. I did feel there was an underlying theme that those who don't love themselves can be loved and admired by everyone, but still have a really hard time loving themselves and others.One other thing I would comment on is the use of the Bernard Herrmann score during a segment of the film. I thought it was an amazingly intelligent use of the music. The scene was getting just on the edge of being too much for the overall tone of the film, and the score's use telegraphed intensity, yet, because it was a recognizable score used in a previous specific dramatic context, it was almost tongue in cheek, and lightened the mood just enough – almost to melodrama – without losing the serious drama. Honestly, it made me LMAO, while still caring about the character's situation. I would dare to say Bernard Herrmann would have loved it too.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A shining example of creative art and love for cinema!,"'THE ARTIST': Four Stars (Out of Five)2011's 'Best Picture' Oscar front-runner (as well as 9 other nominations) and the most critically acclaimed movie of the year is this black-and-white silent film! It stars 'Best Actor' Academy Award nominee Jean Dujardin and 'Best Supporting Actress' nominee Berenice Bejo. The film was written and directed by Berenice's husband, 'Best Director' and 'Best Original Screenplay nominee, Michel Hazanavicius. I didn't find the film to be quite as good as all the awards and critical acclaim it's received but it's definitely a very unique and original film going experience.The film is set in 1927 Hollywood during the last great days of silent film. It focuses on one of the biggest stars of that era: (the fictional) George Valentin (Dujardin). Valentin feels his marriage, sanity and everything else he holds near and dear fall apart when he starts to become a fading star from a bygone era due to the arrival of talking films. A young rising starlet named Peppy Miller (Bejo), that he helped give a career boost to, fondly watches over him though as he continues to drift into destitution and madness.The movie is a shining example of creative art and love for cinema, in that way I definitely admire it. It's also an honest story of self-indulgence, excessive pride and depression. Not the uplifting romance some people might be expecting but a quality drama nonetheless. The directing, art design, cinematography and acting are all exceptional. Is it the best film of the year? Not by a long shot, especially when movies like 'WARRIOR' are out there, but a very good film all the same.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe8CEO75Pj0",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A must see film,"This film is extraordinary, it stands out from the crowd. Only a gifted mind can create such a masterpiece. I loved the director's perspective of the Cinema at that time, a genuine appreciation of silent movies.'The Artist' describes life itself perfectly, it shows how the changing and cruel society treats the human being and how difficult is to come through an inability. Both the main actors are magnificent in their roles. Jean Dujardin's lovely smile and Bérénice Bejo's classic beauty are remarkable. A special mention for the dog too.Ironically, with this film, the French have scored a great goal against the massive American film industry.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Engaging, shamelessly romantic and an absolute joy to watch!","First of all I wanted to say that I created an account with IMDB specifically so I could write this review simply because I wanted to counter the utter rubbish being said about it by some reviewers.I came to this film a long time after it was initially released but I'm so glad I finally found it. It's an utter gem of a movie and it's not just me saying this - look at the overall score! It stays true to it's self imposed restrictions: it's both silent and black and white, but if you think these are too limiting, think again. The acting is top notch and Jean Dujardin is so believable as a silent movie actor I found myself wondering if his character was actually based on one of the stars from that era. Likewise, Berenice Bejo is captivating and strikes just the right tone throughout the 1h 40m running time. As the credits rolled I felt that contented feeling you get when you've been thoroughly enthralled. The fact that this is a European film about Hollywood gives it a certain edge in my view.Now then, a word about the naysayers... I guess there will always be some folk who simply 'don't get' a film because they aren't that bright, whilst others purposely take a contrary position simply because they like the sound of their own voice (or in this case, the self aggrandizing joy of seeing their own ill-judged opinions on the internet!) but forget them.

Best Picture Oscar & Bafta 2012,"Like all the previous positive reviews, mine is exactly the same. Keeping it short and sweet, this film is pure genius and conveys the magic of cinema that so rarely comes across on the screen today.

There are so many magical and memorable moments from this film and you must see it for yourself to enjoy the full treat.

"The Art of Self-Pity and Silent, Sentimental Mush","*Possible Spoilers*Nope. Sorry. I found The Artist's ""silent movie"" concept to be, for the most part, a major misfire and a real test of my patience.OK. At first I could accept (sort of) this film's ""no talking"" policy because its story was set in the years of silent films (from 1927), but, once its story moved into the talking era, the effect of non-speaking actors and the continued use of dialog cards quickly lost its initial novelty.There was absolutely nothing new or fresh about what went on in The Artist's story. Like, haven't we all seen this same old scenario all before, ad nauseum?Since The Artist relied solely on nobody audibly speaking to carry it through to its corny ending, that, from my perspective, just wasn't sufficient enough to keep the picture interesting and hold my undivided attention. I found it was a badly conceived idea for a feature-length picture.Even though this b&w film was a depiction of the silent-era of film, it, in itself, did not have the proper feel of an authentic silent picture. It had clearly missed the mark.I have seen plenty of silent films in my days, but The Artist just wasn't able to capture that essential feeling which naturally comes to one while viewing a genuine ""silent"". The look and feel of this film was definitely all wrong.I really can't believe that The Artist actually won an Oscar for ""Best Picture"". This is one of those movies that (again) I suspect people are afraid to come right out and say that they don't really like it much. Because if you say that then you're considered to be so uncool (or something equally dumb like that).Now, don't get me wrong here, I'm not saying that I hated The Artist (there were parts about it that appealed to me), but, it really wasn't deserving of all the praise and admiration that it garnered for itself.Perhaps if The Artist had been a bit more uplifting like Singin' In The Rain, instead of focusing so intensely in on George Valentin's tedious, self-pitying despair, then I think it would've been worthy of all the acclaim that was heaped upon it. But, as The Artist stood, it wasn't adequate enough to be considered such an all-time winner.And, to be honest, the only ""character"" in this picture who I thought was deserving of an Oscar for ""Best Actor"" was the cute, little dog who knew about a million clever tricks. Yeah. I think that this smart pup deserved to be at least named, but, sadly enough, he remained nameless throughout this film's 100 minutes of silence which was literally so loud at times that it was almost deafening.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Does it have the same performance? We wait. Here in Brazil the film has been a success. People thought that by being silent and black and white film would be bad. Coompletamente missed.

A Beautiful Film,"I don't quite know what to say about this film. Let me start by saying that my parents and I, who all love film, were somewhat unexcited to see this film. We read the reviews and we are always in tune with the Oscar hype and we went to see it, almost out of a sense of duty. Good lord were we wrong. It is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. It's groundbreaking in the sense that it reminds us that you can have a poignant story without words, not to mention special effects. However, groundbreaking implies that it will create a series of films in the same vein. This is not true either. Silent film is not making a comeback. This is just a bright shining gem in filmmaking – one of the best in a long time in my opinion. It's probably going to sweep the Oscars, it certainly deserves to. As many nominations as it has, I actually think that either John Goodman or James Cromwell should have been nominated in the BSA category. Whoever allowed a filmmaker like Michel Hazanavicius to make this film the way he wanted to deserves now all the accolades that this film will receive after the Oscars. It's going to blow up, if it already hasn't – and it deserves to. Make sure you see it in the theater though, won't translate to DVD as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
That is the movie.,"Excellent set-up progression and resolution...Seems like you are watching a real 1930s movie. If I did not know, movie was shot in the modern times I cannot tell the difference. All scenes are meaningful and containing purpose. The base feature which is silence, provides focus to the movie. But you never say ""If only I heard this part of the scene "". We feel all the emotions without talking.Story is also beautiful. Both conflicts of the movie (changing of the movie types and George-Peppy relations) are clearly mixing within each other and this feature bewitches us.Also masterly production and costume design satisfy us.

When film language began there wasn't any sound and I've always thought image is the most elegant way to tell a story. Soap operas relate on dialogue to tell you what's going on, and that's why I've always thought their story telling is vulgar. This is the opposite side of the spectrum.

Jean Dujardin gallantly attempts to carry the movie through, but the hyper cliché, almost comic book amalgam of many popular screenplays from the silent era that is the source material for this movie, kills his effort to save the film.Watching The Artist to get an experience of a real silent movie, is like buying a $50 Breitling from Canal Street, in China Town, New York City for an experience of the actual watch.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Artist (2011) - Sit Back and Enjoy the Silence...Or We Can't Be Friends Anymore!,"No, you probably don't know the lead actors. Also, the whole movie is in black and white, and there's hardly any dialogue. But I beg you, give this movie a chance, or I just flat out don't want to see you anymore! With early Oscar buzz and highly acclaimed reviews, ""The Artist"" is a black-and-white silent movie about a silent movie star, and his fall from fame. Now, out of all the movies in 2011, ""The Artist"" is one of the most hilarious, enjoying, and breathtaking movie-going experiences of this or any other year. Jean Dujardin totally deserves a Best Actor win, stealing the whole show for his work as George Valentin, a silent movie actor during the 1920s silent era of Hollywood, with his trusted companion, a hilarious puppy. Seriously, that dog has his best laughs in the entire film, and he's one of the best animal actors ever seen on screen. Then, he meets the gorgeous Berenice Bejo as Peppy Miller, a big fan who soon takes over Hollywood by storm, leaving George on the far sidelines. James Cromwell is also really brilliant as George's ever-loyal valet who is always there for George, even in his tightest situations. John Goodman is awesome as the studio boss, who tells George that ""talkies"" are going to take over the new future of cinema. With the talkies being introduced, and the silent movies are disappearing, George's career disappears as well, and loses all his popularity rapidly. All I need to say is that I've never had this much fun watching a movie in a long, long time. I enjoyed every single moment in this movie, from beginning to end. This is a unique and different movie-going experience, and it felt like watching a film in the 1920s. The casting ensemble is breathtakingly brilliant, and they didn't need to say anything. I was blown away by the sight of this movie. The addition of using the black-and-white detail, and the silent movie style is super unique. The cinematography is amazing, the editing is super, the music is beautiful, and the acting really carries the movie. Written and directed brilliantly by Michel Hazanavicius, ""The Artist"" is a beautifully well-made motion picture that teaches about the age of motion pictures, the changes that new technology will make, and how some fame can go away, just like that! So, bravo to the people that made ""The Artist"". This is one of the best movies ever made, and I hope that this is the Best Picture winner of 2011. ""The Artist"", in my review, ""a visualizing and enchanting motion picture experience"".",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
More grasping than an normal movie,"I can't believe it. Just can't.I started to see this movie with extremely low expectations, and was complaining about ""how can a silent, black and white movie can be nominated for best picture, whilst other great films are left apart (well, not so much great films, the descendants was the worst movie I've ever saw in my life)"".Well, I was wrong. Jean Dujardin fits perfectly for the role, and he's acting was excellent. He displayed his character at %100.Other thing I was scared about. The script. I was terrified that the script would be just too ""slow and old style"" like a 1930's movie would be. Wrong. Great Script! When you are expecting an obvious situation during the film, there is a twister, which continuous to gasp attention.Bérénice Bejo isn't of such recognition of this review (although she is Argentine, as me) but still does a fine job, although she is a socialist. I would expect from her to donate all her Oscar and revenue money for the ""communist cause"".Nevertheless: Jean+Good Script+Curiosity for being just a 2011 silent, black and white film = An emotional film that gets to the bottom of your soul.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Artistic film. Not more, not less.","This film was very ironic on itself, modern silent film about silent films. It used quite a few cool techiniques and some ideas were very cool even though predictable. The story is very ironic too. If you love silent films you'll love this, if you love artsy films you'll love this, but otherwise it's a predictable overly ironic artsy film. It's enjoyable, but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece or genius.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Beautifully Modern Classic Silent Movie,"The Artist tells the story of George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), a silent film star who happens to bump into one of his fans, Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), inspiring her to audition for a minor role as a dancer at the studio where he works. However the world of film is changing, moving away from silent films into talking-pictures, and while Peppy rises to fame quickly George is set in his ways and refuses to believe that silent film is dead.I have never seen a feature film in the silent movie style, and I loved this. Black and white films always look classy and this one had a beautiful authentic 1920's feel that completely disguised the fact that it is a modern film. The musical score set the scenes perfectly, creating atmosphere to replace the words that would normally tell the story, which flowed wonderfully and was consistently entertaining. Dujardin and Bejo brought their characters to life through charming (and not overdone to compensate for the lack of dialogue) acting and sweep you up in their heart-warming tale of forbidden romance. There's also an incredibly well-trained dog that adds to the overall sweet nature of the film. The story is initially fairly simplistic but that really adds to the overall charm, and once the plot has been set up we see the complex nature of George's life and how he struggles to cope in a changing world, something that no doubt many people can relate to. Peppy on the other hand is embracing the new age and all of the opportunities coming her way, which again is very relatable, and the clash of these two character's personalities adds the complexity to the plot.The Artist is classic and beautifully well-done, with highly relatable characters and an authentic silent movie styling that is captivating and rare nowadays. It's a heart-warming and romantic story guaranteed to make you smile (and a little nostalgic), I highly recommend it!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Different Kind of Excellence,"""The Artist"" has proved so many things and I am certain this is going to change a lot of people's point of view on the arts of silence. ""The Artist"" perhaps appears as a simple trip of nostalgia that brings us to the past and reconnects with the beginning of films, but more importantly it excels in a different manner and it shows us that silent movies are not necessarily boring and that the lack of dialogue can be masterfully turned into richer contents and depth.The two leads deliver solid performances and the background music is incredible. All in all, this has been a wonderful experience and it has blown me away.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
