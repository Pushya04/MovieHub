X-Rated Paddington,"I think a lot of people miss the entire point of this film. The mere fact that it centres around a talking teddy bear should be a clue that this is just irreverent comedy and nothing more, yet it seems like many critics are aghast at its lack of seriousness and authenticity.Unlike most comedies made this century, Ted is actually funny. The gags are vulgar and often predictable but they are nonetheless very amusing and perfectly timed. And honestly, what more do you want? This is just a good piece of comic relief.On top of that, its a very slick looking film with great animation and a well-conceived score. My only real complaint is that Mark Wahlberg does not work as the hapless middle-aged failure. He is just too clean-cut too pull it off and its hard to buy into him being so tragic. I think this role would have been a perfect fit for Vince Vaughn who is much better at carrying off these type of characters.One of the few gross-out comedies that actually works. Don't take it seriously, just sit back and enjoy the sheer nihilistic ridiculousness of it all.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A party of a film... not for the easily offended,"I really should start this with a warning: This film is not for everyone! If you are easily offended (by swearing, sexual references, casual racism and various stereotypes) then you should read no further and give this one a miss. However, if you are a fan of Seth MacFarlane's other projects (Family Guy, American Dad) and maybe you call yourself an ""80's child"" (so many pop culture references to this time) you are going to love this.Sure some parts are a little disjointed, the story seems vaguely familiar and the ""moral"" of it kind of gets lost but quite frankly, it's just so darn funny none of that matters. The script is hilarious, the cameos are fantastic and the soundtrack is perfect.Ted himself is well animated and Seth (apart from sounding a little like Peter Griffin) voices him with the usual competence. Mark Wahlberg delivers exactly what we have come to expect from him, and the rest of the cast seem to have had fun filming, which comes across in the various performances no matter how big or small. The acceptance and interaction of everyone with a living teddy-bear adds to the simple joy of this film, and you find yourself happy to watch and not question why nobody is fazed by this. TED is a laugh a minute, party of a film and I, for one, can't wait to see it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A Predictable, Enjoyable, Light-hearted Delight","Ted has gained popularity in India due to its light and charming nature, earning a place on my watchlist for nearly a decade. Since it was leaving the OTT platform, I finally decided to indulge myself anticipating a great movie.It began promisingly. Mark Wahlberg's remarkable acting skills were evident, although this might not be his finest work. Mila Kunis was also appreciated in her role.The movie unfolds with a series of conflicts, but it becomes evident that these conflicts will arise between the protagonist and his relationship with his girlfriend considering there was a ted / the best friend. The predictable nature revolves around these conflicts with Ted eventually making up for them.The film provides light-hearted comedy, and Ted's character, with his crazy antics, adds a sense of enjoyment. However, the movie failed to meet my expectations, feeling rather average.In essence, Ted offers a fun and enjoyable experience, predominantly relying on comedy to entertain the audience. If you appreciate comedy, the film is likely to amuse you, but those seeking more substance may find it less engaging.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ted (2012) review,"I just want to state off hand that this is my first movie review, well other than just telling someone what I thought. So if you are looking for a well written, witty review then.. you might want to stop reading now. But since this movie is still in production, this will probably be your best bet for the time being.I just went to a free screening of Ted at the Greenback theater in Sacramento, CA. And I just have to say off the bat, I LOVED it. A movie hasn't made me laugh that hard in a long time. Now, I'm not going to give you any more information than the description because with the movie not even being released yet, I think that would be a spoiler of some sort. But I will tell you that was so much better than what I imagined it would be, granted that was before I knew it was directed and voiced over by Seth Macfarlane. So if you're a fan of his, you're definitely in for a treat, and even if you're not I still think you would enjoy the innovative comedy that comes from a snarky and crude teddy bear companion. The acting was very solid, from main characters to jerk bosses, and crazy.. well, crazy people.. the acting was very convincing and enjoyable. The story was great, while it might sound stupid to some, myself included, it's very well executed. Definitely not one of the movies that left me thinking ""the idea was good, but they could have done so much more with it"", it was actually quite the opposite. And this is certainly not a low budget film, the CGI animation reflects this. The furry bear voiced by Macfarlane is very realistic and believable.The only drawback I could possibly see that would cause someone displeasure would be, like a lot of new comedies, this film pushes the envelope in raunchy, vulgar humor. Plus the different amount of drugs used. This movie will receive (most likely), and be very deserving of a R rating. It doesn't rely solely on shock humor though, there is plenty of good old fashioned clean comedy. But if your like me, and that type of subject matter doesn't bother you, then I HIGHLY recommend this film. And if you're a Seth Macfarlane fan, then that's just a perfectly gift wrapped little bonus for you.",,Anonymous,Comedy
A standard comedy - but with a teddy bear,"Whilst I did not dislike 'Ted' I cannot say I was overly impressed by it. The hype and popularity that built up towards the film's release had me expecting something fresh, something that would keep me laughing days after. To my disappointment, 'Ted', to me, turned out to just another Rom-Com, its only real unique twist being Ted himself.Having said that, 'Ted' did provide some good laughs, whilst they weren't exactly side-splitting the film was entertaining and I did watch the entire feature without getting bored or uninterested. The animations for Ted were of a good quality, doing a good job in making it seem like Ted was actually there with the actors, rather than just a computer-generated 3D image.What I felt let 'Ted' down was it's predictability and lack of memorable or unique laughs. Being rated as a 15, 'Ted's plot didn't seem to suit it's targeted audience, I have seen similar story lines in films rated PG or even U but the explicit content of 'Ted' was clearly intended for more mature audiences, therefore I felt it deserved a more mature plot.Overall, I'd recommend 'Ted' to those who are looking for a relatively light-hearted story with a few giggles added in and a cursing, yet somehow still lovable, teddy bear. It's good, but nothing overly special.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Loved the movie!,"I went for the advanced screening and didn't expect that much from the movie. I knew it would be a good comedy with R rated jokes and didn't know that it would be emotional too!My wife almost started crying in one scene and suddenly laughed like anything ..

"Crude, lewd and rude = perfect! NOT a kid's movie!","I got into a screening of this movie thanks to my daughter, after waiting what felt like forever. I saw the unrated trailer on YouTube and couldn't wait to see it. As another reviewer said, if you like Family Guy, you'll like this. In some ways, it IS Family Guy. Wahlberg basically plays a Peter Griffin type character,a likable, but somewhat dimwitted guy. Ted is essentially Brian, smart, witty and self-centered and Mila is sort of a Lois type, hot and the grown up in the story. Be warned, this is NOT a children's movie. Nudity, drug and alcohol use, plus heavy on the profanity. In other words, go see it! Just leave your (little) kids at home.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the Best Comedies I've Ever Seen,"A smart, crude, but lively and hilarious comedy, Ted makes the most of its premise unlike any comedy before it, and truly shines as one of the funniest films I have ever seen. Mark Wahlberg and Ted, voiced by Seth MacFarlane, make for a lovely pair, and the two have chemistry I haven't in quite some time for a comedy film. Simply said, the film has it all. Booze, drugs, action, comedy, drama, Flash Gordon, everything. The soundtrack is great, the jokes are hysterical, the script is surprisingly impressive and realistic (for this type of scenario), and the direction is good as well. The pacing never seems to let up, and the film is almost exciting to watch by simply the fact it goes all in on what it set out to do. It's a truly top notch work for MacFarlane and proves to quite possibly be his best work yet. His talent shows in the film like never before, and he makes something truly delightful out of it. Ted isn't just rude and obnoxious, the film is full of heart too. And though the film may have a hard time taking its own matters seriously from time to time, when it needs to get emotional it does, and the film takes the risks it needs and accomplishes them. As with Ted coming to life in the film, this comedy is nothing short of a cinematic miracle, and proves to be one of the best experiences I have ever had watching a movie in my life (and I've seen over 1,000).
My Rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Solid fun movie,"One of my friends got tickets for the movie. So, I had absolutely no idea what Ted was going to be about. Then I saw Seth Macfarlane's name in the credits, and I instantly knew what to expect. Even the opening scene had the audience laughing!Ted, the carefree, weed-smoking teddy bear has been Mark Wahlberg's one and only friend from the age of 8. At 35, he is having trouble with his girlfriend (Mila Kunis) because of his immature behavior, mostly because of his teddy bear. As the movie progresses, we realize that he must decide between his true love and his beloved teddy.The jokes include the typical Family Guy sort of humor - ranging from crude and crass to Seth's favorite 80s cultural references. Family Guy fans should enjoy a movie version of their favorite family. The story line is almost too predictable, but we almost forget about the story in the middle of all the humor.I recommend watching the movie with a few friends and have a nice laugh. Just like an episode of Family Guy. Oh, and Mila Kunis is absolutely gorgeous and extremely lovable. There, you have one more reason to watch. 7 on 10 for the constant humor and the ridiculously funny teddy but the extremely ordinary storyline.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Consistently funny and a surprisingly cohesive effort from MacFarlane,"First there was Gollum, then Caesar the ape and now ... Ted? If you thought motion-capture animation was beyond the range of foul-mouthed R-rated comedy, here's your evidence to the contrary. ""Family Guy"" creator Seth MacFarlane has taken his love of characters who shouldn't behave like humans behaving like humans to the next level —and the big screen — with ""Ted,"" a story of growing up — at the age of 35.Fans of MacFarlane and ""Family Guy"" will be the first to tell you that the comedy pioneer has been more cold than hot lately (I guess those manatees in the tank of idea balls have been worked too hard). It's not easy to keep scoring laughs using the same non-sequitur formula over and over again, but fortunately ""Ted"" is a more comically cohesive effort than you'd ever expect from the king of unexpected random jabs, references and political incorrectness.If you haven't been curious enough to find out what the film is about already, ""Ted"" tells the story of how young John Bennett (who grows up to be Mark Wahlberg), who had trouble fitting in as a kid, made a wish on Christmas Day for his teddy bear to come to life. His wish comes true and Ted becomes world famous, even appearing on the Johnny Carson Show. But as Patrick Stewart lovingly and frankly reminds us in his role as narrator: like Corey Feldman and Frankie Muniz, eventually, people stop giving a ****.Despite a serious relationship of four years with Lori (Mila Kunis), nearly middle-aged John is still ripping bongs and watching '80s ""Flash Gordon"" with his equally irresponsible teddy bear best friend. Eventually, John must start to make sacrifices if he wants to become the adult that Lori wants him to be, and Ted is arguably the chief reason for his inability to shape up.There aren't exactly any curveballs in this story, but that's when you realize you're watching a film in which a man is trying to stop hanging out with his profane teddy bear. Despite the obvious outcomes, ""Ted"" has to be considered an original comedy.It's also consistently funny. Sure, the nature of many of the jokes is that they exist in a vacuum and aren't necessarily related to what's going on or what matters, but much of the references actually tie into the plot later on (such as Flash Gordon ... it'll make sense when you see it) and it's far less random than skeptics will come in expecting. That said, some of its best jokes and references will resonate on a personal level, i.e. if you watch this with a group of people, you're bound to laugh really hard at times when they don't and vice-versa.The only thing that feels a little out of place is a subplot involving Giovanni Ribisi as a creepy single father who has been a longtime admirer of Ted's and inquires about purchasing him for his overweight son. You've never seen Ribisi like this and that alone is amusing, but the focus of the film is on how John and Ted's mischief impacts his ability to grow up and get more serious with Lori, and this sort of butts into things.Yet for all its shenanigans, the amount of heart and sincerity in some of the relationship drama between John and Lori is surprising. Wahlberg and Kunis are generally pretty convincing, even if it's a bit weird that John is mature enough to have a relationship last four years but not enough to not screw things up at his job or avoid giving in to Ted's peer pressure. (Bear pressure?)The secret weapon is that Ted really is kind of adorable, and the mo-cap gives him an extra lifelike quality. The film hits some emotional notes early (who can't identify with loving a stuffed animal?) and this helps it to reconnect later on despite all the R-rated chaos in between. That ability alone assures ""Ted"" will be seen as better than a majority of foul- mouthed, dirty-minded comedies.""Ridiculous"" comes to mind as the best descriptor for ""Ted,"" which one has to imagine MacFarlane aimed for in the first place. His performance as the titular bear is certainly reminiscent of Peter Griffin (there's a wink to the audience about that, by the way), but more importantly, Ted is treated as more than just an opportunity for a never-ending string of jokes that are simply funnier because ""it's a teddy bear.""Maybe having to create a complete package in the form of a movie has helped MacFarlane learn how to tone down his shtick. Audiences will write you off if you deliver them something inconsistent and scatter-brained that goes beyond 30 inconsequential minutes of their lives, and MacFarlane and co-writers Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild make the majority of adjustments needed to honor that notion. ""Ted"" is as engaging as it is clever, funny and ridiculous.~Steven C",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ted,"Really funny at at times really stupid, Ted is not only extremely well performed by its all-star cast and an extremely satirical and stupidly funny film, its script and direction is also impressive, the music and touch is perfect which all makes for a very watchable and humorous comedy, the movie does still repeat itself and does feel tiring and slow-moving at times.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Family Guy on R-rated steroids,"Have you ever wondered what Peter Griffin would sound like with a Boston accent? Well the talking teddy bear Ted is the answer in Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane's directorial debut, Ted. MacFarlane provides the voice of Ted in this raunchy comedy about a young boy who makes a Christmas wish that brings his stuffed teddy bear to life. But, as the boy grows up, so does Ted. Jump forward twenty years to the story of a grown man balancing work, a girlfriend, and his best friend Ted the teddy bear.Ted is raunchy, vulgar, crass, and culturally relevant. It's a comedic styling much in the vein of Family Guy or any of MacFarlane's other shows, just pumped up with R-rated steroids. From the start with this film's wacky premise we know that it doesn't take itself too seriously and is really only here to deliver the laughs. It's a fairly predictable film and it's plot is very Hollywoodized at times, but it's also pretty damn hilarious. MacFarlane's off brand humor is where this film is successful, as one would expect. However, in about five or six years half the jokes in Ted will no longer be relevant as there are a lot of pop culture references littered throughout this film that will mean nothing in only a few short years.But for now practically all of Ted is absolutely hysterical. It's lots of foul language, plenty of potty humor, and a plethora of dirty sight gags that make Ted tick. Also, a fine helping of cameos keeps the humor fresh and increasingly hilarious, whether or not it makes any sense at all. Sometimes it's really just Seth MacFarlane showing off how far his Hollywood star power tentacles can reach, but none of it falls flat. In fact, very little of the humor in Ted falls flat. I really enjoyed this film. It's nothing more than another raunchy comedy, but it certainly entertained me, and what more need I ask for?",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Not the comedy I was hoping for,"¨No matter how big a splash you make in this world whether you're Corey Feldman, Frankie Muniz, Justin Bieber or a talking teddy bear, eventually, nobody cares.¨Since 1999 Seth MacFarlane has made a name for himself in television thanks to the success of Family Guy. He's also the man responsible for other successful animated series such as American Dad and The Cleveland Show. He's not only the creator of these shows, he also voices many of the characters as well. In his first venture into live action film he also voices the star of the movie: Ted, a teddy bear that magically comes to life after a lonely boy makes a wish. Ted is an R-rated comedy due to the fact that he happens to be very vulgar and getting stoned all the time. The film has had huge box office success in the United Stated and I was expecting Ted to be hilarious, but I guess my expectations were a little too high because I wasn't blown away by this movie. There were some funny scenes, but for the most part the film felt like an average comedy and it wasn't what I was hoping for. 2012 has failed to deliver a successful comedy, and for now 21 Jump Street reigns as the best one in my opinion. Ted is full of irreverent humor, but it's repetitive and you have the usual sexual, drug, and poop jokes. I couldn't find much originality to it, but I do have to say some of the scenes did work thanks to Ted and his best friend played by Mark Wahlberg, whom I've always said is great in comedies. This is a pretty formulaic buddy comedy where you have the typical two slacker best friends and a girl who gets in the way of their friendship and wants them to mature. The only difference is that this time around one of them is a talking teddy bear.The film begins with a narration (voiced by Patrick Stewart) about the story of lonely boy who gets his wish one Christmas morning when he asks for his teddy bear to become his best friend. When the teddy comes to life, John Bennett (played by Mark Wahlberg, and the younger version played by Bretton Manley) discovers that he has found his best friend who he names Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane). Ted becomes an instant celebrity as he is all over the news and is invited to all kind of talk shows. Ted changes young John's life for the better. The film then jumps to the present day where both have grown into adults. John is now 35 and has a healthy relationship with Lori (Mila Kunis). They've been dating for four years now. Ted is still living with John and has also grown up in the same way that his human buddy did. John and Ted like to spend time getting high together and talking about girls, drugs, and Flash Gordon. Everything seems to be going well for the trio until Lori gives John an ultimatum. It's Ted or her. Lori realizes that Ted is keeping John from realizing his full potential since they're always getting stoned and John is always late to work. John realizes that he has to make an important decision if he wants to save his relationship with Lori and the movie moves along from here.One of the things the film explores well is the transition from child to adulthood. We don't only see John grow up, but his teddy bear as well. Now being an adult doesn't mean you're mature and John and Ted are proof of that. They are irresponsible and practically only care about getting high all the time. They both are very nice people, but really immature. That's what drives Lori crazy, but the good thing about Ted is that these characters aren't stereotypical. Lori isn't a mean person who wants to separate the two best friends, but rather wants them to take responsibilities as adults. Ted also has character development and despite the fact that he's very inappropriate he also has a big heart and wished the best fro John and Lori. This isn't your typical face off between best friend and girlfriend. I was pleased with that aspect of the film. Another thing that worked really well for me in this movie was all the references to different films (especially Flash Gordon and Top Gun) and jokes about them. As a film lover you always enjoy those small references and gags. Some of the cameos were also pretty funny and highlights of the film. What I didn't like as much was the fact that some of the sexual and drug humor got a little bit repetitive and old. There were also several poop and fart jokes which are always a little repetitive in these buddy comedies. Ted is still a funny film, but just not the hilarious movie I was hoping for.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Fantastically funny!,"I am stunned by the number of negative reviews on here. We went to see Ted last night (the UK release date) and it was fantastic. In fact, it was the funniest film I have seen for years! The humour throughout is both obvious AND subtle, with masses of trademark Seth MacFarlane jokes as well as some expansion to his comedy repertoire made possible by having a live action film instead of an animation.Some people have commented on all the 80s references - that's the joke in itself - Seth always over-focuses on the 80s and he's poking fun at himself by doing it even more! He liked Star Wars, Indian Jones, Flash Gordon, Top Gun etc. So did I - which is partly what makes it all so cool! Fans of Seth's humour will love these little (and not so little) references as they have all been used extensively in Family Guy. You don't have to be 'over 35' to get the references, you just have to get that Seth is a big fan of the 80s and has great fun referencing stuff he likes. Some might call it self-indulgent but I thought it was very funny. Perhaps you have top be on a particular wavelength, I don't know.To suggest that he's being racist is also to misunderstand Seth MacFarlane - he's actually ridiculing people with stereotypical ignorant racist attitudes. Once again, he has done this in Family Guy and been similarly misunderstood. It's OK to make fun of racism or even the public's lack of knowledge on subjects such as 9/11 - neither of these mean that you're racist or pro-terrorist!In reference to the acting, Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis were very good (especially Mila). Ted was also superbly played (by Seth MacFarlane) and it was interesting to note how after a while you didn't even really think of him as a bear; he was just another character in the film. Lovely to hear Patrick Stewart's voice used again too. In addition, there was a generous use of Family Guy people, who were all great fun (especially the guy who does the voice of Joe Swanson) and looked like they were clearly enjoying the opportunity to be in Seth's film debut.In summary, if you don't like Seth MacFarlane's humour, there's a good chance you will not enjoy this film. However, if you like Family Guy and you have the ability to look beyond the obvious, then you might well love Ted as much as I did. I thought it was brilliant and can't remember the last time I laughed so much at a cinema!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Good sophomoric romp,"Other than some boring, worn out bong humor, much of their attempts at vulgar, low-brow humor are actually pretty funny. You can't help but laugh.

"Light on story, but very funny","I must start off by saying; I'm not a Seth MacFarlane fan. I don't think I have ever watched an entire episode of American Dad or Family Guy. But after watching the trailers and a couple of clips of Ted, I thought it looked funny and I'd give it a go.If you don't mind sexism, mild racism, jokes in poor / bad taste, I'm sure you'll love this film. But then, I guess that could apply to all Seth MacFarlane's back catalogue. In short, if you offend easily - don't watch this film.Ted is all over the place as a film. Even though there is at least one central theme running through it, I still felt it was more a collection of funny sketches than a well crafted story, hence my low rating. But, Ted is almost certain to make you laugh if you aren't easily offended. I laughed out loud at least 7 or 8 times and chuckled quite a few times. If you get Seth MacFarlane's humor - give Ted a go, I'm sure you won't be disappointed. But if you are expecting a film with great plot and character development, you will be left wanting. In short, it is crude, vulgar, offensive and extremely funny.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarious,"I had a fear it would be a bit repetitive with the whole family guy theme but it really wasn't. It surprised me how funny it actually was. I think it's partly due to the fact that it's not a cartoon so even any overly family guyish jokes were even funnier to see the actors playing it out. The trailers don't give away any of the proper funny jokes as well, Which is something I detest (you knew every funny joke in the hangover 2 because of the trailers) and to top it off the bear is probably the cutest thing I have ever seen. Mark Whalberg is - as always - so good. Loved it and I know it's one of those films that the more you watch it the funnier it gets.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Fun Ride with a Foul-Mouthed Teddy...,"Recently watched Ted and Ted 2 and here are my insights about the movie.""Ted"" is a comedy that delivers a lot of laughs with its outrageous humor and memorable performances. The story about a man and his foul-mouthed, animated teddy bear is unique and entertaining. The film's charm comes from its irreverent jokes and the chemistry between Mark Wahlberg and Seth MacFarlane's voice work. While the humor is strong, the story feels a bit more standard compared to its sequel. Overall, ""Ted"" is a fun watch, but it doesn't quite match the level of hilarity found in its follow-up.

Commercials took all the good stuff,"I am a huge fan of Seth McFarlane, and his brilliant shows Family guy and American Dad! I couldn't be more excited for this film to come out. Every time the commercial came on, i glued my eyes to the TV. Unfortunately, that may have hyped it up too much for me. It was a funny film, with good jokes, and a simple story line. But i think my head got the best of me, making me think it was going to be one of the funniest movies i'd ever seen. The commercials stole all the really good jokes, as it always seems to do. However, i do hope Seth McFarlane decides to make another film. He's a true comic talent, who isn't afraid to take some risks. Think about it, Mark Wahlberg staring in a comedy about a man who's best friends with a drugged out, foul mouthed teddy bear. Easily could've been a disaster, but it wasn't.

What if Alf...,"Starting as any ordinary Christmas story: When John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg), an isolated friendless kid, wishes for his teddy bear to become real a simultaneously falling star transforms the cuddly toy into a living being, thus becoming best buds ever. However life goes on after childhood, as time goes by, age catches on and the child becomes a man. Ted (Seth Macfarlane) was something of a celebrity back in the days, as a walking-talking-thinking teddy with no place in our scientific-based reality. Now foul-mouthed and wise-cracking his body has remained unchanged, but inside has grown up. Still living with John they form an inseparable duo, much to the chagrin of the latter's girlfriend Lori Collins (Mila Kunis). Perpetually attached to his childhood teddy bear, John fails to grow up and take on responsibility, instead working at a dead-end job and lacking any sensibility or push to alternate his existence.Admitedly a fan of Seth Macfarlane ""Ted"" seemed like a match in heaven - an intriguing premise, a stellar cast and the great comedic artistry of Macfarlane. Alas the sense of humour is a drop below his high standards, somewhat more crude and less whimsically well-placed than normal. Typically non-politically correct the overall concept works well, but lacks the substance and content for the long run, making the screen time enjoyment peter out. Most of the humour focuses on the cute teddy being lewd, heavy on drug use and apt to sexual endeavours with prostitutes or various pop stars. Inasmuch as it works for the character it doesn't make up enough backdrop for creating the holistic script. Wahlberg and Kunis do add some presence, but there just isn't enough meat on this comedic bone to make it work throughout - the silliness starts off as being charming, but just ends up tiresome.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Much funnier than I expected,"I don't normally like this sort of film, being a middle-aged, middle-class Englishman, but being stuck in a distant city with an evening to kill, I thought, why not? I found myself pleasantly surprised. On a scale where anything with Will Ferrell being 1 and Big Bang Theory being 10, this easily ranks 9. The humour is universal enough to travel across the Atlantic, and in between the gags there are real questions about what makes a man more than just a big kid, and how much does love over-rule loyalty.The CGI and the actors' eye-lines are faultless, the use of stuffed toys and graphics not always being obvious. I loved many of the gags, and being of a certain age, I so identified with the Flash Gordon motif running through the film.And it is such an original idea. What if a teddy bear really did come alive? The contradiction of Ted's childish appearance with a thirty-something jaded, crude personality gave an added punch to the humour, and Ted himself was not just a cartoon, but showed real pathos and feeling, even though he was a womanising dope-head.I loved it, and may even try to persuade 'Er Indoors to come see it with me a second time when I get home.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Recommended,"'TED' - 2012Directed by Seth MacFarlaneStarring Seth MacFarlane, Mark Walhberg and Giovani RibisiPlot Overview: When John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) was a little boy, he made a wish that Ted (Seth MacFarlane), his beloved teddy bear, would come alive. Thirty years later, foul-mouthed Ted is still John's constant companion, much to the chagrin of Lori (Mila Kunis), John's girlfriend. Though Lori's displeasure is exacerbated by the pair's constant consumption of beer and weed, she's not the one who's most disappointed with John; it may take the intervention of John's boyhood toy to help him grow up at last.Should this movie work? Perhaps. It has an alright premise but is dragged down by MacFarlane's frequently criticised brand of humour. I myself do enjoy the earlier seasons of 'Family Guy'{Even though it sucks now}. The balance of what it's quality SHOULD have been is right in the middle. And honestly, I like this movie. It's not an Oscar bait movie. It's not gonna change your life but I think if you sit down and watch it, and can tolerate MacFarlane's humour, you will be pleasantly surprised.What worked for this movie. Well for starters I will compliment the cast. Seth MacFarlane does an excellent job at voicing Ted. You can argue that it's just a carbon copy of his Peter Griffin character and there is 100% some merit to that statement. But honestly, I'd argue that there are some noticeable differences between the two. The CGI for Ted was also pretty well done and reasonably convincing.Mark Walhberg was also great in the movie. He doesn't deserve Oscars or critical acclaim but he provided a good enough performance. The supporting cast, which includes Mila Kunis, Giovani Ribisi and Jessica Barth, was also pretty great.Perhaps the film's greatest merit is it's awesome premise. The simple concept of a toy coming alive to be your friend is simply incredible. The story surrounding this premise was pretty weak but it wasn't awful. I wish it had gone through a redraft just to refine it a bit and to fix the awful ending, but it isn't atrocious.Humour is a subjective thing. A film can neither be funny nor unfunny, objectively. So if I tell you this movie is hilarious(which I personally think), you may not think so. All I will say is that I personally found it hilarious. If you do not, then that is your opinion. I cannot recommend this movie for the comedy but that is purely a subjective thing.My flaws with this film? As stated before, the main two are the general plot and the ending. It is way too sappy and way too ridiculous. Comedy is also a factor but I cannot recommend it based on that. If you enjoy some of MacFarlane's other work, then I recommend this movie. The premise and acting are both solid so if you like MacFarlane's humour, you've got a trifecta of reasons to see this movie. If you cannot stand MacFarlane, don't touch this with a 10ft pole. I'll rate this film 7 'Tubby McFat***ks' out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A big success on initial release, Ted has moments of comedic inspiration, but MacFarlane's reference heavy humor has dated the film considerably.","John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) is a 35 year old rental car associate whose best friend is a talking teddy bear named Ted (Seth MacFarlane) who came to life for John as a child after he made a wish. Now four years into a relationship with girlfriend Lori Collins (Mila Kunis), Lori finds herself wanting to move their relationship forward while John and Ted still maintain a carefree lifestyle of getting high and involved in shenanigans. Eventually Lori convinces John to talk to Ted about moving out, but John struggles balancing his friendship with Ted and relationship with Lori.Having successfully re-launched Family Guy on the Fox network as well as sister show American Dad, five years after creating two high profile hit shows Series' shepherd Seth MacFarlane and frequent collaborators Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild came up for the basis of a third show which would be reformatted into what would become Ted. While 20th Century Fox showed interest in the project, management was hesitant to entrust MacFarlane with his requested $65 million budget for not only an R-Rated comedy, but one helmed by a first time director. MacFarlane then took the project to Universal who greenlit the film with the requested budget. Released in 2012, Ted became the breakout comedy hit of the Summer making $549 million worldwide against its $65 million budget and even attained solid critical reception as well. Ted's success allowed MacFarlane to parlay his success into other ventures like relaunching the Cosmos docuseries and of course his pet project The Orville, but Ted itself hasn't aged all that well in the 10 years since its release.I will say the three leads of Ted with Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis, and Seth MacFarlane have solid chemistry and create a strong dynamic that carries the film. In addition to the chemistry among the leads MacFarlane's film also boasts a good supporting cast with the likes of Patrick Warburton, Patrick Stewart as the narrator, Joel McHale, and a very funny extended cameo from star of 1980s Flash Gordon Sam J. Jones playing a fictionalized version of himself in probably the film's funniest segment.The downside with Ted is unfortunately due to the nature of Seth MacFarlane's style of humor which is built upon references. Now unlike Seltzer and Friedberg's ""Movie Movies"" that put in references because they're trying to tap into cultural consciousness for the sake of suckering people in, MacFarlane is actually able to capture the humor from his references (for the most part). But the movie is heavily ingrained in a very narrow slice of time with references built in to the Adam Sandler movie Jack & Jill, Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, and Taylor Lautner and the cultural relevance of some of these people or events has waned considerably with time and because these references aren't as fresh in your mind as they were 10 years ago some of the jokes feel less on target. A point that wasn't great even when I first saw this movie was the subplot of Ted's stalkers Donny and his son Robert played by Giovanni Ribisi and Aedin Mincks respectively. While both are good actors with Ribisi being a reliable character actor and Mincks currently starring Cobra Kai, they're not all that funny here and are just weird and creepy which only serves to lead us to a chase climax that really didn't need to be in the movie.I was reminded of the Simon Pegg/Nick Frost movie Paul from the year before Ted that featured Frost and Pegg as two comic book geeks who have a road trip with a CGI alien played by Seth Rogen and both Paul and Ted are very similar (down to their one syllable name titles) but Paul built itself as an homage to science fiction classics of the 70s and 80s as well as geek culture so it's aged more gracefully in comparison to Ted which feels more sitcomy and tied to various cultural and social mindsets of the era that have lost their appeal.Ted opened a lot of doors for Seth MacFarlane as a producer, but it's not a movie that has stood the test of time. While it has some solid leads and some amusing moments littered here and there, the movie feels heavily tied to its point in time with explicit references made to pop culture ""flavors of the month"" that even people who watched the movie in theaters most likely forgot about within a year.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ted is one hilarious movie.,"So It's school holidays and I decide to go and see a preview screening of Ted at 7pm. The cinema is full and I am entirely surrounded by teenagers, sucking furiously on their frozen cokes and jittering around in their seats as if they were under the influence of some extremely high uppers. The movie begins, yet the kids don't settle down at all. Now normally this would completely annoy the hell out of me, and to some extent it did (hence me still thinking about it now), but it didn't take anything away from this farcical comedy written and directed by the very talented Seth MacFarlane.Ted, voiced by MacFarlane, is absurdly hilarious, with his crazy antics, insane innuendos and the occasional racial slur, it is hard not to laugh out loud. This is all created by the wonderful sound of Seth's voice. I really don't think it would have worked half as well if they have of got someone else. The rest of the cast bounce off him wonderfully. Mark Wahlberg as Ted's best friend for life, fits the bill perfectly and Mila Kunis is great as the girlfriend. For me though, Giovanni Ribisi, when he arrives on screen, plays creepy, camp and evil all too well. He is a joy to watch. (maybe joy is the wrong word here).This is an intelligent and very cleverly thought out comedy. Don't get me wrong, I know the image of a little teddy using the F word and smoking dope continuously, is going to be funny no matter what, yet doesn't sound like it would have to be too clever. The script is 10 out of 10 and this coupled with the perfect pace of the film means never a dull moment. My problem with most comedies is they can't keep the laughs going for the full running time. Here the jokes are very witty, insightful and out of the ordinary and stays that way for the full 106 minutes. The fact that this movie is about a teddy bear whom magically comes to life and then seamlessly blends into day to day life, for me, has failure written all over it. Yet, MacFarlane creates a world where all this doesn't matter and the viewer takes the magic for granted and goes along for the ride. And the ride is most certainly worth the trip.And lets not forget the animation. Ted never looks out of place. The special effects are seamless, even in high action fight scenes, they don't miss a beat.Ted is one hilarious movie. This, for me, is right up there with the best comedies of the past few years. Crude, intelligent and totally entertaining. http://www.filmnotion.com/ted-movie-review/",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Enjoyed a lot,"John Bennet (Mark Wahlberg) an antisocial 8 year old wishes on Christmas that his bear Ted could actually talk with him. A miracle happens and his wish comes true. At this point you might expect an E.T.esque movie like nobody else knows anything but little John and the bear. But it becomes a legend with Ted appearing in Late Night Show and being the talk of the nation. When John is an agent at a car rental company in his 30s, Ted as his sidekick (with the voice of Seth MacFarlane) grows up into a full functioning adult living in Boston, smoking pot, messing up with girls and cheering for Bruins, Patriots and probably Celtics. They all live in John's girlfriend Lori's (Mila Kunis) apartment in a posh downtown neighborhood. John is cool with his low- profile job and irresponsible lifestyle with his best buddy Ted but a problem is likely to occur when Lori wants him to be more serious with his life and proceed to a next level in their four year relationship.With all the absurdity it suggests, this is how the movie develops into something spectacular. Ted is not your ordinary comedy movie. We know Seth MacFarlane and what a great job he does in Family Guy. With spontaneous jokes, unexpected flashbacks, awkward moments and profanity at the right places, this movie is like Family Guy in live motion. Yet you don't get a hint of Peter Griffin or Brian although the voice is the same as Ted's.This shows how well the character development of Ted in this movie is thanks to MacFarlane as the writer and the director. Not only a humanoid with bad habits, Ted even has some political views given away by his racial comments about Jews, Mexicans and Muslims like a random dude somewhere in the US would do. You don't see Ted as a toy anymore, nor is the plot surreal. The film somewhat owes this to the computer graphics team. The animation is so good that it feels like there is an actual toy robot doing all the acting.Also the chemistry between John and Ted is a big contributing factor for this. Surprisingly he has a better chemistry with Ted than he has with Lori. Actually that is what is supposed to be in the movie. Wahlberg is more sincere with his partner in this movie than he has been in his previous ones including Fighter.One thing I don't like about the movie is the lack of consistency. The movie has touches of comedy, drama, action and thriller but all served separately. First hour is a near perfect silly- comedy, maybe the funniest of the year but then the drama kicks in and the pace of fun drops quite a bit. Finally the film turns to be a thriller at the end. The last part contributes to the absurdity and adds up to the movie but there could have been a better mingling between these parts.Having said that, MacFarlane does the thriller part brilliantly. It feels like good and evil from a typical Disney cartoon incarnated in the heroes and villains of this movie. In a sense the director is transplanting the movie to a cartoon in the viewer's perception and memory. In his debut motion picture, Seth MacFarlane shows a great skill and a big potential to spice up the genre.One last note With all the profanity, drug use and sexual content you probably don't want to see the movie with the kids! For more of these see the unrated version if you have any chance.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
This movie was so awful that I had to write a review.,"I lasted about 30 minutes until I hard to turn this garbage off, I love shows like Family Guy, Tim and Eric, Aqua Teen, Its Always Sunny.. this humor is for retarded people or something, AHHAHAHAHAH! LOOK A TALKING BEAR THAT SMOKES WEED AND BUYS HOOKERS HAHAHAH! SO FUNNY! no.. Mila Kunis is the worst actress I've ever seen in my life with her scratchy annoying voice and fakeness. I don't know if the movie got any better but I could not stand to watch any more.. I am so glad I downloaded it off icefilms and didn't spend a dime on it. What a piece of garbage, anyone that finds this garbage entertaining is either on a massive amount of a hallucinagenic drug or has had a lobotomy at one point of their life.. and maybe if you are under 10 years old you might have liked it also.

Everything Comedy This Summer Will Be 21 Jump Street's Little Brother,"Saw the movie last night at the Arclight in Hollywood. If you enjoy Family Guy, you'll more than likely enjoy the movie. If not, you definitely won't.From top to bottom, the humor and structure is similar to what you would expect from MacFarlane: lots of cultural references (that figure into the plot), plenty of crude toilet/violent humor (much tamer than Family Guy, though), cutaway gags, and a lot of heart. Even the music has that weird happy-go-lucky Family Guy twist to it.The characters are performances are what largely keep this movie grounded. Wahlberg does an OK job, but MacFarlane's voice acting and Kunis' performance anchor the film and make you care for the happy ending for these characters.Surprisingly, the movie has a lot of emotional moments. The problem is that unlike Family Guy's sharp wit, the humor is not nearly as sophisticated or fast, and a lot of zingers fall flat. Overall, it's a good, not great comedy with great dramatic elements, but given the strength of '21 Jump Street,' the writing and pacing of the jokes could have been a lot better.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Mostly a crowd pleaser I'd say if you know what you're getting in to.,"'TED': Four Stars (Out of Five)Seth MacFarlane (the creator of 'FAMILY GUY') makes his feature-length live-action directorial debut (with some computer animation)! The film stars Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis with MacFarlane voicing the computer animated title character. MacFarlane directed and co-wrote the screenplay along with two other 'FAMILY GUY' writers (Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild). The film is a fantasy comedy film about a teddy bear that comes to life to grant a child's wish and becomes a burden on his romantic relationship when he's a grown man. The movie is surprisingly well made for MacFarlane's first feature effort and more hit than miss with laughs. It's mostly a crowd pleaser I'd say if you know what you're getting in to.Wahlberg stars as John Bennett. As a child John was an outcast and had no friends so when his parents get him a stuffed teddy bear for Christmas he makes it his imaginary best friend. One day he wishes that the stuffed bear could talk back to him and a falling star grants him that wish. The two grow up together and the teddy bear, known as Ted (MacFarlane), helps John overcome his insecurities. Their friendship is finally put to the test though when John's girlfriend of four years, Lori (Kunis), wants John to stop spending so much time with Ted so they can further their relationship together.The movie is crude and vulgar but nothing more than one should expect from the creator of 'FAMILY GUY'. MacFarlane's direction is surprisingly impressive and the jokes for the most part work (which is more than I'd say for 'FAMILY GUY'). Wahlberg is good and likable in the lead and the movie actually has a lot more heart than you'd expect from it. It's actually a positive story of friendship that could have played out the same way even if one of the characters wasn't a magical stuffed bear. It's about how much love and time you give to those who are most important in your life. It's also of course extremely raunchy and hilarious at times but there's definitely heart to it and it's a good, well intentioned buddy film!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAxZQ69Tess",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Surprisingly Hilarious,"I went into Ted with mixed expectations. Most of the reviews I had read criticized the film for being formulaic while most of my friends praised the film for its originality. Given the obvious contradiction here, I really had no idea what I was about to see, and in hindsight, I'm really glad that was the case.Five minutes into the movie, I knew this was going to be funny. It's almost stylistically identical to Family Guy, and it translates really well to the big screen. If you're a fan of Seth Macfarlane's unique brand of humour, you will love this movie.As far as the cast is concerned, Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis are both fantastic. As Ted, Seth Macfarlane is just awesome, relentlessly delivering hilarious lines of dialogue in rapid succession. There are also a few cameos in this film which are genuinely hilarious, both for the obvious and subtle humor that they add to the film.My only real concern with the movie is that it loses focus at times in the middle. Most of the scenes are hilarious, but there are a handful that focus more on the drama of the story then they do on the comedy, which bogs down the laughter a little bit too much.All in all, this is a really funny movie. Yes, it does have a very formulaic plot and yes, it does lose focus at times, but with a brilliant cast and excellent writing, this movie will keep you laughing and entertained.RATING: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

It was the drugs that made him a real boy!,"While there are many funny moments, ""Ted"" tends to run into the same problems that one would expect out of an almost two hour episode of ""Family Guy""; a simplistic story with some extremely clever jokes and hilarious one liners mixed equally with niche 80's references and jokes that bomb miserably. With the assistance of many of the actors from Seth MacFarlane's own animated creations (Family Guy, American Dad) and Mark Wahlberg (Boogie Nights, The Fighter), the uber-talented MacFarlane writes/directs and does the voice of the talking teddy bear himself, in his first feature film ""Ted"".Using his own satirical take on New England culture, MacFarlane crafts the story of an inanimate teddy bear named Ted, who because of a wish from a child named John, becomes a vulgar talking teddy bear who smokes pot and loves the ladies. But years later as 35 year old John and Ted's juvenile relationship continues, John's girlfriend Lori wonders if there is any hope for her relationship with John to become serious as long as Ted is constantly hanging around. While this super simplistic buddy comedy storyline is accentuated by various comic detours (or bits) that are good for some out loud laughs, the demo audience (depending on how young they are) may not get a substantial amount of the heavy 1980's references, such as a constant (but well crafted) cameo from Flash Gordon himself, Sam Jones.Problems arise in the second half of this film when the comic momentum is all but lost, due to a combination of necessary story arch sentimentality, an overuse of 80's reference and a ""bad guy"" element that not even an immensely talented actor like Giovanni Ribisi (Boiler Room) could salvage. There is also the visually distracting fact that Walberg is so much older than Mila Kunis (who plays his long time girlfriend) but, I digress.Final Thought: I will say it again, MacFarlane is undoubtedly one of the most talented people on television (in the 30 minute format) and while ""Ted"" showcases why his fanbase is so large, his feature film directorial attempt isn't as strong as other animation geniuses turned filmmakers, such as Mike Judge (King of the Hill, Office Space). Go see ""Ted"" if you are a fan of Seth MacFarlane, otherwise seeing a movie like this, may turn out to be only an above average and far too hit and miss of a movie going experience.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Family Gu--er, Seth MacFarlane finally makes his big screen debut","If you are not a Family Guy fan then stop reading and leave immediately.If you are easily offended by crude, offensive, racial jokes stop reading and leave immediately.If you are going to attempt to figure out why there is a talking teddy bear and nobody seems to care then stop reading and leave immediately.Ted is basically a live-action spin of the Family Guy school of humor---full of obscure and blatant references, full of absurd and ridiculous humor, subtle satire and finally even a little bit of heart (Although only the first two seasons of Family Guy contained such a thing). Just like the show, the plot and premise is very simple—the draw is all that happens within the timeframe; that's what keeps you entertained. And Ted fits this billing too.Basically Ted is about a man whose inability to grow up stems from his continued relationship with a teddy bear turned to life during his childhood. All in all it's an adult fairy tale, with all the crass jokes, dialogue, and insanity that you usually get from your R-rated frat pack comedies. Except this time the humor gets flung at you in massive clusters at a rapid ADD pace that may prevent you from breathing at times—while at other times you are just begging for them to throw a new funny sequence.This movie feels so much like Family Guy and not just because it's from the same writer/director and contains the same types of jokes as the cult hit---a good portion of the staff can be seen/heard here. Mila Kunis, Patrick Warburton, Seth MacFarlane himself (voicing the bear with a Peter Griffin accent), and even the musical score comes from the same composer as the show (Walter Murphy).To sum this up nicely, if you enjoy (and can tolerate) the Family Guy brand and the times they do miss their jokes, then there's no reason why you couldn't enjoy this. While the third act really bogged down the entire picture with a boring subplot that actually bares minimal continuity to the first half, I can't deny it's a fun ride and a great debut from Seth MacFarlane.Let's be serious, any movie with a dozen Flash Gordon references has to be entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hysterical idea,"A simple plot of a kid who wishes his stuffed teddy bear could talk to him, and it comes true. From the creator of the animated comedy known as Family Guy comes a full length feature that lovers of MacFarlane's witty random jokes will most likely find fun, funny, and unexpected. Wahlberg has quite a decent funny side as he portrays the grown up version of Ted's wishful creator around 25 years later. It's a battle between a promise of his girlfriend's life versus his best friend's life, featuring some ultra whacky and hardcore moments to keep the comedy on it's feet. I never really even heard of Flash Gordon when I first saw this, but I can tell older fans will have quite an amazing throwback.

Disney meets Family Guy meets porno meets spooky...75%,"This comedy starts off like a Disney movie or something...a lonely boy wants a BFF and his teddy bear (""Ted"") fills the breach. It's not as stupid as it sounds, as the boy - John Bennett (played by Bretton Manley) - makes a wish...on Christmas...with a falling star in the vicinity. Writer/director/voice of Ted Seth McFarlane obviously knows his stuff, as this plausible scenario is better than just about anything...save John's teddy bear being hit by lightning or something. In any case, Ted is now alive and John's BFF. We then catch up on John many years later, as a 35 year old (played by Marky Mark Wahlberg) with a beautiful girlfriend - Lori Collins (played by Family Guy regular Mila Kunis) - and Ted...as a bad influence on him.""Ted"" works as a comedy film with a narrative arc which sustains it. That arc concerns whether John will live happily ever after with Lori, or whether Ted drives them apart.For some reason, Mark Wahlberg has a strong Boston accent...I'm not sure if that is acting or...everyone he plays has a Boston accent...because he does...or something. In any case, Mark and Mila have a nice chemistry in this movie and the presence of Ted in their world feels believable...I particularly like Ted's gait...as soon as I saw it, I though ""Yeah, that looks right"". Joel McHale as Rex - Lori's boss - does a nice turn as the office sleaze.As a movie, it's funnier than Seth McFarlane's lesser cartoon ""American dad"" and about as funny as an average episode of ""Family guy"" (so, there were many laugh out loud moments in this movie). Despite the Disney-esque aspects to this movie, it's really not suitable for children...really, really, really not suitable for children. There are simulated sex scenes between Ted and a checkout chick, bong smoking and some creepy people who become part of the story later on. In other words, it's the kind of territory explored in Family Guy...if you're familiar with that, you'll know the kind of humour to expect in this.

Funny but could have been better IMO,"This is my first review so please forgive me if it gets a bit ""all over the place"" I liked this movie. But IMO, it could have been better.A movie about a crass, pot smoking, dirty minded teddy bear was always going to be funny. And it delivers in that aspect.There were some brilliant one liners and some fantastic dialogues.I laughed out loud A LOT (but I also LOL a lot at the Avengers too) BUT...it was only funny because of the filthiness and crassness of Ted and the people around him.Unfortunately, I found the story a bit blah. IMO, it seemed like it was planned as ""a bunch of things a teddy bear could say that no one would expect"" and at the last minute they though ""shit, better put a storyline in"". And then they just created a basic, done before plot which didn't fit together all that well really.I loved the interaction between Mila and Mark. I thought they mde a fab couple.If you want to see a movie that everyone will laugh at (providing they aren't easily offended) and enjoy then Ted definitely fits the bill. If you want something with a decent story to go alongside the comedy then you will be disappointed. Not for young kids, my 12 year old daughter wanted to see it and after I saw it, she is not allowed to watch it, some very rude bits (funny for me, too rude for 12 year old eyes) Overall, I did enjoy it and I laughed at it a lot and I would recommend seeing it.

"Sex, Drugs, & Fenway Park: a Recipe for Friendship","I did not want to watch Ted when it came out because of the commercials that were harassing us every 10 minutes with the trailer. I felt like the whole movie was shown in it. Plus, the prepubescent humor did not make me smile. Peer pressure finally overcame me and I played it with a Bud in my hand (you might as well lean into it). I finally changed my mind about the movie: it is hilarious! For starters, the whole movie isn't in the trailer. Ted is kind of a UFO gathering different genres: scary scenes with a borderline psychopath? Check. The mandatory love story? Check. Action-packed scenes, sex, or comedy scenes? Check. It is a nice blend of everything that the screenwriters could think of and of what could appeal to the largest audience. It's an entertaining movie for sure with adult-only humor. In my opinion, the best part was all those references to Boston and its people because I used to live there. I don't know how much it speaks to others but the locations and the accents were delightful. Mark Wahlberg is obviously a good pick for the lead part since he is from Boston... I mean Bahstun. Seth MacFarlane proved he could direct one of the best American comedies in the recent years before showing us he could also be a great Oscar host. Is this guy ever gonna stop? I certainly hope not. I want more Boston stories! If you thought your kids might enjoy it because it features a teddy bear, please reconsider. This X-rated bear smokes pot, gets drunk, has sex with prostitutes or co-workers in places you don't want your food to be.

Hilarious,"This movie definitely isn't for everyone. Same type of comedy as Family Guy and American Dad obviously with Seth MacFarlane, which is right up my alley.It's got plenty of the ""offensive"" stuff which to me is hilarious but the cut-away reference comedy many might not get like the Airplane reference.It was completely original though. All of us as kids had toys or imaginary friends we wish were always around or could do more and this did that but immediately going to what happens when you grow up was genius. I think the cast was very good for the movie as well. It's mindless fun so if you're looking for some we'll thought our, plot driven, going for awards type movie, then this isn't one to watch.Great movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Worst move ever,"This is my first review on IMDb and what made me write is that so far I could rely on users rating to help me choose which movie to watch. Until now.I truly can't believe that this movie has 7.7 rating. It is complete garbage, it's dumb, it's not funny. What it is: it's lame, vulgar, not-original, time wasting piece of s***.Not a single line is funny and it looks like it was inspired by the worst parts of Eddie Murphy's disastrous comedies from a new millennium.I would not talk much about the movie because there's nothing to say. Just avoid it and save your brain cells.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Disappointing,"You'd think that a fan of Family Guy and American Dad! would find this right up their alley. You'd think that someone who admires Seth and thinks he is utterly talented would enjoy his movie. The answer is NO! In fact, the only reason this is not getting below a 4 rating is due to these two factors - i.e. 2 extra points the movie really didn't deserve. The jokes are classic Seth and Family Guy. But what works in 22 minutes and in a cartoon manner of cutaways and scenes with no consequences doesn't work for 90 minutes in a movie. To try and make all of this work they had to make main characters stoners. The female lead puts up with this garbage for four years. And the wicked Giovanni Ribisi doesn't nearly get enough airtime to salvage this mess. The end simply. Just. Dragged. Yeah. Stick with short bursts of comedy Seth.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A blend of 80s nostalgia and modern stoner movie, it's heart keeps it from becoming as irritating as Family Guy is now.","I didn't have much expectations for this film, especially after seeing the trailer (not the R rated one) but I hoped not to be bored and it succeeded for the most part. I like Seth MacFarlane in moderation, I've pretty much seen all the Family Guy worth watching to death and I like American Dad. I'm pretty sure he's a guy who's said all he wants and needs to say but he still makes stuff because it makes money. Whatever, it's fine. Ted is a long Family Guy special and follows all his own storytelling traditions and tropes.It's a half 80s nostalgia movie and half modern party/stoner movie which is an interesting blend, though it means some of the references go right over this audience's head. It's typically vulgar and soaked in pop culture and most of it is enjoyable, though there was a ""tribute"" to Airplane! which was just a remake of the scene rather than anything new. It also has cutaways, fantasy scenes and a little slapstick of which I'm glad was minimal, saving it for one big fight scene. It taps into ideas, albeit not particularly profound ones, very effectively. The prologue scene was the highlight and then I slowly got back into it throughout the movie.I'm always fond of Mark Wahlberg but the glaring age difference between him and Mila Kunis was pretty distracting though only because they had supposedly been together for 4 years already so she must've been like 18 while he was 30. I don't know. I liked McHale and Ribisi (though he came late to the party besides a few appearances). The rest of the cast were shoehorned in during their introductions and pretty much proved inconsequential. The whole film was pretty much a series of predictable sequences which could've been a lot better if they had been piled on top of each other rather than one after the other but the climax was on the right note.While this is not a creative decision, it's become clear that digital cinematography is something that's here to stay in Hollywood. Unfortunately I just don't think people have figured out how to use it properly yet. Some shots are great but others are not cinematic and the production of the film becomes clear as day. It's not as bad as something like Public Enemies but it's incredibly distracting and dramatically decreases a film's production value and magic. Maybe it's a post process or its a lighting issue but it just doesn't look good enough for cinema yet. The Social Network did it right but maybe it's because they used Red Epics.Anyway, yeah, standard affair. Easy to sell thing. Couple handfuls of laughs. Pretty forgettable. No big complaints. Certainly worthy of a 5 paragraph review. I liked it.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It won't waste your time,"To me Ted is one of the best examples of a typical Hollywood comedy. I think most people got to see it because it's Seth McFarlane who made it. So it's not weird to expect something as funny as Family Guy. Well, i just couldn't laugh my pants off. I DID enjoy the movie but that's just because it's somehow entertaining. Same as The Hangover, Paul and Due Date, I think this movie is just, okay. Just as lame and predictable as most of this kind, but yet, it's enjoyable. And actually there wasn't any moment where I expected it to be more than just enjoyable. Definitely not as funny as Family Guy (most of the time) is, but way less awful than the unnecessary spin-off ""The Cleveland Show"". If you're chilling with some friends, drinking a cold beer of whatever, go watch it. You'll probably laugh a couple of times. But you're wasting your time if you're expecting a strong and original comedy.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
TED brings all the Family Guy type of humor to the big screen....,"Most people know or have heard what to expect from this movie before buying the ticket. SO, if your'e not a Family Guy fan or don't appreciate comedic genius of Seth MacFarlane, then this movie is not for you.I personally found it very funny and very entertaining. Definitely a movie to see more than once, and one of those to add to you personal collection. Can't wait for MacFarlane's next project whether it be on the big screen or whatnot.And since this Amazon website requires that I write a minimum of 10 lines, I'll finish by taking up the last two or three lines and write absolutely nothing but just words to take up extra space, or I could conclude by saying, GO SEE TED, you will get your money's worth.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"FUN Flick, Mark Wahlberg is amazing in it","Ted – CATCH IT (B+) Wishes coming true in Hollywood movie are not a new concept; we have seen plenty of movies where wishes come true and do something magical into the wisher's life. What brought change in these movies is defiantly is the r-rated comedic genre. Since the blockbuster success of The Hangover and previously Judd Apatow's factory movies Knocked-Up and 40 years old virgin have given Hollywood a hope that a person can make millions over r-rated movies these days. Ted is also one of those wishes coming true movie but with its R-rating and a teddy talking nasty made is hilarious and entertaining. I would not say that it's the finest R-rated comedy but it sure is entertaining. Mark Wahlberg is great in Ted, many people think that Ted steals the show but if you watch carefully you will realize that Mark Wahlberg went out of his comfort zone and at times totally outshine Ted (Seth MacFarlane). Mila Kunis is gorgeous; I think that's why she was in it. The supporting cast is good Jessica Stroup was wasted; poor girl needs to leave 90210 and start auditioning for movies. In the end, it may seem like a one man or teddy show but it's not. It defiantly a fun flick with a funny idea.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
As funny as a funeral...,"Not sure what funny farm some of the reviewers come from but to say the movie is a laugh a minute is really stretching the imagination! One minute of laughs during the whole movie would also not be an accurate summary. Yes I may have smiled a couple times when the bear delivers some rude and crude lines but I think that was more the fact that it was a bear saying it. Mark Wahlberg was OK but I personally think he should stick to action movies and do what he does best. The novelty of the walking, talking bear wore off after 5 minutes. I am so glad I didn't pay money to watch this movie cos I would have been undergoing treatment for severe depression otherwise. If you really must see this movie, I suggest watching a trailer on youtube or somewhere online and that will no doubt show all the 'best' parts of the movie and save you having to sit through the whole thing.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A true LMFAO!,"If you haven't laughed recently is just because you haven't seen TED yet! I saw it today. According to the trailers I was expecting to see one of the freshest movies of 2012, but instead truly laughed my a** off! Cannot remember the last time I laughed so much... on ""Biodome"" (1996) maybe.I used to die laughing at every TED trailer, which is very uncommon. But the movie has to offer much more. Very predictable overall story line with happy ending, but indeed the true power of TED lies in the way the story is developed, especially the dialogues. There is a very powerful situation comedy (sit-com) screenplay experience hidden behind the movie, in the best meaning of a sit-com. I mean the people behind the movie really put their best.Speaking of the overall qualities, nice soundtrack, great computer animations of the Ted character and great play of Mark Wahlberg. Must say Mila Kunis appearance was great too. Not really a strong play, but a really sexy Angelina Jolie-esh appeal. Dialogues? Kick a**!This is my first review where I will not reveal any spoilers and will keep it very short, because I really would recommend you to go and see the movie.A 2012 must see!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Farts and Poop = Yuk Yuk,"It seems utterly useless to complain about the current modern infatuation with flatulence and poop. Last week there was an entire BoB's Burgers (Animated Fox TV) episode about ""The Mad Pooper"".MacFarlane's The Family Guy (Animated Fox TV) has been a mainstay on Sunday night for over a decade and frequently uses such toilet stuff ad nauseam. So there must be a market for this boring and repetitious yuk. But one just has to ask. How many times can hearing a fart or seeing a pile of poop get a laugh?So it is there not for a laugh, but for shock. A cringe. A way to embarrass those who think this kind of stuff is disgusting. To separate you from them (like a kid's club). Anyway back to Ted. If every fart and poop joke and scene were removed from this movie; would it still be as funny? Absolutely. What, if anything, did the scene with the hooker taking a dump in the living room accomplish? Absolutely nothing.It is a kind of charming, clever, interesting, infantile comedy, or maybe sophomoric would be more appropriate. There is enough here to entertain and as always the creator's sharp Pop Culture wit is amazing. The movie is so good when it's good but when it's bad it stinks.But here it is. Obsessed with the anus. So it is infantile. For that it is quite a disappointment, not just here but in a all of its modern marketing. So if you are up for it, hold your nose and take a chance.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ted,"An alright film
It's nothing new but it does take the whole ""living toy"" thing to another stage with its adult humour and style. The movie keeps you hooked and makes you laugh every now and then, it's more of a movie to watch with one eye and do something else's with the other. You can really get intrigued by this movie, nor can you think about the meaning behind it. The acting is rather good and you do grow a soft spot to ted.

Review,"The story tells the story of a teddy bear. Technically, from the very beginning of the movie, I started to wonder a question: how to be credible?
A teddy bear is full of character and can talk. So how did the story begin?
Fortunately, the story started well. On Christmas Eve, the child got a bear, and the bear could talk. After experiencing the media's buzz, such a bear began to become sparse and ordinary, the days were as sparse, and the taste became even heavier.
Fortunately, I didn't see a story about Toy Story 3.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A really fun and good movie!,"This is Seth McFarlane, the creator of Family Guy and American Dad's first full lenght movie. After years of watching Family Guy and American Dad i couldn't help but check out the trailer for this movie. And what i saw was really satisfying! I bought my cinema ticket and went straight to the cinema to watch this thing. And it turned out great! It is one of the funniest movies i've seen this year, and for Seth's first full lenght film, it was really great and the jokes were not forced at all! I simply loved it and didn't regret the money spent on this. In fact, i think i might even go see it again. While this movie has a great plot, it is also a good dramatic film too. BUT, the humor used in this movie will often only apply to those who like the satiric Family Guy TV-show, and those who does not like vulgar and satiric humor should stay away from this one. As i am a big fan of Seth McFarlanes work i loved this movie! I give it a 8 out of a 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A Hilarious and Unbearably Funny Comedy,"Plot: In ""Ted,"" John Bennett, a grown man, finds himself still inseparable from his childhood teddy bear, Ted, who magically came to life after a childhood wish. As John and Ted navigate the challenges of adulthood, their enduring friendship is put to the test when Ted's raucous behavior and unconventional lifestyle collide with John's attempts to mature and maintain a serious relationship. With uproarious antics, zany escapades, and a touch of heartfelt nostalgia, the film takes audiences on a riotous journey through the absurdities of friendship, love, and growing up.Review: ""Ted"" is a raunchy, laugh-out-loud comedy that fearlessly embraces the absurdity of its premise. Mark Wahlberg and Seth MacFarlane, who voices the irreverent Ted, exude comedic chemistry, delivering a series of uproarious and outlandish misadventures. The film's unapologetically crude humor and pop culture references create a rollicking and irreverent experience that is sure to leave audiences in stitches.While ""Ted"" revels in its outrageousness, it also manages to infuse moments of genuine warmth and relatable humor, offering a surprisingly endearing reflection on the enduring nature of friendship and the challenges of adulthood. The film's perfect blend of slapstick, wit, and heartfelt moments makes it a standout in the realm of adult-oriented comedies.""Ted"" is a wild and unapologetically funny ride that never takes itself too seriously, capturing the essence of lighthearted, escapist humor at its best.

It was okay.,"Ted is a movie about a teddy bear named Ted who enjoys drinking beer, doing drugs, and having sex. Although this concept may seem strange, the movie is well-executed by Seth MacFarlane, who voices Ted. Ted and John, who have been friends since childhood, experience difficulties when the bear's crude behavior starts to interfere with John's relationship with Lori. While the plot is not particularly complex, the movie's appeal lies in its charming characters and humorous elements, which, while at times vulgar, are undeniably funny. The movie has a number of memorable scenes, but towards the end, the pace slows down, partly because the novelty of a talking bear has worn off, and partly because the subplot involving kidnapping takes away from the comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A mixed bag,"To me, Ted wasn't as good as it could have been, and, given Seth MacFarlane's irreverent sense of humor, was nowhere near as funny as it should have been. I really like Family Guy and, for the most part, American Dad. I agree with his basic premise that there's humor in just about anything. I also have no problem with shock or gross-out humor, as long as it's intrinsically funny.The trouble with Ted is that it relies too much on strictly shock and gross-out alone. Too much of it has nothing funny about it. A cute, fuzzy teddy bear with a foul mouth is only funny for a short time, if there's nothing humorous about what he's saying. That's the case too often here.A few of the cameos were funny, some were okay, the rest were stupid. The Flash Gordon thing was carried to a boring extreme, especially the party.Wahlberg was miscast. His brother Donnie is ten times the better actor. Kunis sparkled in a few places, but was mostly flat (no pun intended). I usually like her a lot. I didn't see much chemistry between her and Wahlberg.I gave this 6 stars, because I enjoyed it - up to a point - but I do want to underline its flaws. It's a long way from perfect. I tend to attribute it, at least in part, to the co-writers, who may have been aping Macfarlane's style, but couldn't match his humor.It's worth watching. The teddy bear animation is excellent!",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I will make sure that me and some of the other managers enforce the policy so people can enjoy the movie in peace. When it comes out June 29 or you have the chance to see it before. GO!

Thunder Buddies,"I will say I have not seen the show Family Guy that is still running and releasing new episodes to this day, but I do know who Seth MacFarlane is and have seen some of his work before, so a movie from him about a talking teddy bear he voices that also stars Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis; after watching, I had a very good time watching this raunchy comedy. The Seth MacFarlane comedy Ted (2012) is a very funny movie with the character Ted looking real with incredibly beneficial effects and Mark Wahlberg working very well interacting with him; the movie is very funny with quite a few raunchy moments and jokes that you expect from Seth McFarlane that are out there and controversial, but unless that bothers you, you can enjoy this movie fine.Mark Wahlberg gives an impressive performance as John Bennett who wishes is teddy bear to life, but since he is older and has a girlfriend, he must choose between Ted and his girlfriend on who he loves more; he was the straight man in the movie in a way but was also funny in the movie, especially when he is interacting with Ted. Seth MacFarlane voicing Ted was great throughout the whole movie, he was funny with him looking real when he is walking around with John, but what I liked the most was the friendship John and Ted had with each other and how they are just trying to help each other with certain issues that take place. Lastly, I will add here that John Bennett's girlfriend Lori Collins, played very well by Mila Kunis, was also a funny character in many scenes with some good moments of her and John Bennett when they are together talking about their relationship.The movie is funny with jokes that can be controversial but there are also jokes that are funny because of how random they can be, though the comedy is good, what drives the movie is how Ted is shown interacting with people and how he looks with the effects; Ted is created with it having well-done CG effects but also moments where it looks like a real teddy bear is in the scene, also it is funny seeing him walking around and interacting with Mark Wahlberg. There is an antagonist in the movie that is obsessed with Ted because of how famous he was in the 80's when he was brought to life, though he was weird and had an occasional funny moment, he was not needed with the third act climax that was good but could have gone differently.I had a fun time watching Ted (2012), it was funny with exceptionally good performances and well-done CG effects to bring the character Ted to life in this movie; though the jokes might be too out there for a lot of people to enjoy, you can look past them and enjoy the movie, unless you are unable to do that. The movie had some good heartfelt moments mixed in with the good comedy and it worked well, and I liked how the movie was put together where you can tell that it is inspired by Family Guy without having watched the show; this movie is worth watching if you like Family Guy, Seth McFarlane, or raunchy comedies like this.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Strong language can make or break a really good sarcasm, but in this movie everything breaks. Everything. The first fifteen minutes I smiled all the way.

A great comedy that pushes itself,Ted was a pretty great comedy. It's one of those films I've always wanted to see as seeing Seth MacFarlane voice a talking teddy really looked great. When Johnny is young in the 80s he receives a very special friend. Later he makes a wish. A special wish that somehow turns his teddy bear into a real boy. They become inseparable to the point of smoking weed together. Wahlburg is Johnny and plAys mark wahlburg but a good version and he does comes off as almost wholesome. Lori his girlfriend is Mika Kunis and she also brings some good comedy elements. The film is full of jokes. Some that are below the belt.

Review of Ted,"I admit, I went into this movie with very high expectations because I love Seth MacFarlane and his ability to bring non-humans a human-like quality has proved to be comedic genius in the past. However, this movie fell short of what I had hoped it would be.The character of Ted, and the story of how he came to be living and accepted in the normal world was intricate and enticing, but it's Mark Wahlberg that really brought the movie back a few notches. With most raunchy comedies (Pineapple Express, Hangover, Superbad), even if the main character is a total screw up, he is lovable to where you are rooting for him to succeed eventually. This movie made me resent Wahlberg's character to the point where I believed he deserved all the trouble he'd gotten into and hoped he never got out. His delivery of most lines were cheesy aside from the quick draw of female names from the trailer.In fact, if it weren't for Mila Kunis as the saving grace, I would probably want my money back. Granted, Ted has some laugh out loud moments and adds some shock value as only MacFarlane can possess, but the overall picture lacked the staying power of what a true comedy movie should embody.I might watch this again down the road, but it is not near the first movie I would grab when I need a laugh on a random afternoon.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the worst comedies I have ever seen.,"After seeing the good user reviews for Ted my expectations were actually raised a little. The trailers didn't seem too funny to me, but I'm a big fan of Family Guy and Seth MacFarlane and thought that it would be at least as funny as the average FG episode.Well after seeing the movie I have to say that Seth MacFarlane, Mila Kunis, and Mark Whalberg have all sunk to new all-time lows. I can't believe a movie like this would get backed by a studio. The jokes are even more low brow than South Park (a show I can't stand) and the plot relies on fart jokes, constant weed smoking, and cliché characters that try way too hard to get a laugh and overact in almost every scene.I can't imagine that anyone would find this funny, other than maybe somebody so high or so drunk that they find poop on the floor and farting hilarious.The theater was pretty full for an afternoon show and other than the seriously stoned dudes behind me, there were very few people in the theater that laughed at most of the jokes. I had a few chuckles and a half laugh, but no lol moments.I honestly started feeling bad for the actors and began wondering if they actually read the script before they agreed to do this movie, or if they just trusted that anything by Seth MacFarlane had to be funny.I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It really is bad beyond belief, but if you don't believe me, then check it out and be prepared to see somewhat respectable actors sink to the lowest of lows.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Brings us back to laughing at something just because,"After nearly claiming ownership of the ""Animation Domination"" lineup Sunday nights on Fox, Seth MacFarlane makes the leap to the theatrical stage with Ted, which has the marketing concept and appearance of Winnie the Pooh with all the innocence squeezed out of him. The character, Ted, is unabashedly crude, and every time he speaks, you feel the need to take a bath. He utters some of the most foul and disgusting lines any film character has said this year.And yet, I laughed. Again, I'm not proud of what I laughed at, but I did. Ted is the funniest raunchy comedy we've been given this year, and MacFarlane proves he can extend his wit for an upwards of one-hundred minutes. He's created three animated programs and while Ted sometimes feels like it might drum up a forth one, but I don't believe that's the goal here. It appears that this was an idea MacFarlane had floating around in his head for a while, couldn't find a way to make it work on any of his three shows, needed the theatrical freedom and liberation to do and say whatever he wanted to, and thus, penned a screenplay with two others, and created a comedic exercise similar to one by Judd Apatow, but with the additional element of pleasant fantasy.MacFarlane has been put down by remarks that he is too heavily reliant on pop culture references and presents us with characters we can never take seriously. I don't believe he has ever been credited for being strangely sentimental in his programs, and has the skill to create a setup, a climax, a solution, and even unrelated cutaway gags his shows are known for, in the matter of twenty-two minutes weekly. His talent deserves recognition, and I believe Ted is nothing but faithful to his name.In 1985, in Boston, eight-year-old John Bennett was a lonely kid who wished for a close friend to have and trust. When his parents bought him a stuffed teddy bear for Christmas, he wished that the bear would come alive, and miraculously, it did. The bear, named Ted by John, went on to be a celebrity, yet never forgot his first and best pal. The narrator then tells us that just like Corey Feldman, Frankie Muniz, and Justin Bieber, eventually, nobody gave a s***.Twenty-seven years later, John (played by Mark Wahlberg) and Ted (voiced by MacFarlane) spend their days in an apartment, watching movies and cartoons, particularly Flash Gordon, smoking a bong and eating junk food. John is a used car salesman, who has been dating the beautiful Lori (Mila Kunis) for four years, yet is reluctant to propose. She likes Ted, but feels John has been too clingy with childish things that need to go. John is indecisive about choosing the love of his life or his friend he promised he'd be with for life. The setup isn't too far from one possibly existing between long-dating couples with a human who has become too intrusive.Despite given free range as well, MacFarlane doesn't immediately jump on the ""TnA"" bandwagon, or even the gross-out gags wagon either. Frankly, the only wagon he jumps on is the appropriate one; unrestricted verbal wit. He reconnects us with familiar faces and voices, with Mila Kunis (""Meg"" on Family Guy) in the supporting role, his ""Peter Griffin"" voice as Ted's (it doesn't come off as distracting as Seth Rogen's in Paul), and even the voice of the handicap character, ""Joe,"" from Family Guy, Patrick Warburton, is given a minor role in the picture. It keenly reminds me of how Trey Parker and Matt Stone utilize their recognizable voices in their films that are distant from their South Park comfort-zone. Between the verbal wit and the pleasant familiarities, MacFarlane still gives himself enough leeway to function within his newly found theatrical boundaries, without resorting to childish gag jokes.But let's not forget Wahlberg and Kunis in the central roles. If there's one actor who has efficiently restored himself from goofy kid to a capable character, it's Wahlberg. He, along with many other actors this year, such as Channing Tatum in 21 Jump Street, have touched on the comedy genre and have proved worthy of recognition. Wahlberg and the foul-mouthed bear have a kind bromance in the picture that manages to carry itself through the entire film, never running out of steam or resorting to tireless old fluff (no pun intended). Kunis, per usual, is exuberant in her role, providing character where there is usually caricature, and proves her determination and stunning appearance take her further than many other actresses that are on the same, or even a higher, level.After seeing the film, I contemplated my thoughts on if many of the references, jokes, or one-liners would be as funny if they came from a human character, and the answer is probably not. They probably would've triggered laughs, but not the riotous ones this picture gets. It is next to impossible to rewrite Ted with a human character in the bear's place, and second, the film resorts back to that old formula of laughing at something just because. Seeing a human swear, drink, smoke, and act crass in public is typical, but seeing a bear do it all is touchingly hilarious, when done properly. Especially when it is done with a wide range and an enormous heart. I believe it's safe to say Ted is the first big comedy hit of the year.Starring: Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis, Seth MacFarlane, Joel McHale, Giovanni Ribisi, Jessica Stroup, and Patrick Warburton.

"silly, ridiculous, sometimes funny","The multi talented Seth MacFarlane has created a silly, ridiculous and sometimes funny comedy about a boy whose teddy bear magically comes to life, talking and acting like a human being (courtesy of MacFarlane's own voice-over) and remains his best friend through the years. MacFarlane's script deftly explains that, yes, a teddy bear come to life would become a media sensation, but like all media sensations quickly enough wears out his welcome with the public and reaches the point where nobody cares any more (like, we are told, the cast of the TV sitcom ""Diff'rent Strokes""). A premise which in other hands might have been turned into cute whimsy, becomes in MacFarlane's hands a gag-ridden hybrid of buddy movie and romantic comedy, half adolescent toilet humor, one quarter post-baby-boom pop cultural references and the remainder divided between wacky Preston Sturges-like eruptions of comic chaos and clever, jabbing satire on human foibles from the point of view of the jaded white middle-class. Some of the dialogue soars.The male lead is played by Mark Wahlberg, who in recent years has chosen to pump his pecs and biceps to the point where he jiggles when he runs down a flight of stairs. His girlfriend is the sultry beauty Mila Kunis who can really act. Many laughs are generated by a strong supporting cast including Joel McHale as Kunis's arrogant boss and especially Giovanni Ribisi in a highly inventive characterization as a creepy father who, with his overweight pre-teen son, are obsessed with the title character.MacFarlane's TV show, ""Family Guy,"" has always been good for a few laughs and this movie continues the tradition on the big screen.",,Anonymous,Comedy
goes over board with jokes... which is good,"This seems like one long family guy episode. well it is.I loved this film. I wasn't expecting a complex story with many plot twists or intense action scenes. all I wanted was a good laugh. the movie starts strong with a good ol' Jew joke. then the first swear comes in.the construction of this film is pretty simple; dick joke, fart joke, racist joke, sex joke, dick joke, fart joke, racist joke, sex joke etc. towards the end it actually becomes sad. bad stuff happens to the main characters and the jokes stop coming. that was actually a good decision from Seth. even though the only reason I paid to watch the film was for jokes, the sad moment evened the movie out. so now the movie wasn't just something that was created to let the writers show they are funny. it also showed they had hearts.good movie, good movie",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A mildly humorous turd!,"I couldn't get myself to like Ted. I just didn't find the affable fuzzball endearing. The thick East Coast accent with dirty language and antics could only do so much until it grew thin for me. Too bad the movie had to end in hopeless predictability, because I thought the movie would have engendered more meaning with his passing. The couple could have started their new lives without having to be obstructed by this man's childhood protégé.Buddy films can be fun, but all this relationship offers is crass fun, partying and raunchy escapades. The cameo of Sam J. Jones (Flash Gordon) was novel and helped carry this threadbare plot along, but you know a movie is in trouble when they have to rely on trashing other actors.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A movie for a specific demographic,"Seth MacFarlane is a multi-talented guy and this is totally his movie: it is his story, he co-wrote the script, he co-produced, he debut-directed and he voices the titular bear. The two main human characters - Ted's childhood friend John and John's live-in girlfriend Lori - are played engagingly by Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis, but it always comes back to the furry one.MacFarlane turns upside down and inside out the conventional notions of the teddy bear with the most foul-mouthed dialogue you can imagine. It is crude, rude, racist, irreverent and often very funny and there is a fight sequence that it the most hilarious since the one in ""Borat"". But this is a film for a specific demographic: the younger you are, the more you're likely to love it; the older you are, the more you're likely to find it juvenile.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"sweet, occasionally funny","Ted is a movie that defies a couple of expectations. First off, it's a movie about a magical thing in which that magical thing is made ordinary. Normally, if a character starts talking to a ghost, or his computer develops sentience, or he adopts an alien, the movie focuses a lot on how difficult this is to hide. But in this movie, the magical Ted is just a fact of life that everyone accepts.The other surprise is that even though the movie is from the guy who does Family Guy, it's not just a crazed series of sick jokes. Instead, it's a genuinely sweet, though often outrageous, movie about a man's reluctance to grow up, with his attachment to childhood portrayed in an ingeniously literal way.But while Wahlberg and Kunis have terrific chemistry and the movie has some really funny scenes (notably a double date gone wrong), I never really got into it. The humor is mild, and once you understand that it will veer into sudden perverse jokes now and again, just a tiny bit predictable.I appreciate that the film's creator wanted to do something more than twisted Family Guy-style comedy, but I don't feel he nailed it. Without the sort of I-can't-believe-I-just-heard-that comedy of his series, this is just a cute take-off on a kid's movie that never quite catches fire.But it's so likable that I feel guilty for not liking it more.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Rare Comedy That Doesn't Give It All Away in the Trailer.,"Liked much of the movie very much - not every plot point is revealed in the trailer, for one thing. For another, while it was raunchy and foul-mouthed, it wasn't disgusting (well, except in one part), so it didn't annoy me quite as much as Bridesmaids did last year. It makes many insightful comments on mid-'80s culture (or lack thereof) and on celebrities. It does fall apart a little about 2/3rds of the way through when it generally stopped being so funny and started taking itself a little too seriously. While I don't care for Seth McFarlane's TV work, I enjoyed most of Ted, and think he, like Ben Affleck, has a great ear for the South Boston style of speech and attitude.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Not The Perfect Comedy, But Pretty Damn Funny","Ted has been on my list of comedies to watch since I started hearing about it. The idea is great and I do enjoy Seth MacFarlane's style of comedy. Sure enough, that is what Ted is. I've heard it be called a long episode of Family Guy, and while that isn't accurate, it does say a lot about the kind of humor Ted evokes. And I had a pretty good time with it.MacFarlane voices the titular character, best friend to Walberg's Jon. When Jon makes a wish as a kid for his teddy bear to come to life it does, becomes a sensation, and becomes Jon's best friend. If you were wondering how, exactly, the whole teddy bear come to life thing works in the real world sense, it does, and the history of Jon and Ted is told early in the film in a pretty damn funny narration. I will say that, while Ted may be a very interesting idea, and the whole notion of a raunchy teddy bear acting like a man-child is pretty funny in and of itself, Ted could easily have been replaced by a normal person, and the film would be as funny. It's Seth's writing and humor that shine here.MacFarlane has always done good voice work on Family Guy and American Dad, and it translates here pretty well. Ted is obviously the voice of Peter Griffin, and you can't shake that feeling, but Ted also comes into his own as a character. The idea of a raunchy, foul mouthed, man-child teddy bear faded on me pretty quick, which goes to show how well the film was done. Ted's interaction with people never feels weird or out of place. It comes naturally and everyone does a great job of interacting with him. Props to Mila Kunis and especially Mark Walberg, who once again proves that he can do great at comedy. This is a role uncommon for Mark, and where he was a funny guy in The Other Guys, he's even funnier here.MacFarlane proves fairly adept at taking to the camera for the first time and directing his actors. Nothing here is spectacular, I'd even say the film is fairly predictable, but the comedy is gold here. It doesn't hit with a continuous rhythm, but when it hits, it's laugh out loud funny. But, like I said, it's a lot of the usual MacFarlane humor, pulling out some odd pop-culture references here and there, making lingering jokes, and even some very odd, wtf moments. I did, a few times, raise my hands in a wtf gesture. Luckily, the film also has heart. Ted is a little bit too obvious as an object for Jon, who has trouble putting away childish things, but Ted and Jon's relationship shines as honest and natural. Even if Ted is a teddy bear, you still accept what he and Jon have.Ted certainly isn't a perfect comedy. A number of jokes fall flat if you don't get the pop references or are into some of the ongoing bits, like those involving Flash Gordon (although, I did find all the Flash Gordon stuff pretty amusing). The script also has a few issues being a bit cliché and staying too long on certain jokes. Much like Family Guy, some stuff here just isn't that funny or stays on too long. But, the majority of the film is funny. I certainly laughed out loud quite a bit. So, if you enjoy the MacFarlane brand of humor and find yourself at a loss for comedies this summer, Ted should entertain you quite a bit.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Pathetic attempt at humor!,"Simple: I would just like folks to tell me exactly what was funny about this film? Where were the funny bits? To me it was just complete and utter tripe. So unoriginal, desperate and full of the same old profanity and vulgarity. There wasn't a single subtle or creative piece of comedy in it. Many gag/jokes were current affairs, politics etc that were just dead. Useless. And the voice of Ted was crap. Just could not endear to it at all. Many of the scenes were just weird. Not funny at all. The scene in the supermarket where he's acting all vulgar to the cashier? Mad. The fight scene with Ted and John? Pointless and OTT crap.

A movie that inflicts more damage to our broken society.,"In reality, this movie is terribly unfunny and plain stupid. The envelope has been pushed - all the way down the sewer. There is nothing smart, intelligent or witty about this movie. From what I can tell, this movie stoops down to the intelligence level of a 5 year old to come up with this absolute trash that people are amused by.The story line has heaps of potential, the actors are great. But this movie is littered with weak, desperate attempts at humor. The casual swearing is uncalled for. The 'R' rating? I guess it's so insulting to what it means to be mature, it should be rated 'G' since I hear a lot of 12 year olds with the same sense of humor.Overall the movie is an utter disaster, evident by the fact that everyone seems to love it. I learnt that people are amused by hookers, dirty sexual gestures, drugs and human excrement along with mind numbing casual swearing. Wake up people. If you have even the slightest hint of maturity and intelligence, then this movie is not for you.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Seth MacFarlane goes Hollywood,"There isn't much to say except if you love Family Guy or you're a fan of or remember the 80's, you will thoroughly enjoy this. It has all of what makes Family Guy so popular: crude and childish humour with pop-culture references and unbelievable situations. Even if you don't completely understand the 80′s references, you won't feel lost with this film (Flash Gordon, Pink Floyd's ""Another Brick in the Wall"" OK, that was 1979. Sue me! and others).It's a fairly simple layout: lonely boy wishes for a friend and finds it in a foul-mouthed teddy bear voiced by Seth MacFarlane (who is also the writer/director). They become friends for life complete with pot smoking, swearing and bro-ing out. There's a myriad of surprise guests and cameos of varying eras including a large portion of the cast of Family Guy and Patrick Stewart as the dry and witty narrator.Straying slightly from the path of the Family Guy formula, Ted stacks on the Hollywood via rom- com elements. But fans of Family Guy need not worry, as there's filthy humour, pop culture references and insults of all ages, gender and cultures aplenty.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"if children's films grew up - in a word, hilarious!","In a word, hilarious. Saw this courtesy of work pal at a free screening, and really enjoyed it. Seth MacFarlane was the voice of the bear and brought his own brand of irreverent close to the bone bawdy and profane humour to the shana punim of Ted. Laugh out loud, this is primarily a boy's film (what's the male version of chick flick? actually don't answer that...) with lots of 80s and 90s references, and despite the teddy bear not at all suitable for children. My husband and I seemed to be the only ones in the cinema apparently to get the paraphrase of ""Stay Gold Ponyboy"" but the rest were generally appreciated. A terrifyingly genius turn by Giovanni Ribisi with a Tiffany obsession (""I think we're alone now"") gave the film a dark twist and there were loads of other cameo type appearances Patrick Warburton and uncredited Ryan Reynolds playing scarily believable gay couple, Patrick Stewart as narrator and Norah Jones, Tom Skerritt and Flash Gordon, Sam J Jones. Shockingly gross at times, but also with a good deal of heart to make the fantasy (superb SFX) of the living toy relevant, with a surprisingly welcome Hollywood ending that wasn't too schloky. Wahlberg and Kunis were cute and the acting by Wahlberg opposite Ted was brilliant- especially the fight scene. Watch it and weep, with laughter!!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Very good,"Hello and welcome to ""Matthew Praises"", where I praise the heck out of movies and TV shows so hard in order to make it up to the people who gave me flack at my ""Matthew Rants"" reviews. So let's begin with TED. If you enjoyed the works of Seth McFarlene, like FAMILY GUY, American DAD and THE CLEVELAND SHOW, then you'll love this one (especially if you didn't see any of this guy's work). It is down-right funny and it feels like a cartoon of his. It's got fantasy sequences and jokes that revolve around pop culture. It has a ton of language, drug usage, and sexual references which is why it is given an R-rating. So check it out. I highly recommend this movie being shot in Boston (it has some great locations that the typical Bostonian is familiar with).",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"A disappointing, hollow movie with a non-existent plot.","Last night I went to watch the movie ""Ted"", which is Seth McFarlane's first attempt at a feature film. And in this case ""attempt"" is actually a more accurate term than ""film"". The humor is decent at times, and I remember laughing out loud at a few scenes, but the movie feels so empty and hollow. It feels like it's not an actual movie, and more like a long episode of Family Guy, especially considering that the only funny jokes in this movie are the flashbacks the characters have (a Family Guy trademark).The plot is very slow moving (if there is one in the first place) and the movie never picks up any pace, it never excites you or surprises you. The ending is one of the cheesiest endings in film history. Sure, the character work is alright and none of the actors are bad at what they do but the film is overall a huge letdown which leaves nothing behind, I had brought up my hopes for this one. If you just want to watch something mindless on a Saturday night, Ted is a nice option but if you want to watch an actual movie, go see Batman instead.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An Entertaining Adult Fairytale,"I had read many spoiler-free reviews prior to seeing Ted. I typically do that as I am sure many of you have. I'll start my review by saying one thing... It was not as funny as I had expected given the reviews I'd read. I don't want to be misunderstood though, this is a very funny film. That being said, have I watched funnier episodes of Family Guy? Yes.This film is basically an adult fairytale made for children of the 80s. It is chocked full of 80s references that will make you giggle. I was entertained from beginning to end. I can usually let go of the real world when watching a film, but even I was curious to see how they were going to pull off a Teddy bear living in the city. They did it wonderfully. Never once did I think it was beyond belief because of they way people interacted with Ted. The acting was great from all members of the cast. Similar to Family Guy, it's possible to be offended if your not a fan of that show. The humor was crude and over the top, but worked very well here. I didn't laugh the entire time, but that's probably just me. I was entertained though and that is what I want from a film in the end. There were also many great cameos that were very surprising. I'm also glad to see Joel McHale getting well deserved screen time. He is a treat. See this film, but don't let the teddy bear fool you... leave the kiddies at home.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Awful,"This movie made me ashamed to be American. Our standards for comedy have completely deteriorated. After seeing The Dictator and now TED, I'm completely convinced that Hollywood will never release another intelligent, funny comedy ever again. The sad thing is that I was both a fan of Sacha Baren Cohen and Seth MacFarlane, but I have lost respect for both of them. This was a movie made for complete morons. How many times can you say d**k and have someone take a sh*t before it's not funny any more? Has every great comedic writer completely run out of ideas? It's absolutely pathetic. I could not believe that everyone in the theater was laughing at the worst writing and acting I've ever seen.The biggest problem was that the movie was BORING. If you're gonna make a movie about a teddy bear, could you at least not bore me to tears? When that chase scene started and they started sewing up the bear enough was enough. I'm not prude or lacking in the humor department at all, but I just think it's really sad what comedy has turned into. I miss comedies that had the ability to make me laugh without saying ""s**k my d**k"" 800 times. There used to be real humor with real thought behind it, it wasn't so cheap and void of any class or wit. Now all you need is someone to take a dump, a famous actor to say ""s**k my d**k"", and a few offensive, unoriginal jokes about homosexuals/Jews/Mexicans/Asians and you've got yourself a golden ticket.

Very good,"Ted, although not exactly what can be defined as '' a cinematic exquisite '', is a film that does very well thanks in its central proposal: Being a comedy (familiar? I would say) politically incorrect, but never MORALLY incorrect , maintaining a balance and masterful good taste in the delivery of jokes, choosing their targets by hand and always giving them harsh social criticism.

Grin and bear it,"If you know what to expect, I expect you'll be entertained. I could have done without the distracting and unfunny cameos, but MacFarland's voicing of the title character steals the show and garners enough laughs to make it bearable. Ted is a bromance with a difference; a story of arrested development that brings out the kid in you. The bear really does come alive thanks to MacFarland and persuasive animation. Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis are appealing and give committed performances while Giovanni Ribisi gives a creepy and campy performance that would fit right into The Silence of the Lambs.

Crazy in A Very Good Way,"What's wrong with a teddy bear that can talk and interact with the normal world? Welcome to Seth MacFarlane's world! He is the creator behind adult TV cartoons like ""Family Guy"", ""American Dad"" and ""Cleveland"" where dog can talk and an extraterrestrial alien as a family member. It all started when 8-year-old John Bennett made a wish that his beloved teddy bear Ted would come alive to be his best friend forever and it came true the very next day. Afterwards the scene shifts to the present day where Ted is now a bear who smoking pot and dating many girls. Meanwhile, John (Mark Wahlberg) has a job at the rental car agency and serious relationship with his girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis). Somehow, it's time for John, to choose between his best friend and his lover. My appreciation goes to Seth MacFarlane who made the script, directed the movie, voiced and motion-captured Ted. MacFarlane brings us to a whole new level of dimension that we never go before. It's sometimes weird and another time is funny. Macfarlane would do anything to create laughter, breaking all boundaries and mocking almost everyone in the industry. In short, his humor works pretty sick and well! Now, let's talk about Mark Wahlberg. All thiz time, I always think that Mark Wahlberg is always Mark Wahlberg in all of his movies. He seems only capable of delivering one same look, acting and character. But, in thiz movie, he gives me a different perspective. Eventually, Mark Wahlberg is one of the Actors who depend on his strong charisma and attractive personality. In fact, I also just realized that almost all his movies reach significant box office success. Thiz is an undeniable proof that people love him. The next in spotlight is Mila Kunis. Kunis is one true example of modern girls who can say anything she wants while still looking classy. She's not afraid to look silly. Quite the opposite, she gives the impression of smart, flexible and fun. There are also some cameo appearances involving the old aged movie star Tom Skerritt, the Jazz singer Norah Jones and Flash Gordon himself Sam J. Jones. Actually, it's quite refreshing to see a foul-mouthed teddy bear partying with 1980s sci-fi cult icon. Everything is just spiralling out of control and it seems that they are not afraid of being laughed at. Thiz is crazy in a very good way. In the end, what if I tell you that Seth MacFarlane initially intended to voice hi-tech Japanese robot cat, Mark Wahlberg was originally meant to play Nobita and the movie title should be ""Doraemon"". Well, if you believe that, then you can accept anything, including thiz movie. It's not as absurd as it sounds.

"Me And My Teddy Bear, we got no worries and we got no cares","Watching Ted it took me all the way back to my long ago childhood when I had a Teddy Bear. I certainly envied Mark Wahlberg for getting his Christmas wish. Of course the story involves Mark possibly outgrowing the need for a talking Teddy Bear. And that song from my childhood Me and my Teddy Bear kept running through my head.Ted is a charming fantasy about a young boy who grows up to be Mark Wahlberg wishing for and getting his Teddy Bear to turn into a live creature. The bear named Ted of course grows up with Wahlberg and the childish pleasures they shared, are now adult pleasures. Some very adult pleasures.All this is coming between Wahlberg and the girl he loves Mila Kunis. She gives him an understandable ultimatum, me or the bear.As Ted is truly a unique creature, no one in the history of planet earth was ever faced with that choice. How Mark resolves it is for you to see in the movie.If you do see it, I'd think long and hard about taking minor kids to it. Ted is funny, but funny for adults.I have to single out Giovanni Ribisi and young Aedin Mincks who if Wahlberg is ready to give up Ted, they'll have him. These two will creep you out and no one I would hold near and dear would get near them. Also Seth McFarlane was great in his creation of Ted both in voice and animation.Nice enjoyable film, but not one for the kids.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Family Guy Uncensored.,"When a little boy wishes his teddy bear could actually talk to him, he wakes up the next morning to see his wish come true. Best friends/thunder buddies for life they say. Flash forward 25 years or so and now that little boy is Mark Walhberg and that teddy is Seth McFarlane. Mila Kunis is Walhberg's girlfriend and when things get out of control says it's either going to be her or the bear.I know that going into this film that it was going to be 90 minutes of Family Guy jokes and that's a pretty accurate description. So if you love Family Guy style humour, you'll really enjoy this. I think Family Guy 'use' to be funny and ever since it came back from cancellation, it's been stale. Ted, manages to be both. A lot of the jokes misfire and a lot of them hit. I have to give McFarlane credit though, he only used one flashback gag.Family Guy is notorious for having jokes about random celebrities and you either get it or you don't. That's the same with Ted. A Brandon Routh joke and numerous Tom Skeritt jokes get no laughs, but plenty of others do. McFarlane, a fan of the 80's, plants numerous 80's jokes here. Flash Gordon being a big one. I found myself laughing more times than not, but when a joke falls flat, boy does it ever.Ted gives McFarlane more room for crude humour. There's plenty of cursing in this film. A bear that swears is funny for a short while, but when the film tries to get a laugh out of him simply standing there and saying the F-word, then you know it's stretching. Sex, drugs and language fill this film, so it's certainly not for kids, even if the young ones do watch Family Guy. This is McFalane's first venture into the film world and it shows. He has no cinematic eye and doesn't know when to leave a scene. The end result is a wash.Many of McFarlane's friends and co-workers show up here. Mila Kunis, if the most obvious one, she has a starring role, but the supporting cast is basically a who's who of McFalane's shows. Patrick Warburton, Patrick Stewart, Alex Borstein and Ralph Garman just to name a few. Friends helping out friends I guess. Joel McHale plays Mila Kunis' jerk boss who always makes advances at her, that subplot literally goes nowhere. Finally Giovanni Ribisi amps up the creep factor and takes the story in a totally different direction in the third act.In the end, Ted is a funny film. The best way for me to recommend it is based on Seth McFarlane's comedy. He wrote, produced, directed and voices Ted. It's got his mark all over it. If you like his comedy and television shows, Ted will be a laugh riot. If not, I would probably say avoid it.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

The restaurant scene where he brushes away a fart and the three businessman create a fuss must have been penned by a five year old. The Flash Gordon scenes were dreadful, the entire kidnapping plot line and the Dad & child should have been removed completely.Wahlberg said he wished he got Teddy Ruxpin for Christmas instead.

Movie is watchable more than two times in a row.,"To me, a movie that instantly feels like you can watch it continuously, end on end, etc. is automatically worthy of a 10 out of 10. Even more deserves a 10 out of 10 when you feel that other people can do the same. And that's exactly how I feel about Ted.Some reviews I've seen give it a bad rap and then a bad rating just because there's a great amount of crude humor. However, there's warm, heart felt moments, and not just crude humor in some parts that balance it out and make this movie a fantastic comedy and one heck of a time at the movie theater.And that is another reason why this movie gets a perfect score from me.Plus Seth MacFarlane might be my long lost brother cause the things they (the characters) say in the movie are exactly some things I would say. Just jokes and poking at society and thoughts on Hollywood I think everyone with get a kick out of. Even though it's so reminiscent of family guy (duh), who cares. Its a great time at the movies.

"Hilarious, best comedy of the summer","While it's not exactly a perfect film, 'Ted' will put a massive grin on your face from the start. Most of the gags will have you laughing until your chest hurts, and the ones that won't will at least make you smile like crazy.To be fair, Seth McFarlane's inexperience as a director does show in places, but with jokes pulled off so brilliantly it's often hard to notice. If you're a fan of Family Guy, American Dad or any of McFarlane's creations, you will love this. Of course, some of the jokes may be too crude for some people's tastes, so be warned. But it isn't all penis jokes and swearing, there's a lot of light-hearted humour in there too, and plenty of pop culture references and parodies (the Flash Gordon scenes are hilarious).But, despite it being McFarlane and co's debut feature film, the writing and characterisation are very good, certainly better than any other comedy this year. In fact, even the emotional stuff is pretty powerful and you feel a lot for the characters.Haters will hate and nitpick all they want, but 'Ted' is hands-down the comedy of the summer, the kind of feel-good comedy with unexpected, hilarious jokes flying from everywhere and just making you want to smile. It's beautiful.See if you liked: Family Guy (series), American Dad (series), Paul (2011), Superbad (2007)",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Disgusting & a waste of money,"The trailer for this movie is misleading and deceitful & that's the only reason there were any people in the theater, although many walked out during the poor excuse for a movie. I was all prepared for a good comedy but this has to be the worst movie of all time & I mean ALL TIME. The vulgarity and cursing is over the top, drugs and alcohol in the bankrupt minds of the producer/director must be fillers and stop gap for creativity. I felt embarrassed for the cast of actors & actresses that subjected themselves to a GRADE B movie, not a lot better than a cheap porno flick. I will watch for this cast of pathetic entertainers in the future so I can avoid them like a plague, money better spent bad hamburger.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarious,"Absolutely hilarious. I gave this a 10 not because it's perfect - nothing will ever be. But boy, does this movie deliver. America - your favorite writer gets to the big screen with a bang. The writing for this movie is laugh out loud. I haven't been on IMDb for a while and writing reviews was a distant memory. Ted showed me why I used to love comedy movies. My only problem with the movie was the incessant laughing from the crowds - sometimes drowning out dialogue. I will probably see it again making sure the theater is empty - will take a while. That being said, it's R. Leave your kids behind. And overtly PC people will also have trouble with certain scenes. All round, MacFarlane poured his soul into the movie making - it's quite hard to weave tender moments into a movie as raunchy as this, but he did it anyway and one will never imagine this is a first for the director. My kudos and a big recommend to all movie lovers out there.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Fine, but don't expect anything remarkable","I watched this movie a few months ago. I had high expectations, though. But I feel that it's not much to tell about it. Nothing more than a 6 out of 10.I cannot deny that the idea it's interesting. Most of the jokes were fine, it had some humour in it. But something was missing. No, I wasn't looking for depth. But maybe for better humour- better than sexual and drugs jokes. It was fine, but nothing special, compared to everyone's hype. There are far better comedies than this- but if you don't take it seriously and don't have high expectations, it's perfect for a Friday night with friends.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Finally, a good use for CGI...","This is the story of a 35-year old guy named John Bennett, played by Mark Walhberg, who's victim of such a common syndrome in people of our generation, he's an ""adu-lescent"", basically, an adult who refuses to grow up, and keeps on enjoying a hedonistic life made of sex, drugs and house parties. I don't know if the word is used in English, but anyway, think of Judd Appatow's comedies' male protagonist and you'll get the point. And this John Bennet leads his hedonistic life with Ted, his 27-year old best friend. But John has a job and a beautiful girlfriend named Lori Collins, and played by Mila Kunis, who wants to make plans with him, but he must show that he's capable of being an adult and convincing Ted to let him live his life. That's ""Ted"" in a nutshell.Oh yes, and Ted is a Teddy Bear. One of the most memorable CGI creatures of recent years, who provided Mark Walhberg one of his greatest roles, in the same vein of touching weirdness and comical performance than the late Bob Hoskins in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"".I can imagine Seth MacFarlane pitching the film to the producer, a few sentences and you can hear a cash-machine sound in the background. Just when you get the story, a man whose best friend is a talking teddy bear, you understand it is a comedy of opposition, think about it, a big, smiling, cute and fluffy teddy bear, symbol of childhood and innocence, acting like a horny foul-mouthed animal party, this is an offer a producer can't resist to. But from our experienced viewers' perspective, as promising as the synopsis sounds, we wonder how long such a gimmick can be maintained before losing its appeal. MacFarlane is a terrific writer when it comes to animated sitcom episodes (such as ""Family Guy"" or ""American Dad"") but there's no fundamental difference between the premise of ""Ted"" and ""Howard the Duck"". ""Ted"" could've been a disaster.Or ""Ted"" could have been 'just a good film', but guess what, it's slightly better than that because of how surprisingly good it is. Actually, what could have been the basis of a sketch or a ""Family Guy"" manages to drive a story-line of a hundred minutes in an exciting and entertaining way. And this is owes a lot to the fact that Ted is handled like a full and three-dimensional character from the very start. The film opens in 1980 when a friendless boy (so alone he's even mocked by the poor Jewish kid who's getting his annual Christmas beating) and when he gets a Teddy Bear, he makes a predictable wish which predictably becomes real. Ted speaks, much to his buddy's delight and his parents' horror, but then the magic of Christmas operates, what happens next, within the film's fantastic universe, is handled with very smart realism.No, the parents don't hide Ted, why should they? Ted becomes a local oddity then an instant celebrity, invited to the Johnny Carson's show, and so forth. And then like many 80's wonders and other 90's stars such as Corey Feldman or Frankie Muniz, he sadly sunk into oblivion. And after that, this is where the film won me. I thought John would get rid of Ted and then the teddy-bear would come back to his life, but would have that made sense? Why would you even lose your best friend, one that understands you perfectly, one that grows an intense complicity with you and one who was raised on the same cult-programs than you? No, Ted remained his friend and very much his friend for 27 years, and when we meet them, they act together like true bros, Ted might be a gimmick for us to discover, but he's a fully developed character nonetheless.The film takes a departure from films like ""Howard the Duck"" or ""Paul"" where the strangeness relies on Sci-fi elements. The fantasy here allows the film to get away with all the 'why's and 'how's and spare us some distracting special effects. Here, the plot centers on relationships, and the way love can undermine friendships and vice versa. And when you suspect it will be impossible for Ted to leave John's life because he's got nowhere to go, the film takes you by surprise by making his independent life absolutely possible. The screenplay, written by Macfarlane is the best asset of the film, because it creates unpredictable situations out on predictable material. There's no scene that hasn't been seen before, but in ""Ted"", it works because it doesn't try to be original, it just sticks to Ted's irresistible personality and the contrast with his appearance.Of course, there's a lot of things happening in the film, a mysterious buyer obsessed with the Bear and played by a creepy-looking Giovani Ribisi, there's Lori's boss and occasional stalker whose efforts to conquer her hearts always meet with answers you never really see coming, there are also one of the most memorable cinematic parties with a mysterious guest star, and of course, there are some delicious interactions between Ted and characters of female persuasion, even a nice cameo as one of his ex's, one you never see coming. This is a film that is really caring about making us laugh and manages to take a concept à la ""American Dad"" (one of the best written animated shows) and make a story out of it, one full of crazy one-liners, raunchy but never vulgar dialogues, or never vulgar at the expenses of humor, and one of the funniest concluding voice-over monologue.And beyond the laughter, Ted is humanized in such a way you can't look at him as a Teddy Bear, but he's so cute and adorable you can't ignore that. What a fascinating paradox!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Funny, but trying a little too hard...","MacFarlane's trademark mix of cutting satire and slapstick comedy setup worked its charm in TED, delivering plenty of laughs, and even a little heart, for anyone who can handle the film's risqué on screen escapades.But MacFarlane (who makes his feature directorial debut with the film) successfully balances the absurd and over-the-top elements of Ted with a number of grounded, albeit familiar, statements on love and friendship. That said, despite presenting a number of genuinely sweet moments, the film isn't going to be for everyone and moviegoers who aren't interested in watching a stuffed Teddy Bear f**k a cash register display (which is only the tip of the iceberg) should probably look elsewhere.This feels pretty much the same as watching Family Guy. Peter Griffin is John, TED is Stewie and Lori - Lois. The jokes are ruder, cruder and more sexual oriented (hard to imagine right?).Without question, the core Ted story will be especially familiar to anyone who has seen a bromance film or a similar thirty-something coming of age tale before. Had the movie not featured a sex-crazed talking stuffed animal, it'd be easy to write Ted off as a formulaic and predictable series of events that fails to offer anything but formulaic characters in service of one comedy setup after another. However, watching the surprisingly lifelike animated Teddy Bear performing even the most basic actions (such as driving a car) never gets old, and as a result, even the formulaic elements of the plot are easily heightened by the unabashed absurdity of the setup. Of course, there are also plenty of fresh comedy gags as well – not to mention loads of '80s throwbacks that pull double duty in providing a number of laugh out loud setups, as well as humanizing the stuffed protagonist (i.e. he's really into Flash Gordon).The cast includes plenty of stilted interactions, especially between Wahlberg and Ted, but none of these moments detract from the overall enjoyment of the experience – since everyone on screen is clearly operating with their tongue firmly planted against the side of their cheek. Mila Kunis once again successfully flexes her comedy muscle and, despite serving in a supporting role this round, has some of the more enjoyable (and heartfelt) scenes with the bear. Joel McHale's Rex and Giovanni Ribisi's Donny are equally entertaining, albeit exceptionally one-note, which describes most of the characters in the film: thin but entertaining vehicles for either physical or one-liner comedy.While it's not going to be for everyone, moviegoers who are onboard with Ted's campy premise and crude antics will likely find that MacFarlane has delivered an entertaining live-action comedy debut. Outside of the premise, the scene to scene narrative elements don't offer many surprises, but considering they revolve around an R-Rated talking Teddy Bear, most scenes still manage to present plenty of fresh laughs and, from time to time, heart/stuffing-warming character moments.P.S Wahlbergs accent is HORRIBLE. I think he would of sounded better just using his own accent, the one he tries to pull off comes across fake as ever, listen out for it...tried a little too hard.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Terrible,"I was surprised at how utterly awful TED was. It was truly and absolutely terrible. There was essentially no plot. It was one gimmick about an animated stuffed animal who curses a lot and spews a lot of raunchy, sexually explicit comments. It'd be okay for a five-minute sketch -- even a recurring sketch on SNL would have been okay -- but there simply isn't enough to make a full-length movie. I am surprised that the consensus seems to be positive, as this movie hovers at about a third-grade level.Moreover, I was surprised at Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis -- not to mention Giovanni Ribisi -- all of whom have made quality, substantive movies/shows in the past, opted to be in this crap-fest. Farts jokes and a stuffed teddy bear having sex with a woman only go so far, and at least insofar as this reviewer is concerned, they don't go very far at all.One of the worst movies I've seen in years.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
That's a great story. I felt like I was there.,"Ted is a 2012 fantasy comedy that follows a man whose childhood wish brought his teddy bear to life.Directed by family guy creator Seth MacFarlane comes a fantastic comedy that is not only very imaginative, but absolutely hilarious. Mark Wahlberg stars as John Bennett, a lonely little boy whose wish for a friend comes true in the form of a teddy bear that he got for Christmas (that is also voiced by Macfarlane). But when his friendship begins to get in the way of his commitment to his girlfriend portrayed by Mila Kunis, John has to reevaluate what's important in his life.The jokes in the film are crude, so unless you don't mind that kind of humor than this might not be for you. Otherwise, it's a great movie that is full of nothing but funny moment after funny moment, with a terrific cast, and a really good original story. If you haven't seen this before, I would definitely recommend checking it out.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Funny, as promised","If you're a fan of Seth MacFarlane or a child of the 80's then you'll enjoy this. It's filled with pop culture references, crass comedy and fantastic cameos, Very funny (in a 'Family Guy' humour sort of way) and I definitely got my share of laughs.Ted himself is well animated which adds to the magic, and despite finding his Peter Griffin voice initially distracting (loved that they addressed this) I totally fell for him and his bromance with Mark Wahlberg.Wahlberg does a good job, he's perfect for the role as a Bostonian who as a child successfully wishes his teddy bear to life. 'John' gets more than he bargained for when the stuffed animal follows him into adulthood, complicating his relationship with (Mila Kunis). Now he has to choose between his girl or his friendship with the crude and extremely inappropriate Ted.The plot here is nothing special, its familiar, I would even say cliché but it doesn't really matter because events are just so hilarious. On another note, I could definitely tell that Seth McFarlane is (my age) by the bits I found funny or ironic or nostalgic, like the Darth Vader case for all the action figures, Airplane re-enactment, Flash Gordon or Indiana Jones notes played on the stairs. 2/7/16",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Just plain vulgar and crude,"This is a story that tries to be funny by putting a dirty mouth, vulgar and sickening frat boy persona in a teddy bear. With all the skills of animating such a bear, it could have done something uplifting, but the happy ending is a sham. I felt tricked to watch this movie. It made me so upset that I actually wasted my time on this. I kept wishing there was some redeeming value to this movie but there wasn't. This movie puts the worst of human nature out there and makes it appear good. Who could come up with such a story line that is so nasty? The story line is so pathetic and uncreative telling a story that's been told many times over. Definitely not for your kids or teens. And people wonder why we have an attitude problem with young people in the US. This is a case in point.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Offensive, wrong and childish, ""Ted"" is hilarious and then it becomes a Hollywood rom-com","The great thing about ""Ted"" is that they know their target audience. And they hooked us from the very beginning. It starts with a fairly well written narration about how in 1984 on Christmas eve, all the Boston kids would gather together and beat up the Jewish kid, and then the next morning they would open their presents. One little girl got a Cabbage Patch Kid — the identical one which I got on the exact same morning. They had similar clips for the rest of the audience.John (Mark Wahlberg) got Ted, a teddy bear, who became a real, live teddy bear. ""A Christmas miracle, just like baby Jesus."" That should give you a sense of what the humour is like. It's blasphemous, homophobic, racist and culturally offensive. For those who don't get offended easily it's actually pretty funny.As John grows up and Ted becomes famous (he is a walking, talking teddy bear after all) they settle down for a life filled with childish behaviour and lots of pot. One morning, John is too stoned to drive to work, but behind a blue haze of marijuana smoke, Ted says it's okay, he can. And so he does. I couldn't help myself but laugh.A lot of people seemed to be delighted by the fact that there was a story to the movie ""Ted""; somehow expecting that there wasn't going to be one. As much as Hollywood would prefer to not have to tell a story, they always at least try. But don't let the fact that there is a story confuse you into thinking it's a good one. It's not. It's a simple romantic comedy about a guy who can't grow into a man because as long as he has a teddy bear he will always be a kid. That is paraphrased directly from the movie.The novelty of the humour does wear off as the story builds up. Most of the lines remain funny, but I would like to think that they could have made the plot funny too. An element which makes ""Horrible Bosses"" (2011) a better movie than this.Wahlberg essentially plays himself, minus the singing ability, so he was very natural but his reactions weren't as funny as in ""I Heart Huckabees"" or some of his other comedies. Giovanni Ribisi, on the other hand, does not play himself – I hope! And he hasn't been funnier. He plays that creepy guy from the park with the kid who could be his son or who may be his lover.Some scenes I was a bit too creeped out to laugh, some scenes were so damn funny that I couldn't help but laugh, and some scenes should have been made funnier. Which is probably what most people would expect to get out of a movie like ""Ted'.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Talking teddy is kinda funny,I do think seth mcfarlane is a talented script writer and does very well with his writing for his show family guy but Ted wasn't the best and just barely saves itself from mediocrity by being occasionally unfunny.Like on one hand I really was expecting more from this movie. The premise sounded kinda funny and seth macfarlane is usually funny enough. I can say that it did not deliver. First off it wasn't really that funny. Occasionally a joke landed pretty well but the rest is really just haha drugs and sex really funny.

"Too real to be absurd, but good acting","In this movie Mark Wahlberg's character has a buddy who is a living, breathing Teddy bear.In order for this movie to be funny you have to find the idea of a crude teddy bear to be ridiculous.For this to happen, you need to be able to associate the voice of the voice actor with a CGI bear.The voice was a little too real for me. I could imagine in my head what the voice actor probably looked like. I hard a hard time identifying the voice with the CGI character.So, instead of seeing an absurdly crude voice come out of an absurdly cute bear, I just saw them separately.But there was still some great acting from Mark Wahlberg, and a few other actors. And some interesting Boston-related humor. The actress who played his trophy girlfriend was forgettable though.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Not the type of teddy bear that you're used to,"Mark Wahlberg has summoned his teddy bear from childhood to life, and the whole premise of the film essentially revolves around this. The plot is rather predictable and not all that thick, but I doubt that people are going to watch Ted for this aspect. I liked Ted when it came out and well, I don't dislike it now at all, but I don't think it has aged particularly well and I found it less funny on rewatch than I did when I first saw it. I think part of the reason for this is that it has tons of pop culture references that are a decade out of date now, much like MacFarlane's other works if you don't know the things they're referencing then you won't get much of the humour. It also feels overlong and it's pretty much a one joke movie in a way. The acting is generally pretty good for what it's worth.Expect copious amounts of profanity, as well as many references to drugs and sexuality. It's for this reason that it's not recommended for the faint of heart but if you like raunchy comedies then you could do much worse.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A little disappointed," When I heard Seth MacFarlane, the baby-faced genius behind TV's most hilarious sitcom, ""Family Guy,"" was planning his feature-film debut, I was totally thrilled. I was even more excited to learn the plot would revolve around a foul-mouthed, pot-smoking teddy bear magically brought to life via his owner's childhood wish. And when I discovered Mark Wahlberg and ""Family Guy"" regular Mila Kunis were signing on to star, I began eagerly counting the days until it premiered. And when the film finally arrived, my patience is rewarded with ... a gross-out comedy from the guy responsible for creating history's funniest animated series? Yes, there are moments when MacFarlane's clever side intercedes, and those bits are great, especially his biting digs at washed-up child stars and Taylor Lautner. But for the most part, he and co-writers Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Weld go for the cheap and lazy, like poop-and-fart jokes, and walk-ons by the likes of Tom Skerritt, Norah Jones, Ryan Reynolds and Flash Gordon himself, Sam J. Jones, that serve no purpose beyond providing a knowing wink and nudge to MacFarlane's hippest fans.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Not only is it unfunny, it's also sickeningly offensive and quite possibly the worst film I've ever seen, which is not a phrase I'd use lightly.

Ted also had a plot, surprisingly which was unoriginal and slightly too serious considerings its premise. Ted also has some great cameos. To quickly round up this review all I'm going to say is the film's great but it has its flaws. Some of the jokes are a hit or miss but the film's overall the second funniest film I've seen all year (First being 21 Jump Street)so I recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

My personal opinion is no,it doesn't make it that bad a movie. Considering the fact that it's Seth's first attempt at a live action feature length,it is a pretty good movie.

Show your kids this and they'll never want a fluffy toy again!,"When the initial news of Seth MacFarlane's Ted circulated it unquestionably turned people's heads. A fluffy, cuddly and heart warming harmless bear became centre stage. A boy's Christmas present becomes his life-long wish, to speak, to move and enjoy human life with him as he struggles to fit within human society. On that note it wouldn't be recommended to compare this with former living toy spirits such a Pixar's Toy Story, far from it as Team Woody and Buzz, unless off-set, pose smoking weed and mouthing off like an animal.The question that's poses is whether Ted is a majestic creation. Would the jokes be considered droll and tolerant if a soft toy wasn't in the picture? MacFarlane has brought the unusual to our screens by being imaginative, expanding beyond his marathon of Family Guy episodes and turning Ted into a triumphant persona when considered the topic of dialogue amongst those who have become intrigued by the comic of a talking, homophobic, self indulgent teddy bear. Counteracting this, Ted is not an original act; we've seen puppeteers and all spent time in reverie of waking up to a cuddly friend. As would be expected, if this was reality the bear would become famous, but after a while the bear becomes ancient history and left to mound up with those folks forced to convert to everyday life, parallel to his opposite number performed by Mark Wahlberg. I doubt this will be one of Wahlberg's most honoured and remembered lead acts in front of the camera as the teddy is primarily centre stage. Mila Kunis is plainly staged for prettiness and zilch else. Indubitably she has acting talent but is purely the mechanism for a love story or acceptably becoming a symbol of lust for Ted to gawk whilst being John's (Wahlberg) paramount Thunder Buddy. Ted basically replaces the languid yet significant friend who clings to his middle aged underachieving chum, who is adoringly attached to Mrs attractive. Circumstances become unsettling and John has the thorny decision of choosing between Mr Fluff or the love of his life.The film does boast a number of pure hilarity components, particularly the scene of prostitute excrement and a few interventions with Ted's employer. The enjoyment factor can be notified within this film but will incontrovertibly struggle to pose any bona fide prominence in years to come. MacFarlane's efforts here will become dreary after purchasing the DVD and left mounted in alphabetical order, sandwiched between titles such as Squeamish and Tedious. Let us hope it doesn't turn into a cult faction where exasperating cyclic Family Guy aficionados quote the screenplay phrase for word as they daily perform with the animated television series.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Seth MacFarlane and Mark Wahlberg splash their comedic energy in this vulgar, yet devilishly funny buddy comedy","Comedy fanatics can always count on Seth MacFarlane, creator of the hit animated series 'Family Guy', to put on a good show, even his raunchy humor may not be your cup of tea. This movie, marking his first major film debut, takes his patent for vulgar humor and audacious delivery of crass innuendos and cranks up a notch with this story concerning a friendship between a man and a furry childhood friend with the mouth of a sailor. That childhood friend happens to be a talking teddy bear. For a movie featuring a cuddly little toy as a faithful companion, you would believe if you are in for a kid-friendly treat. But as this is Seth MacFarlane working behind the camera, this raunchy comedy is anything but that. It is an exercise of crude, R-rated humor and profane dialogue complete with innuendos that put the humor in 'Family Guy' to shame. Ultimately, it is funny and infectiously charming to the point where it is only expected to keep you laughing almost consistently. This film follows John Bennett (played by Mark Wahlberg), a 35-year old man who shares an apartment with his foul-mouthed, pot-smoking teddy bear named Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) who he brought to life as a result of wishing upon a star when he was a child. When their infectious friendship, however, threatens to come between his relationship with his longtime girlfriend Lori (played by Mila Kunis), he must decide how to balance his their friendship while maintaining a good relationship with the woman of his dreams.There is plenty of joy to be found in Mark Wahlberg crashing on the couch with a talking teddy bear while smoking pot and trading profane one-liners about sex and drugs. If there is anything that hinders in your one's enjoyment in these scenes, it is, of course, Seth MacFarlane's tendency of pushing the envelop with his vulgarity, his frequent excess of four-letter words, and cracking jokes on some occasionally sensitive subject matter. Nonetheless, this movie fully embraces the audacious comedic spirit MacFarlane granted in the 'Family Guy' series. And when it comes it the chemistry between the titular character and Mark Wahlberg, that is where the film peaks. Wahlberg, who has done a few comedic roles in the past such as 'The Other Guys', shows off with his infectious comedic muscle that greatly pays off in nearly each scene he comes on screen. He is also given a chance to show his serious side when the story dives into more dramatic territory which involves the crisis between his relationship with Mila Kunis. This portion of the plot is perhaps the lesser element of the story as it serves the purpose of giving the cast some time to breath from the consistent comedic absurdity that fills the air. Nonetheless, Wahlberg and MacFarlane succeed on delivering the laughs almost consistently. Sure, there are a few jokes that fall flat. But that is only occurs few and far in between.Ted is a wildly funny and entertaining enough keep viewers, particularly those of the Seth MacFarlane fandom, engaged from beginning to end. It is also very vulgar and crude to point of taking its R-rating to its peak. In this case, the conservative crowd will be left in an uncomfortable position. But for everyone else, it scores a fun, laugh-out-loud exercise.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great bathroom humor with some unexpected extras,"The most surprising thing about ""Ted"" is that it features an actual story rather than dragging itself from one joke to the next. It's a simple story, but it definitely has some degree of fairytale magic and leads to some genuinely touching scenes in the third act. That's something you don't really expect from Seth MacFarlane, because storytelling isn't exactly his strongest point. I was expecting this to be just as filled with non-sequiturs as ""Family Guy"", and I would have been fine with that. But all of a sudden MacFarlane understands how to write interesting characters you can side with, and that's a nice plus. The most important thing is the humor though, and ""Ted"" has plenty of laughs.

All goes well but inevitable, John gets old and has a girlfriend (Lori) so his relationship with Ted shouldn't be as it was, but it's actually stronger than ever. Unfortunately for him, Lori isn't happy with them so John must choose between her and Ted.It's the sort of movie which doesn't take itself seriously so neither am I. It's a complete joke, set to make you laugh with everything the characters do. The simple fact of having a live teddy bear, cursing and smoking all the time is awesome! You have a bit of drama and some sober scenes to change the ""mood"" a bit but nothing complex. Most of the time, it actually is funny but you have the impression that it tries too hard. A plot with more complexity and a better end could have made it a great movie. Still, it's quite a laugh!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I'm confused!,"I'm confused! I thought a 7.3 rating on IMDb meant a film might not be everyones bag but it would definitely not be a stinker! This film is not funny, it's not clever, it's not interesting and the acting is poor! I love American Dad and I like Family Guy but every so often there will be a ""joke"" that isn't a joke, I can only conclude that these must be Seth Macfarlane's contributions to the scripts because Ted is full of them! As I've already said, I like Family Guy but it does seem like when the writers can't think of anything funny to say they just come up with something crude, hateful or derogatory(often about young women), This film does exactly the same! Don't waste your time or money on this!",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Inside Joke,"Until Ted collapses at the end, with a generic ETish tragedy-turned-victory jerking of tears, I was laughing, sometimes so hard I regretted eating at Taco Time.Yet, since I have only seen two or three episodes of Family Guy, and I'm enjoying the maturity of my mid-fifties, I got the distinct feeling that there was an inside joke in Ted, or my age precluded me from seeing the movie as an joke to be appreciated by younger folks.Anyway/either way, the movie is crude and stupid and pretty darned delightful, with Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis, and Seth McFarlane having a grand old time on screen.I saw Ted with my wife, and I must be getting old because there were times I was so embarrassed from the crude humor I actually apologized to her.Then I saw her laughing hard, too, and I knew I didn't have to apologize.Maybe that's what makes Ted work--it's unapologetic in its crudity, its attention to its demographic. I saw The Rocky Horror Picture Show back in the early 80s, and I didn't get the cultish devotion that the movie generated. I did recognize that I couldn't recognize what was going on then. I do recognize that Ted's audience is about 30 years younger than me.Luckily, I'm smart enough to see what I know I'm not seeing.That's why I recommend this hilarious vulgarity.",,Anonymous,Comedy
Unexpected and worth your while,"This movie has surprised me with a good number of refreshing and unexpected moments. Without over-analyzing the story scenario itself (a conscious, living and intelligent teddy bear co-existing in today's society), I am claiming that Seth MacFarlane has created a believable setting, as believable, as can be.Mila Kunis and Mark Wahlberg are doing a very good job, with the later doing an excellent performance explicitely, considering the special bond to his living teddy bear. It's one example of Mark Wahlberg's diverse performance capabilities, considering the long way he's come from ""three nippled Calvin Klein underwear rapper"" to someone who can make me relate to his history to Ted. If someone would have told me before that I would enjoy and buy an emotional relationship and laugh my butt off during an intense fighting scene between those two I would have been convinced easily. This is also credited to MacFarlane's prior experience with writing and Family Guy that can make any ridiculous idea work.The movie is sometimes brave, sometimes silly, but all in all well crafted and if you're enjoying a good laugh you should definitely try it without friends and family that are too sensitive about nudity and moderate profanities.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Frequently hilarious and touching; one of the all time great comedies,"Seth MacFarlane's irreverent humor may not be for everybody; but those who love ""The Family Guy"" will adore ""Ted,"" whose running time equals about five ""Family Guy"" segments,yet, amazingly, maintains a more consistent level of humor than even one average episode. ""Ted"" even trumps ""Family Guy"" by also being a romantic comedy superior to most. A pretty amazing accomplishment,if you ask me; and, I hope the Motion Picture Academy recognizes this by nominating ""Ted"" as one of the year's best films.I have always considered Mark Wahlberg a middling actor with great taste in scripts, as he has made some really fine movies. Mila Kunis is not only beautiful, but a great ""straight man,"" as the antics in ""Ted"" would have rattled any lessor actress. Giovanni Ribisi is terrific in a small role, saving what is easily the weakest part of the movie (which is still better than your average movie). However, who would've thought Sam Jones(!) would steal every scene in which he appears? NOTE TO Hollywood: Give this guy another chance.Ted's animation is so astounding you actually come to accept him as a living, breathing creature, and the fantasy sequence recreation of ""Flash Gordon"" is spot on, an more amazing accomplishment considering the film's relatively small budget. Likewise, kudos to whoever effected the ""appearance with Johnny Carson"".As a bonus, Nora Jones, one of my favorite singers, also appears; and, she proves she is not only a great singer, she is sexy-beautiful and funny.""Ted"" stands along with ""Duck Soup,"" ""Young Frankenstein"" and ""The Whole Nine Yards"" as my all time favorite comedies.I give ""Ted"" a ""10"".",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It is nowhere near as funny as it should be.,"An episode of Family Guy might have more jokes than this entire movie. Sure I enjoy Seth McFarlane's brand of comedy but they are too few and too far.John (Wahlberg) is a lonely kid and wishes for his Teddy Bear to be able to talk to him and his wish is granted. Skip 25 years and the Teddy Bear (Ted (voiced by Seth McFarlane)), now a pot smoking foul mouthed ex-celebrity is still living with him and is coming in the way of him moving forward in his life and relationship with his long term girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis).The comedy genre is very similar to that of Family Guy mixing together Peter, Stewie and Brian according to the situations. The premise is quite familiar and does not go adventurous. Wahlberg has a good comedy timing and Mila Kunis sleepwalks through the role that she is quite accustomed to. Have to commend the CGI team for perfectly blending in Ted to make him feel real.It is nowhere near as funny as it should be.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Entertaining and funny, beginning and end show substance","The first few scenes of this movie give the impression of a wholesome, family-friendly Christmas movie. Okay, except for the part about beating up a kid because he's Jewish, but that still might have been acceptable in some family movies. Patrick Stewart's narration, like pretty much everything he does, is magnificent.Things change pretty quickly. I'm so glad I had the sanitized version aired on NBC, which I finally got around to watching yesterday.Okay, sanitized isn't quite right. Broadcast TV still allows a lot of filth.Still, I found the whole story quite entertaining, and a lot of it was funny.And while this could easily be dismissed as garbage, the last 30 minutes or so gave this movie some substance. An exciting adventure and some touching moments, and giving Lori the chance to show how caring she is.Lori is such a loving and patient girl, despite being so good-looking. Mila Kunis did a fine job. I mean for this type of material. This isn't ""Black Swan"" (actually, I have yet to see that).John is an appealing enough character and very dedicated to his ""best friend"". I know Mark Wahlberg is capable of better, but he's good enough here.Seth MacFarlane gives his usual great performance, with one exception. He sounds like Peter Griffin (and this is mentioned), but occasionally, and the first time he talks, he sounds like Brian Griffin.Joel McHale showed considerably more talent on ""Community"", but he has a couple of good scenes here as Lori's sleazy boss, and he's especially good delivering just one great line.I know Giovanni Ribisi is considered a respected actor, but I'm not sure what to say about him here. But without Donny and his son, this movie would have been missing some important scenes.Bill Smitrovich as Ted's boss does a good job, and has a surprising attitude.A cameo by Norah Jones shows her to be quite appealing, and of course I like her music.The music is one of the best things about the movie. Walter Murphy does the 50s sitcom-style music for ""Family Guy"", and a lot of the music in this movie sounds similar. There is great music in fine restaurants and at Rex's party. There are exceptions:1. The two versions of how John and Lori met.2. When John leaves one party for another, and when he arrives at the second party.3. Watching the TV series about Flash Gordon.4. Donny dances to Tiffany.Is this movie worth seeing? If you Seth MacFarlane's sitcoms, probably. And I do.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"A Man's ""Bear"" Friend","I haven't really watched Seth Macfarlane's Family Guy that much, but I knew this movie would be just as funny. Going in, I was thinking it would be some average version of a movie like a boy/man with his dog (where this time it's with his teddy bear), but once I heard the first opening joke in this movie, I was definitely hooked. After that, the jokes kept coming and I almost got to the point of tears, especially with one later in the movie. Some of them you felt OK laughing about, while some made you feel so guilty that you laughed so loudly after hearing them.I finally got to see how the great Mila Kunis acted and it's funny seeing Markie Mark talk with his New Yawk-like accent like he did in the movie ""Fighter"". It was awesome how it was basically Peter Griffin if he were a teddy bear. Even though he had a small part, Ralph Garman from the podcast ""Hollywood Babble-On"" did great as Johnny's father when Johnny was little. It kind of felt odd seeing Ryan Reynolds in this, but his part was just as funny as everyone else's.Even though the plot kind of felt basic, the jokes were the main part of it. You kind of had that feeling of knowing what was going to happen next, but the stuff Johnny and his ""bear"" friend (ba dumb tssh) are just so great you have to see it. I'll never look at toy teddy bears the same and also these pandas that I'm seeing on a local news station. I'd definitely recommend this movie if you're in for a very good laugh. I'd rate it a 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great film for a guys night,"Get a bunch of guys, go out, have a few beers and then watch Ted. Strongly feel this movie's fan following will grow as the years go by and a decade from today, we will be putting this one alongside the Big Lebowski, Old School etc.The premise of Ted is silly. Why would anyone want to watch a movie about an obnoxious teddy bear. Well, because a teddy bear doing crazy stuff and speaking like he has no filter is actually pretty funny. And Ted truly is one of the guys. We all had teddy bears growing up. This is what happens if they grew up with us.Intelligent acting. Seth McFarlane takes his Family Guy humour and is effective in throwing it into a stuffed animal. Overall, a fun movie if you go in with the intent of having fun. If you go in with the intent of finding an Oscar nomination, you'll be disappointed",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Ted makes you laugh ""hahdar"" than you have laughed in a long time, while still maintaining relate-ability","I do not give 8 out of 10's often; I am not trying to seem like a pompous ass, even though I'm listening to Kate Bush singing ""Wow"" as I write this review, but 8 out of 10's are hard to come by. Well, at least they're hard to come by with the scale that I grade movies on. And 8 out of 10 comedies are even harder to come by due to the recycled nature of all 2000's interludes post-Anchorman/Dodgeball. That being said, Ted deserves this honor (if you can call it that) wholeheartedly and without question. And here's why.""Stupid comedies"" with ""stupid humor"" have been a part of American culture since Judd Apatow first took his directing reigns and graced the silver screen with his comedic genius in 2004 and Ted certainly falls into the category of ""stupid humor"" - at least at times. But how does Ted separate itself from everything that has been done and is already shopworn? Enter Seth MacFarlane, the brains and voice acting behind the hit TV show Family guy who not only directs this work of art with class and ingenuity but also adds in some Family Guy-esque humor, a brand that we are all so familiar with, in all the right places.Everything you need to know from this movie you can find out from the preview, therefore a summary (and spoilers) is not necessary. Mark Wahlberg plays John, a 35-year-old rental car center employee who has a stuffed Teddy bear and a girlfriend who clearly deserves better in Mila Kunis. That being said the humor starts as soon as the beginning credits roll and doesn't die down until the conflict of the movie. Only a stone-faced GTA mom will sit through this movie and never donate a smirk. The plot is filled with hilarious one-liners and quick-and-quirky comedy that will have you in stitches; that already divulged comedy is peppered into an actual plot, stellar acting performances (including Ted's) and completely random and unexpected spouts of hilarity.Although the plot is actual, it isn't strong. Clichéd is the best word for it, but I was not expecting a Stephen King or Martin Scorsese screenplay. The movie follows a basic outline of background information, setting-up of plot, conflict, rising action, falling action, and climax. And the climax will make anybody who is a child at heart tear up - yes, I had to hold back tears because of that oh-so-wonderful Teddy bear. The plot adds onto the character ""models"" nicely and the audience develops a care for the characters, something that is missing from almost every recent film and is an absolute afterthought when making comedies. The biggest thing that makes you care about one particular character in this movie is the fact that he's a Teddy bear. Simple as that. He's adorable, funny, and despite having a 38-year-old Connecticut man's voice, cute.Mark Wahlberg once again steps out of his ""cop, fightah, cop"" comfort zone and plays a comedic and sometimes awkward funny-man, similar to the one he played in The Other Guys. Oops, he was a cop in that one too. Regardless, his performance deserves mention, as does Kunis's. She plays a stunning girlfriend extremely well and the chemistry between her and Wahlberg is a nice touch to the playful plot. However, Ted steals the show despite being 100% CGI. This shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone for the movie is titled after the fuzz ball. The emotions evoked in the bear's face really display a forward progress of computer generated graphics and the fact that Wahlberg had to talk to, essentially, nothing for the length of the movie is respectable.What else do you need to know? You don't need to be a certain age to enjoy this movie. All you need is an open heart and a soft spot for stuffed animals. And the latter is optional. Although the comedy dies down within the second half of the movie, the twists kick in and it's a stellar ride to the end. Few smudges, on an otherwise paramount comedic performance, make Ted an enjoyable film for anyone. You will want to dig up your old Teddy bear after watching this movie - I did.+3 for comedy gold+3 for Ted himself+1 for Wahlberg/Kunis+1 for inclusion of plot",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Supremely funny if over dependent on pop culture gags,"Ted is a film that if you didn't know it was headed by Seth MacFarlane, you would after about five minutes if that. The premise about a Teddy Bear growing up and living with a man is one that has been utilised very well. It does not hide from the fact that it is a very silly premise and does in fact celebrate it. Where the film has its weakness is where the humour is almost too synonymous with MacFarlane. A deluge of 80's nostalgia and pop culture gags reach the forefront of the film. If you do not like this sort of humour where there are references galore, some of which are a little too in your face and out of place. It depends on the patience you have for these pop culture gags. In Family Guy they can be prone to becoming severely out of place and too random to be funny. In Ted though they are, at least for MacFarlane kept in moderation. The leads in Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis do very well and seem completely natural in parts that would be difficult to play otherwise. Wahlberg especially stands out and gets just as funny as Ted himself. Ted (voiced by MacFarlane) is of course the stand out character, his only flaw is possibly that his behaviour is too predictable at times, regardless he is very funny and does actually provide many laugh out loud moments. Plot wise it takes very predictable turns but its just a fun comedy and I anyway at least got over the fact relatively quickly. The film is funny, its key weakness is just that the humour is effectively very concentrated.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Da Bear!,"Here are the bear facts: The comedy ""Ted"" is quite a treat, and it's one of the best ""laugh-out-loud"" comedies of 2012. Director Seth MacFarlane's concept of a raunchy talking bear is something that might sound silly on paper, but it's quite amusing on screen. ""Ted"" stars Mark Wahlberg as John Bennett, a Bostonian who as a result of a childhood wish, caused his toy bear Ted to come to life; too bad he did not have a Bikini Barbie. Consequently, the talking bear Ted becomes an instant celebrity as a result that he is a talking bear. John and Ted become best buddies throughout John's childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. John and Ted do all those things that guys do with their toy bears like smoke pot, rent hookers, get drunk, and talk smack. Lori, John's girlfriend of four years, gets impatient when she continuously observes that John is not willing to mature into a matrimony state mainly because of his man-child behavior with Ted. So therefore, John and Ted's friendship is put to the test. I will not divulge more on the ""Ted"" narrative because it is something you have to see for yourself; if you have not already. But let me tell you this in in a flash, the 70's sci- fi remake of ""Flash Gordon"" and its star Sam J. Jones play an important part in ""Ted"". Again, you just have to see for yourself, if you can bear controlling the laughter of this uproarious inclusion. ""Ted"" is MacFarlane's baby, and he excels in his hilarious scribe of the picture and his pinpoint direction; and I should also voice to you that he voices Ted riotously. Wahlberg proves again that he can depart from drama to comedy with ease in his performance as John. Mila Kunis was efficient in her work as Lori. And by the way, Mila could bear hug me any time! Like that's going to happen! But it was Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones, yes Sam J. Jones, who came out of nowhere to deliver the top ""far out"" performance of the picture. ""Ted"" delivers the bear necessities for a comedy to shine, so give it a bear chance. ***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Okay, but slim","Ted is an okay movie. Some of the jokes are really hilarious and in a peculiarly intelligent manner. Seth McFarlane's humor is really one of a kind and his easy approach towards movie-making is something that is worth appreciating. He's just consequently himself without all the BS and that's very refreshing. Ted has a few downsides though. Some of it only got clear to me a few hours after seeing the movie and realizing how kind of forgettable the whole thing is. This might be due to the fact that the script is not particularly rich in content. Compressing character development into feature film length might be unfamiliar territory for McFarlane and most of the characters are pretty slim, with the female lead appearing particularly one dimensional. Joel McHale's character and the promising antagonists of the movie fall unfairly short too and the movie really could have used a lot more work on them. This is especially frustrating seeing so much empty space throughout the movie just screaming for ideas to be inserted and one gets the feeling that McFarlane just didn't really try too hard all together, kind of disrespecting his devoted fanbase. Also, the moral standpoint of the movie was a bit unclear to me and could have been worked out more. I'm not saying that it couldn't have done without one, but if you do have a position and you center a whole plot around it, please make it at least a clear one. Also McFarlane is not a professional director. Considering that, he does an OK job, but it's really not Spielberg.All together, Ted is not a bad movie by any means and it's kind of lovely, with a lot of good jokes. It's just a bit slim, especially for it's premise.For the same concept Simon Pegg/Nick Frost vehicle Paul comes to mind as a much more profound movie.5/10",,Anonymous,Comedy

A teddy bear with an attitude...,"Initially I had expected a bit more from ""Ted"" in the sense that the movie didn't really cause me to have all that many laughs throughout the entire feature. Sure, there were some great moments here and there, but they were far apart.Now, don't get me wrong, because ""Ted"" is not a bad movie, far from it. It is actually a quite good movie. It has a nice storyline that will appeal to both a younger and a more mature audience. Plus it really helps that the CGI animation of Ted himself was really amazing. All throughout the movie, he was real and life-like, which was really important to make a movie like this work.Plus they had also cast some good people to fill out the roles for the various roles in the movie, and Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis actually had some good on-screen chemistry and that worked out quite nicely. But again, the animation of Ted and his entire personality was really the fuel that made the movie run so well. And it was also nice to see Ryan Reynolds make a small appearance in that role as he did. And it was also nice to see Sam J. Jones in the movie. I don't actually think I've seen him since ""Flash Gordon"", at least not that I can recall.For a comedy, then ""Ted"" really didn't fully deliver the goods. The story was solid, good and well executed, but it just lacked that one-step-beyond comedy that would have made the movie explosive. Personally, I had to look far for the laughters in the movie.

What if this was a friend who was only alive because you wished him to be? What would you do?John Benett was a lonely little boy with no friends living in Brockton, Massachusetts in 1985. Then, on Christmas morning, he received a plush teddy bear he called Ted. One night, lying in bed, John wished Ted would come to life. That wish came true thanks to a star falling from the sky while John was making it. Ted came to life shocking John, his parents, and the world at large. But by 2012, no one cares. John (now played by Mark Wahlberg) is working at a car rental agency and has been dating Lori (played by Mila Kunis) for 4 years. Ted (now voiced by Seth MacFarlane) shares an apartment with Lori and John but makes no contribution to the household expenses, entertains prostitutes in the living room, and rushes into bed with John and Lori during thunderstorms as they still terrify both him and John. Eventually, Lori can't take anymore and tells John that Ted must find a job and a place of his own.Now, I am not a fan of Family Guy and I've never watched any of MacFarlane's other, less popular series. The most popular shows on Fox all seem to follow the same formula. One or two smart characters surrounded by idiots. In Family Guy, the smart characters would be Brian and Stewie. In The Simpsons, the only smart character I can think of is Lisa. That aside, Ted is a hilarious film. Not particularly intelligent, mind you, but what were you expecting from a movie about a teddy bear brought to life by a wish on a falling star? Shakespeare? I won't say it's perfect; it isn't. I will say it was worth the price. See it.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Really depends on whether you like Family Guy or not (SPOILER),"The plot here centers around a bear that magically came to life due to the wish of a young boy. After a brief introduction where we see this bear be a celebrity and the world be captivated by him, we jump forward in time where the world has gotten used to it and life has gone on and now the boy and his bear are still friends but friends that some week, work in low-level jobs and try to get their lives together. In terms of plotting this is focused on the relationship between John and Lori in regard how Ted messes it up – it is a very simple plot that allows for lots of crude yet funny escapades along the way. A sub-plot about another family who wants the bear seems to exist solely to provide a dramatic conclusion and doesn't really fit.This very simple plot means that the film will stand or fall based on the viewer's sense of humor. If you like Family Guy with its non-PC characters, crude tone and constant reference points then the film will more than likely work for you, if not then it probably won't. The reason for this is because the wit and humor is very specific; it is unfair to suggest it is not intelligent just because it is crude, but it is worth saying that this isn't Woody Allen any more than it is as basic as pratfalls or fart jokes. The majority of the jokes come from the creation of Ted – specifically that he is a teddy bear who says terrible things, does drugs and hangs out with hookers – it is a simple character in that regard and the humor follows that pattern. The delivery is what makes it work though.MacFarlane may be rather one-note, but that note is a good one. His writing and delivery of lines is generally very funny and it is telling that I never even once thought about what a good ""special effect"" Ted was (although he is) because I was too busy thinking of him as a character. Wahlberg also deserves a lot of credit; as daft as the film is or as demeaning as some of his performance is, he always goes with it and his performance with his invisible co-star is really good whether it is in dialogue scenes or in the more physical scenes. Likewise Kunis goes with it really well and manages to do enough to carry the actual plot while also helping the comedy.It isn't a brilliant film though and even fans of MacFarlane will acknowledge there are bits that don't work or that really force the point. For example as a child of the era, I loved the Flash Gordon references and the silly extent to which it takes them, but mostly it wasn't particularly smart so much as it was wonderfully silly and as a result I imagine many others will see it as tiresomely silly. The plot is simplistic and messy, the humor is mostly crude and the references are generally heavy, but it had me laughing and the performances from the lead three are all strong as they ""get it"" and their delivery really helps the whole thing hang together.",,Anonymous,Comedy
"Tonally uneven, but totally hilarious.","Seth MacFarlane is one unique comical voice, and he brings his Family Guy-like formula to his first feature, Ted. A movie about a bear who swears, smokes weed, and makes frequent crude remarks has serious potential. And that is why Ted deserves to be seen: It is flat out hilarious. Tonally uneven, and overly familiar, but still hilarious with hardly a dull moment. The movie provides some golden antics, especially between Mark Wahlberg and MacFarlane (playing Ted through motion capture). The delightful pop culture references are also tickling, none the least of which was an homage to John Williams' legendary march from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Joel McHale and Giovanni Ribisi provide their own laughs in supporting roles, Patrick Stewart gives a droll narration, while Norah Jones provides a couple of jazzy original songs. With his comedic resources, and a possibly stronger screenplay, you can only hope that MacFarlane will make something even better the second time he releases a movie.***1/2 / *****",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Family Guy humour actually works on live action,"I laughed pretty hard throughout the entire film. So that should tell you it's worth watching.So yeah straight to the point, I had no clue that Family Guy's humour could actually translate so well into live action. The cutaway gags, pop culture references, the non sequitors, the New England backdrop it all works here.The character Ted to me is a cross between Peter and Brian Griffin. He's like Brian because he's this little fuzzy thing you're not supposed to take serious but you do. And he's like Peter because, you know... the voice.The film doesn't revolve around Ted as much as it revolves around Mark Wahlberg's character and his relationship with Mila Kunis who are both very likable.If you like Family Guy or just have a really good sense of humour this is for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Gordon's Alive! DROP DEAD FRED ramped up by a thousand,"Very funny, I have not laughed so much for a very long time and that was even before the salute of FLASH GORDON kicks in with a cameo from Sam J. Jones. Remember 'Drop Dead Fred', the crazy imaginary friend of Pheobe Cates who caused all sorts of mischief, well TED is real and TED is a party animal, literally. He drinks, smokes, dances with hookers and has never left the side of his best (thunder) buddy played by Mark Wahlberg. As time goes by Mark and his amazing girlfriend played by Mila Kunis want to live alone without TED. Havoc erupts creating some amusing scenes not soon forgotten. TED is a comedy that the recent debacle starring Adam Sandler 'That's my Boy' failed to be, edgy, unique and most importantly, funny. See this now, Go Flash Go.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Could have been so much better, Seth!","I couldn't agree more about this film being overrated. I'm a huge fan of Seth MacFarlane, but I get more chuckles in 20 minutes of Family Guy than I did from this entire movie. If it weren't for the teddy bear with the foul language and sick sense of humor (which I love), it would be another boring ""guy in love, pisses off girl, and wins her back"" story. Seth's humor is usually more thought provoking, and no doubt stifled into mainstream slapstick here by the film studio and/or other powers that be. I wasn't expecting too much from Mark Wahlberg, since in my opinion he is a very one-dimensional actor who happens to be cast in excellent roles. I did, however, expect more from Teddy, who could have benefited from more creative use of the CG technology, and a little more ""tongue-in-cheek"" humor as opposed to the gratuitous and crude slapstick doled out here. The novelty of a foul mouthed teddy bear wore off for me within 20 minutes, leaving nothing but an ""after school special"" caliber plot. The fight scene between the teddy bear and Wahlberg was pretty f***ing funny, though.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Laugh Out Loud comedy returns!,"I had read some of the early reviews of Ted, and it mostly got good write- ups. So I went to see it with my wife and best mate. Being a Family Guy fan for years (and thus a Seth McFarlane fan) I was expecting a lot. And I can say I wasn't disappointed - far from it! It was refreshingly different, funny, unique and clever. The CGI was fantastic (you forgot Ted as all CGI and thought he was just a character in the movie) and Mark Wahlberg (of whom I am not really a fan) did a surprisingly good job of pulling off the character in the movie. With some extremely memorable funny bits, (especially the ThunderBuddies song), I look forward to seeing this movie again..... and again...... and again.. :) Seth McFarlane, you are one seriously funny, talented dude!

the great 10 out of ten 2 out of ten roller-coaster ride.,"I'm not going to dwell on this .Ted is so funny you actually have to look behind you to check if anyone else in the cinema is actually phoning the police to report you for having thoughts that are a) illegal b) illegal c) socially unacceptable d) sick e) illegal f) perverse.The good news though is that between the bits where it is so funny that you should actually hand yourself in for treatment/counselling it's really rather dull.So as the film progresses you're like ""this is a ten man"" to ""this is a two man"" (ah, only if you are sad as me that I think in IMDb mode at every movie I ever see.So it's like 10, 2, 10, 2, 2, 2, 9, 5, 10, 2, 2, 2, 10, 9, 2, 2, all the way through and the average of that is about 6 so I'll give it a 7.It's really funny (but boring).",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Excellent Laugh Out Loud Funny Movie,"I saw this film earlier today with my friends, and I thought it was absolutely hilarious. Maybe it's because I love Family Guy so much but I found it thoroughly enjoying.Moreover it wasn't just me that found this funny the cinema was packed with people who were laughing out loud and it even got to the point when you couldn't hear the next line in the film. Which, even though sometimes could be annoying, really was a credit to Seth McFarlane's first feature length film.I believe the storyline was good enough for a comedy film like this I mean it is about a 35 year old man who is still emotionally attached to his teddy bear so you know its not exactly going to be Shawshank Redemption, however throughout the entire film the comic timing was perfect.Overall I would definitely recommend you watch this film, and for all Family Guy fans it's a must see.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ted - A Review by Brandon Krzysztof,"""Ted"" is a slap stick comedy by Seth MacFarlane that asks how far can a little boys wish go. It also asks how far can a comedy go in terms of crudeness. After one box office success, 21 Jump Street, and one failure, That's My Boy. Let's see if Ted can bring back crude comedy to the top of the box office this week and for weeks to come.When John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) was a little boy, he received a stuffed teddy bear for Christmas and upon receiving it he wishes that his new bear could come alive and talk in real life. When his wish is granted, his new friend Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) comes alive and they share a bond that they will share forever. John is now 35 years old and Ted, now a celebrity, is still around and living with John. Now John has to balance his life between his job, fun with Ted, and his girlfriend (Mila Kunis) and encounters tons of road blocks in making his life balanced.This being Seth MacFarlane first live action film, I thought the camera shots he used were very good and the comedy was laugh out loud hilarious. MacFarlane's voice work is amazing, even similar to Peter Griffin (Family Guy), his voice went well with Ted's personality and demeanor. Mark Wahlberg was gold in this movie and did a good job acting, especially in scenes with Ted, who was a CGI generated bear. The comedy in this movie was vulgar, grotesque, and racist; but this being a Seth MacFarlane feature the audience should be expecting that. The film had a good pace; it never seemed slow. Near the last third of the movie, the film did a little genre change. It went from crude comedy, then a little bit drama, and then near the end there was a cool little action adventure sequence.Even though I prefer comedies that aren't vulgar and crude, this one was definitely worth price of admission. It was hilarious on all counts. I think there are jokes in here that can be offensive to any type of person, but you knowing Seth MacFarlane you shouldn't be surprised. This is one of the best comedies of the year up there along with 21 Jump Street. This film had everyone rolling. Highly recommended.4 out of 5 stars.bkstaReviews.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

If your the type of person that doesn't like movies with bad language, alcohol, sex and drugs then maybe you don't want to see this movie. Other than that this movie is great from start to finish. It has good acting, a good storyline and just flat out hilarious. This has to be the funniest movie I've seen since horrible bosses. One thing is for sure I wouldn't go taking any children to this movie, don't let the cute teddy bear fool you.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Tigers play too rough, but not as rough as Ted","Greetings again from the darkness. Upon watching the trailer, it would be easy and understandable to simply write off this movie as a ridiculous piece of junk produced merely to capitalize on the popularity of Seth MacFarlane (Family Guy creator). That would be a mistake. While much of what Ted has to say will burn your ears, the insight that goes into his lines is often unmistakeably brilliant.The movie opens with terrific narration from Patrick Stewart. It's done in A Christmas Story style, only with a caustic and deadpan irreverence that will jolt you before the opening credits have even rolled. We learn the story of 9 year old John Bennett, a social outcast who receives a teddy bear for Christmas. First, what parent buys their 9 year old a teddy bear??? Anyway, that night, under the covers, young John wishes that he and Ted could be lifelong friends. In the morning, he awakes to find a sweet, lively teddy who startles everyone.The talking bear becomes an instant celebrity and is even booked on the Johnny Carson show ... the first of many 1980's pop culture references. As in the case of Corey Feldman (pointed out by the narrator), celebrity often fades. Flash forward 25 years and John and Ted are living together with John's girlfriend (Mila Kunis). The boys spend most of their time smoking pot and watching TV re-runs and worshiping the 1980 Flash Gordon cult movie. It's a typical man-child existence except that one of them is a vile, 4 letter-word spewing teddy bear, and there is no logical reason that the beautiful Kunis hasn't walked away from the four year relationship with the hapless loser John.Mr. MacFarlane's true talent lies in laughing at our societal norms and encouraging us to laugh at ourselves. He does this through Stewie, the pet dog on Family Guy, and now here with a talking teddy bear. He holds little back in ripping our obsession with celebrity or our clinical anxiety towards all things Politically Correct. Luckily the same rules don't apply for talking teddies, so we hear things that we aren't even allowed to think. Because he can, MacFarlane mixes in his love of the 80's with numerous references and we even get odd cameos from Tom Skerritt, Nora Jones and Ryan Reynolds. The most bizarre reference takes up a substantial part of the movie ... Sam Jones, the star of Flash Gordon, appears as an aged party animal, teaching the boys some new tricks. Most of this will be dead time to those unfamiliar with the 1980 movie ... and evidently none of us have been impacted by it like MacFarlane.The movie is a mash-up of John Waters, Bad Santa, Jackass and just about every stereotypical slacker-buddy movie from the past 25 years. It's all of that and none of that at the same time. Depending on your viewpoint, Ted is either a crass, irreverent, totally inappropriate waste of movie time, or it's a comical, insightful observation on where we are as a society right now. Only you can decide ... just please don't take your kids.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Pathetic movie,"I watched this movie after i saw the rating on IMDb . I must say i am thoroughly disappointed with the movie. It makes no sense and even if the fantasy could be imagined, the plot and story was more or less same to many other romantic movies. Only Mila Kunis was worth watching in this. The teddy bear speaking looks hilarious and miles away from making some sense. I was really bored watching it.The genre is listed as comedy which is more hilarious than the actual scenes in this movie. It is not a comedy folks. SO watch this at your own peril.Overall i should say , please don't waste your time watching this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Still funnier than Pitch Perfect,"Ted is A Family Guy Fans dream. Its a feature length film filled with fun characters played by the actors of family guy, what more could you ask for? The feel to the film is a lot like a long episode of family guy: Ted is often a slow witted but comedic guy, a lot like Peter Griffin. I find it fitting how they're voiced by the same guy. There's a lot of swearing, drinking, silly humor, profanity, and sexual content, much like an unrated family guy episode. The characters even seem to originate from family guy. There's John who is like an older version of Stewie, with Ted being Ruebert the Bear. Lori is like Lois, and her boss is like Quagmire or Brian, constantly after her. There's a creepy fat kid who is like a mix of Chris and the Jewish kid, and his father is like Mort. But it is still original and Seth MacFarlane does a good job at directing a feature length film. Unfortanatley I've seen a lot of reviews for this movie that don't appreciate its crude and slap stick comedy, but fans like me consider it to be one of the funniest movies ever made, so i say check it out.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
What a load of rubbish!,"After all the TV hype about the upcoming release of Ted, I was eagerly looking forward to seeing it. What a huge let-down!I can't blame this on cultural differences and simply say that American humour is different because I frequently laugh my socks off at Two-and- a-half Men and The Big Bang Theory on TV. Considering the inordinately high overall rating that this film has on IMDb I can only assume that it's me because I don't think I even smiled (let alone laughed!) once during it. The whole concept was ridiculous (is THAT funny?). Like, would the whole adult world happily accept a talking, walking, dope- smoking stuffed Teddy bear? Is this an indication of the world's mentality in 2012? I sure hope not!I honestly think that, in years to come, Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis and, perhaps most of all, Patrick Stewart will deeply regret ever having anything to do with this load of utter crap! They are both excellent actors and I find it hard to believe that they were so hard up financially that they needed the work. I note with particular interest that Mark has no less than five post-Ted movies - and Mila has six - in various stages of production so I wonder what on earth made them demean themselves with this. It's almost like prostitution of their art and talents!I believe there is a difference between realistic expletive language (like when the story centres around working men or underworld criminal gangs) but the gratuitous profanity in this film has no usefulness whatsoever unless, of course, it makes those of limited intelligence laugh - but do our filmmakers need to pander to this sort of audience? I guess it all comes down to who spends the most at the box-office. (more prostitution!)Basically, the story-line is absolute rubbish and an insult to the intelligence, the plot and dialogue are NOT the least bit funny and the romantic aspect defies belief. Mila should have run a mile the day she first learned about Ted and never come back!As usual, I stuck it out to the bitter end, because I am the eternal optimist and live in hope that something enjoyable will develop (as often happens in movies that start out a bit slowly or stupidly) but, in the case of Ted, I wish I had ejected it after the first five minutes! That's over an hour-and-a-half of my life I'll never get back! Sorry, I cannot recommend this movie for any reason - there isn't even any nice scenery in it!",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Ted has entertainment value thanks to the incredible chemistry and funny jokes,"How could a movie about a slacker and his teddy bear be this funny and so good? It's because of the comedy genius Seth MacFarlane. He produced, wrote and directed this fine film. Ted does everything well regarding how a black-comedy should be as its visually funny and also the strongest is its jokes. Seth MacFarlane made sure the cast had great chemistry and got the right actors to play the parts. Mark Wahlberg and Seth MacFarlane is of course those that stand out the most as they are the leading actors, I could never see anyone else play the roles than them.Another thing I thought was great was the choice of music, great dramatic scores and some really good songs from well-known musicians. It fit the overall style of the movie and made it funny even more funny. The writing is great in terms of the jokes and likeable characters but suffers from a not so original story but it has its charm, for those who goes in expecting a great and deep story you'll probably not be super interested. The story is simple and serves two purposes, having funny jokes that makes us laugh and to tell the story of this man and his teddy bear. It's entertaining!After watching it now for the third time I have to say I understand much more of the references and inside jokes that Seth has, and that makes me appreciate the comedy much more. First time was I too little to understand much of the jokes and its target is the more mature audience and that made me enjoy the jokes much more the second and now third time watching this masterpiece of a comedy film.

Depends if you like Macfarlane's humour or not!,"Even the most sophisticated of people can have their immature days. Their isn't a soul out there who doesn't have a childish materialistic possession or hobby. Ted (mostly) shows how difficult is to part with it... via a talking bear. Wahlberg's character John Bennett is more man-child than sensible adult. On one side his (often) lovable fuzz-ball best friend Ted (Seth Macfarlane) is a bad influence on him. On the other side his girlfriend of four years (Mila Kunis) wants them to move further in their relationship. Ted's story is about friendship and how far that friendship can be pushed to the limit, and push others away. Wahlberg's a funny front-man, (he proved how comical he can be in The Other Guys), Seth Macfarlane has more difficulty conveying jokes through the animated toy. Thankfully most soar. There's a lot of filler jokes to bulk up the running time, and the humour can be crass, rude and often bawdy. Being a fan of Macfarlane's popular adult-cartoon Family Guy helps, but understandably his humour isn't for everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

family ted,"Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane's debut feature is crass and sexist. It wallows in nostalgia, flirts with racism, spends too much time scampering after a plot. It's also the funniest film of 2012. A raucous insult to good taste and good sense that warps the template of the American boy-man comedy into horrible new shapes.Ted – a cuddly toy bear brought to life after a wish upon a star – is a miracle turned sour. The public got bored of sentient ""Teddy"". He's become a grizzled former celebrity – a tired little weed-smoking, beer-swilling teddy bear. He spends his days on the sofa, distracting his childhood buddy John (Mark Wahlberg) from committing to his girlfriend, Lori (Mila Kunis).It's been said that MacFarlane will aim his vicious wit at anyone except the white middle-class male. But Ted is as much about the frustrated nature of wastrels like John as it is a showcase for the world view of a gratuitously obscene teddy bear. MacFarlane makes it clear – after all the cruel jokes and bitchy asides – that John isn't happy, hasn't been for a long time. And Ted's the reason. John starts to see Ted for what he is: a weary Boston meat head, made funnier and sadder for being trapped in the body of a children's toy. It's in the dissolution of their long-term friendship that the film really bites.If you need to intellectualize your enjoyment of MacFarlane's comedy further, you could point to the tragedy of Ted's ageless existence. Or the director's skewering of a society that so quickly tires of an anthropomorphic teddy bear. Or you could just laugh until your stitches burst at a whacked-out cuddly toy extolling the merits of a strain of weed called ""They're coming! They're coming!"" i did.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Fun for the first time but forgettable the second time,"The story of the movie sounded interesting and honestly at the first half I was expecting to have a great time, and I did had a good time, but it was more like good-meh time. My biggest problem with the movie is that I don't get most of the jokes because they are references. I may be too young or whatever but even the references I understood ween't that funny and I actually never laughed out loud at any moment and considering it's a comedy, it dissapointed me. But for the other part, the story isn't bad is just a bro movie where you know how things are gonna go and that's how they happened. At the end I think that it was a good movie that could have been a lot better if jokes weren't mostly references, but still, if you watch it, you can enjoy it enough to leave you with a good taste.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I was a little disappointed by the ending because it left me feeling that there might be a sequel (God I hope not)... Mila Kunis played her role very well and I do have to say that this is a rather OK performance for Wahlberg.Overall it's not worth the allotted time, it's disappointing.

Ted...3 out of 4 Skittles,"First things first...the concept of Ted is completely ridiculous. That being said...Ted is also completely hilarious. Writer/Director/Actor Seth MacFarlane, best know as the creative force behind the TV animated hits Family Guy, American Dad and The Cleveland Show, brings the same kind of humor to his feature film debut. Jokes that offend everyone from all walks of life and expected and delivered.Although Ted is a walking talking teddy bear, MacFarlane's script keeps the story grounded in the real world, which actually makes it more realistic and believable then the recent comedy duds That's My Boy and The Dictator.Mark Walhberg (The Fighter, Boogie Nights) and Mila Kunis (Black Swan, Friends With Benefits) form a strong basis for MacFarlane to bring the cuddly little Peter Griffin'esche title character to life. And major props have to go to Giovanni Ribisi playing the awesomely creepy stalker who plots to steal Ted away for his own son. His gut-busting scene where he sexually dances by himself in front of his TV to a 1980's Debbie Gibson music video while drinking apple juice through a straw is one of the funniest in recent memory.Parents beware...if for some reason you think this would be a funny movie to bring the kids to...think again. Ted curses like a sailor, smokes pot and bangs hookers. If this seems like a movie you want to enjoy with your children then the Parent of the Year award went out the window for you a long time ago. If you don't let your kids watch Family Guy, then you won't want them to see Ted.If anyone could make a funny movie out of a teddy bear that has come to life, I'm glad it was MacFarlane who attempted, and not someone at the Disney cheese factory. Now that he has a taste at feature films it's excited to see what he will come up with next.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
waste of time,"this is my first review so bear with me here (no pun intended)...i usually seem to have quite some overlap with roger ebert in terms of movie taste but what he saw in this, i really don't understand. for me it had a lot going for it, i like mila kunis and mark wahlberg and the trailer looked promising but man, was i disappointed! i found the dialogue incredibly crude and uninspired, the plot moronic and predictable but worst of all (it IS a comedy or at least tries to be), it's not funny at all. and i mean not at all. i do enjoy silliness and brainless comedy and am not objected to explicit language whatsoever but again it should serve the intended purpose. which is to entertain (laughed until i cried in pineapple express for example). i did not feel entertained by Ted but rather bored and annoyed. so in my opinion - EPIC FAIL!",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"it was good, seen better","""As the result of a childhood wish, John Bennett's teddy bear, Ted, came to life and has been by John's side ever since - a friendship that's tested when Lori, John's girlfriend of four years, wants more from their relationship."" let's see, for me, It was a good movie & funny, the bear was so cute...aww..the Only bad thing for ME was that it was VERY vulgar & FULL of dirty humor (not really my style) but if you're into that you'll love it! a little's OK for me but when you have so much it becomes stupid & raunchy in my opinion & no longer funny. It does feature drug use but then again you could find that in a wide variety of movies not to mention TV shows so that's almost the norm.

Not Great but enjoyable comedy film,"This movie is about a boy who wishes for his teddy bear to come alive and be his best friend. When I heard of this movie, I thought it was the perfect storyline for a kids' movie like Stuart Little. But when I watched two clips of this movie on the internet, I got excited as it was made as an adult comedy film. I have procrastinated to watch this movie for a long. Here I am, finally watched it.This movie mostly deals with how Ted impacts John's relationship with his girlfriend, Lori. It's a good portrayal of how Ted is wasted 24x7, and it bothers no one. No one expects Ted to be responsible or serious because he is just a Teddy bear. There are some scenes in this movie where Ted gets away after doing inappropriate things because he is a cute toy and no one is bothered about it. But on the other hand, John expects to man up as he is aged and he can't behave like a boy as Ted can remain the same year after year.Even though it has a nice storyline and the potential to have a nice character arc for both Ted and John, it failed as a movie to be complete. Due to focusing more on adult joke scenes, they failed to give a good character arc on how Ted and John resolve their problems and finally become grownups. The subplot where Ted is kidnapped and made Lori have a change of heart but must need to be worked on.The actors did a great job. Ted's CGI was good though. Seth should have tried some different approach as it mostly reminds me of his Family Guy show style of comedy and commenting on actors and real events. The climax was typically cliche, as in most films, as the highly loved character dies and comes back alive.Overall, This is hilarious with adult jokes but with some flaws. Some may find it offensive, but I enjoyed most of the film. I rated it six only because of the lack of story and character arc.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarious!!!,"Ted (2012) is a hilarious, irreverent comedy that delivers non-stop laughs from start to finish. Mark Wahlberg shines as John, a slacker with a heart of gold, perfectly complemented by Seth MacFarlane's foul-mouthed, lovable teddy bear, Ted. The chemistry between the two is electric, blending crude humor with surprising warmth. MacFarlane's sharp writing and direction keep the pacing tight, while the supporting cast- including Mila Kunis,adds depth to the chaos. It's a bold, unapologetic romp that turns a childhood fantasy into a wild, adult adventure. A must-watch for fans of edgy humor!!!!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"""A combination of funny episodes combined together without giving it a form of story.""","The film is adorable because of the talking bear. And this is alone a reason to watch it. No need to go to the theaters. The DVD will also give the same pleasure. The story is average. You should not expect anything more than laughter which for many is genuine. The adult talk that he does in the entire film was hilarious. The story is about a boy who wished for a talking teddy on a Christmas night and he got it. Than starts a normal journey of a person who has this talking teddy ever since which makes him special. Nothing happening in his life is so interesting or worth watching but of course the teddy makes him interesting. For most of the time it looked that the adult talks and funny moments were chunks in the film and were inserted forcefully without actually making the film interesting. But nevertheless those were laughable. It seems like the director could not forget his 20 minutes south park episodes, and was bound to insert these short clips at places without making much effort towards progressing the story. Never felt, that I was watching a film. It looked as if it was a number of pages of an adult comic book. In the field of acting, everyone performed very nicely and the voice of Ted given by Seth Macfarlane was awesome. Mila kunis however didn't have much to show.VERDICT: ""A hilarious adult comedy film.""",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
most uninspiring film ever,"I am sorry that I have to give a one, but this movie is such a underachiever. Most boring and predictable plot and despite the rough language - which I am not offended by- the plot plays out like a happy ever after fairy tale. That was not even necessary, this movie isn't for kids anyway. I did not laugh a single time. There are no funny situations or jokes. I have expected a lot more from the creative maker of family guy. TED is a cool individual, but the makers failed to create an innovative Persona.The acting wasn't too bad, but the cast was a bit off. Is Mark Wahlberg your typical loser guy who gets picked on? They should have picked someone less muscular. I can eventually understand if someone is giving 5 points, but 'best movie 2012'? Seriously, those remarks are faked by the production companies.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarious!,"This film is absolutely gut-busting funny, even though it has its emotional and sad moments, it is always broken with the comedy.Seth MacFarlane did a fantastic job with this film. He really proved that not only can he make hilarious adult cartoons, but also make very funny movies that actually have a good message to it.I'm pretty sure that a lot of people went into this movie thinking that it would only be filled with sexual and inappropriate jokes(Which it does have a lot of), but the film actually has a very good message. It shows you how complicated life can be at times, and how hard it can be when your in a relationship. Also it shows you how sometimes friends can hold you back from moving on with your life, and that everyone needs to grow up and not act immature all the time.Even though it has a good message, the movie is extremely funny. I came out of the theatre saying: ""finally a comedy that is actually funny"" i'm not going to give away any of the scenes because I really don't want to spoil it. This film really does not disappoint. But if you are easily offended I wouldn't watch this movie, because there are a few jokes in this film that may offend people. But if you have a great sense of humour you won't take it to heart.The film is also narrated by Patrick Stewart, and I must say he did a good job. He has a great narration voice, and even the narration is hilarious because Patrick Steward even says funny things that will have you in knots laughing.I can't express enough how funny this movie is. All I can say is go see this movie, you will not be disappointed this film will actually make you laugh.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Not Great, Not Bad. Just Alright","While there really isn't anything wrong with Ted, there isn't anything that great about it either. For his first film, Seth MacFarlane did a good job, but he's still got a lot to learn as a director. The film feels very much like his material and some scenes felt exactly like a live action episode of Family Guy. Mark Wahlberg did a good job in his role and MacFarlane and I really enjoyed the character of Ted. He really carries the movie and the scenes without him on screen really seemed to go by a bit slow. As for the comedy in the film, there are plenty of funny scenes, but most of them deliver on a level of chuckles instead of big laughs. That's not to say the film doesn't deliver some laughs at points, but not as many as it should. The one thing that did kinda bug me about this film was it's constant references to the 80's. Some of them such as the references to Flash Gordon were funny, but the film relied way too heavily on them and some of them felt forced. I also felt the film was a bit too long and could've easily been 15 minutes shorter. Overall, Ted isn't as good as it could've been, but there really isn't anything wrong with it that will keep you from enjoying it either. It's much better than the new episodes of Family Guy, but there's much funnier films that have come out this year such as 21 Jump Street.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ted is - like the movie title all ready gives you away - comedy which has no imagination.,"This is my first movie review ever and not even a real one, because I watched only 20 minutes from the beginning.Maybe I'm wrong, but I have a feeling that this movie is going to be a one of those stories about a guy and a friend where guy has to grow up and leave all his boyish BS behind in order to enjoy ""normal life"". In other words, marry a girl and take mortgage.Ted is a symbol of that boyish BS. Ted is probably going to get drunk, use bad language, talk dirty to the girls and at the end or at least in some point, stand in the way of a marriage.Humor in this movie is probably going to evolve around the holy triangle of bad comedies : sex, drugs and bad language.If you find those themes endlessly hilarious, this is probably movie for you.For me the humor was too forced and not funny at all.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"TED, hilarious and rude but heartwarming","I just came back from watching the movie TED. Expecting a lot from reviews and trailers, my hopes were high, and i got what i paid for. TED was both outrageously funny and had meaning.John (Mark Wahlberg) lives with his girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) and childhood teddy bear Ted (voiced by Seth McFarlane). TED is about John and Ted's friendship as it is but to the ultimate test; John must chose; the love of his life or his best friend?Now, yes the plot was a bit silly but it made up for it with its jokes and humor. Everyone in my cinema was laughing from beginning till end.Yes the humor was very offensive, racist, derogatory, and vulgar and this is DEFIANTLY NOT a kids movie, but it was very very funny, McFarlane, the legendary creator of Family Guy, is know for these sorts of mind less jokes of religion, race and sexuality but that is his style, and in a motion picture like this it really worked.I thought that Joel McHale was very very funny and stole every scene he was in and Patrick Wahburton was absolutely hilarious as well, both very well casted.TED is shockingly rude and hilarious, and i sometimes wondered about the mind less use of drugs in this movie, but hey it was the funniest movie I've seen in a long time.

Crude crowd-pleaser.,"From the creator of Family Guy comes one of the crudest comedies of the year, but not necessarily the funniest. When bullied kid John Bennett wishes his teddy bear would come to life, it does, and subsequently becomes a celebrity in the process. Three decades on, Ted (voiced by Seth MacFarlane himself) is a pot-smoking, foul-mouthed wash-up who keeps the now 35 year old John (a very game Mark Whalberg) from growing up, much to the chagrin of extremely patient girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis). The jokes come thick and fast and when they score, they really score; however there are a few clunkers present too. For every side-splitting sexual innuendo gag at the local supermarket, a can't-believe-that-just-happened knockout of a kid or a hilarious Ryan Reynolds cameo, there is an unfunny 'thunder song', a lame fight with an Asian man or a misguided fart joke right around the corner. Having said that, a magical teddy swearing like a trooper is essentially always comedy gold and MacFarlane rides the wave as much as possible – even if his very recognisable voice is a slight distraction, as one drunken in-joke slyly acknowledges – delivering a crowd-pleaser that will surely strike big at the box office.",,Anonymous,Comedy
How can this be rated higher than  Wedding Crashers?,"Ted is a pretty funny movie, but it is by no means justified a rating in the high 7's. Going by what other comedies are rated, this deserves a 6.2 or so. It is of course predictable, and it makes you laugh out loud for about 15 minutes or so. What makes a great comedy? To me it is having classic lines that you and your friends will be talking about for years. Thats what happened with Wedding Crashers, Old School, Happy Gilmore, etc. This isn't in the league of those; and therefore I would like to see its rating settle down in the 6's. IMDb seems to have every other genre of movies rated correctly outside of Comedy. I don't see why people have such differing opinions and senses of humor.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
You might like it if you like Family Guy,"I hemmed and hawed for five minutes before going in to see this movie. I hadn't heard anything about it, and the poster made it look like a children's movie. However, I didn't want to wait too long for the next film and I noticed Seth MacFarlane had directed it -- so I took the plunge.For the first 20 minutes I was worried I had made a mistake. The only other person in the theatre was a kid. Then the movie took a strange direction and gradually morphed into a Family Guy kind of film. (It took me a few years to warm to Family Guy, but I'm at the point now where the oddball humour entertains me somewhat. And there are times when the show is brilliant, especially in scenes involving the Stewie character.)I'm afraid however that I did not really fully appreciate most of the writing and humour in this film. I just didn't find it that witty or funny. The gratuitously offensive jokes and the toilet humour fell flat for me. It was supposed to be irreverent, but much of it just seemed stupid. Perhaps I was in the wrong mood.However, I did enjoy the original premise at the core of the movie (once I accepted its lack of realism) and some of the gags that arose out of it. I was also impressed at the technical wizardry.I had problems with the casting of Mark Wahlberg as John Bennett. I'm a fan, but he is too old, too hot and too worldly to play a 35 year old loser. I don't see him as the Peter Pan figure that the script calls for. In general, I didn't really appreciate this character's quirks. It was forced. Wahlberg pulled it off I suppose. He has a wider range than people give him credit for. I saw Lori (played by Mila Kunis) as just being annoyingly demanding. I thought that Wahlberg and Kunis were a hot couple, but they were in the wrong roles and the wrong movie together. Giovanni Ribisi was good, as always.I was put off by the constant drug and alcohol indulgences of Ted and John. I mean, look at what John looks like: this is a guy who would be into the gym and into his health.I am not quite sure how a young teenager could be allowed into the theatre to see this film. I'm not a prude, but I suppose there are no age restrictions anymore. A lot of the material and language in the movie seemed inappropriate for children, especially the anti-semitic and homophobic humour.If you really enjoy Family Guy, I think you might enjoy this film though.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Certainly, it is Family Guy on overdrive and without the network in the way. My son and I were in tears at times. In an audience of twelve we all clapped at the end. I clapped!!!!

Wahlberg and Kunis are Good,"Ted is a teddy bear, given to a lonely eight year old boy for Christmas, who wishes for the stuffed animal to be real. Well, his wish comes true when Ted begins to have human like conversations with the kid. Word spreads and Ted becomes famous. Fame is fleeting, and as we flash forward to the now thirty five year old John Bennett, who has remained best friends with the pot smoking, foul mouthed bear, the film becomes a fairly routine romantic comedy. Mila Kunis is Lori, John's girlfriend of four years, who has grown tired of John and Ted's sophomoric and immature antics. She demands that he drop the sarcastic childhood toy and commit to her fully. The predictable breakup occurs, and a few mildly amusing scenes are used as filler, including a funny one with the actor Sam Jones from the campy ""Flash Gordon"" movie from yesteryear. Mark Wahlberg is easy going and he has good chemistry with Kunis on screen. The script is decent, but nothing new or different, other than the concept of a talking teddy bear.

The picture transcends conventional comedies because to its masterful balancing act between poignant and humorous moments, leaving viewers with a lasting impression that lasts long after the last chuckle.

It was tempting to switch off in the first half, but we stuck with it and it was worth it - in the second half, the story kicks off and the laughs really begin, with some wonderful cameos by Norah Jones (especially) Ryan Reynolds and others.There are some big laughs in the movie and excellent acting by Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis, whose love story is very well played as a backdrop to Ted's gross-out humour. We finished the film with a smile on our face, and would rate it as worth a watch. It isn't great but is good fun.

Terrific Comedy with Non-Stop Laughs,"Ted (2012)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Hilarious comedy about a friendless young boy who wishes that his teddy bear would come to life, which he does but as an adult, John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) finds his relationship with his girlfriend (Mila Kunis) on the rocks because he can't settle down and quit partying with Ted the bear. Seth MacFarlane's comedy, as you could tell from the trailer and its R-rating, is raunchy, dirty, profane and at times downright insane but any film could do this. What TED does is that it not only delivers on the laughs but it also has a tremendous heart and I think this is what really separates it from the countless R-rated comedies that are being released each year. There's no question that not every joke works but I'd say the overwhelming majority of them hit the spot and deliver much more than your highest expectations could hope for. There are some hilarious jokes about various dory things from STAR WARS to FLASH GORDON but the stuff dealing with Gordon give some of the biggest laughs of any comedy in recent years. The jokes with Sam J. Jones and the party sequence are downright hilarious and the events that happen with the neighbor had tears rolling down my face. I won't spoil what happens but the entire sequence is one major joke after another. One of the keys for this film working is its heart but a lot of this comes from Wahlberg who delivers another very good performance. It's rather amazing being able to see how Wahlberg's career has developed over the years and I really don't think anyone could have said when he started that he would still be acting and still delivering high performances. His tough guy image is certainly put on the line here and he's such a good sport with countless childish jokes that you can't help respect him for putting that image on the line. Kunis is also good in her supporting role and she has some nice chemistry with the lead. Then there's MacFarlane who really delivers with the voice of Ted. The comic timing is pitch perfect and really delivers. Even better is the animated Ted character who always seems like something real and not just some CGI creation. TED scores on pretty much all levels and it's clearly one of the best comedies in recent years.",,Anonymous,Comedy

v impressive,"Watched this film earlier today. Enjoyed it from start to finish. Found it very funny. Acting all round was very good. Mila looked great as always. Film flew by. Laughed out loud a few times which i haven't done in quite awhile. Couldn't really fault the film at all. Nice running time of approx. 100 mins. Kind of hard to fill up lines here. New paragraph should help.Fair play to Seth etc. Best comedy i've seen in awhile. Should appeal to a pretty wide audience. Film called killer joe out now too. Heard thats good. Well, thats my ten lines of pretty much very little information. Adios amigos..........",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Mind-numbingly awful,"Just saw this on an insomniac Sunday morning, last day of a three day free HBO weekend. Watched over half of it, before mercifully falling asleep. This movie SUCKED, BIT, BLEW, INHALED and nineteen other oral sex metaphors I am too tired to reach for. Amazingly stupid, poorly written, not funny, incoherent. I did like the idea that briefly Ted's incredible story was big news and he became a minor celebrity, but they really went nowhere with that. Ted's being a living toy ceased being relevant to the plot. We could have been watching Damon and Afleck running around Southey. Even the prologue and Patrick Stewart's narration falls completely flat. It sounded as if it was written by an 8th grader. ""And then they grew up....heh heh....and things became shitty.....heh heh. It makes me feel sad for the future of humanity that people who are able to operate motor vehicles and vote, think this film is funny.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
One of the best comedies!,The dialogue is gold and the concept of a talking Teddy bear is excellent enough but even better with the voice of Peter Griffin/ Seth McFarlane! Most of the scenes are hella enjoyable and hilarious. I honestly didn't get much sleep but Ted is so much fun I even saw in the theater with my mom I just wasn't reviewing back then.,10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Best Movie of All Time,"Ted is the BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME! Why? Well, here we go. Seth MacFarlane, the genius guy that created the legendary Family Guy, with a sense of humor that blew everyone away, he also created American Dad and The Cleveland Show, and in these three shows, he voices multiple characters with very different voices and he's just amazing. Seth decided to bring his enormous talent to the big screen. Ted is MacFarlane's first motion picture, where he takes care of the directing, the writing and voicing the hilarious teddy bear. In the end of the year, people will think what was the best movie of 2012, some will say The Dark Knight Rises, some will say The Hobbit, some will say The Avengers, some will say 21 Jump Street and some others, some others like me will say Ted. Ted is a fantastic mash of one of my favorite TV shows Family Guy sense of humor with a very smart plot.John is an 8 year old kid with no friends at all. One Christmas, his parents give him a teddy bear. He wishes for him to come alive. That wish comes true and 27 years later, John (Wahlberg) and Ted (MacFarlane) are still best friends, they live together and their favorite hobby is smoking pot and watching Flah Gordon. But, John's girlfriend Lori (Kunis) wants them to move on with their lives and get Ted out of the house. John and Ted's friendship will be tested.No one would not like to see a movie which concept is about a talking teddy bear that swears all the time, smokes pot and has sex with lots of women, including Norah Jones. MacFarlane used Family Guy humor in here, my favorite type of humor and it worked even better in here cause he made this movie rated R (restricTED) and that way he could go even further with the dirty and politically incorrect humor, in this movie we even see a grown man punching a young kid, and only a MacFarlane project could have that. He brought other things from his show, like Mila Kunis (Meg), Patrick Warburton (Joe) and Alex Borstein) and they were all very well used. Now let's talk about the cast, which was a very solid element of the movie, Mark Wahlberg was a superb choice, he keeps surprising me, since The Other Guys, I knew he was amazing with comedy and in here, he was terrific, he just had to make his Bostonian accent have more encases and he had a great performance where he fires off jokes all the time. Mila Kunis, my favorite actress, was also a perfect choice to be the mature of this weird trio, she was very good here and she was also pretty funny and Seth MacFarlane is also amazing voicing Ted, making a voice that sounds a little like Peter Griffin's voice mashed with Brian Griffin's voice and the movie also had amazing cameos. The jokes, well, let me put it this way, Ted is probably the most hilarious movie I've seen, it's a laugh-a-minute movie and each joke is hilarious and I'm a person that usually doesn't feel comfy at laughing at a theater in front of everybody, but this time, I couldn't help it, and although it wasn't that loud, I did laugh a lot, and if I was at home, the windows would break. Botttom line is, if you love Family Guy and MacFarlane's humor, you'll love Ted, it's a heart warming and also raunchy hilarious movie that I just loved, well, let me say it again: TED IS THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.Frank: You think you got what it takes?Ted: I'll tell you what I got.Your wife's pussy on my breath.Frank: Nobody has ever spoken to me like that before.Ted: That's because their mouths were full of your wife's box.Frank: You're hired.Ted: Sh*t.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Sends bad message,"The blatant forks in the road are one thing, I guess they had to give the main character some sort of internal conflict for the choices he makes. However about halfway through the movie there's a party sequence and they do shots and then it's hinted they do cocaine. After all the dumb crap Seth MacFarlane hinted at about what would happen to you if you tried mushrooms on Family Guy, he has the nerve to show people using cocaine right after using alcohol. One of the things they tried stressing in our minds in high school was to not mix the two, because it is cardio-toxic! As if people weren't stupid enough. Other then that Mark Walberg get's kind of annoying when he openly decry's the c-word. All the tasteless things that go on and American people still think that is the worst word in the English language, like if you shouted it in a movie theatre people would gasp in horror and run out, because there is absolutely no misandry men have to deal with that other people would find horrifying and traumatic.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Stuffed, foul, and  funny","Although it's a stretch to call anything by the Family Guy creator ""cute,"" director-writer Seth MacFarlane has endearing moments in his comedy Ted. However, the preponderance of jokes here are raw, rude, scatological, and outrageous, as is MacFarlane's trademark.He is the voice of teddy bear Ted, brought to life when little John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) wishes life into him. Now at 35, John and Ted are best friends sharing life with John's girl, Lori (Mila Kunis). The laughs are plenty, even clean ones like this:Ted: (dressed in a suit and tie) I look stupid. John: No, you don't, you look dapper. Ted: John, I look like something you give to your kid when you tell 'em Grandma died.Then the romantic tension sets in and the humor vanishes while John and Lori work out the expected problem of the teddy bear buddy occupying John's time and imagination instead of Lori. While some of this convention simply has to be followed in rom-com's, the predictability compromises some of John and Ted's fast-paced, working-class Boston dialogue that otherwise carries the show.Suffice it to say, all will turn out right, even if the stuffing gets knocked out of Ted because love wins the day for the humans and, come to think of it, for the bears as well.",,Anonymous,Comedy
This film is hilarious enough to cover for shoddy craftsmanship,"The first thing you notice is how strangely amazing the score is. Seth MacFarlane's comedy chops are nothing new and Mark Wahlberg has strangely great chemistry with a cgi teddy bear. Some of the acting and line delivery is a bit rough and the scenes can be a bit predictable, but it's so funny that who cares.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Great Episode of live action Family Guy,"In short: Great jokes; plot is just used as a tool to get them all out.Obviously, it is easy to say that this was a movie where Seth Macfarlane was able to take the voice of Peter and Brian Griffin, and just put them in a CGI, Live action film. Sure, a person could just say, ""Why isn't there something new that can be worked into this movie other than the regular offensive humor and shock jokes?"" Then again, with the cast, crew, previews, it would seem that anyone with common sense would know that this flick would fall nothing short of a Seth Macfarlane, ""Look at me go!"" That being said, if you set aside the plot, the movie is a real laugh. I would recommend this movie to someone with a, ""Family Guy sense of humor,"" which most of us have, and someone who is not looking for a fun night, with a lot of care free laughs.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Terrible Movie,"Im a huge fan of Seth Macfarlanes work but this movie was absolutely terrible on all aspects of film making. Even judging this movie only by the characteristics of comedy movie, it was still a terrible movie.Seth macfarlane likes using a lot of American pop culture references uses a lot in his TV shows (Family Guy, etc) which people will get the jokes and make connections with how MacFarlane views the world. The problem with making a lot of pop culture references, its basically a hit or miss with the audience. They will either get it or they will not get it, and most of his ""funny"" references were mostly ""misses"" with the audience. Probably because i wasn't born in 80's time period, but for the most part all the jokes were bad.Basically Seth MacFarlane's signature or style of comedy is trough pop culture references, and also he uses a lot of frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Bing Crosby type of classy music for his score/soundtrack. Thats Macfarlanes signature in every episode or movie.Movie was mostly a drama then a comedy.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
It's funny how not funny it is!,"There are no spoilers here because there is nothing contained within the confines of this motion picture really worth typing out. I find it increasingly disappointing as a human being that people fall for such worthless, low life, gimmicky humour. ""Oh wow, look, a teddy is smoking weed, being radically racist/other-things-similar-to-racism and ignorant! Haha oh what a guy, that IS funny!"" There is nothing remotely adult (it is basically a movie for young teens who are too blind to see that swearing and insensitivity are not the cake for humour, only the icing) and creative about this movie. (Sure, there is a valid love story about needing to grow up but that's a thin cover that leaks smell on a pot of s**t). Humour in general may be 'immature' but there is a step between intelligent, immature humour and frankly lame, childlike immature humour where if you insert enough insensitive and inappropriate material into a film the creators assume people are dumb enough to clap their hands together and giggle like a baby. Which we obviously are because this movie got a decent rating. I think I'll stick to comidians who have real wit and something worthwhile to get laughs about. Not impressed.

"If you like Seth, you'll like this. If not, you still probably will like this.","Ted is Seth MacFarlene's directional debut and stars him. It was also written by him. Ted is the story of John Bennet who, when he's young, makes a wish for his teddy bear to come to life, when he does, they become best friends and do everything together. Now, 24 years on, their friendship is tested when John's girlfriend Lori asks more from their relationship and the only way to get more is to remove Ted from their life.I was really looking forward to this film. Seth MacFarlane is hilarious and I love his TV shows. So I was really excited for this. And I wasn't disappointed. It had a lot of funny parts and a few very funny parts. As much as I enjoyed it, it didn't meet expectation. Maybe I thought it was going to be a 10/10 or something, I don't know. But I still enjoyed it and it was very funny.I am delighted this is rated so highly and also the amount of money it made, because, basically it's a defiant thing that there will be more films to come from Seth and I am really looking forward to them. I really liked this film.If I have one complaint it's this. There is a few swing and miss jokes. But otherwise it's a very funny film, with good acting, a gateway to more Seth films and A LOT of 80's film references, also, there is a few heartfelt moments and it really adds to the story.It feels like Family Guy, but it's actually a lot different. But some of the jokes are in the same humor. So, if you like Seth, you'll like this. If you like good comedy films, you can't go far wrong with this either. Because out of all the comedy films released in the last few years, this is up there most defiantly.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Hilarious/Amazing,I really thought I would hate this movie but I loved it. Ted a foul mouth living teddy bear is amazing. Seth MacFarlene is a genius. Mark Walhberg was also great because all this time he was talking to nothing because Ted was computer generated. Every time Ted spoke I fell into laughter. Mila Kunis was also good as the nagging girlfriend. Some of the things Ted says is very crude but you just can't stop laughing. Definitely one of my favourite 2012 comedy movies. I don't think you need to be a fan of Family Guy to like this movie even though Ted does sound like Peter Griffin. I really do recommend this movie. You will forget all your problems and fall in love with Ted.,9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
An OK dark comedy with an original idea,"I didn't walk into TED expecting a masterpiece of a film. I just walked into the film expecting a fun movie about a lazy bear and his friend. And that is exactly what I got.Do not come into this movie expecting anything great, just know that you will probably get some pretty hard laughs out of it and that's it.Mark Wahlberg and TED have very good chemistry and it is very fun to see them together in all kinds of situations. Most of the jokes land and the CGI on the bear is pretty good.What I disliked about the film is the story. I really didn't care about Mark Wahlberg and his girlfriend. All I wanted to see was TED and Mark doing some crazy sh*t, and whenever they decided to cut back to the ""main"" plot, I was bored.The ending is also pretty bad, it is not funny and it tries (and fails) to be dramatic, so it just leaves you with this weird ending that feels like it belongs to a different movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
OMG that was bad,"The advertisements of this looked like it could be funny but then you watch the entire film.

I should have known if Mark's in it its gonna be bad. How does Mark Wahlberg keep getting work? He isn't funny or talented at acting? The writing for this movie sucked & i suspect everyone was high while making this.Seth Macfarlane, just stop making live action films & stick with what you do best with your adult themed cartoons.

"Crude, obvious, TEDious","If fart jokes and seeing a teddy bear getting stoned keep you entertained for an hour and a half, you'll love this film. I went with my son who loves Family Guy and he didn't find it funny either - never hear a cinema so quiet for a comedy! The basic premise is that a bear acts like a dysfunctional adult, compensating for his shortcomings by drinking, smoking dope, being promiscuous and swearing a lot. It didn't really provide a strong enough idea for a whole movie. There are also a lot of 'in jokes' about American TV people, films and Flash Gordon, mostly lost on us. I think the writers probably locked themselves in a room, got off their heads, found each other really entertaining and wrote it up as a script.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Hilarious film!,"I haven't reviewed a film in forever, so I thought to myself ''Why not review the last movie I have seen?''. Well, last night, my trip to the theatre was to see Seth MacFarlane's TED. I'm pretty familiar with Seth MacFarlane's comedy, and while I'm not always fond of it, I do kind of like it. However, with MacFarlane, it's usually a love-it-or-hate-it kind of comedy. As a result, TED could have easily gone one way or the other. Luckily for us, Ted goes in the right direction, and while undeniably very raunchy and very crude, those who are not offended by such humour will be in for one very, very funny ride.John is the least popular kid in the neighbourhood. One Christmas Eve, he is given a teddy bear, and while the teddy bear isn't alive per Se, it automatically becomes John's best friend. One night, little John wishes for his bear to come alive, which is exactly what happens, and the two are now really best friends. It's a really cute story at first, but what happens 27 years after? Well, John (Mark Wahlberg) and his bear, ''Ted''(voice of Seth MacFarlane himself) are stoners and John, at 35 years old, works in a car rental company. John is in a relationship with Lori (Mila Kunis), a very patient and mature girl who, despite loving him too, believes that Ted is a nuisance to her relationship with John. In order to get the best of both worlds, John lets Ted go, helps him find a job, and other things like that...I'm not saying more. I could go on and on about the plot, but I don't feel like spoiling anything. What you do got to know though is that TED is a very, very funny comedy. It works on pretty much every level. Seth MacFarlane's branch of humour is worthy of the early Family Guy episodes, back when it was any good. It is also easily recognizable in TED. Whether he's bashing Jews on a Christmas Eve or having someone pick up a piece of sh!t from the floor, there are many gags you could actually picture seeing on television. Of course, there are many pop culture references as well. However, those don't always work as well as the other gags, but still, when they work well, they're very funny. I'm thinking of an opening gag and a closing gag aimed at some today and past stars which had me up in stitches, and that, long after the movie was ended. The movie also kind of feels like a thriller near the end with a pretty tense car chase. A few other parts, near the end mostly, emotions were present. Not in a crying-your-heart-out kind of way, but more like a Aww-that's-sad kind of way.Of course, both leads are great in their roles. Mark Wahlberg is surprisingly solid, constantly replying with perfect comedic timing and sometimes a surprising amount of emotion to...well, a teddy bear, who doesn't even exist. Mila Kunis also has her funny moments, but besides a climatic decision and being the one who wants Ted and John's bromance to end, she doesn't really bring anything useful to the movie (I blame the way the character was written, because Kunis was perfect for the role.) Undeniably, the real star of the movie is Ted himself. Not only does he look surprisingly realistic for a CGI teddy bear, but he's quite the entertainer. And while most of what comes out of his mouth is profane, it's also very funny. In fact, if Ted were an actual comedian, I wouldn't hesitate one minute to buy tickets for his one-man show. I'll give a special credit to Giovanni Ribisi (who also starred in Contraband, opposing Mark Wahlberg earlier this year), who is awesome as a stalker, but I won't say much more.Overall, like I said, TED goes one way or another. For me, it definitely went the right way. It was hilarious and entertaining enough to warrant a full price ticket at the theatre. Let me put it this way. TED is up there with 21 Jump Street in terms of 2012 comedy. MacFarlane fans, you do not want to miss this movie. MacFarlane haters, enter with an open mind and you might exit pleasantly surprised. Average moviegoer looking to go on a date or to go see a movie? Why not try out TED? Before I used to give 10's out as a way to say ""Highest recommendation"", but I don't give 10's out like that anymore. 9 is a really great mark, and that is what I'm giving to TED, because that's exactly what it deserves.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A big disappointment,"I didn't have the chance to watch this movie when it was in theaters and I was pretty upset by it because I was rather curious. I ended up watching it later and was deeply disappointed by it.The movie starts out alright for a comedy movie, but about halfway down the line it starts going downhill. It is like you're not even watching the same movie anymore. There's a shifting in movie genres, from comedy to action or romance, I don't know. The movie puts you in a good mood and then just ruins it by beginning to be awful all of the sudden. It's undeniable that you will laugh out loud a few times in the first part of the movie and for the rest of if you'll just be wondering whether you started watching another movie without realizing it. I gave it a 6 because the first part is actually good. If the whole movie was like the last part of it, I'd rate it a lot lower.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Cute, clever, adorable and brash fun fairy tale comedy!","Everyone knows when you enter the world of Seth MacFarlane that it's fun and his work is a joy to watch. As his concepts bring out the kid in you as his fairy tales remind you of your childhood he likes to showcase that dreams do come true! With this work rightfully titled ""Ted"" it shows that a fairy tale film can be a heck of a lot of fun especially when it's blended with funny brash and outspoken talk, and in the meantime it tells a touching story of love and friendship! ""Ted"" is a tale about a childhood wish that came true for a young boy John Bennett who after receiving a teddy bear one Christmas wishes it would talk and magically it comes to life!

"It's OK, but should have gone further away from ""standard""","Ted's an odd movie, which is a good thing. Seth MacFarlane brings his signature style onto the big screen and it is a welcome refreshment. Unfortunately, Ted is not odd enough.It feels like the script of the movie was written by two people. The one who wrote the funny stuff is the talented one, although the jokes do have a Family Guy feel about them, which may turn some people off. But then it's like a different person wrote the emotional parts of the story and that guy is not very skilled. The serious dialogue found primarily in the 2nd part of the film, can be terrible. Every now and then, there was a line so cliché and bland that it was hard to believe that McFarland just left it like that. You expect some sort of a follow-up statement or a punchline from the character, but it never comes. Additionally, it is difficult to take anything seriously if it involves a talking teddy bear. If you're going to include relationship drama, it cannot just be the clichéd conflict and resolution of a romantic comedy with its boilerplate lines because this is at odds with the raw style of Ted's comedy.It was cool to feel like a psychic, as the plot was becoming increasingly more predictable, but that speaks poorly of the quality. The outlines of the plot are not stereotypical, but on a scene by scene basis, it was easy to guess what was going to happen next.That said, the actors do their job OK, Giovanni Ribisi especially awesome as the creepy villain; the movie is funny and for most part quite smart; and it has Mila Kunis in it.John and Ted's friendship is filled with genuine emotion.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

MacFarlane has definitely excelled here,"'Ted' is a really funny film that could have been brilliant if there were more laughs in it.Mark Wahlberg was absolutely the right guy for this film, he is definitely at his best when he is in comedic roles (not necessarily in comedy films) and he carried this film better than anyone else could have. Mila Kunis was really funny in this but her character held her back a bit; she could have been a lot better if the script hadn't stopped her. Seth MacFarlane's voice performance was really funny though he was pretty much just playing Peter from 'Family Guy' in a bear form. There was a lot less cameo roles than I expected here but the ones from Sam J. Jones and the delightful little one from Ryan Reynolds were really funny. Let's not forget the hilarious narration from Patrick Stewart who is just brilliant despite only saying a few sentences at the beginning and ending.The script was really funny despite the story outline being kind of basic. The jokes, the insults and the dialogue were fantastic. Seth MacFarlane has definitely excelled here with this script; I really hope he goes on to write more films after this.Overall, if you love 'Family Guy', 'American Dad' etc. then you should love this. It's the same type of humour and is arguable just a giant episode of these but it is still as funny if not more. It was still missing something however; the jokes were spread throughout the film meaning you weren't laughing non-stop.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Throughout the film there is constant laughs; of course there is typical family guy humour which also adds to this films perfection. I couldn't help but listen out for the many voices of the popular family guy characters; such as Meg, Joe and Stewie, and I did worry that 'Ted' wouldn't stand out from all of these characters but he is in fact distinctive in his own right and is a smart, likable and hilarious character.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Seth MacFarlane becomes conventional,"Seth MacFarlane, the man behind Family Guy, in my opinion the best adult animation series ever to grace your TV screen, now turns his creative mind to pure live-action feature films - save one animated teddybear named Ted. The plot is as puerile as they come: a young bullied boy gets one wish from a fairy, and wishes for his new teddybear to come to life and become his friend. He does, saves the boy's childhood, and becomes a national sensation. Then we fast-forward some 25 years, and the boy is now a 31-year-old man-child with a live, weed-smoking slacker of a teddybear - plus an ambitious girlfriend who's not too crazy about their hedonistic lifestyle.Ted appeals to our childhood fantasy, and combines this with one of the main fantasies of many young (male) adults today: ditch responsibility, kick back, and watch movies, TV and play video games all day long. Add Seth MacFarlane's take on an adult, horny teddybear to the equation, and you'd think you'd be in for a real treat. And to be fair, there are numerous laughs in here, which will all definitely work for anyone who likes Family Guy. Most of these are either in the dialogue or realized by some absurd situations related to having a live teddybear with the mind of a teenager. But once the novelty of the setup wears off, and MacFarlane must trust his plot and characters to carry the weight of a full-length feature film, it becomes apparent that much of what makes Family Guy work so well isn't quite transferable to live-action cinema. Yes, we get the pop-culture references (which are fun enough), and yes, the Ted character, which is more or less the spitting image of Brian Griffin, is a fun concoction, but the romantic portion and the plot twist towards the end are far too conventional and uninspired to elevate Ted very far above the mediocre Hollywood comedy level.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"great, great movie","I have seen loads of comedies. Many are terrible. Some are decent. A few are good. But, once in a blue moon you find a movie that is so fantastic that every person in the theater is laughing there heads off at every joke, stunt and comical scene. One of those movies is Seth MacFarlanes Ted. I have been a fan of Family Guy since i started watching it a few years ago, and I was excited for Ted when i heard that MacFarlane was going to be doing it, but to be honest, i wasn't suspecting something as great as it was. I would watch Ted a million times and still find myself laughing mindlessly at it. It is a truly amazing movie in everyway!",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Absolutely pure, uncompromising, unapologetic crap.","""Ted"" is trash. I could only stand to watch the first 15 minutes and even that felt like grey matter was being sucked out of my head. There are some genuinely funny raunchy comedies from time to time these days--but the writing in this movie went beyond silly and inane and then tried to make up for it by trying to conceal itself behind a mountain of prurient crude.Ted stands as conspicuous embarrassment to its screenplay creators and the universe needs to be balanced by at least 10 quality counter comedies or, at least, a public apology to movie-goers in all places, past, present, and future. Yes, this show was THAT bad. Test it: talk to someone that has seen it, but make sure they are not surrounded by others lest the pubescent peer pressure forces an insincere response. I love movies, all types. This movie threatens not only the genre but probably the credibility of those aspiring to its originality. Heaven help us if this is the future of edgy comedy.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Live action Family Guy!,"This is the closest thing you are going to get to a real life Family Guy. Seth MacFarlane, the creator of shows like Family Guy, American Dad, and The Cleveland Show, writes and directs one of the funniest movies I have seen in a very long time. I am so glad that this movie did not disappoint me because it was one of my most hyped films for 2012.This movie stars Mark Wahlberg (Boogie Nights, The Fighter), Mila Kunis (That's 70 Show, Black Swan), Seth MacFarlane (Family Guy, American Dad), Joel McHale (The Soup, Community), and Giovanni Ribisi (Avatar, Saving Private Ryan).When John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) receives a Teddy Bear (Seth MacFarlane) for Christmas when he was little, he makes a wish for it to come to life. So of course, it does come to life. They grow up through the years together as best friends and still are smoking weed, getting drunk, and going no where in life. John has been in a 4 year relationship with Lori (Mila Kunis) and Ted keeps getting John to do stupid things that cause Lori and him to fight. Lori has had it with Ted and tells John it is her or the Bear.I thought the movie was very well written and very funny. Seth MacFarlane always loves to push his jokes out further and as a result it adds to making the movie non stop funny from start to finish. The Ted character that Seth MacFarlane has created is so great, that I believe Ted can turn into a franchise. I highly recommend seeing this film as soon as possible.Rating: 8/10Thank you for reading my review, any feedback would be greatly appreciated.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Bear-able.,"You want bear puns? Look no further! Thankfully, though, the humour in Ted is somewhat more refined. For most TV show creators, the opportunity to translate their talents to the big screen comes with a license to push boundaries in new and exciting ways not available through the medium of television. For Seth MacFarlane, creator of the outrageously outrageous Family Guy and ridiculously underrated American Dad!, it must have just felt like another day at the office.John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) is the loneliest kid in Boston. While the other children engage in unique Christmas traditions, John spends his days inside, wishing for just one friend. On Christmas Day, that wish comes true in the form of Ted the stuffed bear (MacFarlane), who is magically transformed into a living being, the miraculous story of which spreads like wildfire across the country. Fast-forward nearly thirty years and Ted's fame has long-since vanished. He and John now spend their days getting high, watching bad movies and managing John's relationship with Lori (Mila Kunis).As if to state the painfully obvious, the amount of fun to be had with this film is heavily influenced by how familiar one is with MacFarlane's comedic style. Each of his animated creations employ sharp one-liners, bizarre set pieces and a ton of pop culture references, all of which are prominent in Ted. Naturally, the humour is all sorts of politically incorrect, with jokes ranging from drugs to sex to September 11. Highlights include Ted's job interview at the local supermarket, Patrick Stewart's narration and a house party with Sam Jones, star of Ted and John's favourite film of all-time, Flash Gordon.It is made clear by the closing credits where the bulk of the effort went into making this film, as most jokes hit resulting in an array of instantly quotable material making it difficult to watch Ted without a perpetual smile on your face. With so many references to popular culture jam-packed within two hours, most international viewers are likely to misunderstand jokes about Tom Brady, Pepperidge Farm and those promiscuous 'Bahstan Gahls', but the film does more than enough to keep all viewers chuckling throughout.The motion-capture argument typically begins and ends with Andy Serkis (The Lord of the Rings, Rise of the Planet of the Apes) and deservedly so, but an honourable mention must go to this film's visual effects team for the creation of Ted who, both voiced and controlled by MacFarlane, looks about as close to believable as can be.The film tends to cruise in areas not pertaining to straight-out comedy, which may be a direct side effect of MacFarlane's first outing in the director's chair. The plot has been done literally thousands of times before and the character arcs established early leave the viewer in no doubt as to where the movie is heading to the extent that, once you take away the fact that Ted is not human, it starts to look a lot more like every deliberately offensive rom-com ever. Regardless, the film refuses to take itself too seriously with plenty of tension-breaking jokes that, along with a multitude of A-list cameos, work a whole lot better than would appear on paper.Ted begins to deviate from its comedic roots just slightly during the climax set after-hours inside Fenway Park (just out of shot: David Ortiz socking a few dingers), but it does allow for an epilogue that, at least temporarily, strikes the audience off-guard by neatly showcasing the charming bond formed between a man and his bear. Indifferent viewers will enjoy Ted without differentiating it from most other contemporary comedies, while fans of the director's prior work are likely to draw a lot more enjoyment out of every scene.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Didn't work for me...,"So, was it worth my while investing 106 minutes of my life on this one? I have to say, on balance; not really. Yes there are some wonderfully comic moments and smart one-liners in there but I did find it drifted far too much from the sublime to the ridiculous. Also, one minute Ted is 'Brian' for Family Guy and the next he turns into 'Peter Griffin' from the same show (despite his denials). I thought both Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis did a good job; both of their characters were quite believable. Ultimately though I did find it lacked the one thing it so desperately needed; heart. Still, I'm sure the many devotees of 'Family Guy' will love this one but for me, sadly, it's a bit of a dud.SteelMonster's verdict: NOT RECOMMENDED (unless you're a really big fan of Family Guy, in which case why haven't you seen it yet!)My score: 5.3/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy

good pop corn comedy with ironic sense,"I started to watch this movie without knowing that set mc falrane from family guy was behind this. I therefore didn't place any expectations with this movie. In fact I wasn't even sure if the bear would be kind or more ""rude"" in the sense of Paul's movie.This being said, I discover the movie as it came, and I must say that even thought it is not a glorious piece of comedy, still it is a good movie, mixing jokes with the questions related to our modern'age adult who are sometimes still acting like kids after they passed the 30's.the family guy spirit is there, a bit, with Ted's comment, but it's time to time to my opinion, and Mark Walberg play an average performance which leaves overall an OK experience.Not a super great movie, but cool to watch, especially if you lived during, or like, the 80s which are a constant reference in the movie.i rate 7 as 7.5 is not available.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Better than its peers,"John(Wahlberg, with his usual ""not the brightest bulb but nice guy"" charm) had trouble making friends as a child, so at 7, he wished for his plush bear(MacFarlane, playing it like a nasty jerk who does have some empathy) to be alive, and it was granted(and this wisely has everyone know that it is, so he doesn't have to be hidden and dressed up for the entirety, with that lame material we've seen countless times for several decades). They both age over the years, and when we rejoin them, he's been dating Lori(Kunis, not coming off like she's nagging, and who can laugh with the other two... we believe they would get together and stay together, it's not a ""what is she doing with him"" kind of thing so typical in recent American fictional media) for 4 years, and she wants them to go to the next level. All three relationships are very credible, as are most of the characters(except for the ones that are just there for us to laugh at) and their logic. As he tries to develop more maturity, we of course indulge in plenty of juvenile fun, albeit this has almost even amounts of genuinely sweet and/or dramatic moments(it has serious heart, and the ending may very well make you cry... in spite of the unnecessary parts of the climax). This is raunchy, with lots of strong language, mild violence and brief nudity... we get jokes about various sexual, religious and ethnic groups, and this tries to offend absolutely everyone. It is hilarious(it really doesn't try too hard), and yes, there are one or two gags there to push the boundaries; it's an R-rated comedy, it's expected... with that said, this is miles above the usual outing in this genre. The writing and performances are where this shines, with the plot being the weakest(though it is done well), as it is so simplistic and obvious... we've seen it so many times already. And as already mentioned, the third act is... a tad off. It doesn't fit with the clever ""symbol of stunted growth"" concept. There are pop culture references, parodies, and excellent guest stars. The FX are impeccably integrated and animated, you fully believe what you see is real. I recommend this to any fan of the director(who fares rather well for his debut), the cast(McHale is great as an insufferable boss who won't accept that he can't date Mila, and Ribisi is fantastic... note that Warburton is barely in it) and this kind of movie. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funny teddy bear...,"""Ted"" is a Comedy - Fantasy movie in which we watch a man and his teddy bear which is alive due to a wish that he made when he was a young child, trying to continue their lives and their routines when a serious choice has to be made. He has to choose between staying with his girlfriend and keeping his friendship with his extremely inappropriate teddy bear.I liked this movie because it was based on a very clever idea and it was something that I haven't seen before. I enjoyed it because it had very good and humorous moments combined with some inappropriate jokes. The direction which was made by Seth MacFarlane who is also the writer of this movie, was very good and it had many good moments. I also enjoyed the fact that he combined very well comedy with dramatic moments and romance with comedy as well. Regarding the interpretations, I believe that Mark Wahlberg who played as John Bennett was simply amazing and he did a very good job on his role. Some other good interpretations that have to be mentioned were Mila Kunis who played as Lori Collins John Bennett's girlfriend, Giovanni Ribisi's who played as Donny and Seth MacFarlane's voice as Ted was simply the best choice.Finally, I have to say that ""Ted"" is a nice comedy movie with many humorous scenes and even more hilarious ones. I strongly recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it and I am definitely sure that you are going to laugh a lot.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Funny, but overloaded with scatological jokes and other offensive material","""Ted"" most definitely has some laugh out loud moments, and overall I enjoyed it. Sadly though, there is an overabundance of scatological jokes and other offensive material. While I am a woman with a sense of humour, I found a lot of the lines to be outrageously sexist. Of course, I don't take this movie seriously; it's about a talking teddy bear. Still though, I think that Seth McFarlane has gotten a little out of hand. There are some scenes that just made me ask, ""WHY? WHY DID YOU HAVE TO CROSS THAT LINE?"". Those are scenes that I would skip over if I watched this again. Giovanni Ribisi and the boy who plays his pudgy son are hilarious, with their Kathy Bates in ""Misery""-type characters. The sex-scenes leave me perplexed, because I do not understand how those acts are anatomically possible, considering that one participant lacks the body parts necessary to engage in said act. Anyway, this is a great movie to watch when you just wanna chill. But Seth McFarlane has issues.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

A little overrated and I was a bit disappointed,"When I first heard about Ted it was a few years back and I was looking forward to it because of MacFarlane. Eventually, I heard it was moving up from July 13th to June 29th and I was even more excited. But when I saw it, I gotta say I was a little disappointed. I had been waiting so long for this movie to come out. It was a decent movie but not too funny. Most of the funny stuff came from Ted obviously. The rest was just kind of bad. Even Mila Kunis's acting was kind of overacted in my opinion. Overall I guess it was okay, but not really too great. You should see it if you like comedy but if you want something more serious/good you should see something like TDKR or TASM. It wasn't too bad and I'd definitely watch again but maybe renting it or wait till it's on TV. A lot of the jokes are just flat, something I wouldn't expect from the guy who created American Dad. Also, Mark and Mila have no chemistry at all so it's kind of awkward watching them together. Not really too much of a problem though. Overall 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Plain-spoken, matter-of-fact fantasy...gleefully, if at times obnoxiously, 'incorrect'","After receiving a large stuffed teddy bear for Christmas in 1985, a friendless boy from Boston makes a bedtime wish that his plush toy will come to life and be his best friend forever...of course, the next morning, the teddy bear is walking, talking, and scaring the crap out of the kid's parents. 27 years later, the world-renown, celebrated talking teddy bear is still buddies with the boy, now a 35-year old man with a dead-end job who dodges responsibilities and constantly puts his girlfriend second. Extremely well-produced, well-executed comedy that gives us a talking toy who is readily accepted by society--he even gets a cashiering job at the neighborhood supermarket!--yet never loses sight of the human characters at the heart of the story. Producer-director Seth MacFarlane, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild (based on MacFarlane's original treatment), goes for broke with the raunchy gags and movie in-jokes, though the stop-and-start romance between Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis appears to mean just as much to MacFarlane as does the scatological humor. Some of the jokes fall flat, as does an overlong fight scene, an even longer wild party sequence, and an apparent need to be as comically offensive as possible. When the movie is sweetly-rendered, like R-rated whimsy, it's not only devilishly funny but also surprisingly affable. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Too Much to Bear,"This film is mildly recommended.Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis star in Seth MacFarlane's raunch-fest, Ted, a smutty little R- rated comedy that became one of this year's biggest hits. However, the film's real star is a foul-mouthed but lovable teddy bear named Teddy. He's kinda a cross between Snuggles the Bear and Chester the Molester. Depending on your own personal taste, this comedy will either be an outrageous laugh riot or just a gross turn-off. ( I was somewhere in-between. )The slim story goes like this: One day a little boy named John Bennett wishes that his cuddly bedtime companion would come to life and, sure enough, his wish comes true. Twenty seven years later, a grown-up John (Wahlberg) and his bud are still together, although John begins to rue that day as the rowdy Ted fills his life with enough debauchery and lewdness while ruining his romantic chances with Lori (Kunis). Of course, complications and embarrassing moments beset the characters and their bromance, including drugs, prostitutes, and other hedonistic pursuits.That's the basic premise in this formulaic comedy which does have some funny and clever lines but more not-so-funny and, frankly, very predictable scenes as one would expect to find in this type of film. Still both Wahlberg and Kunis provide a nice chemistry and there is solid comic support by Giovanni Ribisi, Joel McHale, and the original Flash Gordon and ex- Playgirl model, Sam Jones as himself. MacFarlane deftly voices Ted and co-wrote the hit- and-miss screenplay ( with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild ). This film also marks his directorial debut and MacFarlane has done a commendable job in all of those departments. The best moments come from the CGI which embodies Ted with the right facial expressions and movement to give him a winning personality and make the character come alive.Ted may be off-putting and offensive to some moviegoers, but if you have a high tolerance of this sort of off-colored brand of humor and sophomoric shenanigans, the film just might be enough fun. Too often the film went for shock value and cheap laughs with a forced vulgarity as its primary goal. The film never bothers to explain or delve into Ted's transition from the cute little teddy bear of yesteryear to the profanity spewing furry lout of today. ( Now that exposition could have made the film far more interesting.) Anyway, anything goes in this movie. Everything is fair game and a comic target for MacFarlane. Ted doesn't always hit the comic bullseye, but it does aim to please those liberal-minded moviegoers in the audience. GRADE: B-",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

He did it in ""Fighter"" and now he has done it again. His innocent part plays right into the heart of humor like it did in ""The other guys"".Mila Kunis plays her part cleverly. Seth absolutely brings his accent bounded Griffin-ised self. Clever writing and cast. Loads of credit goes to narration (you will know who), McHale and Ribisi for being sublime at what they do.

"So much potential, so much of the same. What a shock.","Story and plot had a lot of potential, and although I am not a big Family Guy fan I have found Seth Mcfarlane to have some bright spots that are really funny in his writing. Not sure what his obsession is with oldtyme show-tunes but I digress.This film shows everything that is wrong with the Hollywood hype machine & the poison of writers/directors thinking something is funny just because of the premise or their brand of shtick that's become popular.This movie is not that funny, it's just the same old jokes that try too hard to push the envelope with material we have simply just seen WAY too much, especially from Mcfarlane & his barrage of cartoons, etc.Had some funny moments but instead of taking any chances with making a unique story it ends up doing the same Adam Sandler nonsense of copying every other trashy Rom-Com formula cliché in the book.The special effects were good, some of the jokes were clever, but if they wasted a great opportunity to make something different here. Not sure why this movie is as overrated as Avengers but I guess this is what we settle for these days.Only acting worth mentioning was the female lead...other than that it is the typical & expected cookie-cutter performances by non-funny male leads.Blah Hollywood, blah.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A funny movie,"TEDIt was good.It is typical toilet humour. A lot of swearing, getting high, hookers etc... Basically, it is what you would expect from Seth Macfarlane if you have seen Family Guy.The movie is about a little boy who gets a teddy bear for Christmas one year and wishes it would actually talk to him. On the night he wishes for this, a shooting star happens to shoot by in the sky... the next morning the bear is alive. 20 years later, the bear and the boy have grown up and are partying hard.The bear actually looks real through the whole movie. The effects are very good. I didn't notice Mark Wahlberg talking to himself at all... when he was talking to Ted, he was actually looking at him.There are some really funny moments in this movie, most of which are in the trailer. There are some other really funny parts that are not in the trailer though. I was just hoping there would be more. It is a laugh out loud comedy, but there could have been more which I am hoping will be in Ted 2, which I have read is going to be made soon.There are some great in jokes too... as well as some retro tunes (Knight Rider, naming one) and a classic guest star appearing in the form of Mr. Flash Gordon himself, Sam J.

A raunchy and humorous buddy comedy,"""Ted,"" directed by Seth MacFarlane, is a comedic romp that blends outrageous humor with a heartfelt story about friendship. The film follows John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg), whose childhood wish brings his teddy bear, Ted (voiced by MacFarlane), to life. As adults, their bond is tested as John's relationship with his girlfriend, Lori (Mila Kunis), becomes serious.Mark Wahlberg delivers a solid performance, skillfully playing off Ted's crude and mischievous antics. Seth MacFarlane's voice work as Ted brings the character to life with sharp wit and irreverent humor, reminiscent of his work on ""Family Guy.""While ""Ted"" excels in delivering laugh-out-loud moments and clever pop culture references, its reliance on crude humor may not appeal to all audiences.

If Peter Griffin was in Toy Story...,"Although I like Seth Macfarlanes animated shows such as Family Guy and American Dad, I was concerned that this film would be a let down as I did not enjoy A Million Ways to Die in the West (2014).I am happy to say my original judgment was proven wrong and I thought this film was pretty funny. Ted reminded me of Peter Griffin and of course sounds like him too, as you would expect! He even makes an in joke about this in the movie.I really do enjoy films which are self aware, such as when Ted acknowledges that some of his jokes went to far! However, I must admit Seth's outrageous and sometimes racist humour did not always make me laugh.You will think that some of the jokes are pretty immature, but you must remember that some of them, such as the thunder buddies song were made by the protagonists when they were children, so it sorta makes sense.The story itself is interesting as it deals with the questions such as ""what would happen to Ted once John grows up?"". The overall answers to such questions are not only adressed, but are humourous as you would imagine! I'd say if you like Family Guy, give it a shot as the humour in this movie is very similar!",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Terrible comedy,"I didn't expect much from this movie, seeing as it was made by Seth Macfarlene, who makes one of my least favorite TV shows. But coming out of this movie I was actually disappointed. Not only is the comedy stupid, and depends on the concept of ""LOL its a teddy bear that swears and says wacky things"", but the story is terrible as well. It seems reminiscent of Family guy, in where its just some guys getting in silly situations for the lolz. The only connection in the whole thing is the The main character needs to make sure that he doesn't make his girlfriend mad, oh also hes a wimp haha!!!! The whole thing of wishing on a star is the most disgusting thing I have seen in a movie in a long time. This movie is in my bottom ten of movies. I would rather watch Joe Dirt 100 times in a row than see this movie one more time. Do not watch",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Conventional but funny,"If you like Seth Macfarlane humour you'll like this film, simple as that.In his first feature film, Mark Wahlberg plays John Bennett at a time in his life when his childhood friend, Ted, creates a rift between John and his girlfriend played by Mila Kunis. There's no cinematic risks taken, just Seth Macfarlane humour with attempts at being touching.The jokes are spread wide, with modern jabs and many throwbacks. Some hit hard, some don't, and some I found to go too far (one 9/11 joke is horribly distasteful).The film overs many cameos of varied success levels, probably a product of the Macfarlane name.While acting isn't the draw here, everything is sufficient, and Giovanni Ribisi's creepy dad character is hilarious and steals his scenes.Ted can be a fun film if you let it. Most people probably are less sensitive than I when it comes to potty humour. Also there's a fair- sized twist at the end, but it's funny that the 'I do what I want' Macfarlane can't stick to his guns with it.6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Very funny at times, but not that well written","I was a huge fan of Seth MacFarlane's Family Guy early on, and even quite liked it for at least the first two or three years of its return, but, man, has it ever gotten tired since then. I was hoping this new project would rekindle some talent, especially given its success with both audiences and critics. Frankly, though, this just feels like more of the same. There are, I must admit, some huge laughs in the first half or two-thirds of the film. The gags are very Family Guy-like, and it's about as ramshackle as your average episode of modern Family Guy, but, still, it's funny. The Giovanni Ribisi subplot especially just doesn't work in any way whatsoever, and it completely takes over the film in its final thirty minutes. The relationship plot line that drives the rest of the film is better, but it's not great, either. Neither Mark Wahlberg nor Mila Kunis ever feel like real people, and Ted himself gets old pretty quick. I won't say there wasn't some enjoyment - in fact, if you're interested at all, I'd say it's definitely not painful or anything - but it's pretty weak.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Unbelievably funny,"You might say this movie is predictable, childish and stupefying (maybe you're right) but what more can we ask for than a teddy bear being a savage to everything and everyone in its path 😂? This film reaches the total nonsense, each scene is more unbelievable than the other, leaving the audience to die laughing. Most of the jokes land and are well positioned, Seth MacFarlane is a genius not only at doubling Ted but also directing the film. Not to mention the antagonist ... I mean what could I say? It's just hilarious.The performances of Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis are also good. I couldn't leave out the excellent and ""original"" soundtrack as well as the quality of Ted's effects.Mixing nonsense with a drop of emotion, the film achieves its goal, a great viewing with friends!

So Funny & really good story!!,"What a brilliant film!! Got dragged to watch it & did not fancy it one bit from the trailers but was totally taken in from this crude, funny & great script!!

A great story where a guy has to ditch his bum of a best friend for his girlfriend!! Some of the scenes are laugh out loud, the soap in the supermarket, the job interview, the fight scene all great and the relationship between Ted & Walhburg has so much surprising chemistry its amazing.

I was expecting this, but I thought it would still be a funny movie. It was alright,Ted did do some funny things and he was a good character; But it was all the same material be used over and over again from family guy. Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis both did a great job acting their parts and Seth MacFarlane puts the Computer Generated Image to life. The movie would of been better with a more dicey script and Ted not having the only amusing part of the film.

This movie is so bad I turned it off,"I couldn't even watch this travesty of a film. The jokes were stupid and nowhere near clever. Nothing about this was witty. This film reminds me of the movie, Idiocracy, in that it is made for people who live in that future... completely stupid and happy with it. I turned this movie off because I didn't laugh. Not even once. I don't think Seth McFarlane is funny at all. I don't know how people reviewed this movie with any positivism. The acting was bad, the plot was dumb. It was just a completely non-necessary film, and I cringe whenever someone references it and expects me to laugh along with jokes a 10 year old boy would make. Unless you are a pre-teen/teen boy or have the mentality of one, you won't enjoy this movie. Even my boyfriend, who loves bad movies for whatever reason, agreed in turning this movie off.

When You Wish Upon A Star...Turned On Its Ear!,"One has to wonder that it is quite hard to make a truly funny ""conventional"" comedy movie, so how on earth can a non-animated movie about a walking-talking teddy bear succeed? This stuff works fairly well for a certain kind of audience when it's animated as director MacFarlane's ""The Family Guy"" has shown, but with live performances, and no animation, one would think the pitfalls to be insurmountable. That said, the fact ""Ted"" succeeds in an even more mainstream way than MacFarlane's previous productions is a pleasant surprise.The movie is rich in satire and detail (the kind in which you'll catch additional humorous connections with second and third viewings), but has a real beating heart underneath the veneer of its unique combination of raunchy humor and political incorrectness (most will likely be at least somewhat offended at some point) - which is pure MacFarlane! The jokes are continuous and the wit is sharp enough to blot out the occasional dead-spots. Beyond the writing though it would still likely be impossible to achieve such a level of success if it were not for the cast. Simply put, the cast is uniformly excellent – like an ensemble with great chemistry. Plus, outside of the outrageous Ted there's the great device of the Patrick Stewart narration which treats the story as if it is a heart string pulling Disney family movie – until it veers into the profane, but laughable.Ted is even more over-the top than you'd expect in a come-to-life hard partying 30-something slacker teddy bear. Ted is actually a sweetheart underneath the smart-ass exterior. How the directors managed to make Ted look as real as the actors is for lack of a better description, amazing. Playing out the love story sub-plot, Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis certainly have that special something commonly called on-screen chemistry. They have to make it work because they are a couple that is simply meant to be and the viewer feels something for them. Add the fantastic characters they're surrounded by and the sum total is movie that manages to combine ribald humor with heartwarming story telling in the most unconventional sense. This movie blazes its own totally unique path. If you like comedies and are not easily offended it is an easy recommendation because it is certainly the best comedy of 2012. Plus, nice seeing Tom Skerrit back...He, he!",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
it's not to be taken seriously the plot is about a talking bear!,"After seeing this trailer yesterday, I could not believe how funny this looked, as fan of Family Guy and Amecina dad, I Could not wait until Aug 1st last yearFirst half of the movie was very funny, i felt like i was laughing for 30 minutes no stop, there was really funny jokes, I love the Thunder songs, crack me up big time.After the first half hour the movie dose lose a steam and dose feel less funny, they do have some descent jokes that will make giggle for rest of the movie.I was hoping for full on comedy, I do think they put a tad too much drama in this movie, which made less funny, some might find some scene very sad.I Really enjoyed how the movie ended, I think was perfect ending to this movie.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I was surprised that a good actor like Mark Wahlberg did such a terrible movie.I do not recommend this movie to children nor anyone. The jokes were real bad, the one about the Mexican food was not funny nor the part that the toy threw a holy bible to M.Wahlberg.Also the issue of the main actor and the bear doing drugs is not acceptable,that is not entertaining to the public.

"While it's jokes are hit-and-miss to the extreme, and it is too reliant on crudeness-for-the-sake-of-crudeness, ""Ted"" is salvaged by good direction and a lot of charm.","People's opinions on the works of Seth MacFarlane tend to mainly fall within two camps. Those who like/love his work... and those who hate it with a passion. Very few people seem to fall in-between.I'm one of the few who fall in between.I think Seth MacFarlane is a really talented person, and a very charming guy. In particular, I enjoy his music and interviews, and some of his producing work, such as the recent reboot of the classic Science television show ""Cosmos."" And to an extent, I do think that there are a handful of episodes of ""Family Guy"" and ""American Dad"" that are phenomenal. (""Road to Rhode Island"", as far as I am concerned, is one of the best episodes of any animated series I've seen since it's premier nearly 15 years ago) However, despite really enjoying some episodes, I don't view ""Family Guy"" or ""American Dad"" as particularly strong comedies. For me, they are basically take-it-or-leave-it. And I do have to say I really do not like ""The Cleveland Show"" at all.So for me... I'm a casual fan of Seth MacFarlane, but far from a hardcore fan or a hardcore hater. I'm in between. I like some of his work... while I dislike his other work.So I went into ""Ted"" fairly open. I was interested in seeing how MacFarlane's style would translate to a feature-length, live-action (well, MOSTLY live-action) film. And I am pleased to say that overall, I think ""Ted"", while flawed, was a successful film.We follow John (Mark Whalberg), a 35-year-old man who has spent his life living with ""Ted"" (Voiced by Seth MacFarlane), a teddy-bear that was magically brought to life when John was a child. While the existence of a living teddy-bear initially made Ted into an overnight celebrity, like many people, his 15-minutes-of-fame quickly dried up, and Ted is now just a regular old crude guy. He enjoys spending his days getting high and trying to pick up women. This causes issues for Lori (Mila Kunis), John's longtime girlfriend, who (rightfully) believes Ted's childish, immature ways are holding back she and John's life together. And so, the story kicks off, as Ted and John try their hardest to grow, mature and be able to separate themselves for the sake of John's relationship, all while a creepy fan of Ted's (Giovanni Ribisi) tries desperately to get him... even if it means he must kidnap the teddy-bear of his affections.The cast is a lot of fun. Whalberg and Kunis are a joy on-screen and have a great chemistry. Ted's voice by director MacFarlane is a lot of fun (although I think MacFarlane throws in too much crude humor through Ted, which does make him start to feel unlikable at times), and supporting roles by the likes of Ribisi, Matt Walsh and Joel McHale are also a lot of fun. In fact, I found some of the secondary characters (particularly McHale's slimy character) to be some of the most amusing.I was very surprised by Seth MacFarlane's visual direction, considering this was his first major live-action production. I found his direction to be quite slick, concise and even stylish at times. It was a refreshing change-up from the grittier or ""more realistic"" approach that too many movies (even comedies) try to utilyze these days. And I will admit that story-wise, MacFarlane's script (co-written with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild) does have a fairly solid structure, providing a decent (albeit basic) storyline where all major protagonists receive a fair balance of screen time and development. Also, the effects used to create Ted are fantastic. While he is a CG creation, the effects are life-like enough that once you get into the story, you forget that Ted isn't real, and just believe he's in the scene with the other actors. Wonderful effects work.However, despite a strong production and a likable cast, this film does have some major flaws, which is where it has to lose a few points, sadly. And it mainly boils down to its humor and content.MacFarlane has a very specific style of sort-of ""random comedy"", and his work does have a large amount of crudeness to it. And that was a big problem here. Too much of the film's humor was simply crude-for- the-sake-of-being-crude. And it felt like the film was struggling to prove how rude-and-crude it could be. And too many of the jokes were far too hit-and-miss. (Usually as a result of the crudeness.) Now, I have no problems with crude humor. But here, it just felt contrived at times. And unnecessary. And it does take you out of the film to an extent when such crass, rude humor is being shoveled into your face for no reason. I'll admit, I laughed at a lot of it, but there were several moments where I wouldn't laugh for 5-10 minutes, and would just stare at the screen, thinking ""Wow, they are trying TOO hard to be edgy and gross with the jokes, and it's just not working."" I really think the film would have been stronger if it pulled back during a few scenes and didn't shoehorn in so much contrived crude humor.And sadly, that's what took this film down from a very good 8 out of 10 for me, to a slightly above-average 6 out of 10. I really enjoyed this film. But the fact that it is so hit-and-miss from trying to force in so much crude humor is a big problem for a comedy. I can't on good conscience give a comedy a higher score if there are so many dead-spaces without laughs. But I stress that I still do really enjoy this film. And I hope the sequel has a better balance with its humor.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Teddy Boys,"With a new series about to air, I thought it was a good time to revisit the original ""Ted"" movie that's now over a decade old. I'm perhaps most interested in how the series will cope with the shifts in taste that have affected comedy recently.As a lonely child, John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) wished for his childhood teddy bear to come to life, and he did. Twenty years later, John and Ted (Seth MacFarlane) live together, with John's girlfriend, Lori (Mila Kunis). Due to Ted's influence, John isn't particularly career focused, preferring instead to smoke weed and watch TV. Lori isn't initially that bothered by this, but after four years, with marriage on the cards she comes to believe that some separation between the two wouldn't be a bad thing.It's very much the style of comedy that MacFarlane was working on in these years. Crude and sophomoric, which - as with something like ""Family Guy"" - has its cake and eats it too by putting it's more sexist and racist jokes in the voice of an idiot, generally in this case Ted himself. Before I sound too 'soapboxy' about it, I should say I did laugh several times during the film, though not as much as I thought I might. It's the bigger observational stuff that that's the funniest still like Ted's explanation of singing in 90s grunge bands or their obsession with Sam Jones and ""Flash Gordon"".The CGI work on Ted himself is really well done with the character flawlessly interacting with whatever he needs too, include a violent looking brawl later in the film. The performances are good, with perhaps Giovanni Ribisi proving the highlight.It'll be fascinating to watch the series as, as I said, the general trends in comedy have been towards a more positive and uplifting place than it was in the early 2010's. Even MacFarlane doesn't make comedy in this style anymore, or does he? We'll find out.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Enjoyable,"With Ted, MacFarlane managed to create a tale that seemed to be child oriented, but that is definitely for an adult audience.The movie is riddled with references and parodies; the dialogues fly, and the caustic humor is enjoyable even though it is quite uneven qualitatively.What can be blamed is the script, being easy and nice enough with this bland love story which contrasts with the quirkiness of the movie. MacFarlane could/should have really gone much further on that aspect.The direction is very good, the teddy bear animation is top-notch, and some scenes render very well like the fight at the hotel.",7.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Very good for 2012,"This movie is a perfect example of what happens when one relies on current topical humor to permeate a film. Some of that humor has not aged well. The underlying story is fine and clever and is done with a certain sweetness between John and Lori, which is timeless. John was never fitting in with his neighborhood kids, so when Ted came along, an instant bond was formed. And when a magical wish came true when John was 8 and Ted became alive, it was friends forever. But when a person is 35, as John is in the movie, that presents barriers. There is a humorous subplot where Ted has to get a job, so despite sabotaging the job at the grocery store, Ted gets more and more promotions. It is a fun movie with a lot of irreverence.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

"Legitimizing The ""Family Guy"" Humor Set","Because the ""Family Guy"" TV show has been on the air for over a decade now, there is an entire generation of comedy fans who have grown up with its raunchy, celebrity-bashing, voice-acting, frat-party style of humor. As such, a film like ""Ted"" can now wildly succeed in a contained theater format, and it does (in this case) with hilarious results.For a basic plot summary, ""Ted"" sees young John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) giving life to his childhood teddy bear (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) via a magical wish one long-ago Christmas night. Fast-forward about 26 years, however, and suddenly Ted is now a pot-smoking, wise- cracking, babe-chasing celebrity who keeps John from realizing his full potential. When girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) comes into John's life, John must ultimately choose between her and Ted in order to figure out what his future will hold.Quite obviously, this movie is made for the ""Family Guy set"". I mean, practically ever FG voice makes some kind of appearance here, and the jokes are of the same sort of crude/sexual/celebrity/juvenile nature. As such, I know a number of individuals who would walk out of the theater in disgust. For those who ""get it"", though, it is absolutely hilarious. I don't want to go into any details and ruin the fun of many of the film's best jokes, but suffice it to say that you'll never go more than a couple of minutes with a belly-laugh.Besides the jokes, the acting is also tremendous. Kunis is fast becoming the ""Queen of the rom- com"" and turns in another great performance here, while Wahlberg is convincing as a sort of ""Peter Pan"" character who is in no hurry to grow up. MacFarlane's voice of Ted (in which can be heard all of Peter, Brian, & Stewie from FG fame) never gets old either.Also, there is more to ""Ted"" than just comedy. It contains some impressive action sequences, as well as some character development and drama surpassing that which one would expect in movies that SHOULD showcase those things. This movie, despite the humor type, takes itself very seriously at its core and strives to provide more than just the laughs that one knows will exist coming in.In essence, ""Ted"" is a sort of ""coming of age"" for Seth McFarlane's unique set of skills. Whereas he once was thrown off FOX's airwaves for being a little too crude, he can now make a movie about a pot-smoking, expletive-spewing teddy bear that leads its opening weekend at the box office. Why the switch? Because, after years of honing his comedic style, MacFarlane found the right mix of actors and tone to produce a movie that stands up well on its own merits.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Starts off great but then descends in to standard Hollywood rubbish,"The problem with this film is that it sets itself up to be a pastiche on a children's story which is aimed at adults. By the end of the film however, it feels as though the producers are patronising its audience having forced them to sit through 100 minutes of recycled, unoriginal and highly formulaic ideas.Sure, there are a lot of laughs to be had along the way, but its not long before we start to see the characters develop in to their Hollywood stereotype. Kunis starts off funny and cute before quickly descending in to a wining, selfish stereotype who wants Wahlberg all to herself. The latter generally mopes around like a sad looking monkey in the last half of the film whilst also managing to over-egg it in the first.There are lots of Family Guy references throughout which do work well in live action, although they lack the sublime ridiculousness the cartoon format can bring.Overall, the film lost its way half way through which was a shame as the great CGI could have really made this one something to remember for years to come.",6.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Sure, there are a lot more in Family Guy, but they work because it is a cartoon, which is not real. Any person who experiences real life can look at this film and think ""Who says stuff like this?"" It just distracted me from the film whenever a character would say something pointless, which happens a lot.The story is predictable and I don't understand who the film's audience is. It makes references to Twitter and Katy Perry, then makes Flash Gordon jokes throughout.

Toilet Humor With Heart,"So many comedies these days stick to the foul-factor, how much can they gross everyone out while making jokes about drugs, alcohol, and sex without much context to it. Now, being R-rated, Ted, of course, has these references. But what I loved about it was that it still gave context.The story line is a bit silly (But a talking teddy bear is your main character, so that shouldn't shock anyone), but you find a connection with Mark Wahlberg's character and his struggles between the seriousness of his relationship and the want of having a care-free life with his best childhood friend, Ted. You even find some relationship with Ted as he learns to grow up beside his friend.Obscure references that few people can catch at first, wonderful music scores (provided by the Walter Murphy), great narrative by the ever- famous Patrick Stewart, great acting from the cast (yes, even the CG bear), cameos from celebrities (one that caught me extremely off-guard), and an appropriate amount of toilet humor makes Ted well-worth the watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Best Comedy Film of 2012,"In a Comedy Film i only give 10s if laugh like I gotta pee from beginning to end. That being said.This in the canvas that Seth MacFarlane needed set aside from TV. This merger of Universal Pictures and Seth MacFarlane will be known for making the BEST COMEDY FILM OF 2012.They tried this type of comedy before with HOP but Universal Pictures was only able to do OK. Even though it was a Easter release. This is Different. It Looks Like a Teddy Bear but sounds like Family Guy with a Unrated mouth. I mean your gonna get a bit of everything. Kool Narration, a beginning, plot and a ending. Its a full package filmGreat acting is seeing Mark Wahlberg (John Bennett)interact with ted like he was a actual human instead of a stuffed bear running with cgi graphic movements. You truly believe they are best buds for over 20 years. Mila Kunis is awesome as (Lori Collins)girlfriend to John. She too plays off the bear so nicely. You have to understand that when the actors act with ted, they are just talking to props or just air. Its like a Saturday Night Live skit that calls for two characters but your the only living actor.You will laugh and you will cry from laughing so hard either way don't be without the thunder buddies in the movie ted.I JUST WISH THEY WOULD SELL THE TEDDY BEAR :(It looks like a Teddy Bear but talks like a Rated R movie Moms",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A New Low,"I decided that I would sit down with my twenty-five year-old (yes, I know) brother today, and maybe even try to bond with him. Instead, he decided to put on Ted and I died a little bit on the inside.Ted follows the misadventures of a loud-mouthed, misogynistic, homophobic, and malicious stuffed bear who just so happens to talk and still live with his original owner, That Guy. That Guy is generic and never really does anything interesting. Miraculously, he managed a relationship with the lovely Mila Kunis for four years, but even that one is still a mystery of convenience....And as I watched this, I couldn't help but notice how awful the writing was, too. It's like the movie was made for a twelve year-old child with no sense of right and wrong, or compassion. To enjoy something like this, you would have to be majorly baked. Otherwise, there's no hope for you as a human being. Sorry! You can roll your eyes at me as much as you want and say that I don't have a sense of humor, but you probably know that there is some truth in what I'm saying.Ted is a repulsive, brainless comedy...Quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made. The fact that it's so over-rated disgusts me more than the millions of women who call the anti-feminist drivel, Twilight, a must see. (Self-hate, much?)",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Daft and sexist,"I don't get it. What's funny about a teddy bear misbehaving? Or am I not the target group (being 36?)? Certain teenagers may find this kind of pointless movie funny with sexist jokes, sexy women and... well that's it. I thought we'd seen enough of these kind of movies with 30 plus men not willing to grow up and having to make a choice between friends/a friend and a woman. Perhaps it's an American thing but I find it totally impossible to relate to these kind of ""choices"" in real life (being a woman)- between a partner and friends (most people I know including myself have BOTH friends and partners) and nor can I relate to 35 plus men behaving like the main character, unless they are totally losers. There seems to be no point with having a teddy bear as a friend, a part from it's OK to cuddle each other in a boyish way (obviously there just had to be a fart sound to make it OK to stay close when THUNDER comes along) It's SAD and I found it painful to watch as I kind waited for the real plot and some more action to come along, which just didn't happen. I am glad I rented just it on DVD.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Funniest movie in 2012... if you are having a crush on Peter Griffin.,"I heard great things about this movie, but was mildly disappointed when three of my good friends just gave it shitty review. So I definitely lowered my expectations a lot before watching this movie. Boy, was I wrong! What I forgot to ask my friends about, was; Do you like Family Guy? I'll bet they doesn't. Otherwise they wouldn't give this movie anything else than sparkling stars.You can say a lot about Mark Wahlberg's acting, and as usual he should have stayed a model for Calvin Klein instead of going to acting classes. However, Seth MacFarlane's twisted sense of humor carries this movie to perfection - and of course the hottest girl on earth; Mila Kunis.The plot it self is not something spectacular, and you have a feeling through out the movie, that you already know the ending. It is the very classic ménage à trois, triangle drama. The childhood friend who hold the main character back from dealing with real and grownup life including his true love. BUT - this is not the purpose of the movie. The purpose of this movie is to make you laugh. And it does. There are so many awesome references to different characters from the 80's, Family Guy, etc.It took me about 10 minutes to abstract from the familiar voices of Family Guy (Joe, Peter and to some extend Meg - you know Mila Kunis face and voice, so not so much her), but as soon as you let the movie and characters suck you into this vortex of dark twisted humor you have a hard time of letting go.I gave it 10 out of 10. Not so much for the plot, but for the purpose of this comedy.I have a major crush on Family Guy and the humor.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
best movie ever,Best movie ever period. Great Movie for a real date because this is funny for the both of you. Plus it tells a story about growing up about life that there is a time you will grow out of things but you will never forget them. If you also want to see a movie just as good but if better than the hangover and 21 jump street than see this the is movie. Even if you think family guy is dumb and dull you will still like this. so the next your girlfriend wants to go see a movie make its sure Ted Not Some male stripper movie.

"Yep, this is from the executive producer of Neil deGrasse Tyson's updated version of ""Cosmos""","Seth MacFarlane is one of those guys who splits everyone. People either love him or hate him. And this tale of a wise-ass Teddy bear almost certainly did so. ""Ted"" is fun to watch just because it knows exactly what kind of a movie it is and lets everything out, as did MacFarlane's later ""Million Ways to Die in the West"". There's pot-smoking, defecation, and high jinx at work. This must be what people mean when they say Boston strong!Basically, it's an excuse to let your inner thirteen-year-old. You'll like it if you accept low, blatantly silly humor. I did.In conclusion, it looks as though we're not alone now after all!",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Awesome comedy!,"It takes a lot for a comedy to truly make me laugh but this movie succeeded more than once! Guess this is really a movie that speaks to me, not so much with just its story and concept but more with its references and other little things that can be found in this movie.The premise of this movie probably doesn't sound all that appealing to most and actually also lets this movie sound like a very typical, predictable and childish, gimmicky movie, that relies solely on the premise of having a talking teddy bear in it. But the movie is surprisingly clever and doesn't become a predictable or lame on in any way. It also most definitely is not a childish movie. Quite the contrary! It's an at times rude and cruel movie, filled with plenty of sex, booze and drugs as well.In essence it's being a very simple and straightforward movie. It really doesn't have an all that complicated story to it but it still remains a well written movie, that flows well and barely has any misses or other weaknesses in it. It's a very consistent movie you could say, that doesn't ever goes overboard with anything and somehow manages to keep things fresh, interesting and funny, all throughout.The movie really has some great and fun characters in it, which is also being one of the main reasons why this movie remains such a likable and fun one. It doesn't just center on the Ted character but also on the human character played by Mark Wahlberg. And this movie is finally being one in which Mark Wahlberg is playing a different and certainly also very likable character. Honestly, if you are a Mark Wahlberg hater you still might very well end up liking this movie and even Mark Wahlberg in his role.The movie of course also works out well because Ted is being a convincing character in the movie. He really is a walking and talking teddy bear, that doesn't look fake in anyway. The movie uses some great effects for him!No matter how bad or silly this movie might sound to you; just give it a shot! Changes really are that you will end up liking- or maybe even loving it.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Absolutely hilarious from beginning to end.,"My summary is pretty self-explanatory. This is the first comedy I can remember in a very long time where I have laughed this much from beginning to end. It is easily the must see comedy of the summary if not the year. The writing from director Seth Mcfarland is nothing less then I expected from him. I am not a regular viewer of Family Guy although I have caught a few episodes here and their but I have seen the last few Comedy Central Roasts in which he has hosted and he is among the funniest presents in that series I have seen.In short, I urge anyone who has not seen this yet and is questioning whether to go see it, to not hesitate for a second and definitely go out and see it. It is obviously not intended for children so do keep that in mind, other then that, prepare to lose a few calories through laughter.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
If you need about an hour and a half of nonstop laughter...,"I'm going to try and make this short and simple. Reasons for 10:            1. This is a great movie to watch in theaters; you get to burst out laughing as loud as you can because literally everyone else is doing the same thing.2. The plots of comedies are hardly ever very good because the main focus is laughter, but Ted will keep you glued to your seat. I had to pee so bad halfway through I could barely stand it, but I didn't want to miss any of it so I waited.3. (Bonus) If you're a Family Guy fan, you'll love that it has most of the main voice actors from the show in it, and it contains a couple or few references to it as well.Go see it.

Ted the only toy who can't give you joy,"This infamy begins with the presentation of John Bennett, a child who has trouble integrating into a group of friends or at school things are not so good, being a mockery to all. He receives by Christmas from his parents a teddy bear. One night he puts a desire, that his toy to become alive. His dream is fulfilled, he wakes up next morning with a bear very much alive. Years went by and John is now 35 years old has a beautiful girlfriend by four years and of course his friend who made a pact with how they will be friends for life. John uses to smoke the bong with him, be lazy on the couch watching TV shows, swear and drink beer after beer. Seeing that his friend has not matured and not behave as an adult man, she gives him an ultimatum to get rid of Ted for them to see their life and threatens to leave him. If not then she will be the one to go and will end their relation. Just because some obsessed fans of Ted and happenings that they will pass, he will make Lori to change its mind about him.Honestly when I saw the scenes from the beginning when John was a child I was ready to give this movie a high note but when John was on the couch and talked with Ted in the first 5 minutes made me change my mind and give it the lowest grade and nothing of what would have happened in the rest of the film would make me change my mind. Again I can not believe this b-s has a note so high. What happens to you people? What if this film will be watched by a child? What will learn from it?

Sophomoric Craziness,"I'm an old guy, but I also can take a joke. My son encouraged me to join him for this movie. I found it quite engaging. There are films that are deliberately crude, hitting the lowest common denominator. Others have deep charm (sort of the ET complex). This film manages to take that charm which we occasionally fall for, and put a bullet in its head. It is full of great lines (listen for the beginning Apache helicopter bit) and sight gags. Some don't work, but most do, and what we haves one strange film. Family Guy knows no boundaries and so it's not surprising that the film is the same. Ted is a mess. He is the victim of the fate of the child actor (although he is a rather nondescript Teddy bear). Mark Walberg is just vacuous enough to pull this off. It may be his best role because he has to show a balance of kindness and utter stupidity when it comes to his old friend. They are comrades in arms and when romance comes in, the bear is going to take first place. This is wonderfully creative and engaging. Ted should get a couple of Golden Globe nominations (I mean the bear, not the movie).",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

AWESOME comedy!,"I immediately voted this a 9-star. But a day later, I've upped my opinion to full 10-stars. I cannot think of a way to improve TED. It was simply hilarious.As you might suspect, there's a lot of stupid humor in TED. When I saw the dumb jokes coming, I would mentally prepare myself to simply hold my breath until it was over, knowing that more intelligent humor would follow. But more often than I care to admit, the ""dumb"" humor wore me down until I burst out laughing like I haven't laughed at a movie since PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES or FAMILY VACATION. In my opinion, TED is an instant classic like those movies.Sure, TED is offensive and gross. But it's freakin' funny.I heard the ""FAMILY GUY"" connection only *after* seeing the movie. I had no idea who Seth MacFarlane was, nor this movie's relationship to FAMILY GUY. Full disclosure: I cannot stand Family Guy. I tried watching it long ago, like three times. Each time I lasted about two minutes and had to turn it off. Just terrible. But TED is hilarious. So if you hate Family Guy, that doesn't necessarily mean you won't laugh at TED.There are lines, entire scenes, and facial expressions re-running through my head all day today.Full-stars, thumbs up, all that.

One of the worst movies ever,This is 2 hours of my lift that I will never get back. What's the point to this movie. VERY disappointing. Who would ever read this script and think it was something worth making. How can these actors think - WOW - this is a movie I would love to be in??? by 1/2 way through the movie I was trying to look for a spot that I actually thought was funny. I was working at trying to laugh and could still not find anything to laugh at. This ranks up there with Little Nicky and Zoolander as one of the worst movies I ever watched - and paid for viewing it to add insult to injury. My advise - don't bother.

Interesting movie,"When you first look at this movie, you think it would be a kids movie because it's the story of a teddy bear and a grown man's friendship. Then you're like amazed that it's rated R instead of G or PG. Most parents would think 1st it's a movie for their children. But it's weird that it's not. It's funny how grown men like me plan to watch this movie. Cause usually girls watch movies that involve teddy bears. As for this teddy bear, Ted acts more of a man than just a teddy bear. He has a job, girlfriend, and loves to party and relax. Seth MacFarlane was a good choice to play the part of Ted. Ted and Peter Griffin are similar in many ways. They love to do stupid things to be funny. And they'll do anything to just slack off. Many children treat their stuffed animals as if they were family to them. As a young boy, John thought of Ted as his little brother. They loved to be together. Since John couldn't make friends, he chose Ted to be his friend. John said he's always there for him and he listens to his problems carefully. Over the years, they become adults and all they wanna do is party. Ted is more of a partygoer than John. John just wanted to have a normal life like any other man on Earth. But Ted just thinks fun is more important. It sure did bite the dust when Ted got a job he didn't want. Ted is sure enough to be a ladies man or should I say a ladies bear lol? Every girl knows what he does to please them. He is who they want to make love. Milan Kunis was a great actress. I can picture her who gets annoyed by Ted. Like when Meg Griffin gets annoyed by her family lol. I would watch the movie repeatedly. It was a great set-up. Great dialogue, characters, setting, and plot. A regular man and a teddy bear makes a powerful friendship. You mess with Ted, and the fight will be unBEARable haha",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

One a kidified pile of Disneyish crap and the other an adult comedy.. Sadly due to that conflict it ultimately fails miserably. :(Many of us had such high hopes for this movie and I cannot fault the cast. But the screenplay creators / director dropped the ball on this one. It could have been a true classic.. but instead is destined to be a dust collector in the bargain bin.I hate to say it but for Seth MacFarlane fans.. as well as fans of Mark and Mila... skip it.. far too many will be bitterly disappointed.Oh and a FYI.. my wife and my brother in law.. also big fans of Seth feel very much the same on this film.,5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
straight into my top 10 comedies,"this is just...hilarious. and i mean gut bustingly hilarious. it has been a while since i laughed this hard watching a comedy. its Seth's signature slightly childish but at the same time clever comedy and i loved every second of it.obviously the premise is about a boy and his bear who he wished could really talk when just coincidentally a shooting star pops along (when you wish upon a star) and he comes to life. he's at first surprised, but accepts it quickly. The parents reactions by the way are quite funny.after Ted's celebrity status and Patrick Stewart's fantastic narration, Ted and john have grown up and smoke weed, laze about the house and discuss some hilarious ideas. the jokes are quite often inconsistent but hilarious all the same, especially when Ted gets job (i won't ruin it for you, but its one of the best parts of the film, although its a bit short)i know I'm using the word hilarious a lot, but that is the keyword in this film. its typical Seth and thats what we want, thats what we got and i loved it.there's only 2 things that i didn't really like. the first was mark Wahlberg's accent. most of it wasn't bad its just every time he said a word with an -r at the end made him sound like a total ass. its only nitpicking though and doesn't affect the overall film.the second was that the film, although brilliant, wasn't really that quotable. there's no lines that could be repeated in everyday conversation unless set up which to be honest, is a once every so often opportunity, and by then you may have already forgot.overall, its brilliant. utterly utterly brilliant. i see people have panned this film for its childishness and inconsistency. sorry people, these are attributes of Seth. its what we love him for. we wont expect anymore, or any less.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Mark W. is a good actor I am surprised he chose such such a bad movie. Not at all appropriate for children. It has a dumb plot with a real bad sense of humor. On a rating of 1 to 10 I give it a 1. It is a real bad film, I thought there was more creativity in Hollywood. It probably is a low budget film. It could have been a nice movie if many changes would have taken effect.

Gen Y trash,"Although I've watched South Park and Family Guy, some of the vulgar content in this movie made me uncomfortable. This movie just had too much profanity and obscenity for my taste. Some jokes were overused and funny at first, got old very fast. As a result, the movie dragged, became boring and a waste of time. I didn't find Ted likable at all. Plus, Seth MacFarlane didn't attempt to give him a voice different from Peter in Family Guy so every time Ted spoke I imagined Peter from Family Guy. That's just lazy on Seth MacFarlane's part. And I find Peter one of the least likable characters on Family Guy which may have played a huge part in my disliking of this movie. The plot is not good. In fact, it feels quite juvenile compared to the writing on Family Guy. There is still much was left to be desired in the story.

alot of adult hillarous jokes,"Ted,a film by Seth MacFarlane , is a adult comedy that required a parental guidance
There is really only one joke in ""Ted"" - a toy bear comes to life and turns out to have a filthy mouth and a taste for weed - but the movie's attempts at humor can nonetheless be sorted into a few distinct categories. There are jokes that are funny only because a stuffed bear says them, jokes that are not funny even though a stuffed bear says them and jokes that may or may not be funny because of Mark Wahlberg. Mila Kunis is also in the movie, but she can't be funny because she's a girl, and her job is to be amused, tolerant and pretty.Tolerant amusement is pretty much the best this harmless little picture, directed by Seth MacFarlane from a script he wrote with Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild, is able to manage, even though it strives for obnoxious hilarity. The cleverly animated ursine title character, voiced in an exaggerated Boston bray by Mr. MacFarlane himself, is a fire hose of vulgarity, ethnic insult, homophobia and misogyny. In the modern, meta manner he (that is, Mr. MacFarlane) wants both to indulge and to deny the offensiveness of this material, to wallow in ugliness and make fun of it too. It's a wasted effort though. The sin of ""Ted"" is not that it is offensive but that it is boring, lazy and wildly unoriginal. If Triumph the Insult Comic Dog ever got a hold of Ted, there would be nothing left but a pile of fluff and a few scraps of fur.

Ted's Dead,"Possibly the least funny 'comedy' I've ever had to sit through, which was a shock for me, since the creators of Family Guy, a show I love, were involved.I think this entire movie falls on its own rump if the novelty of a swearing, weed-smoking teddy bear wears off at any point. For me it took about five minutes.After that it was just a slew of simple, crude 'jokes' that never hit their mark due to their reliance on the teddy-bear vehicle.The bear itself was an irritating character, completely unlikable in every regard, and what was up with Mark Wahlbergs' accent? Are there really Americans with dialects as ridiculous as that? It sounded like he was chewing words rather than saying them.All in all, juvenile, and not even funny with it.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Very funny for MacFarlane's first film,"""ted"" is a film that may have a teddy bear in it, but it's definitely not for the kids. Within the first 10 minutes of the film, you hear the worst four letter word used in a religious sense. But the audience went crazy, that was when i knew that this film was something different. For those of you who don't know what ""ted"" is about, it starts about this kid named John Bennet ( a very unpopular kid, so unpopular that he envies the Jewish kids that gets beat up) and on Christmas Day he gets a teddy bear that he names ""teddy"". After a while, he knights Teddy with the honor of being his best friend for life (or as they say in the film ""thunder buddies for life""). And on one night, he wishes that Teddy could really talk. Low and behold, the next day, Teddy CAN really talk! Instantly he becomes famous, but it wears out over time. Skip about 30 years or so and it's the present day where John and Ted are still Thunder Buddies. Instead of having movie nights and riding in soap box cars, they're smoking pot and watching their favorite movie, ""Flash Gordon"" (which is very important later on). John (played by Mark Wahlberg) now has a girlfriend of four years, Lori (played by Mila Kunis) and she expects John to grow up and move on with his life, Ted just being the obstacle. It's like every other buddy film, but the buddy is a very irresponsible teddy bear. I think what makes this movie work is the fact that Ted can do things and say things that we wish we could but never had the heart to do it, also because he's a teddy bear. The intriguing thing about this movie is how it never slows down, there are parts that are meant to be serious but then after a second, Ted says something that'll have you on the ground laughing hard. I was extremely impressed by the plot, sure it sounds so overused, but MacFarlane doesn't overdo it, he compliments the characters, so to speak. Also the jokes are very in your face and laugh out loud funny. Defiantly keeps in style with the ""Family Guy"" humor that we all know and love. The acting given by Kunis and Wahlberg is really good and you could really feel the tension and the love between them. But the kudos goes to the bear. MacFarlane gives a voice that really speaks, curses, and does other naughty things. This movie would be called ""all about a bear"" but i believe that it's really about friendship over the years.

Celebration of mediocrity,"I have to confess that I have seen many bad movies in my life. This (so-called) comedy really makes the highest ranking so far. The director/screenwriter/narrator of Ted demonstrates a very restrictive and particular sense of humour that insists on highlighting sexual extravaganza over and over again. Believe it or not, there is actually a love story. By confusing ""being funny"" with ""being vulgar"", that story however gets lost pretty quickly. I saw no point in watching this movie till the end... to what end anyway? Since religious language is also abused all the time in pointless dialogues, maybe a prayer will serve as an appropriate conclusion: O Lord, have mercy!",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Unbearable,"A grown man lives with a talking teddy bear, which makes his girlfriend unhappy. The stuffed toy not only talks, but he spews profanity, drinks beer, smokes pot, and is sex-crazed. Isn't that hilarious? This movie is for those who find this concept irresistibly funny. The keyword here is ""concept,"" because other than being foul-mouthed, the little guy doesn't say anything funny. The dialog and situations are painfully lacking in humor and the film goes on much too long. Not only is Macfarlane's script lacking in wit, but he wallows in phony sentimentality and sappy romance, making it unbearable. Wahlberg is a limited actor who is not suited to dumb comedies. He should stick with dumb action movies.",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Maybe This Movie Isn't For ""Family Guy"" Fans","I watched Ted, then went through many of the user reviews on IMDb afterward. It surprised me that so many people who disliked Ted were Family Guy fans. I'm the opposite: I've seen very little of Family Guy and never particularly cared for it, but loved this movie.First and foremost, it was an amazing accomplishment to make Ted as realistic as he was. The animation was flawless. And the actors were very convincing in their interactions with a character that didn't actually exist when they were filming their scenes. Yes, the humor was raunchy, but apparently I was in a mood for raw humor that day. The acting was very good, and the evil father-and-son team were actually convincing, despite (or perhaps because of) the father's comically-spastic dancing.A lot of Family Guy fans complained that they were troubled that most of the familiar Family Guy cast was brought in and used in a different context for this film. But since I don't watch Family Guy and was unencumbered by any such troubles, I just thought it was a very enjoyable, well made comedy -- with very credible dramatic and romantic overtones.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Don't bring the kids, bring a bong!","Ted is an awesome film.Young John Bennet wishes that his Teddy Bear could be his best friend forever. He gets that wish: a walking, talking, living Teddy Bear. This is them as adults: pot-smoking underachievers, with gorgeous girlfriends who love them for their personalities.STORY: 4 out of 5The story is a bit familiar. We've seen the best buddy comedy before. However, we've never seen it with a talking Teddy Bear who smokes pot and drives.The characters are set up very well, and we get to feel for these people. While many movies blast through scenes, trying to get to some climactic point, this movie takes its time -- but not too much time -- and lets us feel these people and relate to them.The couple is already together, so we don't have to suffer through a budding romance movie again. However, the romance gets in the way of the friendship between Ted and John, which is what the movie is really about.I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's for lovers of Family Guy / American Dad, it's for lovers of Stoner flicks and comedy. GO WATCH TED!!!WARNING Warning: this film is not for everyone. Do not take your kids. This is an R-Rated movie dealing with drugs, hookers, creepy fanatics, creepy bosses, and sex in public. On top of that, there is a lot of strong language and sexual references.",10.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A terrorist attack on our values ​​as a society.,"This film tells the story of John Bennett and his teddy bear. On a beautiful Christmas, and thanks to a desire he asked, this teddy bear came to life. However, as it's not very common to see a grown man with his absolutely delinquent teddy bear, this friendship is destined to pass by severe difficulties.This film was an idea of ​​Seth MacFarlane, who signs ""Family Guy,"" an American series of humor for adults. And in fact, only a head as damaged and distorted like his could think of ruining the teddy bears, a symbol of our childhood and innocence, putting one of them to do a huge amount of obscenities in a two-hour movie. The film puts Ted to behave like an idiot, to swear and say profanities as if he were reciting Shakespeare instead, and to use drugs and drinking as the world were to end tomorrow and the best thing to do was to turning back in human evolution. In addition to this authentic apology to animality, imbecility and consumption of drugs and alcohol, the film also puts Ted practically defending the ""theory"" that being a pervert is simply great, and a great proof of manhood.I don't consider myself an ultraconservative nor a moralist, but the truth is our society didn't need this kind of movies. There are more interesting ways of doing comedy. To making people laugh isn't need to attack the moral and social values ​​in which we create our children and stand our nation. We live in days of great confusion, it seems that what is evil has become good. And movies like this only serve to prove it.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Bear-faced low-brow fun.,"As the result of a childhood Christmas wish, John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) has been best friends with his walking, talking, very-much-alive teddy bear Ted (Seth MacFarlane) for the past twenty seven years; together, they hang out and enjoy the finer things in life, like quality weed and repeat viewings of camp sci-fi classic Flash Gordon. Things look set to change, however, when John's girlfriend of four years, Lori (Mila Kunis), suggests that the time has come for her boyfriend to become a more responsible person and for Ted to finally find a place of his own.With Ted, writer/director/performer Seth MacFarlane has made one of the few films to star Mark Wahlberg that I actually like (the others being Fear and Boogie Nights). Of course, my enjoyment of Ted has very little do with its leading man, but a lot to do with MacFarlane's laugh-out-loud, unapologetically politically-incorrect script, his confident direction and hilarious voice-over work. It doesn't hurt either that the film features the lovely Mila Kunis as John's love interest, a brilliant self-mocking cameo from none other than Flash Gordon himself, Mr Sam Jones, and top-notch special effects that ensure that the film titular character is someone (something?) you can really care about.7.5/10, happily rounded up to 8 for having Ted beat the crap out of Wahlberg.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Corny romance trying too hard to be politically incorrect - or are we Europeans too jaded?,"While I enjoyed some of the jokes and laughed a couple of times, it felt like McFarlane was trying to be politically incorrect for the heck of it. Especially since the incorrectness is actually rather clichéd and will not be hurting many people's feelings, at least here in Europe.To make doubly sure that no feelings get hurt, McFarlane wraps the jokes in a tidy package of harmless romantic comedy with cardboard-cutout actors, predictable plot and corny happy ending, that will soothe and reassure the viewer with the palette of emotions that he is accustomed to find in most Hollywood blockbusters.Do yourself a favor -- skip this movie and watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail (for the 100th time) instead!",3.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ted is a good movie,"Ted is the story of cereal killer Ted Bundy, and honestly it is the Boogieman Nights of cereal killer movies. Ted Bundy is played by that guy from New Kids of the Block Mark Wakeboard and he underplays the roll. Right down to having a stuffed animal sidekick. True crime filmss are always upsettling because you know the factual facts are facts. It's the visual depiction of true life, which adds some sort of authentification to the filmss. Ted starts out as a normal everyday kid with no friends, and the Jewish kids scream at him all the time, then he wishes for a friend in his stuffed animal. He then shows his parents his ""alive"" bear, after they freak out they are never seen again, we are lead to believe he killed his parentsoffscreen. Then for the next two hours Ted and his bear just kind of walk around Boston meeting Tom Skerritt fans and watching Cheers. Then they hang out with Flash Gordon and David Putty for awhile. They meet Ryan Reynolds too and you hope Ted ices him after what he did to The Green Arrow franchise, but then the movie sort of just ends.All in all I would say Mike Walkburg wsas OK as Tedd Bundy but I would have preferred to see more than him just doing bong hits and giving people keys to rental cars. If your looking for a good cereal killer movie look to Love and Other Drugs or Bride Wars.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Worst movie of the year??,"This movie is everything that is wrong with movies today. Not one part of this movie made me even break a smile. It wasn't funny, it was stupid. Mark Wahlburg still breathes every line he speaks...Mila Kunis can act at least but is the only redeeming quality about this piece of sh*t movie. Seth Macfarlane IS NOT FUNNY by anyones standard. They only people who should find this movie funny are teenage boys who think that fart jokes and jokes about actual sh*t are funny. Any adult that finds the movie enjoyable must have something wrong with them because this is the stupidest movie I have even seen.

Funniest movie of the year,"Mila Kunis, Mark Wahlberg and Seth McFarlane, just from knowing that I knew that I had to see Ted.This film is the epitome of hilarious, I laughed from beginning to end and I'm sure you will too, as long as you aren't easily offended. Mila and Mark have good chemistry and their performances were very strong. Seth McFarlane's wit and sarcasm was evident in the script and the crude humor of Family Guy was present throughout the film. I won't recommend this film for anyone under 13 however adults will thoroughly enjoy the movie. The plot is basic, nothing phenomenal but the humor and wit along with the cast makes this movie just plain old fun.I don't want to spoil anything but there are a few cameo appearances from celebrities such as Norah Jones and Ryan Reynolds as well as several cross references to pop culture for humor. If you're in the mood for a great and hearty laugh, Ted is definitely the movie for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A few good moments but not enough,"The concept is stupid, the jokes seem forced and vulgar, the acting is weak at best, the characters are predictable and never connect with the viewers so why watch this movie you ask? That's a tough question to answer but the truth is there were some quite humorous moments, some really funny scenes, some very funny one liners and joke sequences, and therefore I'd say the movie was worth viewing just for those few selected moments. Overall this one was just a so-so effort. I think it also could of been somewhat shorter in length as the funny lost its way and at times really dragged. I'm a big Mark Wahlberg fan, and while this isn't an example of his best work, it is still funny enough, and clever enough to earn a 5 out of 10 rating.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Way more funny than I expected!,"My wife and I were out for dinner and decided at the last minute to see a movie. I saw that Ted had gotten some good critical reviews and that fans on Fandango said ""Must Go."" We got the theater right on time but found out it was sold out. I was shocked but intrigued, so we decided to wait an hour for next showing. Turns out that the theater had added an additional showing, again making me more curious about this movie. We sat down and watched the seating completely fill out.From start to finish, I was pleasantly surprised by the entertainment value of this movie. I was laughing so much at times that my stomach hurt, and so was my wife who rarely finds raunchy humor amusing. But it also has a fairly deep story about friendship. The acting was fantastic and the editing superb; at no time did it drag.But I don't want to build it up too much. Part of the reason we enjoyed it so much is because we weren't expecting much. Go see it, I agree with the Fandangoians. Warning: Definitely NOT for kids or for those who are easily offended, but it does manage to offend everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

FINALLY a GOOD Summer movie!,"If it wasn't for The Avengers, I would say that so far, this summer is full of duds. Thankfully, Ted came out and I have to say it was really good. Thank you, Jesus, I can honest say a movie was good after walking out of the theater!First and foremost, and this was already in the trailers, but I really like the setup to the story. It's narrated like some fairy tale and this unpopular kid gets a magical teddy bear for Christmas who can interact with him and everyone else. The true story, however, is when they grow up and how their lives are.When I first saw the trailers, I thought I was high watching it. After seeing the movie, they must have been high making it. In fact, Teddy and Marky Mark are getting high an awful lot in the movie! But their a few things along the way that surprised me. Like the chemistry between Marky Mark Mila Kunis. It was very good! Not only that, Mila acted her butt off in a movie about a Teddy bear. Don't believe me, there is this scene where she gets really mad at him outside Ted's place, and it was a very solid performance. I was actually convinced that she was irate with him! What's odd is that a movie about a talking Teddy bear actually worked on an emotional level. That's no small feat! And the fact that the Teddy Bear sounds just like Peter Griffin and it made me feel something is also amazing!If there are a few things to gripe about, I would have to say that the Marky Mark character is almost too much of an idiot throughout the movie. I also have a hard time understanding why someone as hot as Mila would even stay with some a weirdo too.The movie is pretty funny and it is very entertaining. It's not the funniest movie I've ever seen but it does get the job done. After seeing Black Dynamite for the first time last night, the bar was set a little too high for this film anyway. Highly recommended though.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy

Enough with Fenway already! Mila Kunis looks amazing, but there's only so much the hot chick can do. So the first half has some frat boy funnies...then it just gets boring. The Flash Gordon references are just too much...campy at first then just lame. Mark Wahlberg tries...and when he sings I had a Dirk Diggler flashback, but the whole Norah Jones tie-in is just another boy-must-win-back-girl after bad boy behavior by humiliating self in public rehash.

Rofl,Ted was a great funny movie that provided many laughs and comedic moments Seth Mc Farlin did not disappoint. The way i see this movie is like Stewie from family guy grew up with his bear Rupert and the bear came to life and now he still lives with the bear. This movie will have you rolling on the floor laughing the whole movie from beginning to end with some aw how cute moments. Even after all the fowl language and all the bad attitude from Ted you still love that fuzzy little rascal. Add this movie to your collection as soon as possible its great and epic awesomeness.

I suppose they might be funny in an episode of the Family Guy, but for me they fell flat.

"If you are an adult male watching movie with one or more of same, it's hilarious!","I've been a fan of Seth McFarlane's animated comedy shows as a great, end of the day escape, turn off the brain and laugh at how silly we are when we try to take ourselves too seriously. As a middle-age, middle-class American man, the humor and even cultural references hit my funny bone.
Ted has some similar hooks, like the self-deprecating, lovable loser ""head of household""- John Bennett in Ted, although not yet married with kids, is a bit like Peter Griffin in Family Guy or Stan Smith in American Dad. John's quirky friendship with his childhood teddy bear Ted, who has magically come to life, is funny by nature much like the Griffins with their dog Brian in Family Guy, or the Smiths and their ""pets"" (or hostages) Roger the alien and Claus the fish in American Dad. Rather than these ""pets"" being simply cute and innocent, they cuss, have sex, and sometimes seriously screw with the lives of their owners.
McFarlane must have realized A cute stuffed animal can get away with saying things or doing things that would seem disturbed, vulgar, or prejudiced if done by a person, and McFarlane gets a lot of mileage out of that setup!
After Ted gets a job at the grocery store, there is a hilarious progression with Ted talking back to his boss and (literally) screwing around while on the clock, and it results in his boss promoting him. There is satire throughout the movie on how the characters relate to their work, and the power relationship between bosses and workers. Lori and John's bosses have inflated view of the social status bestowed on them via their job title, not realizing no one else takes them seriously. John needs to get serious about work and can't conceive that maybe hanging out with his teddy bear and getting high might be screwing up his life!
Meanwhile Ted could care less about work, but gets away with everything and even get promoted.
Another funny scene is when John and Lori come back from a nice dinner and Ted is partying in the apartment with a group of prostitutes, as Ted sits on the couch surrounded by these scantily-clad women he says something like, ""somewhere there is a group of horrible, deadbeat fathers out there I'd like to thank for giving me this night with you girls."" This little sociological insight is actually kind of sad, but it comes across as hilarious when spoken by this cute little teddy bear.
Beneath the surface of funny lines and sight gags there is this layer of comedy about social class and conflict, dead-end jobs, relationships, and even sociopathic over-indulgent parenting.
Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis both gave solid performances, also want to mention Jessica Barth in perhaps the best performance in the movie as Ted's girlfriend Tami-Lynn.",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
right up my alley....  in the dumpster!,"I thought I'd note, so that you guys/gals don't think I'm some sort of religious fanatic, or someone who's easily offended - I'm neither.This movie is awful.The jokes aren't funny. I connected with some of the 80's nostalgia early in the film, and laughed at an early ""Saturday Night Fever"" bit, but for the most part.... awful.One of the worst movies I've seen in a while.I gave ""Waiting"" a 72/100,.. and ""Office Space"" showed that one of these novice directors from TV fame could deliver a comedic masterpiece(gave that 95/100 - right there with Swingers and Anchorman as some of my favorite comedies of the last two decades).""ted"" has little to no comedic value. There are two jokes in the film. One is over-regurgitated use of the f-bomb, and the other is any poke at religion. In either case the jokes aren't funny. It's almost as if Seth is making up for his censorship on television, and sorry Seth it comes of as ""you don't have anything better/funnier to say"".The film is quick to tell the audience about the heartfelt connection between it's lead and his Teddy bear, but their love for one another isn't developed at all. Their only connection seems to be the desire to smoke pot.... something else I don't have a problem with... or did at one time if you catch my drift... either way... those jokes aren't funny either.I spent the last two weeks stopping at nearly every rental machine in SE Tennessee to find this thing because it looked to be right up my alley. I guess you could say I did have high expectations, but anyone that thinks this film is anywhere close to it's current rating must also be high. Which is fine, but a lot of party animals think ""Half-baked"" is a masterpiece too. Actually, ""half-baked - 52/100"" might be considered a masterpiece next to this piece of junk.I like the Family Guy, but Seth McFarland has a real stinker here with ""Ted"".

Fantastic summer movie a must see!!,"I thought that TED was a brilliant film, because of all the publicity I did worry that people would expect too much and therefore it would not be as funny, however I was pleasantly surprised. It is typical Seth MacFarlane with hilarious gags that just toe the line, there are some references to family guy for his fans but he doesn't overdo it allowing people that are not familiar with his work to enjoy what he brings to the movie. Of course many of the actors have worked with MacFarlane before but the clever thing is that quite a lot of people even Family Guy and American Dad fans would not recognize them because MacFarlane is famous for cartoons, therefore the actors are given a chance to shine on screen instead of being an animated character. However I do think some of the gags may have gone too far particularly 9/11 it was fine once but i do think twice is a bit too much as it is an American film and people are still a bit sensitive about the subject, I will be interested in the overall reaction of it, I may be completely wrong as MacFarlane has a reputation of taking taboo subjects and taking the mick! Mark Wahlburg and Mila Kunis' acting is superb and really makes the story of Ted believable to the audience, of course a Seth MacFarlane film would not be complete without him in someway or another and it seemed appropriate that he did the voice of Ted, his outstanding voice talent is well known and completed the film. Overall I think Ted is a fantastic Summer movie, it will make you laugh until you can't breath, gasp with shock at this perverted teddy bear and there is a heart to the story, sad parts that are really touching. To watch another side of MacFarlane that has yet to be explored proves that MacFarlane must have more tricks up his sleeve! I really hope he continues making feature length movies as he has proved he can be a success in that field, but still remains faithful to the cartoons that gave him his big break!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Insanely Pedestrian, Even by Seth standards","Think of every trope that gets overutilized in Seth MacFarlane's brand of humor. Now imagine each of those tropes put into a full length movie, that's what Ted is. I decided to watch it as background noise but unfortunately even with the modicum of attention that I was giving it: the humor was so bland and so rehashed that I had to cut the movie short and found greater enjoyment sitting in silence instead.Weird interspecies sex scenes?

Cutaway setup Humor? Check
General ""Raunchy"" Humor? CheckCombine that with an awful Boston accent that often times dips into Peter Griffin territory from Seth voice acting out the titular star and a boring plot about a manchild growing up and it's truly a recipe for disaster.That being said: considering this was made well over a decade into MacFarlane's career: none of this should come as a surprise so although I'd recommend avoiding it all-together, if you really want to watch it: cut your expectations in half and then make the decision on whether or not it's worthwhile having this movie suck up your bandwidth for 90 minutes.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy

It would have worked better but the film would be X rated.You know there is more going on here than just a funny talking teddy bear movie. Right!No? So what!

Hilarious live-action debut,"First off I must stress, if you don't like Family Guy you are definitely not going to enjoy this movie. If you do then you will find it be quite funny throughout. Most of the joke material involves Ted as the primary source of the comedy, however Mark Whalberg and Mila Kunis both hold their own against MacFarlane's well known style of humour. I personally found this outing for Whalberg was better than in The Other Guys and a solid portion of the films humour was as a direct result of his performance. Aside from looking stunningly attractive as usual Mila Kunis did well in her role and while she wasn't a major part of most of the jokes she portrayed her character well and did well as the primary source on conflict in the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy

I don't understand how even a single person is reviewing this higher than 4 stars... ""you just don't like Seth MacFarlane"" no, I don't like jokes that are so unfunny that I can't even laugh at them. What a bad movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Knocking on raunchy's door!,"Now, I don't watch Family Guy– I never have, and probably never will. It's just not my kind of show. So going into 'Ted', I had no clue how funny Seth McFarlane was. I think I laughed 3/4 of the movie! The other either lame jokes that just weren't funny (yeah, I'm talking' 'bout the Katy Perry one! Watch it!), or it was sad. But that was only at the end. Mila Kunis was her funny, adorable self and Mark Wahlberg–phew! He is sexy with a capital S! (Sorry, I got off track.) Besides the looks, he was very good in the movie. They couldn't have used anybody better.'Ted' was an absolute party! Swearing, sex, drugs, more swearing, more sex and more drugs. Although I must say, if you're easily offended you shouldn't go. This movie is knocking on raunchy's door!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
So much disappointment...,"After having heard my friends talk so much about this movie and how funny it was, I decided to give it a try. I have to say this is one of the most overrated films i have ever seen. The target audience are 14 year old kids or just simple minded retards. This movie is terrible, there were a very few funny scenes and the plot was horrible, it was way too simple and predictable. If your more for the comedy in the film then i recommend you to just watch the trailer, it basically shows all the funny scenes. This is basically like watching Family Guy, just worse! This film was way to predictable and I highly recommend you not to watch it.",2.0,Anonymous,Comedy
So fricken funny,"I'm not giving away anything. This movie is hilarious. From minute 1 to the end, you wont stop laughing. See it. If you don't laugh at this movie then comment or whatever on this sight. I know a surgeon. We can implant a funny bone or surgically remove the great big stick out of you a@#.BTW to all those who say its family guy. its not. I makes references and the style is somewhat similar but it is quite original and I never knew Teddy Bears or Flash Gorden can be that hilarious.So bullet pointsFunnySee itIF no humor comes then surgeon.We can implant a funny bone or get that stick out of your a@#hole.See it its hilarious.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Ted (2012) - Seth MacFarlane Power!,"""Ted"" is the first ever motion picture to be directed by Seth MacFarlane, more well-known as the creator of the highly-successful and incredibly hilarious animated TV series, ""Family Guy"". As a fan of the show myself, I was anticipating for this movie, the minute I first saw the trailer. You know what, the wait was really worth it. ""Ted"" starts off with the story of when Mark Wahlberg was a little child, wished that his teddy bear can talk, and become his best friend. His wish actually comes true, and it becomes a worldwide popular story across the world. Now, 27 years later, Ted and Wahlberg have still haven't left each other, and still have been buddies ever since. Wahlberg has also been dating Mila Kunis for over 4 years, and now wants to take the next level in their relationship. Now, Kunis asks for Ted to move out, so now Ted and Wahlberg now head off on crazy shenanigans, which will affect their lives in the process. Now, we have our movie, and it's flat-out hilarious. Similar to ""Family Guy"", ""Ted"" knew how to really beat the odds. This movie is dirty, raunchy, and offensive, all wrapped into one movie. Awesome! ""Ted"" is probably one of the funniest movies I've so far seen this year. This movie is filled with plenty of pop-culture references, movie references, TV references, references of Flash Gordon, and plenty of famous celebrity cameos from Giovanni Ribisi, Joel McHale, Patrick Warburton, Tom Skerrit, and the narration of Patrick Stewart. That's all of what Seth MacFarlane has been known for. I was laughing out-loud from beginning to end, even the moment at the end credits was hilarious. Most of the references got me on my seat, because most of them I have been familiar to, recently. I will definitely go again, for a repeat watch. Mark Wahlberg had really great chemistry with either Ted or Mila Kunis, and the performances feel memorable, and the audience grows to like these characters. The writing is witty, the jokes are raunchy, and overall, this movie just flat-out impressed me. This movie knew what it wanted to be, and it went on a very fresh and clever road. ""Ted"" is probably the funniest film I've seen so far this year, and I hope Seth MacFarlane makes more movie projects in the future, while still making me laugh on ""Family Guy"". ""Ted"", in my review, ""immensely entertaining, and down-right hilarious"".",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
vulgar teddy and boring story....,"make for a lousy movie. The problem with this comedy was that it just wasn't funny, especially the first half hour, most of it is a narrator and it was just boring. Basically an outcast named John wishes his teddy bear were real and be his friend. Well it happens. Skip ahead to a 35 year old John with a girlfriend, Lori, of 4 years. The 2 live together with Ted, the bear. Ted likes to smoke pot and be vulgar. He's a bad influence on John and Lori's had enough. So you know what's coming next, the ultimatum, and you know Ted won't leave John alone for long. And there's this really gross side plot of Ted getting it on with a fellow cashier. And of course Ted has to help John win Lori back and there is the side plot of Ted's crazy stalkers. But the jokes weren't funny.FINAL VERDICT: A waste of time, skip it.",4.0,Anonymous,Comedy
A lot better than I expected,"I'd heard from many people that Ted was not really that good, and since all my friends and I are huge Seth Macfarlane fans, this stunned me. We are also huge fans of Mila Kunis and Mark, so we thought it couldn't do any wrong. I waited for it to come out on DVD. I actually really loved it! I don't know what exactly people disliked about it, but I thought that it was great for what it was. Yes, there are a lot of 80's references. I am not an 80's lover AT ALL, so I thought this would be my point of undoing but I found that since I didn't really know most of the references very well, it wasn't anything to be bothered about. I love the use of weed smoking in this movie, because the hard truth that American's don't want to face is that more people than they realize smoke weed and it's really not that big of a deal. Those that think it is are just brainwashed by the government telling them that it's wrong and dangerous, yadda yadda. I'm not sitting here saying I do it, because I don't, but I also don't condemn those who do. I fully support movies that don't shy away from the subject. Anyhow, as long as you don't expect this movie to keep you laughing from start to finish without stopping, and you don't have a problem with a bit of drug use and partying and seeing Mila Kunis fog up your screen with her hot self, then this movie is great for you! Is it perfect? No. But it wasn't bad or disappointing. There are even a few heartfelt scenes for those who like that.",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Fun, yet boring","As a huge Family Guy fan, I was excited to see Seth MacFarlane directing a live action feature. The humor is exactly what you would expect, however, Family Guy is a 22 minute show and Ted stretched a single gag for way too long. Family Guy is quick and hits you with joke after joke, but the timing for Ted became painful. I felt MacFarlane hung himself with the R rating. Free of network censorship, it felt like he tried too hard to try and shock an audience that's already been around the block a few times. My ADD checked out halfway through the movie and I drifted into boredom. People will argue and say ""what about that scene"" or ""I loved the part when they did this"", but wouldn't you think a feature movie would have more than 2 or 3 funny parts? Would you watch Robot Chicken if it were only funny for 15 seconds and the remaining 10 minutes were boring? Wait for home video and put it on in the background... and get a time machine and watch it when you were 14 years old- that might help too.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Finally, a real kids film for adults!","First of all let me state that I'm voting Ted a 9 out of 10 not simply because I think it's a great film, but because how often can you seriously rate a comedy? It deserves the 9 for how well planned and produced it is before the content steals the show.Seth Macfarlane, creator, writer, director and voice-over artist of such animated shows as 'Family Guy' 'The Cleveland Show' and 'American Dad' proves in his feature movie debut that, not only does his own unique and hilarious comedy sketch brand of childish comedy make a successful transfer from cartoon to reality - low and behold, the man can tell a story and make it stand apart from the crowd.Ted is the perfect mix of all the things a decent comedy should contain and whereas it might occasionally rely on offensive over the top comedy and stereotyping, even if you've never really been a regular to the cartoon series' he produces you still appreciate it because just when you think it couldn't be any more far fetched, it weighs down like an anchor and grounds itself in reality.It's a stoner comedy, a childish fantasy of epic proportions and dare I say it; its reliance on the odd sexist and racist observations make for the type of uncomfortable laughter you can actually appreciate. Often more suggestive than ""balls out"" offensive, it relies on your sick humour rather than insists that you learn to appreciate it.Ted also boasts a great cast aside from Wahlberg and Kunis. Patrick Warburton (Family Guy's Joe Swanson) is hilarious as Guy. Patrick Stewart narrates and Ryan Reynolds provides some of his greatest acting EVER! Sam J. Jones' cameo as himself is off the wall and back to the character of Ted himself, MacFarlane has me in stitches so often.Overall, Ted ought to be a classic and I think it will stand the test of time providing it doesn't rely on a sequel!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Bear Necessities,"'Ted' comes from the mind of Seth MacFarlane, the genius behind 'Family Guy', one of the few American shows to legitimately rival 'The Simpsons'. It's irreverent, iconoclastic and inspired. I laughed all the way through.Being the school loner and an only child, John forms an unbreakable bond with his Christmas bear, Ted. One night John rhetorically wishes that Ted could actually speak. At that moment, as luck would have it, a shooting star passes overhead and Ted comes to life. They grow up but never apart, which threatens John's four-year relationship with his girlfriend, Lori (minxy Mila Kunis).'Ted' has a deliberately familiar plot and structure, but it's not these MacFarlane wants us to focus on. The bear steals the show because he IS the show. He's a naughty little bear, who swears every other word, smokes strong pot and sleeps with hookers. He's what Peter Griffin would be like if Trey Parker and Matt Stone created him.As well as voice Ted, MacFarlane also plays him, with the aid of motion-capture technology. Taking a break from his action man persona, Mark Wahlberg is aptly cast as the adult John. Playing a 35-year-old is a touch improbable, though his scenes with Kunis are nonetheless credible.Scatological humour is usually a sign of desperation, but MacFarlane is as inventive with his butt jokes as he is with the rest. He also reinvents clichéd jokes superbly well, which means they take you by surprise. Remarkably, 'Ted' impresses on a dramatic level, too. Ted is basically a nice 'guy', however, the celebrity life he leads is a lonely one, so he hangs on to John, his 'thunder buddy'.'Ted' never lets up. It's gag after gag, each one coming closer to making you gag than the last. How does this film have room for such unlikely personages as Patrick Stewart, Flash Gordon and Norah Jones? You'll have to watch it to find out.www.moseleyb13.com",8.0,Anonymous,Comedy
"Other than the occasional laughs, you are not missing anything if you skip watching this in the cinema.","Seth MacFarlane, who is the creator of family guy, wrote and directed the movie, this is his directorial debut, and I may not be watching his second work. I am not a huge fan of family guy, the whole idea baffles me. But no matter, i see Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis, i just expect to have a good time, which i didn't have.Wahlberg and Kunis combination was great on screen, they gelled together and there were the best thing to see on the screen. The movie dragged with profanity and too much sexual reference, i just kept waiting for the next thing to happen as each scene dragged and i wish i could just skip ahead.The computer animation was handled by visual effects facilities Tippett Studio (who were responsible for the way back when Robocop series and the more recently The Smurfs). MacFarlane wrote the screenplay with his Family Guy colleagues Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild, and they must have thought there were writing for a cartoon, because some events that happened were totally ridiculous, a teddy bear and sex, that is both loony, perverted and ridiculous in so many ways.The plot is simple: as the result of a childhood wish, John Bennett's (Mark Wahlberg) teddy bear, Ted, came to life, as John grew so did the bear, in attitude voice and reason, but things started to change when Lori (Mila Kunis) comes into the picture, John has to grow up, but Ted keeps him grounded.Acting by the leads is an A+ from me; i was actually impressed by Mark Whalberg, not saying he is bad at what he does just saying i was impressed. Directing and screenplay D-, some scenes were just too dull for me.Whalberg was in Contraband and The Fighter (with Christian Bale) before this movie, i was not too much of a fan of Contraband, but the fighter was just a legendary movie to watch. Mila Kunis was also in the movie Max Payne with Whalberg. Mila jumped at me from the movie The Book of Eli and later on Black Swan, i see her growing to be a regular on the silver screen.Well, Ted is a movie all we want to see, some loved it, a few didn't i am of the few, may be you go see it yourself and let me know what you think.",5.0,Anonymous,Comedy
Do your self a favour!,"Ted is one of the funniest movies I have seen all year, by far one of the best comedies (21 Jump Street and Ted) and one of the most creative aspects I have seen in nearly two whole years!Cast: Seth MacFarlane voices Teddy/Ted perfectly, Mila Kunis as Lori is magnificent and Mark Whalberg as John was perfect also.Script: All the script was great, but Mila Kunis' Lori character didn't have a strong script, so that was a let down.Plot: Plot was hilarious and highly interesting. The plot was the best thing about the movie because I thought there wasn't going to be one, but it was hidden in the shadows.Direction: Seth MacFarlane directs perfectly, and thank god for that! Because I thought it would have been all over the place!Overall: Ted is a delight and extremely funny, do yourself a favour!",9.0,Anonymous,Comedy
I didn't think my low expectations could have been disappointed. They were,"It almost feels necessary to reciprocate the vulgarity of this so called 'comedy' in order to express my distaste for its unoriginality, offensiveness, and ability to absorb incessant laughter from a mass audience, excluding myself. I will however restrain and refrain from reducing myself down to that level, in comedic terms, that level being beneath the basement of laughter.The fact Seth MacFarlane's directorial debut is categorised as a comedy is quite tragic. If 0ff-colour humour and flatulence are primary appeals for modern audiences, then we can unfortunately (or not if you enjoy it) prepare for a future comedy genre flooded with idiotic and stale humour. Every laugh in the theatre possessed a sense of shock, prior to genuine laughter because of the crude nature of the every ever predictable and tired joke, which were exhausted even before the opening credits.Take the attempted humour away from Ted and what are you left with? Other than a slightly more bearable two hours, the remains would be shorter than the amount of time it took me to want to leave the screening, which was not long at all. With all three of our main character's motives established early, their actions only become increasingly obvious, so obvious that one could probably predict the events if they were to have held a glass to the door of the screen with one ear at the other end and just listened rather than watched. They would have most likely had more fun than I too!While having a strong dislike for MacFarlane's three hugely popular animated series, I find my reasoning behind this similar to that of my loathing for Ted. These, in my opinion, pathetic excuses for the moving image, embark on what I can only describe, feels to me like being trapped on a one way train filled with loud, obnoxious passengers who are engaging in ignorant disputes, throwing useless insults at one another. The little steam it had prior to boarding is quickly diminished because of the engineer, MacFarlane's lack of skill to sustain a working locomotive.Despite the above, perhaps harsh criticisms, there were few positive elements to the worst film I have seen this year, maybe any year. The combination of live action and animation looks superb, to a point where you do not even question the reality of the character Ted's existence. It would have complemented the film more had we seen more emotion displayed by the character in terms of facial expression and body language, as it is solely dialogue which makes him feel like any more than a child's teddy bear. Overall though, the Tippet Studio visual effects team did a terrific job. Back to reality, or well, a real person in Mila Kunis playing a fictional character. The most convincing of all characters due to the genuine emotion she appears to convey.The only way in which the eyes that are looking over the hands typing this review would once again witness the film that is Ted, would be if Universal Studios decided to pay me. Those who are fans of MacFarlane's work on Family Guy and subsequent almost identical series will be prone to enjoying another very similar tale of pointless storytelling. I personally would not recommend this immaturity to anyone who does not appreciate the director's other works.",1.0,Anonymous,Comedy
