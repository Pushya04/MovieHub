Another original sci-fi movie!,"Another original sci-fi movie in the list, a nail biting thriller which will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie. The only drawback maybe it's just 90 mins in length. However, this movie gets straight to the point without wasting any time for setting up the story.Though it's an original sci-fi movie, it doesn't go into the technicality and makes it complex. It's simple and to the point. If you want to watch a fast paced thriller, you can consider this for sure.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Nailbiting....,"I love this movie and have rewatched it a few times over the years. Duncan Jones has impressed with other offerings such as Moon and Warcraft and I look forward to his future ventures. Jake Gyllenhaal (another favourite) plays the protaganist brilliantly and the angst, apprehension and despair that he portrays while trying to figure out Source Code is palpable. Although the premise is far fetched, the characters are relatable - which is why we watch movies right?",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Definitely  a Sci-Fi film to remember,"The future of movies doesn't seem too bright since all we're getting are remakes, adaptations and unnecessary prequels/sequels and that's why original stuff like SOURCE CODE can really make my day.Honestly, the trailers and initial premise didn't seem promising; some soldier can travel back in time and has to stop an some evil terrorist from bombing America. At first glance it looked more like some patriotic Steven Segal movie written by Tom Clancy with a higher budget and better actors. And then you watch it.Like INCEPTION, this is one of the few movies that you can't spoil since even the smallest detail could accidentally reveal a twist or two. The story itself is a very original blend of thriller, sci-fi and drama and it works. Full of unseen twists and with a high octane pacing, SOURCE CODE will keep you wanting for more as each answer is slowly revealed. The script helps too but its the actors, who deliver the lines well, who drive the movie into emotional levels. My only problem with the film is some weak foreshadowing but it thankfully doesn't affect the movie in a bad way and to give any more details would spoil the film.To keep it short and to avoid accidentally spoiling a plot detail or two, SOURCE CODE is a must watch. It's one of the few original films out there in a market full of crap and it's definitely worth your money. It's just a pity that Hollywood doesn't seem to be supporting these kinds of films.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Excellent Thriller,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer. This is the best thriller I've seen in years.Definitely kept me on the edge of my seat.The writing is outstanding. All four principal actors do well and Gyllenhaal, especially, carries the plot forward extremely well.At the start, I feared a stock, predictable Hollywood thriller.

parallel reality,English Director Duncan Jones brings to the audience a nail biting thriller as well as beautifully directed movie.Source Code revolves around the concept of creating a parallel universe through time travel.Jake Gyllenhaal plays the character of Captain Colter Stevens a pilot in U.S Army .Colter wakes up in a train with a woman Cristina(Michelle Monaghan) in front of her whom he has never met before .The last thing he remembers is fighting a battle in Afganisthan.This completely confuses Colter who later discovers that everything about him as changed.The train he was on get's blasted and Colter wakes up again in a capsule this time a woman name Goodwin beautifully played by Vera Farmiga talking to him and trying some memory regain techniques .Colter later learns that she is a member of some secret organization that has built a program known has source code that can connect to anyone's brain and access some-part of their memory .This enables them time reassignment which can create parallel reality.The chief-head of the organization Dr. Rutledge played by Jeffrey Wright is very stubborn and mean and wants to accomplish mission at any cost.The movie can make viewer fall in love with each character .Cinematography is beyond satisfaction .Actor Jake Gyllenhaal takes the character to a different level .The concept of the movie at a time will seem abrupt which is completely acceptable in a sci-fi movie .The movie will keep it's audience on their toes .This master piece was nominated for 8 awards and won the COFCA award for best original screenplay in 2011.,,Anonymous,Mystery
Superb!,"What a movie. The price is worth paying. This movie gets straight to the point. You know you see a lot of movies that waste so much time getting into a story. Not this film, virtually from the off, we are there, in the film. It's like there is no beginning, but a middle and an end. Obviously you guys know the storyline so I'll not waste time telling you what it is about, just go and see it. It is a film that keeps you looking, you actually feel like you are 'in the source code' which is fantastic.

Enjoyable thriller,"Nice science fiction thriller with good performances by the actors, worthwhile to see this in the theater.Jake Gyllenhaal seems to have hit his stride lately, picking good roles that suit him with the last couple of movies he has starred in. He does well here, as a reluctant hero who starts to piece together what is really going on in a mission to discover the details of a terror plot and identity of the terrorist in Chicago.The film is shot in an intelligent style, giving brief but significant snippets of various characters on board a commuter train and red herrings tossed in liberally to keep you guessing.It's not that original or groundbreaking, but made with high standards and care to give the movie-goer good value for their dollar and a pleasant entertainment that delivers on expectations.

How thinking too much can almost ruin an otherwise decent flick,"At its simplest, this seems to be the story of a guy reliving the last 8 minutes of someone else on a train over and over before it explodes. How and why is for you to discover. I had a peculiar experience watching this film. At first, I was quite engrossed by the mystery element and the paranoia of what's going on and who's responsible. However, as time went on, I kept being taken out of the picture. My sense of disbelief was hurt because I was finding big logical flaws. I was left dissatisfied and frustrated. However, after reading more about the Source Code concept and the ending online, it seems I was unfair about the logical flaws. The problem is that it's implied, and you assume, it takes place in someone's else memories and/or some kind of virtual reality based on those. As such, our hero shouldn't be able to discover certain things because the person he's in doesn't know them because he never saw them. It's worse when the camera shows you other people without the hero there. If he's not there, how does he know that's happening? So, my big piece of advice for enjoyment of the movie is not to dwell too much on the science explanation part, that in my opinion was lacking. It's probably not what you might think or even what the main scientist thinks. Check on the Internet afterwards to understand as I did.With that out of the way, let's write about the rest. I thought the directing was excellent with dynamic camera movement in rather small enclosed environments (the train and somewhere else). The recurring fire explosion in slow-motion was sometimes quite artistic. The story was good with nice suspense (despite the repeating), a few very good twists and a few far-fetched occurrences. The science aspect should have been explained better. The main character was acted very well by Gyllenhaal. He excels at playing distress, uncertainty and anxiety. The leading actress was quite fetching and likable, making for good chemistry. The train passengers were unfortunately mostly cardboard-thin (why was it mostly men?). We weren't made to care for them. It's not a special effects heavy movie. It starts as thriller, then veers toward drama and romance. I wasn't really moved by any of it, but I liked the romantic aspect. I didn't care about the ending as it felt like a focus audience consensus, and at that point, I thought it didn't make any sense (unfairly so). The product placement was really irritating. All in all, I think it's an enjoyable movie that I'd have liked more if my brain hadn't picked (mostly unfair) holes in it while watching.Rating: 6 out of 10 (good)",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Brilliantly inventive...and yet another wonderful film from Duncan Jones.,"During the last week, I've become a HUGE fan of Duncan Jones. That's because I saw his amazing sci-fi film ""Moon"" (which he wrote and directed), his short ""Whistle"" and his latest ""Source Code"". These three films, all super-well made and inventive, represent the three films Jones has so far made--and I can pretty much guarantee you'll see a lot more from him because these three films are simply amazing.I scored ""Source Code"" a 9--which is actually not quite as high as I rated ""Moon"", but the film sure came close to also getting a 10. The plot is so inventive and the film made so well that I can't see why it isn't scored higher than 7.5 on IMDb.When the film begins, Colter Stephens (Jake Gyllenhaal) suddenly finds himself on a train heading into Chicago. He knows no one aboard and is NOT the person people think he is. He is, in fact, a soldier serving in Afghanistan--so how did he magically appear on the other side of the planet?!?! While this is only the beginning of the film, I will say no more because the film has one surprise after another--and I'd hate to ruin the film for you.In many ways, the film plays a lot like ""Inception"", ""Groundhog Day"" and a bit of ""The Sum of All Fears"". However, this is a great oversimplification--there is so much more to the film than this. Wonderful acting, wonderful direction and a thrill-a-minute script make this a must-see film. Really...you MUST see this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Decent Enough Sci-Fi Thriller With A Solid Lead From Jake Gyllenhaal,"Pros:
1. Jake Gyllenhaal (Colter Stevens) per usual gives a brilliant performance.
2. The train setting gives the film an overwhelming sense of claustrophobia which helps to increase the tension.
3. The CGI, in regards to the train, fire, explosions looks surprisingly good. The movie also knows never to over-rely on it.
4. The pacing is fantastic. With a limited plot, it's always a high risk that the movie will start to feel repetitive, however this film keeps the same pace and manages to stay fresh.
5. The ending is simultaneously heartwarming and satisfying.Cons:
1. The score is extremely overbearing and obnoxious, as well as the fact that it's mostly just stock action music.
2. The film's lighting makes the movie look really cheap and bland.
3. Derek Frost's (Michael Arden) motives for blowing up the train are very weak. He states the ""world is hell,"" and therefore it needs to be reduced to rubble. This reduces the tension, and it induces an eye-roll.
4. There are a few plot-holes. For example: somehow Colter Steven's dad didn't recognise his own son's voice over the phone; the film never explains how Colter Stevens' consciousness can be broadcast into a dead person's memory; and at the end, a new world is mysteriously created with no explanation.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Tough to overlook the logic holes, though I really tried","I would never say Source Code is a bad movie, but there are simply way too many gushing reviews - from critics and viewers alike - than this film warrants. That the film is a highly suspenseful thriller cannot be argued. I quite enjoyed the main character's recurring trips inside the source code scenario. The problem is that the central premise of Source Code is implausible at best and quite possibly ludicrous. It's as if the filmmakers felt that if they peel away the layers of plausibility very slowly, the audience won't notice. It does seem like many viewers either didn't notice or didn't mind the holes. I'm willing to entertain the occasional logical stretch, but when it is the film's central premise being stretched beyond recognition, that's when I begin to have a problem. As much as I wanted to go along for the ride, I just couldn't go all the way. By the end, the cumulative effect of all the liberties taken by the filmmakers became enough to bump Source Code from out of the sci-fi genre and into the fantasy world.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Source Code is not time travel. Source Code is time reassignment.,"Source Code is directed by Duncan Jones and written by Ben Ripley. It stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright. Music is by Chris P. Bacon and cinematography by Don Burgess.U.S. Military helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal) repeatedly relives the eight minutes leading up to a terrorist train bombing in the hope of finding the bomberWith his excellent first film, Moon, Duncan Jones got himself noticed to the point that many sci-fi fans have been eagerly awaiting his next foray into the sci-fi realm. So some pressure, then, on Source Code to make good on that early promise. Leaving space, Jones is this time on Earth tackling a sub-genre that has had many an instalment over the years, the time travel thinker. How wonderful to report that Jones and his sparkling team have crafted one of the better efforts to tackle the subject.Off the bat it has to be said that it's easy to draw comparisons to a number of movies that Source Code leans on. Be it the continuous comedy time loop of Groundhog Day, the techno mind meld of Déjà Vu, and thematic snatches from the likes of The Matrix and Frequency, Jones' film is not about to herald a new dawn of sci-fi. Yet all these things have amazingly come together to create one large intellectually satisfying whole. Sprinkle on some action adrenalin rushes, ease in some suspense, some heart tugging and a romantic thread that actually belongs! Well you have got yourself a very tasty piece of pie.That Jones is able to blend all this without halting the flow of his picture marks him out as one who is ready for the big league. We are after all dealing with a film that for 90% of its run time is replaying an 8 minute train ride. But each 8 minutes brings more to the plot, tension mounts, clues are dangled, characters come alive, yet we know that this train still goes kaboom, the hopeless feel that accompanies the destiny of Colter and the train passengers adds another critical element to why Source Code is top stuff, namely is it possible for Colter to go against the laws of quantum physics? He believes so, he desperately wants to save everyone on that train, but logic and his superiors tells him, and us, otherwise.None of this would work if the casting wasn't so astute. Having to carry the film firmly on his shoulders, Gyllenhaal is fantastic, showing vast range with every 8 minute section of that train ride. From the confusion that brings out neurosis in the early parts, to the manic and steely determination to succeed in the latter stages, he nails it as a flawed, scared, soldier of hope. Monaghan's natural attractiveness and earthy appeal really serves her character well, making it easy for us to not only want her to not get blown to bits, again and again, but also to believe that Colter wants to succeed so desperately so as to save her. Farmiga is in a small role (arguably just a plot set up), and mostly in close ups via a screen, but she makes good as the icy stickler for orders who begins to melt with Colter's desperate situation.The liability is Wright, who seems to be pitching his role as the Source Code creator between evil genius and pompous prat! I've no idea what accent he is trying to do and he blatantly tries to steal the film in every scene he is in. You have to think that had someone like Ridley Scott or James Cameron been directing, such thick ham slicing would have been reined in. Jones will learn one would think. Chris Bacon's (conductor-I Am Legend) score is suitably Hitchcockian, Don Burgess' (Contact/Spider-Man/The Book of Eli) photography is genre compliant and it's nice to see some Illinois land marks feature. All that and there's even a very notable (homage) voice cameo in there as well.Even paying off on further viewings, Source Code is a must see for the genre fan. A thriller with heart, a sci-fi with brains, and an action film as well. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Unrealistic / Unscientific, but still good","Source Code is a science-fiction mystery film set in modern day Chicago and a government facility in an unknown place. This is one of those movies that will make you think hard trying to figure out what is reality and what isn't. Unless you pay close attention to what's happening, you can easily get confused and lost. It is thus somewhat comparable to The Matrix and Inception. As you might expect, the sci-fi aspect of this film was totally ridiculous, unrealistic and unscientific. The mystery or whodunit aspect could've been more suspenseful and could've used some twists and turns to keep you guessing. If you watch carefully, it is fairly obvious near the beginning of the movie who the bomber was. Overall, this is an above average sci-fi film that is worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Begins well but spreads too thin,"The idea is nice, it begins very mysteriously and when the general concept is presented you sense there are going to be mind blowing things, something like Inception perhaps. Sadly, the scientific idea is purely presented and the writers give too much place to romance, it seems like the movie tries to attract women and do so by weakening the sci-fi part. I hate movies that try too grab too many aspects, the movie could go a little bit longer and actually build the idea of ""Source Code"". The romance is forced upon the story, like the writers were told they had to insert love and did it wrong. To sum it up, a great concept not so greatly presented.

unexpected gem,"Duncan Jones, the son of David Bowie and director of 2009's critically acclaimed Moon, returns with his second feature length film Source Code.It stars Jake Gyllenhaal playing his usual charming hero self as Captain Colter Stevens, whom is connected to a program named the source code which allows a person to take over someone else's body in the last eight minutes of their life. Captain Stevens is connected to the program in order to find out who blew up a train outside of Chicago in order to stop a second attack.Cleverly written and brilliantly directed with obvious Hitchcockian influence, the film in fact is such a thrilling ride that the sentimental ending that takes it a little off track wont bother you in the slightest.

The plot is easy to understand, the jargon used isnt over the top and I found myself gripped throughout.
2nd reason is that films like this hinge on the ending. The ending has to be good and I believe this delivers. It's a nice, happy ending. There's no unanswered questions and you're left fulfilled.Beyond that the characters are likeable and it's well acted from all involved. Listen, it's not a film you'll shout and scream about. It's just a nice little thriller that you'll watch and go ""you know what I quite liked that"".

"Well made and fast paced, but a little been there done that and a little too improbable","Source Code (2011)It's easy to say this could have been a great movie, because it has some great elements, but it's also easy to notice how derivative the basic ideas are, too. And so this is a decent thriller with lots of issues left hanging. I think some people will totally love it, especially if they haven't seen, or maybe if they have, the inspirations for it.That is, the structure of the film is a series of variations on a single set of events, returned to over and over with twists and alternatives explored, many of them imaginative. A very differently styled predecessor is ""Run Lola Run"" but I think ""Source Code"" is a more direct echo of recent American films like ""Momento"" or ""Vantage Point."" It's a little like ""Inception"" meets ""Groundhog Day,"" actually, and that's not all bad.The main character who is reliving (or seeming to) the main event, the blowing up of a Chicago commuter train, is a war veteran played by Jake Gyllenhaal. He's good, very good, if not astonishing (you might consider Bruce Willis in ""Twelve Monkeys"" for a definition close to astonishing, believe it or not). The talking head (mostly seen on a video screen) that helps him through his various incarnations is Vera Farmiga, always a trustworthy presence on screen. Everyone else, from the terrific scientist in the background (Jeffrey Wright) to the bland but serviceable girl and would be girlfriend (Michelle Monaghan) are support to the main pair, or even just to Gyllenhaal, who carries the show.The rest of the movie is eye popping effects, high tension whodunnit terrorism, and interior soul searching in a sci-fi kind of superficial way. It's fine, but it's been done better before. And there are some logic bending requirements that you can go along with most of the time, but reluctantly. By the last few minutes, when there is one ridiculous last twist, it's just a matter of saying, loudly, ""Whatever.""This is almost the definition of a summer blockbuster--well made, fast, undemanding, interesting, fleeting. And it's a month early, so maybe there are more decent things to come.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Nutshell Review: Source Code,"With the number of remakes and reboots and adaptations going around Hollywood, it isn't everyday that a film emerges with something relatively original and creative, except perhaps for the science fiction genre when it creates its own rules to play by. Duncan Jones proves he's no fluke with Moon, coming up with an equally entertaining and engaging Source Code that has Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead role as military man Colter Stevens who finds himself in a groundhog day type of situation, tasked with a mission of investigating and stopping a bomb from exploding on a commuter train headed for Chicago, failing which he has to ""die"" together with its passengers, again and again.The less said about the film, the better because letting slip any plot points no matter how minor would be a huge disservice to an audience. Suffice to say that Stevens has to achieve his mission objectives in a race against time, all 8 minutes of it, based upon a program created by Jeffrey Wright's Dr Rutledge that taps on the final collective memories of victims in any disaster, where an investigator can somehow find himself in the body of one of the victims and be at the recreated scene of the crime, interacting in a simulated environment to discover clues and of course, perpetrators. It's an extremely sexy scenario that provides a leg up in any investigations should something along the same lines get translated to reality - imagine scores of crime being solved, and being a powerful tool in the fight against terrorism.Jake Gyllenhaal plays his character with aplomb, resigning to knowing he cannot get answers from his handler Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) unless he delivers with each cycle some intelligence and findings, while at the same time getting attracted to Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) through the identity he assumes. The love story snuck in was a nice little touch, as does the backstory of who Stevens is, and how he gets himself into where and what he is currently into now. Things start to pick up when Stevens becomes situationally aware and desires to take control over his own fate.The visual effects here didn't go overboard and Jones knows exactly the limits required before they take over and overshadow the strength of the story. It's less gimmicky, with more detail to attention given to the host of supporting characters and series of events going inside the train, and covering a lot more aspects of the expansive simulated world that addresses some of the major issues that could have made plot loopholes, but thankfully didn't.But the downside which I prefer to overlook because it doesn't detract the viewer from the experience, involves accepting the reality that the filmmakers present to you. If you do not buy into the paradox of time travel, then you won't enjoy any time travel movies, and the same applies here if you aren't a big fan of alternate realities - there's the world that everyone exists in the main narrative, and a recreated digital one that is used for investigations purposes, defined to exist only within the specified limits of an event centered around 8 minutes worth, and no direct line exists between the real world and the recreated one, except perhaps to send one into, and retrieve one out of.The other minor disappointment involves what I thought to be pressures existing to have a Hollywoodized ending that perhaps would be more acceptable to mainstream audiences. There's a moment in time in the final act that would have closed the film nicely given the moral conscience and decency to provide proper closure, and I felt it would have been pitch perfect rather than to push the realm of an alternate reality even further. There has bound to be a cheat sheet somewhere that the story by Ben Ripley decided to pull out to allow scenes to run and continue into the final few minutes that were quite unnecessary, if only to wrap things up in a more hopeful, and expectedly straightforward manner. Some implausibilities that broke its own rules on collective memories however do provide for post-movie discussion, especially if one's stance were to centre around one of the most powerful abilities of the mind known as imagination, and the desires to hear just what one wants to.Still, Source Code belongs up there amongst contemporary science fiction stories that leaves you engrossed and engaged with every repeated cycle and turn in the story, and with excellent cast chemistry making it worth the ride. It presents something that isn't done to death already with that tinge of science fiction that looks like an attractive proposition to create in our world. Highly recommended as it goes into my shortlist of the best movies of the year thus far.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Gripping & Quirky Thriller,"Source CodeIt was much much better than I expected, the script cleverly got over the repetitive nature of the ""train on a time loop theme"" by having sufficient variation in the 2nd and 3rd scenes to keep the narrative impetus going.This was a tense thriller from the start with our hero Jake Gyllenhaal, trying to uncover, by whatever means, a psychopathic bomber looking to blow up most of downtown Chicago. The camera was up close and personal, with Jake giving an intense, on the edge, micro gestured idiosyncratic performance, he was very good.Of course we had, always a high point, an ambition driven cold and calculating ""mad"" scientist and a compassionate army major adding to the mix.The camera work and styling was good, except for the capsule Jake was trapped in throughout the movie, this was somehow meant to be a crashed helicopter that had come down in the sea, to me it looked like the inside of a dumpster with a few windows cut in, not good!We were told Jake's character was partially alive however when we got to see him he was certainly alive and kicking, this ""plastic bag of bones"" was less than convincing, I laughed and yet we were meant to be shocked and emotional!Somehow or other it morphed into a quasi-romantic ending, with seemingly everyone living happily ever after, however, and without ruining the plot, one character at the end seems to have lost his life, his body and his girlfriend, so it's not quite the happy ending they imply.I'm giving this a firm 7 outta 10 for an original idea that was excellently executed and a great central lead.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Dr. Rutledge clearly doesn't want to explain things in detail because he, at least initially, does not want Colter Stevens to understand his precise predicament. But even later on, the ""synaptic compatibility"" (or some such) explanation that is offered is cursory and difficult to accept.But if you can fully suspend disbelief, then this is a wonderful journey. Jake Gyllenhaal is perfectly cast as the protagonist. And Michelle Monaghan is constantly-smiling perfection as Christina Warren.I first watched this back around 2013 and, watching it again in 2024, I had forgotten just how truly wonderful it was. Indeed, I watched it twice, back to back, because I enjoyed it so much (and also because I wanted to review the explanation given by Dr. Rutledge).",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""You cannot alter this reality while inside the Source Code.""","""Son of David Bowie"" Duncan Jones makes really great sci-fi films and one of my favorite genres is sci-fi so I really appreciate it. He started out with the super low-budget sci-fi Moon. I liked Moon but one thing bothered me about the movie, the point/twist of the movie was revealed too early in the film. Now Jones is back with Source Code and he delivers the goods once again.If you have seen the trailer then you know the basic plot. The movie starts with our main character Captain Colter Stevens waking up on the train sitting opposite to a woman who obviously knows him and calls him ""Sean"" but he doesn't know her, he runs away to the bathroom and he sees in the mirror reflection a completely different man then suddenly the train explodes. We are transported into this weird capsule where he is ""briefed"" about what's all this about. The movie keeps jumping between these two settings: between the Source Code (I am not going to spoil what it actually is like some professional reviewers or some reviewers here on IMDb) and the reality but that doesn't limit the film in any way. The director manages to keep the movie suspenseful, balanced with amount of ""action"" scenes and mysteries to keep the audience guessing. Especially after the brilliant opening scene he' s got everyone pulled inside the film and on the edge of their seats, that's where Duncan Jones shows off his skills. The movie bears a lot of resemblance to Twelve Monkeys and Deja Vu (trying to save something/someone repeatedly or prevent something from happening or the hi-tech playing with time) so that doesn't make it completely original idea but I' m glad anyway that Hollywood still has some fresh ideas in the safe.Jake Gyllenhaal pulls here probably his best performance yet. He is quite charming here, completely believable when he is confused, funny and realistic when he is falling for the girl who he can meet only in the Source Code. He is very sympathetic and he looks great with a gun. Jake Gyllenhaal has grown into one hell of a great actor. Michelle Monaghan is cute and manages to make a great character even with the minimum of screen time. The oddly accented Dr. Rutledge, the creator of the Source Code, played by Jeffrey Wright is the only character who provides the audience with some sort of explanation.In the end this is a very enjoyable suspenseful sci-fi thriller but with a few flaws so it can't be put alongside classics like Twelve Monkeys or Inception. It's got a great concept but not just so mind bending. I hope this will be a box-office success so Duncan Jones will provide us with another well made movie",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good thriller,"Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) and Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) operate an experimental program where they insert Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) into the last 8 minutes of somebody's life to investigate the cause of a train explosion. He searches for the bomber's identity and falls in love with one of the passengers, Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan).There is a Groundhog Day feel to this, but it works quite well. They all feel a little bit differently. As for logic or believability of the premise, it's best not to dwell on it. The more you dwell, the more problems you'll find. It's better to let the thriller take over. The other good thing is Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan. They have good chemistry. This is a solid thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Deja Vu,"Director Duncan Jones follows up his film Moon with a time reassigned action thriller Source Code.Taking inspiration from the television series Quantum Leap as well as films such as Narrow Margin, Groundhog Day and 12 Monkeys.The movie opens with Jake Gyllenhaal playing a decorated soldier, Captain Colter Stevens, a helicopter pilot whose last mission was in Afghanistan who comes to consciousness on a Chicago commuter train. He feels disorientated and confused as a pretty passenger opposite called Christina (Michelle Monaghan) acts like she is his girlfriend and refers to him as Sean. When he goes to the bathroom and looks in the mirror he sees another man's face.Colter has no idea of what is going on around him and suddenly after the train takes off after brief stop a bomb goes off killing everyone.Colter finds himself back in some kind of capsule and learns the is taking part in some kind of experimental computer simulation called the source code where he can go back to the last few minutes in that train as he linked to the brainwaves of one of the victims. His mission is to identify the bomber who was on that train as he plans to set off a second larger bomb.The simulation repeats itself and each time he gets to know more about the people on the train and possible suspects.There is something Hitchcock like about this film as Colter finds himself in a position he does not largely understand and something more dangerous elsewhere is going on and people are relying on him to come through. His controllers back at command reluctantly give him small nuggets of information as Colter tries to figure what is happening.The film might not be entirely original but it has enough sci-fi and thriller elements to be entertaining because Gyllenhaal sells it well helped by Monagahan, Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Jake Gyllenhaal - The mark of quality...,"... in that if I see he's in a film, it's usually worth watching and then some.Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up on a commuter train on its way into Chicago, across from a girl in her late 20s who apparently knows him. He has no idea how he got here, no idea who this girl is, and when he looks in the mirror he sees the reflection of somebody who is not him. He looks in his pockets and finds his wallet. Inside he finds an ID for a history teacher whose face matches the face he sees in the mirror. What goes on here? Watch and find out.Gyllenhaal is so great in this. He has to go through a range of different emotions and they're all perfect, and it's great to watch him go from incredibly confused to highly focused. And on top of that he's just so charming.This is basically an extended version of a very good Twilight Zone episode, and I love TZ more than anything. There are major similarities to Groundhog Day too. It has its serious moments too though. For example, if you have a close friend or relative you've wanted to make up with and you've always thought that you'd get around to that eventually - You might want to call that person now.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

End it 5 Minutes Earlier,"Live. Die. Repeat. ""Groundhog Day"" with action, ""Source Code"" lives up to the premise.

""Next time I'll bring you a pizza!"" is cringey and ""Tell him that everything is going to be okay"" didn't evoke the emotional response that I think the filmmakers wanted.The action was realistic (i.e., the jump off the train) and the big third act reveal was interesting, but the characters were lacking for me.

"Intriguing, thought provoking thriller","Don't you hate it when people want to summarize a film in one tagline or ""pitch""?Let's try here - ""Inception meets Groundhog Day"" and similar in tone to the recent ""Adjustment Bureau"".Useful in this circumstance, as to give too much detail will spoil your enjoyment of the film.We can safely allow that Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is on a train, it does not end well, despite meeting the very finely cheek boned Christina (Bridget Monaghan).This will not happen just the once, another clue. The military are involved, a prerequisite in any film involving conspiracy theories and shadowy going's on.The film achieves a delicate balance of thriller, romance, Sci-Fi and drama, no easy task if the tone of the film is to remain consistent. Director Duncan Jones, has crafted perhaps not a classic, but a solid piece of entertainment, whilst also broadening the film into something more than might be suggested or expected.The characterizations are good, Gyllenhaal makes a believable protagonist with many and varied possible work occupations and through some acting skill, makes the completely unbelievable, believable. No easy task, compare with early Harrison Ford for a fair comparison.Gyllenhaal is perhaps not in this league yet but this is a solid step in the right direction. Monaghan is delectable, changing her attitude and reactions appropriate to the situation and Vera Farmiga (Colleen) as a controller type character, makes some headway in a difficult role.Jeffery Wright, as Dr Rutledge seems somewhat uncomfortable in his role, not really buying into the character he is tasked with selling. Choosing to play the character a little more malevolent and chewing a bit more scenery, metaphorically speaking, might have added to the film. This might also provide more credibility for Colleen's later character arc.The effects are solid although not intrusive, serving the stories purpose and not the other way round. The story is inventive and just when the tension appears to have dissipated, finds another worthwhile plot strand for a thoughtful and intriguing ending.Not quite ""Inception"" level spinning top debates, or endless blog ruminations perhaps but this should be good for a discussion when the credits run. Which may be sooner than you think with a relatively short running time for a modern film.SummaryIntriguing, thought provoking thriller with a good blend of sci-fi, drama and a fine sprinkling of humour.Recommendedhttp://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Quite liked it,"I was watching this and all I could think was that I had seen it before. In fact I'm pretty sure I had seen it before. It was that memorable. Anyway I actually quite liked it, let me tell you why. The film had an engaging and interesting start, but then it became less interesting towards the end because it delved into the nonsense science farce too much. Which is my main issue, the science behind the fantastical story is presented as fact but is absolute total nonsense mumbo jumbo which makes every moment of movie science really hard to swallow. Also the first part was a bit frustrating because of how long it takes the main guy to get it. On that note I didn't like Jake Gyllenhaal, he plays the same character which worked perfectly in Donnie Darko (2001) but in everything else nah he's too serious and boring. Well overall I actually enjoyed my experience but it's not consistent enjoyment.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The distraction,"Captain Colter(Gyllenhaal, driven), wakes up on a Chicago subway train, sitting opposite of Christina(Monaghan, adorable, if less so than she was in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang which is still a ton). She knows, and clearly likes, him, yet he has no recollection of getting on, nor does he recognize her or his own reflection! 8 minutes later, the car blows up. He comes to, back in that same situation. It has already happened, but he can keep going over that portion of time, and try to find and stop the bomb. And, lest you think there is no tension or reason for us to care(as is the case with Edge of Tomorrow), he has to do it fast it was only the first attack, and he is the best chance of preventing the next one.This gains a lot from the human story in there, with our protagonist's insistence on being more than a tool, by being allowed to contact his father outside of the ""replay"", and the studio-enforced, yet still sweet, romance. The explanation for the sci-fi aspects strains credulity, though not to the breaking point. It's fun to see him try to crack the mystery, and we are guessing right along with him. Ultimately, the solution has a number of problems: it feels so convenient and simple that I kept waiting for the twist to it, and it's easy once we get there, to the point where the audience wonders why it took so long to get there. The effects, editing and cinematography are very nicely done.This isn't as clever as it thinks it is. It also doesn't realize all of the ethical issues the concept brings up, in spite of trying to address the ones it can. The subtle exploration of post-9/11 thinking is one of the greatest strengths here. With a running time of 83 minutes not counting the end credits(89 with), and the first(as we're waiting for the film to establish what we go into it already knowing, or at least be entertaining until it gets there) and last quarter of an hour not being all that compelling, we're left with a middle that is enjoyable enough still, I don't expect I'll watch this again. While the ending does make sense, it's rather sappy, and we end up feeling more tricked than surprised.The DVD comes with the three(the latter two alternate subtitles, every few minutes a short piece of text will come up, neither of them spoil anything, so you can just put them on for the first viewing) informational tracks: #1: audio commentary with Jake Gyllenhaal, Director Duncan Jones, and Writer Ben Ripley, #2: Access Source Code: Trivia(facts that have some connection to what's on screen, such as a ""no smoking"" sign telling us when such a ban was first done. They don't really have anything to do with the movie itself. It's funny in a quirky sort of way, since it's like watching the film with an easily distracted, sentient encyclopedia, which responds to the visuals with free association – after a while, I started trying to guess, sometimes successfully, what it would ""pick"" to spout stuff about.) and #3: Tales of Time Travel(titles and short descriptions of time travel stories, most of them films, in no particular order decent, but it might as well have been text in a menu), three interesting featurettes: the 26 minute Cast and Crew Insights(interviews), 6 and a half minute Focal Points(the concepts are explained) and 18 minute Expert Intel(physics professor discusses the realism of different aspects of this), trailers for Unknown, Brighton Rock, Attack the Block and this, and an ad for Mars.There is a little violence, disturbing content and moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to the biggest fans of stories about time-travel, alternate universes, etc. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Bad Code,"The fact that so many people liked this film makes me scratch my puzzler. It asks the question: what do you get when you take a touch of ""12 Monkeys,"" add a dash of ""Déjà Vu"" and sprinkle on a smattering of ""Groundhog's Day?"" The answer? ... A whole lot of ""meh."" Aside from reeking of been-there-done-that syndrome, this film is reminiscent of the Star Trek: The Next Generation (STTNG) episode ""Cause and Effect"" in which the Enterprise was caught in a time loop in which it kept getting destroyed until the crew sussed out how to avert the tragedy. ""Source Code,"" in similar fashion repeats an 8-minute event on a train before its destruction as a result of a terrorist bombing.Unlike the STTNG episode that featured characters that fans (read as: Yours Truly) grew to know and love, the ""Source Code"" cast is unfamiliar and underdeveloped just enough for me to absolutely not care about them or their predicament.Jake Gyllenhaal does a serviceable job as the confused, reluctant protagonist, and though I love Vera Farmiga, she simply doesn't have that much to do here.

The Mind: String of Cinematic Fabric,"Ten years ago Jake Gyllenhaal brought viewers into the mind of a high school student bridging the gap between universes in ""Donnie Darko."" ""Source Code"" marks parallel universes round two for Gyllenhaal as he leads a seasoned cast with his charming acting talents. Director Duncan Jones is a relatively new director, however, he has gone down the mental thriller sci-fi path before with his 2009 movie ""Moon."" This time around he takes a well written screenplay by Ben Ripley (only lacking premier dialogue exchange) transforming it into the best movie of 2011 to date. The film is unique yet familiar because of the way it is told (the replay film). Gyllenhaal's character Captain Colter Stevens embodies a man named Sean Fentress repeating the last eight minutes of Sean's life over and over. Steven's mission is to use the new technology available to the U.S. government, known as source code, to find the man responsible for blowing up and killing more than 100 people on a Chicago commuter train and ultimately preventing subsequent attacks. After waking up from his first attempt he is disoriented and confused, wondering why he is no longer in Afghanistan with his unit. To make matters even more puzzling, he is briefed by a woman named Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga, ""Up in the Air"") about his unknown ware bouts and soldier status. Stevens learns that he is trapped and his only escape is his interaction with the people on the train that is destined to explode. A minor love story forms as he becomes closer to a woman named Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan, ""Due Date""), whom in the end he cannot stand seeing her blow up again. While he learns more and more from Goodwin throughout the film, mystery still surrounds the limits the project's creator Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright. ""Quantum of Solace"") has put on source code and its affect on past, present and future events.While many may say that the film revolves around Gyllenhaal's performance, the most important character in ""Source Code"" is Director Jones. Jones took the advanced in-depth concept within ""Source Code"" and simplified it into a short string of cinematic fabric. By doing so he took the spotlight off of Gyllenhaal opening the mind of the viewer to the simplistic detail of his fellow cast members' performances and the detailed environment surrounding them. This exemplary artistic craft can be seen throughout the film, starting with the narrow scope that cinematography allows the viewer to see to its slow expansion as plot details come to light. Jones's greatest triumph occurs during the final sequence of his film as he compresses a 3D still image into the second dimension through what can be called pure artistic craftsmanship. However, the art in the film is presented to a broader Hollywood audience and even leaves room for snippets of comic relief provided by Russell Peters's (Standup Comedian) character Max Denoff. In the end, Peters's purpose goes beyond comedy as he helps create ""Source Code's"" metaphorical undertone of happiness.Even though Ripley writes one of the best scripts of the year he fails on occasion to provide the viewer with enthralling dialogue. Periodically throughout the film the characters mend their discourse saving weekly scripted exchanges. The only other faulty part of the film comes from its almost Hollywood ending, which end on more of a happy note rather than a metaphorically profound message.The mental sci-fi action thriller genre is at its best as films continue to delve into the most profound arena; the mind itself. ""Source Code"" is yet another stepping-stone for the future of mental cinema and in the end is no let down. The film proves what ""Inception"" proved last year, art can be found within the scifi genre exemplifying the infinite possibilities of life, love and happiness.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very enjoyable movie.,"I enjoyed this, it's in the same grouping of films as Limitless and Looper, with a little bit of Groundhog Day thrown in for good measure.Think of it as a turbocharged Quantum Leap, it takes a few minutes for it to open up, but when it does it's an enjoyable watch. You could argue that it's a little repetitive at times, but what I will say, is that it's never dull, it constantly offers something to keep you entertained.The acting is fine, Jake Gyllenhaal as always is perfect in the lead role. Some really good special effects, plus a score that adds to the film, rather than distracting from it.It's an interesting solution, with some interesting ideas, but the best part here, is the ending, it comes as a real surprise.Enjoyed, 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Two Joneses,"""Source Code"" isn't even vaguely plausible. I try not to overthink sci-fi spitballing, but even the most preposterous premises should adhere to an implicit rule set. Based on a screenplay by Ben Ripley, who previously authored two direct-to-DVD ""Species"" flicks, this lazy follow- up to director Duncan Jones' understated 2009 character study ""Moon"" is a major disappointment.Steeped in pseudo-science, ""Source Code's"" biggest fault is its failure to adequately explain the parameters of the titular alternate reality experiment. Through vague governmental computer wizardry, Army Capt. Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is uploaded into the body of a civilian aboard an ill-fated Chicago-bound commuter train and tasked with locating a rigged explosive and its owner. To complicate matters, he only has eight minutes until impact and it's back to start.So begins a trial and error rescue mission—not to save the train itself, but to identify the culprit and avert a looming second attack. If you're already confused, don't sweat it—Stevens is too. After every botched attempt, he finds himself back in a dank isolation room harnessed into an enormous machine with a video link to his commanding officers. As he probes them for more information on his mission, he also pries out the requisite exposition about the tech.Long story short, Source Code isn't time travel. It merely relocates Stevens' consciousness into the lingering memory trail of the recently deceased. Cool, right? The problem is that such a heady concept immediately opens itself to a thousand potential plot holes. For instance, if Stevens is reliving the terminal eight minutes of someone's life, why can he exit the train at random when the body and mind he's sharing has no frame of reference for it? How does he even know what the passengers two cars over look like?Even if you buy into the flawed logic of ""Source Code,"" the filmmaking just isn't up to snuff. Jones throws subtlety to the wind for this antithetical take on the genre he seemed so passionate for two years ago. He imbues the proceedings with a nondescript glossy veneer and achieves unanimously stilted performances from his cast. Character actor Jeffrey Wright comes away looking especially bad, but Gyllenhaal is also mismanaged in the lead.It isn't their fault; Jones lacks vision and Ripley lacks talent. The latter in particular seems incapable of executing on even his better ideas interestingly. By his hand, Stevens' lame bomb-sniffing stratagem boils down to blindly badgering suspicious-looking commuters and eventually lucky guesswork. Maybe some will respond to his common sense approach, but I much prefer watching characters more clever than myself weasel their way out of trouble. For all his military training, Captain Stevens might as well have been Joe Average Passenger.A far cry from the careful construction of Duncan Jones' offbeat debut, ""Source Code"" is a discouragingly impersonal film shellacked with Hollywood disinfectant. Worse, it's plain bad science fiction. It's a halfhearted amalgam of films like ""The Matrix"" and ""Inception,"" hold the fresh perspective. Still, I'm not ready to count Jones out. The young director had a hand in fleshing out ""Moon,"" and will hopefully creatively contribute more to future projects. However, as it stands, his first two features couldn't be more at odds. Taken alone, ""Source Code"" is a misfire; given that it's the sophomore effort of so promising a talent, it's a major missed opportunity.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Surprisingly Original Sci-fi Thriller,"Source Code is equal parts ""Quantum Leap"", ""12 Monkeys"", and ""Deja Vu"". It has elements of any number of sci-fi thrillers, both classic and modern. And yet, it's one of the most original movies I've seen this year.Jake Gyllenhaal (Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time) stars as Colter Stevens, an Air Force pilot who must find the bomber of a passenger train before another, even larger bomb is set off in the city of Chicago. He searches by traveling back in time and entering the mind of a passenger who died on the train. He can only stay for eight minutes at a time, but he can keep returning as often as he needs to; as long as he finds the answer in time.While his mind travels to the past, his body is locked in a mysterious pod. He communicates with the other members of the Source Code project through video; but most of the communication is practically one-way, as the leader of the project, played by Jeffrey Wright (Casino Royale), rarely answers his questions and insists on updates. It's understandable, I suppose, with even more lives at stake, but it doesn't do much for Stevens' state of mind, which is already strained by the time travel. To make things even more complicated, Stevens' begins to fall for one of the passengers, played by Michelle Monaghan (Eagle Eye, Gone Baby Gone).The movie does a wonderful job of building and holding the suspense. The mystery of the bomber's identity is hardly the only mystery that needs to be solved. Who is Colter Stevens, really? How did he become part of the Source Code project? Can he change the fates of everyone, or anyone, who died on the train? What will his fate be if he fails? What will be his fate if he succeeds? The acting is another gem for this film. Jake Gyllenhaal demonstrates his range as he plays a man increasingly frustrated with the dual tasks of saving lives and discovering his own status. Monaghan is a delight to watch, as she always is, and the chemistry between the two doesn't feel at all forced, as it so often does in thrillers with romantic subplots. Vera Farmiga (Up in the Air, Orphan) plays a sympathetic Air Force captain who tries to guide Stevens through his mission, and even support him when he uncovers the truth about how and why he was chosen for it.If there is a difference between derivative and unoriginal, then Source Code sets the standard for defining it. The ending, I felt, may have been a bridge too far, but that doesn't change the fact that, in a culture of remakes, sequels, and adaptations, this is one of the few movies that can stand on its own merits. There are elements, as I've written, from several different sci-fi stories, and yet they are weaved together into a surprisingly original thriller.(Originally appeared at http://fourthdayuniverse.com/reports)",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Hard SF or Thriller?,"I have watched this movie now because I'm scheduling a thematic channel.Does science have no feelings? Love conquers all?Jake Gyllenhaal is in his best. And... what can I say... I love Michelle (her welsh surname too).I love films where reality is not what it seems. And it seems a fast paced thriller but I think that this falls under the genre of Hard Science-Fiction. The best is that it forces you to think, as Interestellar.The only 'But...' is that certain times of the script are slaughtered to the thriller tension. However the end result is powerful and moving.

excellent! just what I needed after a long day,"I've just finished watching it and it really brought me to a different reality,I couldn't see anything else until it was over, it was that kind of a movie. great job to the actors & to the one who wrote that script! I would love to see more movies like this one, and I love the idea of parallel worlds where anything can happen, it makes you wonder.. The concept of the movie is quite new, never seen it in movies before and I think that's exactly what people are looking for - it enriches our imagination. To think beyond the limits and to believe that death is not the end - these are two of most important ideas from this movie (please excuse my English, still learning).",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Unique, thrilling and tense.","Jake Gyllenhaal fleshes out the characters he portrays, and rightfully makes it his own. Whether it's Donnie Darko or Zodiac, he ups the ante. This is absolutely the case in Source Code. Think Groundhog Day meets the best sci-fi you can think of. Gyllenhaal is Colter Stevens, a soldier who's forced to use the Source Code: repeating a real-life train journey to Chicago, and its eventual explosion and the death of everyone on board. His mission is to find the bomb and its detonator. The investigation's only half the hoot. On the train opposite Stevens (who's in someone else's body on the train) is Christina (Michelle Monaghan), a beautiful, down-to-earth woman that knows the person Stevens has 'taken over'. Colter's subconscious actions bring them closer together, but is it a relationship destined to fail the moment he enters the Source Code? Only 8 minutes of time will tell, as director Duncan Jones successfully balances romance (or not time-travelling) with heart-stopping action.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
From Emotions to Algorithms.,"Director Duncan Jones, who gained fame with his debut film «Moon» (2009), returns to science fiction with «Source Code». The protagonist, Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal), suddenly wakes up in another man's body and has eight minutes to prevent a train explosion. Sounds thrilling? Yes, unless you start thinking about how it all works.Jake Gyllenhaal, as always, is top-notch. His charisma and ability to convey the full range of the protagonist's emotions make the film watchable even for those who aren't fans of science fiction. Vera Farmiga as Goodwin and Jeffrey Wright as Dr. Rutledge also shine; their characters bring the necessary drama and mystery to the plot. The scene where Goodwin, breaking all protocols, makes a human choice is particularly impressive, showing that even in a world of algorithms and technology, there is room for genuine compassion.The visual effects and technical execution deserve special praise: train scenes, explosions, effects - all are first-rate. Cinematographer Don Burgess, known for his work on the iconic film «Forrest Gump» (1994), and composer Chris Bacon clearly knew what they were doing; every frame and note contribute to the film's overall atmosphere. But, as they say, all that glitters is not gold.The idea that the «Source Code» device can create a multiverse sounds at least strange. The film raises more questions than it answers, and the scientific basis of the plot seems so strained that one might wonder if screenwriter Ben Ripley should have attended a few physics lectures. The logical inconsistencies in the plot also don't help immerse the viewer in the story; sometimes it feels like the film forgets its own rules, let alone the audience.Plot twists that initially intrigue become predictable fairly quickly. Dialogues, at times reminiscent of school essays, and clichéd secondary characters also don't help. You can't help but wonder: was too much attention paid to visual effects at the expense of script development?Despite this, the film leaves behind a few memorable moments. The main character's phone call to his father is a touching scene that evokes genuine emotions. Goodwin's decision to keep her promise to Colter adds depth and underscores the human side of the story, which is so necessary for a film with a sci-fi foundation.This is a tense sci-fi thriller with excellent acting and impressive visual effects. But its weak scientific foundation and logical inconsistencies prevent it from becoming truly outstanding. In the end, the film leaves a mixed impression: it captivates with its visual solutions and tense atmosphere but disappoints with the insufficient development of scientific concepts and plot details.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Keeps you on the edge.,"I was told about Source Code by a friend of mine who was psyched about it. So I decided to give it a try. I was expecting a usual action packed thriller with not much of a storyline. But, what I saw was a very well scripted, intellectually challenging movie with not too much action. I actually had to watch it again to get the full gist of it. The story revolves around a soldier played by Jake Gyllenhaal who did full justice to his role. This might be his best performance after Donnie Darko and Brokeback Mountain.Source Code, being a science-fiction, had some non-explainable facets to it. But, the writer did his best to keep things clear and not make it too complicated. It may probably not win an Oscar next year, nevertheless, it is the best thriller this year and deserves to be watched at least once.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Another favourite of mine this year...,"So far, 2011 has been a mixed year. There have been fantastic films, like Tree of Life and some pretty bad films too like Battle:Los Angeles. Source Code is not quite my favourite of 2011, but it is close. It is a suspenseful, compelling and very well done thriller and almost perfect. Duncan Jones(director of the wonderful Moon) does a superb job directing, and the film looks great with atmospheric cinematography and lighting. The writing is outstanding, thoughtful with the odd bit of droll humour and the issues of loss and responsibility give it some emotional weight as well, and the story benefits from an interesting idea, is compelling and has enough suspense and tautness to satisfy. The acting is great, Jake Gyllanhaal balances vulnerability and muscle-bound action expertly. Jeffrey Wright tries a little too hard, but Michelle Monaghan and Vera Farmiga are solid as rocks. All in all, an excellent film and a favourite of mine this year. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Simple but effective,"Despite its short run time, Source Code manages to cover a great deal of exciting scenes and twists (some more predictable than others, but they are exciting and warranted nonetheless). Its best to go in knowing a minimal amount of what is going to happen. In fact, the movie itself is minimal, but by answering things that are usually important to the story at a rapid pace, the minimalist effect works well. Some may complain of the ending, but it works within the story well and leaves the audience with a large amount of space to think. All in all, an enjoyable ride that will leave you contemplating what you saw and satisfied with its workmanlike nature.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A twisted brilliant thriller.,"Wow. Having just watched Source Code I must say that this is a great movie. The storyline is filled with twists and turns. The movie is smartly built and wonderfully acted. Jake Gyllenhaal acts with emotional depth and gives us a look into the life of someone thrown into such a strange and unsettling circumstances. The movie makes you feel very smart for understanding each twist and turn. Every single second is well thought out and has the rest of the movie in mind. The movie is clever. Of course the movie does toy around with some very profound ideas, especially in the last few minutes, and sometimes they don't always work. However most of the time the movie leaves you guessing and feeling sad for the loss and pain of the characters, escpically the main character. The sheer complexity makes it mind bending. But at the same time it's very straightforward to understand. All in all its a great film with a few missteps are outdone by the brilliance of the film. Thank you for reading.

Exactly what you'd expect from someone whose Dad once sang about spiders from Mars,"For a guy whose Dad used to sing about spiders from Mars, it's probably apt that he turned out to be a sci-fi whiz kid. Duncan Jones burst onto the scene with his 2009 sci-fi drama 'Moon', starring the great but underrated Sam Rockwell. He made an impression with that film and makes an even bigger one with his sophomore film.The first time I saw 'Source Code' I dismissed it as mere escapist folly. A (much recommended) second viewing confirmed the film is clever, full of ideas, original and, most importantly, hugely entertaining. It's like a song you dismiss upon your first hearing but grow to love. I had precisely the same experience with Wes Anderson's 'The life Aquatic with Steve Zissou'; now it's one of my favourites of the last 10 years.'Source Code' opens with alternating, swooping tracking shots of a moving train against a wonderfully modern, almost futuristic, Chicago. The Hitchcockian music presages the relentlessly fast pace of the film. Don't reach for popcorn, or make notes like I had to; you'll miss a vital plot point.Jake Gyllenhaal awakens on this train and finds himself sitting opposite Christina (Michelle Monaghan). She refers to him as 'Sean' but he insists he's Captain Colter Stevens, a US soldier who flies planes in Afghanistan. He's acutely aware of his surroundings, all of his senses are heightened.Then the train blows up. He is zapped from the train to a desolate, blackened capsule, with only a computer screen for company. A face emerges on it. It's the pretty face of Vera Farmiga's character, Goodwin. She administers a quick mental test to ensure he is compos mentis. He passes. 'Welcome back, Captain', Goodwin reassures him.He obtains as much information as he can about his situation. The company he is part of is called Beleaguered Castle. He's on a mission to find out who bombed the train. He will keep being zapped back to the train until he finds the bomber. How this is all possible, he finds out later, is due to 'Source Code'.'Source Code', the theory goes, allows access to a parallel reality. This reality is opened when a person's circuit memory remains active for eight minutes after their death. These eight minutes can then be re-lived by someone whose profile (DNA?) resembles the deceased's. Stevens' profile matches one of the train's commuters – Sean Fentress, a teacher.Now things start to make sense and the action can be enjoyed without having to stop and think too much. Events fall into place more or less how we envisage them. There's a nice twist as to who the bomber is, but anyone who calls themselves a buff will guess correctly based on classic rules of audience deception.Apart from 'Donnie Darko', Gyllenhall has scored big with performances in Jim Sheridan's 'Brothers' and Jim Madden's 'Proof'. He brings an appealing physicality to this role. He assumes the nuances of each scene skilfully and seamlessly. Like only some of Hollywood's hunks, he is valued both as a serious actor and as a bit of eye candy. My only gripe is that he's still a tad too young to pull off this kind of demanding role. Every role requiring him to be experienced and worldly, have him come off as boyish and unpersuasive.A flaw here is that Gyllenahaal plays Stevens as relatively sanguine. Surely a person in his position would be the epitome of furious, if not in state of permanent disbelief or apoplexy. I'd wager that it would have benefited the story's subterfuge if Sam Rockwell had played him.It's not a point that's been dwelled upon but there are four big twists. Containing them in 93 minutes, and doing so engrossingly, shows Jones's talent. Never is the film geeky or inaccessible. That's not to say it's not intellectual – it is, and Jones manages to reconcile some clever and complex ideas. The film raises an ethical question: Should such a device as Source Code, if it existed, be used in the fight in the 'war on terror'?Much of the success of 'Source Code' is down to the Editor, Paul Hirsch, whose precise timing in cutting back and forth between the train and capsule keep you hooked. Credit also to the SFX staff: the explosions look charmingly fake.I would have liked Ben Ripley's script to develop the Source Code theory a bit more – because it's fascinating and the film wouldn't have lost anything by dropping a few of the near-duplicated mission scenes. One or two sentences by Jeffrey Wright explaining Source Code aren't quite satisfactory, neither is Gyllenhaal saying 'Yeah, I know, quantum physics and parabolic calculus'.Jeffrey Wright is believable, like he normally is, as Dr Rutledge, the patriotic zealot responsible for creating Source Code. Vera Farmiga is spot on as Rutledge's dedicated but compassionate co-worker, though her role is easy. The comedian Russell Peters features quite extensively as an obnoxious passenger on the train, though I'm not sure his appearance is necessary.The characters remain sedentary for most of the film. The few kinetic sequences were just enough to break the monotony. The end scene is played out in real time, where we get to see a full episode of Source Code, i.e. a whole eight-minute scene, which is as heart-wrenching as it is cathartic. I won't spoil it by asking why Stevens' Dad doesn't recognise his own son's voice?www.scottishreview.net",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Smart and exciting original thriller with equal heart to match the brains,"Trains, brains and alternate realities comprise ""Source Code,"" the sophomore feature from Duncan Jones, director of 2009′s intellectual sci-fi dish ""Moon"" starring Sam Rockwell. Jones coaches a similarly terrific actor in Jake Gyllenhaal to another commanding yet heart-filled leading performance. The difference is that ""Moon"" was contemplative and brooding; ""Source Code"" moves at thrill-a-minute pace. Both, however, possess that same cerebral quality that wins audiences over.A less elaborate ""Inception"" might be one way to classify ""Source Code,"" as both share this newly founded sub-sub-genre of carrying out missions in a lifelike non-reality. ""Source Code"" focuses on Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal), a helicopter pilot in the air force who finds himself inside the titular program, which zaps him into the body of a random passenger aboard a Chicago-bound commuter train that will explode in exactly eight minutes. The passenger has already died in this incident and so has everyone on the train, but as program creator Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) explains, part of the human brain's short-term memory still functions in a window of time after death. The source code recreates that eight-minute long experience. The idea is that Stevens can use those eight minutes to learn information about the crime and prevent future acts of terror; all other objectives are secondary.Rookie writer Ben Ripley's script moves along well enough with Jones' pacing to keep our attention away from holes in the plot and the science and everything you'd expect in a film this preposterous to make ""Source Code"" a fun and stimulating ride. And although it's seemingly all about brain science, the film displays a surprising amount of heart and a unique perspective on human nature. Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan ooze a certain likability that ups the ante and lets us step back from putting the plot's puzzle pieces together so that we may adore the chemistry and other gooier moments free of guilt.Even Vera Farmiga, who plays the face on the monitor guiding Stevens through the process, becomes a more involved character throughout the film, which offers a nice change of pace compared to similar military characters in these kinds of offerings.The story withholds a frustrating amount of information at the beginning, made all the worse by Stevens begging Farmiga's Goodwin for answers and her continued reluctant denial of them. From the trailers, you also have an idea of what the source code is all about, but not having that confirmation is tantalizing for the first portion of the film. Frustrating, but darn effective. The answers, while not presented in a miraculous twist format are unique and certainly not predictable. Without spoiling anything, I can assure you that there's no source code within a source code.As a Chicago resident, ""Source Code"" was both cooler and more ridiculous. From what I could piece together, I'm pretty sure this was I usually took when I was a resident of the suburbs. I can't fathom anyone trying to blow it up — it's kind of boring. The whole ""who's the terrorist?"" element of the plot, however, ranks way behind the film's character-driven objectives. We're supposed to care much more about Stevens' and his experience with the source code, not about the ultimately irrelevant context Ripley concocted to get him there.As such, the film could've taken place anywhere, although Jones takes great joy in turning Chicago's infamous ""bean"" in Millennium Park into a metaphor for the film. Henceforth, I won't be looking at the bean the same way again. I will also be sure to crawl underneath it on my next visit and decree: ""I am in the source code.""Even if only coincidence, great pride comes from this thrilling movie being set in my fair city. A gripping original story — no matter the size of the gaping holes in its logic or the terrible CGI used to create its explosion sequences — clearly overrules everything, and this film has the proof. ""Source Code"" offers a thinker's thriller without the headache, a story geared to sci-fi nerds with a universally appealing message at its core. I suspect some will scoff at its relatively mid-range intellectual level, but from a pure storytelling perspective, ""Source Code"" does everything right, very much in the same way (but on a smaller scale) that James Cameron's films do. Duncan Jones should now be on everyone's list a director worth keeping tabs on if he can continue to bring high-concept films down to earth.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Just to clear the confusion among audience for this excellent serious sci-fi movie,"Let me try communicate well. Quantum parallel universes are the premise of this movie and the machine built by the physicist in the movie. The thread that the soldier asked for executing the mission is in one quantum universe. He had the opportunity to enter another quantum universe in which the explosion has yet to happen. This opportunity is introduced due to the fact that the scientist is able to capture the overlap between multiverse after seizing the brain state of Sean just 8 minutes before the explosion. Multiverse overlaps when their states match at one time instance. The scientist will be able to hold on 8 minutes of another quantum universe and call the soldier back to the reference thread, as long as Sean exits the other quantum universe in a death state at the end of the 8 minutes. Otherwise, there will be difficulty, as shown in the movie. It all occurs as planned since the soldier is called back. However, the last time the solider enters a (not the) quantum universe that overlaps with the reference universe, he was terminated at the reference thread by the captain. Once the reference quantum universe vanishes according to the soldier brain state as he was put to death at the end of the 8 minutes in the main thread, the other quantum universe departs the overlap instance and Sean continues to exist in that quantum universe with all memory acquired from the reference universe (multiverse communication succeeds). Of course, once he texts the captain in that alternative quantum universe, the captain in that quantum universe will receive the text message before she actually proceeds with the mission. In the ending, the soldier realized that and informs the unaware captain and the scientist in his alternative universe about this aftermath of a successful multiverse joins and departs that is a successful multiverse communication.The movie is an accurate depiction of multiverse communication.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
True sci-fi,"This is what a true sci-fi should be. It's fun, easy to watch, but thought-provoking and intelligent.

"Thank you Duncan Jones, for re-establishing my faith in the new breed of film directors. Not all's lost!!","Cinema is an art, beautiful, complex and surreal . To make a good film requires more than just money and a fancy equipment. The problem nowadays is that it has become more and more difficult to actually find the art in cinema . We have movies coming out, it seems in factory lines, with a particular format of budget and emotions. And all this while we forget to add the soul in films.... the soul which makes it what it is, but then again every once in a while we come across something which surprises us but at the same time we find the familiarity of likeness which we have been seeking for so long. It need not be too fancy or too flashy. All it needs to be is a good idea, cleverly executed. Source Code is a perfect example of that! Having heard a lot about the film, I still kept my expectations low. In comparison to the brand of cinema (in 3D, might I add) we've been witnessing lately, it wasn't surprising that people have developed a tendency of appreciating anything mediocre these days. What I saw, however, blew my mind away. Not because it was an extremely well crafted script, not because Jake Gyllenhaal performed spectacularly but because it managed to join the small list of films which I entitle as beautiful. Made on a reported budget of a mere 35 million dollars, it did what most of these so called blockbusters haven't managed to do, made me sit in one place for one and a half hour......in awe.""Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up to find himself on a train heading to Chicago. Although the other passengers all seem to know him, he has absolutely no idea where or even who he is. The last thing Colter remembers is flying a helicopter mission in Iraq, but here he is in someone else's life, being referred to as ""Sean"" by his traveling companion (Michelle Monaghan). Even the man in the mirror looks nothing like him. Before he can find out what's going on, an express train zooms by on the opposite track and a bomb on the train explodes.Colter then wakes up in a chamber where an officer on the screen (Vera Farmiga) tells him that he has just returned from the ""Source Code"", a secret government project which lets him go back to the last 8 minutes of a person's life and re-live it. His job is to use those 8 minutes in order to find out who the bomber on the train was as that is their only key to saving the other places where the bomb has been planted.The movie works on a large scale mostly due to the combined brilliant efforts of both the director and its lead actor. Jake Gyllenhaal displays a wonderful presence of character and has, after a long time given such a wonderful performance, supported well by the rest of the cast members which includes a surprise number in the form of Russel Peters. Also remarkable were the special effects which showed that YOU DO NOT NEED 3D TO MAKE A VISUALLY WELL SHOT FILM, but what works most for the film is its human element which manages to make an otherwise imperfect film, beautiful. Being a science fiction film it could well have gone down the path taken by most science-fiction films where good concept is traded off for action scenes and everything that could have helped it become a masterpiece is flushed down the drain. Instead, Source Code walks down a different path... it chooses to have a soul (a la Vanilla Sky, Blade Runner and Inception) Every time Colter goes back for eight minutes, it feels as if we are back for another short adventure, building our anticipation about what indeed we are going to find next. Director Duncan Jones manages to make a fast-paced gripping thriller and displays enough reasons why he will be the one to watch out for in the years to come! With every film, he is evolving into a fantastic direct0r. Moon suggested it and now Source Code confirms it too. That's 2/2 for you!If Inception and now Source Code are anything to go by, rest assured this decade, might turn very well turn out to be the age of intelligent, thrilling science fiction movies.Thank you Duncan Jones, for re-establishing my faith in the new breed of film directors.

A brilliant idea; every minute counts,"POSITIVES:1) The idea is brilliant
2) The film is only 90 mins long and takes place almost entirely in the same 2 settings; this makes the film magnificently focused
3) I genuinely welled up towards the end when Colter calls his father
4) The mix of high concept sci fi and terrorist thriller is really goodNEGATIVES:1) I hate when films spend their first 3 minutes doing the credits over random shots of scenery
2) I don't think the threat of the terrorist attack was focused on enough. Other than one tv screen of cars trying to escape Chicago, the impact of the terrorist attack is never really felt
3) While I actually quite like the idea of the ending, the fact that there is no explanation to the ending is infuriating",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Coded to perfection and thrills!!,"Source Code is an enjoyable Sci-fi thriller shot in Hitchcockian style,which reminds of the 1993 flick Groundhog Day.Director Duncan Jones who earlier directed the critically acclaimed movie Moon(2009) has created his second movie in even better way pleasing all the sections of the audience using an excellent screenplay by Ben Ripley.Captain Colterswakes up in a train to Chicago, inside a body of a teacher whom he does not identify and comes to know that he's part of a mission to find the bomber of a Chicago commuter train and to prevent another bombing in the city.Jake Gyllenhaal(Whom we loved in Prince of Persia) has done a superb job by effortlessly portraying the confusions,emotions and essence of Captain Colter Stevens.Michelle Monagahan has also played her role remarkably well and suits the role of a lovable Christina Warren.Vera Farmiga (Up In The Air fame) and Jeffrey Wright have done their parts with full commitment and requires appreciation.Some small goofs about the bombing of the train and colter Stevens and low quality graphic effects,particularly the explosion scenes are the only negatives which can be picked out.Excellent incorporation of love into a sci-fi background,goof-less script by Ben Ripley,the Hitchcockian way of story-telling and brisk Editing of the movie makes it a must watch for movie lovers.Verdict::Source Code is a thoroughly enjoyable Science Fiction with a well-crafted storyline,good performances,strong screenplay and commendable direction.Go for this movie and you will love it.

"A well made thriller will an unsatisfying, plot hole of an ending","What happens when you end up in a train and get involved in a crime where you have to save the people in it from a bomber while also being caught in a time loop? Sounds confusing I know and I hate describing plots in movies so lets just leave it at that.Source Code is very entertaining. Well shot and well directed for the most part. Jake Gyllenhaal gives an exceptional performance as well, as his reactions to the situations seem very natural in an otherwise unnatural situation.Before going in to this film let me tell you that its the mystery plot that keeps you invested. You are continuously curious about the situations Gyllenhaal is put in. About the time loop that keeps happening. Its the kind of story that relies on plot to keep you in rather than characters, since aside from Gyllenhaal, no other characters really pull you in.The main issue I have with the film is the ending, which I won't spoil. Its one of those endings that right before the last 5-10 minutes wraps up in a nice bow and everything seems to make sense. Then right at the last couple minutes it takes a complete turn and now everything you thought you knew turned out to not be true at all. Your left questioning things. Its like in a horror movie when the main characters finally kill the monster but then it turns out its still alive right at the last shot of the movie. whats worse is its not nearly as smart where it could leave clues to figure out what the ending really means.It just doesn't work in this kind of movie. Overall though it was fun. There's also a romance plot in the movie that was sweet and aside from the flaws its still an above average movie.Score: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Eight Minute ""Groundhog Day"" with Suspense","""Source Code"" is a sci-fi in a similar vein as the movie ""Deja Vu"" with Denzel Washington. A scientist named Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) has developed a method to send a person's consciousness into another person's for eight minutes at a time, almost like ""Quantum Leap.""OK, that's not what Dr. Rutledge claimed, but that's what was happening.As Dr. Rutledge phrased it,""When a light bulb turns off there's an afterglow... The brain is like that. Its electromagnetic field remains charged, just briefly, even after death... It contains a short term memory track that's approximately eight minutes long...Combining these two effects , Source Code lets us capitalize on the overlap (of the remaining charge and the eight minutes of memory).""All we see is as the viewer is a man named Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) in a capsule being beamed into another man's body repeatedly at eight minute intervals in order for him to identify the person responsible for blowing up a train. This memory that Stevens is reliving is of a teacher named Sean Fintress who died in that explosion. Every time eight minutes lapses Stevens finds himself back in his capsule.The science of this science-fiction is far from air tight. How is Stevens able to go into another man's brain if the ""electromagnetic field remains charged just briefly""? Based upon Dr. Rutledge's explanation they'd have to either keep the brain alive indefinitely or be there the moment a person died, and even then I'm assuming they'd only get one shot. Furthermore, how can a person manipulate those eight minutes worth of memory? What happened happened, how can you cause the person to do something different?There are more questions, but I don't want to belabor my point, which is that there are plenty of plot holes. Stevens was supposed to investigate while in the Source Code in order to find out the identity of the bomber to prevent a future larger explosion. Each time Stevens went in Source Code he got closer to the answer and closer to the love interest, Christina (Michelle Monaghan).Ignoring the faulty science, this was a blast; like an eight minute ""Groundhog Day"" with suspense.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A very Quantum Leap like movie that is very fun to watch.  A movie that makes you think about it when its over. I say B+,"""What would you do if you knew you only had one minute to live?"" Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal) is picked to be part of a new and secret plan. He is able to relive the last eight minutes of someones life over and over in order to stop terrorist activity. The only problem is that he doesn't realize it at first. His goal is to find out who bombed a train in Chicago in order to stop a bigger and more deadly explosion later in the day, but Colter wants to change the plans, if he can. This is a very good movie, but one you must pay attention to in order to follow it easily. This is from the same director of ""Moon"", so if you have seen that movie you will know what to expect from this movie. This is a movie that would get better the more you watch, very layered type of movie and you will be able to catch different things each time you watch. One of the better sci-fi/thrillers along the lines of ""Inception"" and ""Adjustment Bureau"", not as good as those, but comparisons could be drawn. Overall, a very interesting movie that needs to be seen more then once in order to fully get what you need out of it. I liked it though. I give it a B+.Would I watch again? - Yes I would, you almost should.*Also try - Speed Of Thought & Moon",,Anonymous,Mystery
Predictable and Boring,"Not sure what other people are seeing in this. Within 10 minutes I had the plot worked out. I very much disliked the cinematography. From the first scene with the cut aerial shots sweeping to the train and over the city I did not like it. The relationship between the girl on the train and the man was ridiculous. He had more on screen time and a better relationship with the military girl. I just thought it was not very good, boring shots very like good TV, very little drama. I do not understand the people on the edge of there seats comments. A 6 film, not awful but it felt like payola to me. The studio must be delighted to have somehow gotten away with it.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Amazing thriller,"I love this movie. Jake Gyllenhaal plays really well, Michelle Monaghan is at maximum charisma, and the plot has just right amount of science fiction, some dark mystery, and endless suspense. The cinematography is excellent as well.Also, I really like movies that put story forward and do a lot with very little - there were basically four scenes in whole movie - a train, a capsule, a military installation and a train station/parking lot. Yet, like other excellent movies with such limited locations - like ""The Cube"" or ""Man from Earth"", the story and people are working so well that you barely notice.If anything, the ending feels a little bit cheesy, and the science has been explained poorly. ""Quantum mechanics"" and ""parabolic calculus"" is basically poor way of saying ""don't worry your little head about it"". There's also sort of a plot hole. To not spoil anything much, protagonists have ability to create (better) alternate realities, but since it requires something bad to happen in current one, and they'll still stay in current one, why do they bother, exactly?I wish this issue could have been addressed more. That said, absolutely excellent movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Great film for those who are spiritually aware and wished to watch continuation of Matrix,"This movie has a spiritual meaning which you can only understand if you read and educate yourself about quantum psychics before hand. The script is not a brainer and it is very simple. You will guess the next scene without any doubt. If you are looking to watch a cleverly made, Matrix like science fiction, do not bother to watch this movie. You will find it not an exciting and loaded with virtual effects.However if you are practicing quantum psychics and you want to grow with the message embedded within the movie, go for it. This movie is not for everyone. This is definitely not a film which can win Oscars. acting is not an extraordinary as the script does not require actors to push themselves more.

Tell Him Everything Is Going To Be Okay,"I think this is one of Gyllenhall's best movies. The sci fi alternate reality is not bad. It has an original concept. It has some decent special effects. The worst part of it all, is that at some point, they are trying to have a good time in Chicago which we all know is just not possible.Of course this movie is over 10 years old at the time of this review so maybe Chicago was better back then. I know I will always miss the Chicago Chop House, one of my favorite places in that city.There's plenty of reviews on this one so I'll just rate it and move on.

An original and movie drenched in sagacity,"The majority of films today will either have an idea that they use to compel their story and have originality, or they have an idea not so unheard of but their acting, cinematography, and screenplay will make it easy to overlook. Sometimes they will have half and half or divvy it up, but it's not often that you come across a movie that throws all of it at you at once, yet organizes and flows luxuriously. With Source Code, it seizes your attention with not just action and fast cuts, it makes you excited, it makes you sad and mourn, it takes you to somewhere that puts you in the ""body"" of Gyllenhaal as he so effortlessly jumps into the shoes of a confused and real person. He makes it seem as though he was literally put in the position of the movie with no past knowledge, he resembles all of us with the fear, anger, and all emotions that come with being put in the Source Code. In a word this movie is original, yet not just a cool idea, the acting and the techniques used by Duncan make it seem more like the source code already is real, and we are just now learning. The movie is great and I would recommend it to anyone that likes a good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Sci-Fi action does not disappoint!,"Source Code is now added to my top 20 all-time favorite movies.This movie is excellent - if you like sci-fi. If you don't like science fiction, then this movie can't help you. You must be able to take a leap of faith with the premise of this story.Why this movie is fantastic and deserves your time: 1) Quick-start. The action begins the moment we fade-in. The very first frame of the movie - that's it, game on. And don't think this is the typical gimmick of then going into flashback so we can see the ""setup"" for the action which started the story. Oh no. We simply jump into the middle of the action. The story has already started, and we're barely grabbing on for the ride.2) Pacing. The hero does everything you want him to do, exactly when you want it, in the right way, at the right time. Sometimes confused, sometimes determined and forceful - always in the same frame of mind as us, the viewers. At no time was I waiting for the hero to ""catch up"" to me. And at no time was I left behind while the story raced ahead of me. It's a writing skill I greatly admire.3) Characters. They are all believable. They react to situations the way you think people should react. You never ""see"" acting. You never say to yourself, ""Oh come on, nobody would say that."" Not in this movie.My mind was engaged every step of the way through this thriller. There's no time to rest. And there's no filler scenes.This movie has been compared to many. Source Code really stands out on its own, and is superior to most. If you liked or even mildly enjoyed some of the other movies to which Source Code has been compared, you should love this.

Jake Gyllenhaal is dependable as always and especially Michelle Monaghan has the exceptional quality to have chemistry with almost any actor she works with. Believe me, in the role she is playing, it is hard not to come off as annoying or damsel in distress. And she doesn't.Maybe if you looked real hard, you would find plot holes about alternate realities or universes or time travel in this film. But I didn't want to think too much. The filmmakers has my permission to just go ahead and tell their story.Source Code will be judged by some as dull or talky. That's the part of the audience who loved T4 or Transformers I-III.

The idea of reliving the last eight minutes of a life to avoid a terrorist attack is original and keeps the tension high. Jake Gyllenhaal is convincing in the main role, bringing emotion and intensity to the character.The film hits the pace, with few moments of boredom, but some parts of the story begin to get complicated and require a little more suspension of disbelief than necessary. The narrative loses strength at its end, with an outcome that tries to be exciting, but that leaves some loose ends and does not tie everything so satisfactorily.Despite this, ""Source Code"" is a good mix of action and mystery, with an execution that fulfills what it promises.

No intentional spoiler inside,"Let me start by saying, I didn't mean to see ""Source Code"". It was one of those films I red about and thought I might see them one day, but it was sheer accident I ended up seeing it. And despite some plot holes I enjoyed it. The acting is first class, Gyllenhaal is repeating his Prince of Persia role, so much so I could call the earlier movie a spoiler for this one, but that's all I'm going to say on the subject. Problem is this film is almost impossible to speak about without adding spoilers. I can say the pacing was perfect, I can say it's an action sci-fi (many scientist will debate this) in which most of the action is psychological. I could add a special commendation for Vera Farmiga whose role is much harder than most of the others on the film and she still performs superbly, but truth is that's all I can say without adding a spoiler.So here is the bottom line, despite the mentioned plot holes, the movie works and that's what matters.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A fantastic thriller movie,"I first learned about Source Code thanks to IMDb. I saw Jake Gyllenhaal was starring in the film, so I decided to check out the trailer. It was brilliant. The trailer made me excited to see the actual movie and I was very disappointed (when I first saw the trailer) to find out that 'Source Code' wasn't out yet.We were originally going to see 'Sucker Punch' today, but it wasn't showing during the times we were available. Luckily, I saw that this movie was also playing, so I eagerly suggested to watch this movie instead. It was a good choice, seeing as my mom, my sister and I all enjoyed this movie tremendously.This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat, waiting for Colter (Jake Gyllenhaal) to make his next move. I was surprised to see that this was sort of a low-budget movie. The director did a great job with limited funding. 'Source Code' will keep everyone interested. Unless you're that type of person who over-analyzes everything and wants everything to be perfect.As an action movie, this film gets a perfect grade. As a thriller, another perfect grade. But I was confused with the science-fiction part of this movie. The ending made me confused. I didn't know what had happened anymore. I think that this movie should have ended 5 minutes earlier. But it didn't. And for that, I gave this movie a 9/10. A very small (and can be overlooked if you wish to) deduction.'Source Code' is an excellent mystery thriller. Don't over think things.

Duncan Jones with a 2nd Home-Run!,"Two years ago a small independent sci-fi film called Moon was released. It was one of the three best films of that year. So I knew Duncan Jones was a director to look out for. A few months ago when I heard about the plot for Source Code I thought it would be an experiment gone wrong. The trailer reinforced those ideas even more, to the point that I never bothered to anticipate it or even know when it was about to come out. Then it was released to some strong reviews. The film deserved them, because this is Duncan Jones at another strong outing.Source Code handles some sci-fi ideas with it's plot in a very well thought-out manner. The screenplay is pretty great, especially when we have seen films 'play out dejavus' before. But Source Coce represents a new idea. It is true that the actual mechanics of the film's 'Source Code' would probably not be able to work in the real world, but this film succeeds in the same way that Moon succeeded. It deals with some very interesting ideas that are center in the plot of one male lead. Jake Gyllenhaal is pretty great in the main role. He hasn't had a performance or film this good since... well, a LONG time. Michelle Monaghan is also pretty good, and it's very easy to know why this character would be going out with a woman who's this likable. I also loved the ending.Duncan Jones is 2 for 2 with this and Moon. Both are great thought-out films, although they do have different looks, since Moon was low-budget and this one definitely does feel a lot more mainstream. Jones kind of reminds me of how Christopher Nolan started out, with indies like Memento on to big films like The Dark Knight and Inception. Hopefully Jones becomes just as big (although better luck to Jones than Nolan at the Oscars, hehe).",,Anonymous,Mystery
Fine and interesting,"This movie is a pleasant viewing experience that delivers a well developed plot that I found to be quite engaging, that is the good part.I did find that the story lacked a bit of creativity in terms of thrills and suspense but Jake Gyllenhaal did a fantastic job at keeping me interested right till the end. Parallels have been drawn with 'inception' by some reviews before me but I think they are exaggerated 'Source code' is a good watch but doesn't possess the heart thumping edge of your seat suspense that we got from Nolan's masterpiece.You must watch this movie because I was particularly caught by surprise by one sad twist in the tale that I am sure will find interesting too.I'd say seven stars for great acting and some really fine dialogue.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Source Code is a more convoluted, faster paced Ground Hogs Day [1993] with guns and a ticking time bomb","Source Code is a more convoluted, faster paced Ground Hogs Day [1993] with guns and a ticking time bomb. Although not that well made Source Code is a reminder that audiences prefer complex story lines, even if they aren't completely coherent.Source Code stars Jake Gyllenhaal as a Colter Stevens, a helicopter pilot who is trapped in some sort of machine simulator. The beginning of the film starts with Stevens waking up on a train in a body that is not his own. He's sitting across from Christina Warren played by Michelle Monaghan, a female companion who he will learn later on has a small crush on him, or at least who she thinks Sean Fentress. Stevens lives 8 minutes of Fentress's life trying to gather himself when a bomb suddenly explodes killing everyone on the train.Stevens awakens in a metal dome disoriented and locked into a harness. Without knowing who or where he is an image and voice appear when he is contacted by Luit Goodwin played by Vera Farmiga. Goodwin tells Stevens that he must identify the bomber of the train so that they can prevent another terrorist attack. Steven's doesn't quite understand what's going on with his last memories being aboard a helicopter in Afghanistan. Before too many of Stevens' questions are answered he is to told to try again and abruptly plugged back into the source code.This process continues over and over until bit by bit is revealed what the source code is. Apparently source code allows a certain someone to be plugged into the consciousness of another certain someone and live out an alternate reality, something involving string theory and such. The rules are that he only he can only live out the last 8 minutes of that someone's life because that's how long the ""flash"" lasts when someone dies. Also, whatever he does in that reality will not affect any other reality.So Gyllenhaal is plugged into the source code relentlessly by his military commanders over and over until he finds the bomber. Over the course of his multiple reenactments Stevens narrows down the bomber and develops a relationship with Ms. Warren and Luit. Goodwin.Gyllenhall and Monaghan are good but nothing spectacular. Jeffrey Wright plays the nerdy mastermind quite well. He's cruel, discordant and tunnel minded; just what you'd expect from a scientist who's spent his whole life dedicated to his pet project. But it is Vera Farmiga who really shines in her role as the intermediate officer between the enslaved Steven's and the heartless scientist. In every scene Framiga battles with the two conflicting personas of her character. The female empathic side trying to soothe and care for Stevens as he's used as a cog in the high tech military defense machine; and also the military stratagician (stratagician is not a word???) who must convince Stevens to finish the mission while withholding the painful truth of Stevens' condition.The music in Source Code is a little pretentious and is abnormally noticeable. Its special effects are not the greatest with explosions and slow motion looking like they had been done by a sub par video game company. However it's not just the special effects, nor its mediocre cinematography but also Source Code's erratic pacing and editing for my undistinguished rating. The scenes don't flow well together and you feel just as pushed around as Gyllenhaal's character as you bolt back and forth between scenes. This feeling may have been deliberate on director Duncan Jone's part but watching the movie you feel like you've been riding the old bumpy wooden roller coaster you'd find at the boardwalk.At the end of the film you're constantly teased with false endings. As soon as you think it's going to end, they tag on and extra scene which tangles the plot even further. During the last 20 minutes they start abandoning the rules of source code and begin cramming in new content. It's like they shot multiple endings of the film and instead of choosing one, they decided to put them all in.Source Code is an intriguing film with a lot of complexities and philosophical metaphysics involved which I think is the reason for its success at the box office and among critics. As we know from Inception and The Matrix audiences today are really drawn to these alternate reality movies. However Source Code is not particularly well constructed and i'll be re- watching Ground Hog's Day numerous times before I even think about re-watching Source Code.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Repetitive plot that you can guess in the first five minutes,"I'll try and keep this spoiler free so people who are thinking of watching this can get a good idea about it.But, this review is simple. It's been done before! If anyone has watched star trek or most any other television sci-fi, you will guess this plot in the first 5 minutes as I did. You probably won't be able to predict the ending as there is a decent twist. However, the ending twist I'd say kind of ruins the ""moving"" aspect of the movie as well and just makes it even more kind of bland. But, now that I say that if the movie had ended in another way I probably would have thought it just even more typical and over done.It's enjoyable, but only if you have something better to see or haven't watched a lot of sci fi before and don't get the plot in the first 5 minutes.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The story seemed to be written by a hyper active, overly-intelligent 7th grader. It was just FULL of holes throughout. The acting wasn't bad, but nothing spectacular. I can usually sit through just about anything and find SOME redeeming quality about it, but not this one. For all the hype this movie received before release, and still does, it failed SO hard to live up to it. I found myself checking my phone a few times throughout the movie just wanting it to be done so I could go do something worthwhile with my time, but it just went on and on and got more and more stupid as the minutes crawled by. Even my wife, who's a huge Gyllenhal fan, was blasting this stinker as we were leaving the theater.If you don't like ANY thought put into your Sci-Fi movies, this is a movie for you. If you like your stories to follow ANY kind of logic, skip this and go see, well, just about anything else.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pretty much 4 things to this movie,"1. It was a edge-of-seat, thriller and suspension.2. Could have been a bit more thrilling when compared to Edge of Tomorrow's edge-of-seat quality, or if we want to talk big time thriller movies than it would need to bump its thrill up a thousand bwajillion times to come close to Inception's level of thrill.3. There is a decent attempt at emotion, but doesn't make you cry.4. The ending is superb, unexpected, and amazingly smart.7.3/10 for the thrill but then gets bumped up to 8.4/10 for the incredible ending (remember the ending is still only about 5 minutes long). In the end I recommend Source Code for people who like sci-fi thrillers, and can pay attention to the movie the whole time.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Poignant moments in a contemporary Sci-fi,"After an explosion kills a train full of people an Air force pilot is tasked with reliving the last 8 minutes of a man's life on the ill-fated train to discover who planted the bomb and prevent further attacks thanks to a project called the Source Code. However, in doing so he discovers a truth about himself is more astonishing than the source code programme itself.Source Code plays out as a long Twilight Zone episode, but that's not a bad thing, it's theme is that of worm holes, parallel universes, reality consciousness and debatably time travel. There are three amusing nods to the TV series Quantum Leap two of them subtle.Jake Gyllenhaal is on top form here as Colter Stevens (a play on Colt Seavers possibly) and adds scope and emotion to his character as he's forced to relive the last eight minutes of life over and over again to find the bomber. Michelle Monaghan is fine with what she's been given but is really a story pawn as Stevens gets to know here better after each time the 8 minutes are rest. The most interesting character Colleen Goodwin is played superbly by Vera Farmiga who is torn between duty and Stevens' wellbeing. Jeffrey Wright (of James Bond Felix Leiter fame) gives a fitting performance as source code creator Dr. Rutledge.While Duncan Jones wonderfully crafts the film with limited but successful use of effects mainly the train explosions, he manages to keep the repetitiveness fresh showing different angles revealing different parts of the train throughout. Thanks to writer Ben Ripley the story allows other settings to be used in the limited repeated 8 minutes. That said, there are few surprises, also some stereotype anti-prejudice which has now become a cliché in the bombers identity and those suspected is included. This sets it below the sharpness of Duncan Jones 2009 film Moon.Thanks to the intriguing closing scene you don't feel cheated and it's a satisfying piece of constructive science fiction within a contemporary setting. Like Jones' début the poignant moments manage to tug at heart strings which for a popcorn flick is sparse these days. Recommended.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Melodramatic and cliché, but overall very intriguing.","The dialog is a bit too cheesy at most parts. It is cringe-worthy, very poor screen writing, but overall the story is fascinating, unpredictable and original. Like with Moon, director Duncan Jones brings up very interesting food for thought. There are some REAL heavy ethical points here, but the film never dives into any depth with them. I felt there was so much more to explore with source code, and it would have been very rewarding if the the film was about 30- 40 minutes longer and ventured into some of the issues that the film only scratched the surface of. I felt the film barely had time to handle the fast-paced surface aspect of the story. The acting and action of the film was spot-on, though I wish the film would have had a different ending. Overall, Source Code is a great film, but had the potential to be something absolutely amazing like Moon was.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another discussion of the concepts of identity and reality from Duncan Jones,"Duncan Jones' follow-up to the simply brilliant Moon is another discussion of the concepts of identity and reality. Compared to Moon, however, Source Code is much more of a scientific mess, but that doesn't mean that it lacks entertainment value or even thematic strength. In short, this year's film is a hybrid between Groundhog Day, The Matrix and Inception, also borrowing some of those films' flaws. The premise we're presented is enticing, as Jake Gyllenhaal time and time again wakes up with the same 8 minutes of leeway on a train which is about to explode. All that he seems to remember is that his name is Colter Stevens, although that is not the name the woman across him (Michelle Monaghan) refers to him by. She seems to know him, even though he doesn't know her. The first time around he is completely ignorant as to why he's there and what's going to happen, but by and by he understands that he has an important role to play, and that if he finds a way to stop the explosion, he might also be able to save himself.Despite the repetitive and deliberately obscured storytelling, we're instantly sucked into the proceedings, because it is apparent that, as with Moon, Jones is not primarily out to impress CGI buffs, but rather to challenge our minds and conceptions. Ben Ripley's creative script is a good basis for this, and Jones also makes the characters and the action feel remarkably real and close, well helped by Gyllenhaal's and Monaghan's faithful performances. And although films with a premise such as this can be a test for the viewer's patience, Jones handles this well (better than Harold Ramis in Groundhog) by speeding up the repeating portions of the narrative and adding some clever bits of comedy for good measure.Of course, films dealing with the concept and realization of time and/or parallel dimensions will always face logical challenges which are almost impossible to overcome, and ultimately, Source Code is no exception. The film becomes less existentially interesting and more trite once Gyllenhaal is given godlike powers in order for the filmmakers to sneak in a customary happy ending, but that's not an uncommon development when a talented young filmmaker follows up an independent success with a higher-profile studio-production. That being said, a far too neat ending and a few logical fallacies cannot hide the talent at work in Source Code or the fun and excitement they're able to concoct for large portions of this film's running time.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Source Code is Fresh,"¨What would you do if you knew you only had one minute to live?¨ Source Code is a great action thriller directed by David Bowie's son, Duncan Jones, who is beginning to make a big name for himself in Hollywood. In 2009 Jones directed a small film starring Sam Rockwell called Moon, and it was among my top films of that year. It was a great science fiction thriller that reminded me a lot of Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey. Jones does very interesting work once again with Source Code; although this time he didn't come up with the screenplay. This was a much bigger project and Jones probably had to deal with producers this time around. There are some great and inventive moments, but there are others (like in the ending) that remind us that this is another Hollywood popcorn movie. The movie works in most part thanks to a great performance from Jake Gyllenhaal. Source Code ranks among one of his better performances at least in an action film. Due to the premise the story could have become predictable, repetitive, and boring, but thankfully it doesn't because of the twists (at times it goes entirely a different direction than what we expected) and because Gyllenhaal gives it the freshness it needs. Monaghan didn't seem to be up to par with Jake, but it doesn't matter because she was just a supporting character. Some credit has to be given to Ben Ripley, who although being relatively unknown in Hollywood came up with a fresh, innovative, and interesting script. The action thriller worked really well and I hope Hollywood keeps introducing some new and fresh ideas like they did with Source Code.Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a soldier who from one moment to the next goes from being in a helicopter in Afghanistan to finding himself on a train in Chicago with the identity of another person. Stevens doesn't understand what is going on as the girl sitting in front of him, Christina (Michelle Monaghan), is talking to him. Colter doesn't recognize anyone in the train and when he sees himself in the mirror he realizes he is in someone else's body. Suddenly in the mix of all this confusion a bomb goes off and everyone in the train explodes. Colter wakes up inside a pod without understanding what is going on. There is a lady on a screen talking to him and informing him of his situation. Her name is Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) and she tells him he is part of a program called the Source Code. A train has exploded in Chicago and they are sending him back in time to try to figure out who the bomber is before another explosion takes place. Colter is being sent into a sort of parallel universe in an attempt to discover who the bomber is, not to prevent it from occurring because it already has happened. The program seems to be able to create a worm hole that is plugged to a human consciousness. The data it receives comes from the dead people on the train. Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) is working with Goodwin; he is the scientist behind this program and he explains to Colter what is going on. They obtain this data because the human mind retains the last eight minutes of their lives, therefore they are able to connect Colter into their consciousness and send him into this parallel universe in order to identify the bomber. He only has eight minutes to make the discovery and if he doesn't the train explodes and he has to be sent each time.Scott Bakula's voice can be heard when Colter calls his father from the train. Bakula is known for the TV series, Quantum Leap, which has a premise similar to the one in this movie. Jones probably added his cameo in order to credit the series for the similarity. This action thriller begins with a bang. We are put right in the middle of the action and there is no need for us to be told what is going on. Jones leaves us out from the introduction and allows us to be just as confused as Gyllenhaal's character is. We are just as lost as he is and we begin to make discoveries along the way at the same time he does. This is what makes Source Code really work: it hooks our attention from the beginning and makes us pay close attention to the action. Jones respects his viewers and doesn't dumb down the plot, he makes us think and get immersed in the plot. Source Code is really short (93 minutes long) and it moves at a very fast pace. If Jones would have slowed down and tried to explain what was going on then the movie wouldn't have the impact it did, but by letting us figure out what was happening as the plot unraveled we became more and more engrossed by the action. Source Code is one of those movies that grab us by surprise, one that we didn't expect much from, but end up leaving with a smile on our face because it comes as a sort of fresh air after a hot day. Hollywood doesn't make much of these movies anymore, but when they do come out its exciting to see something different. Too bad they ended up giving Source Code a typical Hollywood ending, but beside that I have no complaints. This was a great action thriller.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A solid sci-fi thriller!,"I like stories where the plot points are scattered around like little pieces of a puzzle and we as the audience have to go through the entire process of piecing together this whole thing while keeping each and every detail in mind while our main protagonist does so as well; this is one of those templates that I genuinely fancy.Therefore, my experience here has been mostly positive, though I would like to point out that a fascinating premise like this could have resulted in an entirely different outcome. I am not saying this was a poor attempt; it was reasonable, and it had its moments of excitement and thrill, but looking at the underlying possibilities, all I can say is that things could have been more exciting.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
High quality sci-fi,"In terms of setting, if not style, think Quantum Leap, Groundhog Day, that sort of realm.Thrown right into the story you can start racking up the genres almost immediately, with elements of mystery, action and sci-fi... as the film moves along you'll get more of them plus some romance and traces of comedy, plus a bit of philosophy to think about if you so wish. The quality of this film, the enthralling strength of it, was clearly marked by the general silence in the cinema. A few remarks early on, such as the face of the body Jake Gyllenhaal inhabits looked to us a lot like Charlie Sheen, and our being reminded of Quantum Leap (TV show where each episode saw Dr Sam Beckett occupy the body of a person in a position to ""put right what once went wrong""). In fact the latter is cleverly/amusingly touched on by the fact Scott Bakula (who played Dr Sam Beckett) has a credited significant role in Source Code! But soon and for the rest of the film, nothing but admiring silence.Well filmed, well written, well acted and with a nice soundtrack, there really isn't much to fault about this film. Some scenes are a little bit cringe and it's not an especially original premise, in a general sense. But small considerations.Gyllenhaal is very good, Vera Farmiga has a wonderfully enigmatic look in this, looking very similar to Jake's sister Maggie in fact, Michelle Monaghan is fine considering she's not given so much to do or emote.I also like the overall philosophical dilemma element and the possibilities hinted at by the ending, but for those not interested in such things, no trouble. You'll enjoy the film fine in the time you sit and watch it. It's just a nice bonus that you could end up thinking about some of it's themes and possibilities for some time afterwards.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Source Code is a fun sci-fi/thriller that keeps you invested!,"Isn't it obvious that as soon as I saw its preview on Tubi, I immediately dived right into the film because of an actor I liked? No hesitations and instantly knowing I won't be disappointed because of Jake Gyllenhaal. It seems that I have never seen a bad movie from him and if I did, I would still sit through the whole thing because Jake is an amazing actor that I cannot resist because he's one of the few that I would never get bored of watching over and over again.Now to tell my opinions about the movie. Source Code is really an interesting one, one like no other that builds tension and has these plot twists while having a plot of ""trying to solve who is the bomber of a passenger train"". It has an interesting premise, almost like a Twilight Zone/Groundhog Day scenario. It's a film that I can re-watch a second time, and it would still be entertaining. The ending was also good. It expands the quantum theory much deeper and more complicated in some ways, to an extent that these soldiers have created something much bigger.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very Good - Would watch it again and again.,"It has been some time since I viewed a movie I could quickly and easily rate as 8 out of 10 stars. This one is certainly it. It has plot originality, almost constant suspense, on-screen chemistry between the stars, superior supporting acting, excellent cinematography... A film like this makes me wonder why I never heard of it before the DVD release.Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan click almost instantly. Jeffrey Wright and Vera Farmiga deliver fine acting in their supporting roles. Not an easy feat since facial expressions are what their characters have to work with in this quite original script.While this is primarily a Suspense/Drama/Science Fiction flick, there is also some action, mystery, and a tad of romance.Gyllenhaal plays a military man assigned to a computer-created reenactment of recent events with orders to discover who was responsible for a terrorist act. Like many science fiction movies, the ""science"" allowing this is a little hard to wrap one's head around. Nevertheless, I found myself OK with it, as more and more details emerge about what is really going on. And when the mystery resolves, what Gyllenhaal decides to do with the information he has acquired makes for a very interesting outcome.This is a very good movie and I would watch it again, even knowing what happens. Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Director Duncan Jones just maybe the next Spielberg or Lucas???,"Gylenhaal seems to be travelling down the same road as Nicolas Cage in my own opinion as one of the hardest workers in the business and most underrated. I liked Source Code as it brought action, romance, drama all to the table. Newcomer director Duncan Jones who brought us 2009's Moon brings us yet another sci fi adventure this time about a US soldier Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal ) who wakes up on a train not knowing why he is there only to find himself sitting in front of his love interest in this film Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) He has taken on a hidden identity and with much arguing with Christina that he is not Colter he bolts to the bathroom to get a hold of himself only to find he is staring at a strange face in the mirror that is not his own! The train blows up and we see he is now in a pod of some sort in a US government lab. He gets told that he has only 8 mins to find a bomb aboard this train. They send him back and forth to the scene of the crime as he goes against time to find either the bomb or the terrorist who put it there! This movie reminded me in a weird sort of way of Groundhog Day with Bill Murray most of the way through it. It packs loads of twists and plot turns amidst all the action involved. A good watch for any fans of Duncan Jones previous work. He seems to be what we will soon be calling the sci fi director of the ages!",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Source Code,"Train now becomes a sensitive hot topic in China due to the 7.23 train-wreck accident at Wenzhou, and this film fitly offers an effectual resolution to prevent (or forestall) the tragedy, which causes an 8-minutes-save-the-world mission accomplished by a high-tech novelty called ""Source Code"".Duncan Jones is sturdily paving his way for a further advancement as a new gifted director after his universally-acclaimed indie debut MOON (2009). Although SOURCE CODE, carrying a modest budget this time, Duncan's mainstream breakthrough explores again in the sci-fi genre and successfully generates a palpable solution to satisfy as much audience as possible and meanwhile maintains his auteurism among his devoted followers, from which aspect, Source Code is a decent victory. Both MOON and SOURCE CODE share a similar monochrome circumstance, claustrophobic suffocation, and deal with a straightforward trajectory of the evolution of technology (clones or time-reset mission), for me, it is not important all the happenings make sense or not, what I admire Duncan is his ability to water down the sophisticated elucidation in a range where could be digested by main population without tainting its emotional seesaw. One minor side affect is using too much platitude for the residual elements (the would-be Chicago nuclear-bomb attack looks like a tawdry joke and the ignition of love for Michelle Monaghan is evocatively banal, not to mention the ubiquitous father issue).Jake Gyllenhaal thoroughly reflexes a multi-facet impersonation as the leading role, which inevitably widens his territory and capacity. His maturity and aplomb will grant him a brighter future, which will not be so far-fetched. All the supporting cast is mainly curbed in their restricted field, Michelle and Jeffrey Wright are merely using their stock-in-trade, however the versatile Vera Farmiga's contribution is worthy of an official accolade, she magically endows a corny and stereotyped role with an empathetic credibility, even marginalizes the plot hole to a certain extent (originally I cannot understand why she risks her career just for the sake of some ""emotional"" brain wave, maybe this is the most mysterious part).Finally, a big congratulation to Duncan Jones again (the first one is for MOON two years age) and I think in the near future, lesser and lesser will call him the son of David Bowie, and I wish he could astonish the world of cinema with his own free will, which is a golden mine still underdeveloped.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An interesting story that turns out fine,"Source Code is a Sci-fi thriller of a film and not a bad job is done here at all, it's very nifty but is paced well and the running time is not too long so it's a nice quick watch. Directed by Duncan Jones who of course made his name with the film ""Moon"" brings a nice movie and I feel he is the man to praise in terms of the nifty feel you get from this, it isn't overly complicated although the story cannot make sense at times, but the vast majority though is well worked and pretty entertaining. The movie is one that tries it's very hardest to draw you in, thrill you, then spit you out again, as evidenced by the fast paced moments that then suddenly stop and the movie goes into a lull of sorts but it's a nice feeling, I never thought I'd say I liked being spat out from one scene to another.Jake Gyllenhaal is the main man of the movie and does a pretty fine job of running the movie nearly all by his character though the cast is fairly small and doesn't try to create too many random people to revolve around Gyllenhaal, but that is one reason it feels more interesting. I feel it is very difficult to write about this movie without giving anything away, I can't really even talk about Gyllenhaal's character without revealing too much, but let's just say the character is well created and tackled well by Jake too. Other cast include Michelle Monaghan, Jeffrey Wright and Vera Farmiga with an at time dedicated performance and makes some of the more slow moving scenes easy to watch and her character is another person who is key to the story.Duncan Jones is backed up with a script from Ben Ripley who although creates something intricate and gives Jones a really good story to go on, I did feel sometimes the dialogue could be a little generic. Now Ripley does a good job here, far from bad but sometimes I did feel the talking some characters do is not always fantastic but I really can't take much at all away from Ripley, most of the time the dialogue is fine. And onto Jones again, this time I want to commend him on working well with the camera angles, he collaborates well with Don Burgess who is no fool when it comes to camera work in Sci- fi thriller or actions and sometimes the camera especially in the quicker scenes is handled very well.If I had to recommend this movie well I think many can enjoy this, it's pretty thrilling and also a bit of fun too, seriously this movie tries to be funny even in very serious moments, it's good though. If you're coming into this having seen Duncan Jones's ""Moon"" then don't expect this to be as surreal and it is no doubt a Hollywood blockbuster-ish kind of movie, but really what this shows me is that it is people like Duncan Jones who should be given the chance directing these kind of films rather than a lot of others who create movies that seem like no thought has gone into them. Is it great? , no I don't think so although it is good and way more than OK, definitely one I would recommend. The ending is really what makes this movie a good movie but also gives this a solid finish that makes it not only look better, but also brings a much more raw and human final part which is not always seen in movies that look like this.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"In the future, this film will be a lost gem of a modern classic.","Jake Gyllenhaal, a soldier, finds himself in, what looks like, an action-adventure version of Groundhog Day (1993), as we discover that his consciousness has been placed into the body of a doctor on a train and his mission is to find the bomber who blew up the train earlier that morning. What complicates matters, is this process only allows him eight minutes during each session to figure out who the bomber is. My mind kept wandering back to the famed television show, Quantum Leap (1989-1993). I hope I have given you plenty of references on what this film is like. What makes this film enjoyable to view are human-driven scenes interwoven between the action scenes. Gyllanhaal's ""LEAPS"" back to the military project installation, where all this is controlled from, drift back and forth with scenes of him searching for the bomber on the train.The human story is a touching sub-plot surrounding the relationship between the ""doctor's"" girlfriend Christina (Michelle Monaghan) and how Gyllenhaal's ""soldier"" grows to care for her and the rest of the train passengers. We also are able to feel the emotions coming from our two main military, project characters, Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) and Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright). This is evident, especially with Goodwin, who struggles with the ethical and morality issues revolving around this ""project"". The film maintains a nice steady pace, but it starts to slow down at the very end, to a point where it almost falls apart, but Director Duncan Jones, saves the day by calling in, once again, the morality-play of the story. It creates an environment, that makes you feel emotional about whatever fate that falls upon the nicely built characters that we just got to know during the past 93 minutes.8.5 (MyGrade B+) = 8 IMDB",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

If anything it ruins the whole narrative of the movie up to then, and could have easily been avoided by just being a tad more linear than going for the ""unexpected"" alternative. The last scene really serves to make the movie ""shoot itself in both feet"" and brings everything down. Which is sad, as that scene isn't even necessary to the film or sequence of events.

"BANG, rewind, BANG, rewind...","Time travel stories are a penny a dozen and as old as hills themselves, so it's always a challenge for filmmakers to come up with a new spin on a very old tale. This is where 'Source Code' comes in and thankfully, it succeeds.Plot-wise the movie is very succinct: there's been a tragic terrorist incident involving a bomb on a Chicago train that resulted in huge loss of life. Another attack is imminent. Jake Gyllenhal plays a soldier – Colter Stevens - who's participating in a top secret experiment – the 'source code' of the title – whose job is to investigate the 8 minutes preceding the explosion so he can ascertain the identity of the bomber and hopefully prevent another catastrophe. The one negative side effect of this is he's ends up being constantly sent back in time only to get blown up again and again - until he can find out what exactly happened.The movie plays out in a 'rinse and repeat' fashion, advancing bit by bit, gradually – and enticingly - revealing more and more information each time. With every replay, we see a new item of information or something we haven't really noticed before. If this scenario reminds you of a certain comedy starring Bill Murray and a groundhog, then you're not far wrong. It's the same basic concept of 'rewinding' time, but whereas the explanation of that movie was left to the viewer to decide how or why it was happening, Source Code tells you up front that there's a Sci-fi angle anchoring everything. You could also throw other movies like Vantage Point into the mix and you'll get the general drift that we're seeing a single event played out umpteenth times.But thankfully there's a bit more going on besides endless 'play and rewinds' as Colter Stevens also has to figure out his place in the whole 'Source Code' experiment and as with the bomb plot, nuggets of information is given away at just enough intervals to keep the whole thing from becoming too repetitious.The film is very well executed and acted. The scenario is intriguingly set up and the way it's told will have you glued to the screen from start to finish. In fact you won't want to drop your guard once – you'll be that intent on finding out what's going on in the increasing baffling narrative. The science of the time traveling is also very imaginative and is explained just enough for you to go along with the whole scenario. Of course there is a lot of mumbo-jumbo about quantum physics, but at the same time they don't overdo it to such an extent that you feel you're going to come down with a sever case of the Zzzzs anytime soon.Jake Gyllenhaal is brilliant as the confused time travel guinea pig Colter Stevens and he effortlessly manages to anchor the whole potentially confusing scenario with a likable presence. He's entirely relatable as the 'every man' caught up in the nightmarish situation. Likewise Michelle Monaghan plays her part with a very appealing 'girl next door' quality and even if most of her role in the movie is of the 'rewinding' variety, it says something that she never allows it to go stale. Jeffery Wright is also excellent as the cold, limping, 'by the book' scientist who's spearheading the entire operation without a shred of morals on display.Director Duncan Jones' last movie was Moon and admittedly this movie shares a similar DNA to it in that there's a lot of stuff about the nature of identity, second chances, and other life affirming messages, though as with Moon, you have to get through a lot of darkness before you get to the bright stuff. As with Christopher Nolan, he seems to have certain themes and traits that he's evidently very interested in.The only letdown of this film is, so intent are the film makers/ distributors not to insult certain lucrative foreign markets, they're at pains to sledgehammer home the whole 'never judge a book by its cover' idea, which is a little bit of a disappointment considering the biggest threat to US security is from the very regions they're so keen to avoid offending in the first place. That's the only part of the movie that doesn't quite ring through, which is a shame considering everything else is so damn good.Like the aforementioned Groundhog Day and Vantage Point before it, the biggest disadvantage of movies like this, is they have a low 'rewatchability' factor because they're so dependent on retelling the same event over and over. They generally wear out their welcome faster than a normal movie because the viewer becomes so familiar with the story beats that after even two viewings, it feels like you've already seen it a dozen times. Source Code is the same. Basically you get all the surprises the first time, but as a first time viewing experience, it's truly excellent stuff and will keep you hooked to the very end.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"After 20 mins, absolutely no tension whatsoever","Source Code has a good idea and perhaps if it was done just slightly differently, it might have worked. Jake Gyllenhaal makes a solid leading man and the premise is pretty interesting. But roughly a third into the movie a plot twist is revealed that pretty much nullifies the entire premise. All the tension goes out of the movie, because none of it matters from this point onwards.Gyllenhaal's character reacts somewhat erratically to the situation at hand, but you can't really blame him. But yet again the twist gives no real reason to invest yourself in this character. At that point you are left with the other side to the story. It's not really possible to divulge more without venturing into spoilers, but there is not enough to really, well, care. An alternative take does emerge in the end and is used to conclude the movie, but not enough of the script gave this enough attention to hold any merit as a hook.Otherwise this is a reasonably good thriller. If you can find suspense in the inevitable, then you might still get something out of this.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Fascinating Concept,"An enjoyable movie to watch, thoroughly enjoyed it, excellent concept, really captures the imagination, actively engaged me emotionally with the main character. Other characters lacked depth though.A few little ""niggly"" things that just didn't make sense, could have been better tied up with more attention to detail.For example, when he returned to the loop the scene was shown of the ducks on the lake next to the train going past, he would never have seen it from that angle, nor would anyone on the train.. didn't make sense to me.There were a few things scientifically that my mind was hooked ""how?"" but these questions weren't adequately answered.Nonetheless, a good movie.And this is probably not so much a review, but more a critical analysis of what could be improved.Feels like it could be adapted to be the first in a series, but that might be better suited to TV..",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Time after time.,"Though its ending overreaches and makes you realise that the movie's central premise isn't quite as sound as its earlier hand waving would have you believe, Duncan Jones' insular time-loop thriller is engaging and effective for its majority. 'Source Code (2011)' sets its stakes early on, yet retains a sense of mystery right up until its conclusion. It's enigmatic nature is slowly unravelled via a number of twists and turns that each, somehow, seem as natural as the last. It's a tight, near perfectly paced experience that puts all its pieces on the board almost immediately and then plays the game without stopping for a second. With grounded, even subtle, performances and a solid screenplay, the piece remains believable enough that you actually care about its characters. A less forced, less 'Hollywood' ending would have been the icing on the cake. Still, the affair isn't dampened by its final moments. It's enjoyable throughout. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Top-notch thriller,"A story like ""Source Code"", something that feels petty damn close to hard science fiction, feel like a breath of fresh air. To me, anyway. When you peel away the mind-bending technology/fantasy of the script, it's really just a guy trying to do something heroic and change history. That's appealing any way you slice it. Even the inherent ""Groundhog Day"" comparison is a favorable one.Superficially speaking, I just enjoyed gazing at Vera Farmiga ad Michelle Monaghan for 90 minutes (two different flavors of winsome).

Gyllenhaal's best film? Yes,"Some movies have obscure plot lines, that are more easily understood on a visual platform rather than writing. But writing is all I've got, so here goes nothing.In the film, Source Code, Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up to find himself on a train headed for Chicago, with no idea how he got there. He starts talking to people on the train to try and figure what is happening but an explosion destroys the train and everyone aboard. Stevens then awakes in a chamber, unsure of where he is or what went on while he was on the train. A small screen in front of him shows a woman trying to give him instruction. Stevens discovers that a bomb has been planted on the train and he needs to find out who has done it, in order to stop a bigger catastrophe. He is continually sent back to the train with an 8 minute time frame to shut down the bomb and discover who has planted it. (Think the style of Groundhog Day).Confused? Doesn't matter. Source Code is worth the blurred storyline. You have to see this one for yourself to get a full grasp of what is happening. If you're worried you'll leave this one in a daze and unsure of what you just saw, put the worries aside. The dots get connected as the movie moves forward with an accelerating pace that never lets off the gas pedal. Gyllenhaal brings an outstanding performance to this sci-fi thriller. Amidst all the action, he doesn't let us forget about the human element, which brings Source Code to life.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Interesting and creative sci-fi twist to Groundhog Day and Deja Vu.,"It's easy to label Source Code as Groundhog Day crossed with Deja Vu. Easy but unavoidable.The tale of a man named Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhall) who awakens on a train that he can't recall boarding across from a stranger who obviously feels she knows him and swiftly learns that he is not even in his own body has definite parallels to both films, and while it is definitely worth a look it ends up as a lesser film than both.The central premise of Source Code is that the human mind can recall with great detail the final minutes of life - in this case the final 8. Ambitious scientist Dr Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) has discovered a method of jacking into the brain of a bystander and having a military man play through the closing minutes to see if they can funnel key information back to headquarters, information that might assist in learning about the circumstances behind the event, perhaps even something that might prevent future incidents.In this case Stevens is inhabiting Shaun, a teacher aboard the morning train to Chicago, a train that also carries an explosive device that will kill thousands of innocent passengers in 8 minutes time. At the point of explosion Stevens has his consciousness sent back to an undisclosed location where his only contact is a female soldier named Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) who he interacts with via a monitor. In the initial stages Stevens is quite literally in the dark, confused and disoriented, each time he is urged to go further and try new things, but Goodwin and ultimately Rutledge seem reluctant to stray from the briefest of scripts, something that frustrates Stevens no end. Then it is back to the train for 8 more minutes of trying to ascertain exactly what went on and to prevent another more serious attack on Chicago itself.This is where the Groundhog Day scenario kicks in, though with 8 minutes instead of 24 hours. Stevens learns quickly that only his actions can differ from what actually happened, so it is like he is in a carefully scripted play where he is the only one allowed to improve. Shaun's traveling companion is a young colleague named Christina (Michelle Monaghan), and the carriage they are riding in has a group of passengers that over the many run throughs Stevens learns more and more about. Seeing as at the end of each 8 minutes the entire train-load dies Stevens rapidly learns that there needn't be any reluctance to interrupt, annoy and even beat down the passengers if it helps enlighten him - they're gonna die every time anyway - but this is where the minor flaw in the film happens for me.Stevens makes what I feel are some boneheaded decisions repeatedly in his many runthroughs, then in subsequent situations knowing full well he is on the clock he loafs through the early minutes, wasting precious time, before charging headlong into flawed assumptions and illogical deductions. I realise that in a 90 minute film about one 8 minute scenario that perhaps they felt they had to pad out the running time somewhat but I couldn't help but roll my eyes at some of the dumb things this supposedly highly trained helicopter pilot was doing.That aside however flawed I found the actions at times Source Code has a pretty solid premise that again is not too dissimilar from Deja Vu, which itself had vast holes in logic that required ignoring in order to enjoy the film more. That is the case here. If you think too hard about Source Code it is patently obvious that the whole thing makes precious little sense, but neither does Star Wars, The Matrix and dozens of other universally lauded films. Source Code is not ever going to threaten their position as a hot topic on various message boards but it is worth a look and in the early stages while you are attempting to piece together what is going on alongside Captain Stevens it is quite captivating.I think the acting is a mixed bag, Farmiga is OK as Goodwin but reminds me too much of Kristen Wiig, who I find annoying. Wright channels Darth Vader with his speech patterns and deeper than usual tone and Monaghan is fine in a role that basically requires her to be puzzled for at least 6 minutes out of 8 as her train buddy acts in ways that she has never seen before. But obviously this is Gyllenhaal's gig, and I guess he is fine. I don't think he quite cracks the 'leading man / hero' ranks just yet though, but in a smaller budget film like this I'll give him a pass mark. He's definitely far more likable - or is it less hittable? - than Shia LeBeouf.One last thing. In the dozen or so runthroughs where the early goings were exactly the same routine the ticket lady always asks 'Shaun' for his ticket, yet never Christina. Strange...Final Rating - 7 / 10. Sure the story doesn't hold up to close scrutiny. But I'd rather watch this implausible creativity over a million lazy remakes and sequels. (Scream 4 anyone???)",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Needs a Director's Cut...,"Good, but had the potential to be brilliant. Great central plot: sort of Ground Hog Day meets Charlie Kaufman (esp Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) meets Philip K Dick (esp Minority Report) meets Christopher Nolan (esp Memento and Inception).However, the clever central plot isn't enough to make a decent-length film out of, so there are some detours and padding (eg a romantic angle), and this detracts from the film. Then, just when I thought the movie had redeemed itself for all the padding by having a picture- perfect ending, that wasn't the ending. There is a final twist after the ending-that-should-have-been, and this is totally unnecessary.Duncan Jones (David Bowie's son) shows that Moon was no one-off: he is a director with a great future. He just needs more control over his movies - the tacked-on ending smacks of corporate interference.Great performance by Jake Gyllenhaal, and I am generally not a fan (though Donnie Darko and Jarhead were great).

The heroine repeats the same dialogue again and again when Jake enters the source code to find the bomber. No comedy and not as much as expected action too.. There are scenes where u cant imagine would ever happen.. Like for example in the end when they show parallel reality which is totally impossible.

A Surprisingly Touching Human Sci Fi Movie,"3 April 2011. While a number of critics may refer back to the comedy fantasy classic GROUNDHOG DAY (1993) for comparison purposes for its spin on repeating the same event over and over again, an over-reliance to this movie for a comparison isn't as valuable as it might be as GROUNDHOG DAY in a number of ways excels in its detail and script in using the apparent paradox of having to relive the same moment over and over again to better effect. Probably a better sci fi comparison for this movie would be last year's INCEPTION and even CUBE ZERO (2004) as they have much more relevant and similar psychological elements both apparently sinister and underlying surface suspense as well as what really was captured well in both other movies and what is surprising in this movie - a surprising emotional, relational depth and resonance that was particularly difficult considering the limited room for relational development in the movie. There was a hope before the movie was experienced that some of the intelligent and crisp action from THE BOURNE IDENTITY might surface but it really didn't appear in this movie. Overall this movie provides a satisfying, thrilling, entertaining movie-going experience for the times.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Definitely was not expecting that!,"When I saw the first trailer for Source Code here on IMDb, I nearly flipped out because it stars one of my favorite actors, Jake Gyllenhaal. As I continued to watch it, I saw the 8-star rating and that Michelle Monaghan, whom I loved in Eagle Eye, plays the leading lady, and I decided that somehow I was going to see this movie. I finally got the chance today when my family and I traveled to our nearest theater and saw this film for a very discounted rate, and I could not have been more pleased!Source Code is about Captain Colter Stevens, a helicopter pilot for the US Air Force, who wakes confused to find himself on a train and sitting across from a woman he does not know talking to him. Eight minutes later, a bomb detonates on the train and everyone, including Captain Stevens and the woman, is killed. As the film progresses, Captain Stevens learns that he is a part of a program called the Source Code, a computer program that places him in the body of Sean Fentress, which the Air Force, by finding the train's bomb and bomber, is using to prevent another bombing of Chicago that will occur later that day.I sat on the edge of my seat through the entire movie, awaiting Captain Stevens' fate as thousands of questions flooded my mind: Why him? Will he find the bomber? I even, for a second, believed that either Captain Stevens or Christina (the woman) was the bomber. I came out of the movie with more questions than I did after watching The Matrix, but after sifting through every lobe of my brain for about twenty minutes, I came to my own conclusions and deemed the movie worthy of watching multiple times over. The plot kept me praying for that happy ending I hoped was coming, and the characters and subplots had me laughing, tearing up, and becoming immersed. The twist completed the film, and the ending (which fueled most of my questions) had me itching for more. Anyone who is willing to pay attention and wrack their brain for an hour and a half would love this film, as I did.

The First Excellent Film of 2011,"In 2009, Duncan Jones got the ball rolling for a new era of groundbreaking sci-fi films with his debut feature Moon. Later that year came the critically acclaimed District 9, venturing on a similar avenue in terms of the themes it addressed and fingers it pointed. Last year, Nolan got in on the act with Inception which, while not quite being on the same interpersonal scale as the others, was a spectacular piece of cinema in its own right. Now, Duncan Jones has returned to add to this canvas with Source Code, a technological mindbender sure to incite equal parts acclaim and debate.Jake Gyllenhaal is Captain Colter Stevens, who wakes up on a train without the slightest idea of how he got there. While trying to get his head together, he is shocked to see the reflection of a different man when he looks into the bathroom mirror. Minutes later, the train explodes and he is re-awoken, this time locked inside a capsule. Enter Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) who informs him he is part of a revolutionary project in which he is able to occupy the body of a passenger for the last eight minutes of their life. The story turns into a race against time as Colter endeavours to diffuse the on-board bomb and catch the terrorist, thus altering the future before another imminent attack can occur.Sounds like a pretty straightforward action-thriller, right? Well, to divulge any more of the plot would be the most unforgivable of crimes, as the film treks in a direction that almost makes the bomb thwarting seem like a subplot. The film opens with a brilliant set piece. Everything from the setting, to the cinematography, and even the opening credits seems Hitchcockian in nature, and Source Code retains that feeling by inserting a ton of red herrings (ranging from the subtly clever to the in-your-face obvious) as well as through the characterisation of Colter, playing every bit the paranoid, inquisitive hero personified by James Stewart in many a Hitchcock mystery.This is definitely one of those 'food for thought' kind of movies; one that will leave you trying to decipher the indecipherable long after leaving the cinema. Perhaps the most noticeable theme is the way Jones addresses the most basic of human emotions, happiness, and asks us to make our own judgement of the relationship between ignorance and bliss. Another angle being worked here is a criticism of man playing God (see: Blade Runner, Shutter Island), as Goodwin and her team play Colter's constant overseers, directing his every move and dismissing the questions he asks on behalf of an audience desperately seeking answers.For mine, the biggest flaw of Source Code was not in leaving anything out, but in putting too much in. The film sets itself up beautifully to finish with an ending that is original, intelligent and poignant all at the same time. Instead, it rolls past this point and continues on for another scene, which, in its attempt to tack a wholesome ending onto a powerful film, comes up slightly underwhelming. I don't want this to sound like an exaggeration, because it's by no means a 'cop out' ending, but it allows for a few schmaltzy one-liners that aren't in line with the rest of the film's tone.Also, Source Code lacks a sense of urgency when it's really needed. Yes, Colter has to save the day before another bomb goes off, but this doesn't feel like a big enough threat, as all the while Colter is allowed to enter and re-enter the source code until the mystery is solved. Again, these negative aspects do not detract from the film as a holistic work of art. Rather, they simply keep it from being that little bit better, and maybe even pushing a perfect score.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

"like a Twilight Zone episode... only a very good one, and by a strong director","Duncan Jones and science fiction, after only two films, makes for a pretty darn good fit. With 'Moon' he had an exploration of an astronaut losing his mind on a spaceship with a talking Kevin Spacey robot as his only companion, and it was a surprisingly entertaining-but-deep exploration into consciousness and what it's like to be lonely in space. Now with Source Code he has a more traditional Hollywood film - a ticking time-bomb scenario that doubles back on itself repeatedly as a soldier (Jake Gyllenhaal) is caught up in a mission to find out where a bomb will go off on a train heading towards Chicago. It's a time travel movie, in a sense. I say that last part since Jones and his writer do something clever and unexpectedly touching with it: the character is not exactly on the train, but rather his 'self' is transplanted into the body of another man on the train, with an attractive woman (Michelle Monaghan) and he has to keep looking for clues at to first where the bomb is and second who will set it off.But, as with any good Twilight Zone style story, there's twists and turns that make for an unexpected trip. What's somewhat unexpected is how much heart the director puts into the material. It's as much, if not moreso, about a man having to come to terms with his own mortality and his relationship with his father that was left without resolution before this mission. Plus there's the whole thing of 'can-you-change-the-past' kind of thing and what this Source Code could provide, which is akin to what was done in Twelve Monkeys only with more to-the-minute timing ala 24. I was drawn into the science of it, and the trickier questions of 'is this ""right""' as coming from essentially a military-prevention-weapon' stand-point (and Jeffrey Wright's character, kind of channeling Cornel West?).Aside from the cleverness displayed in the plotting, which is classic in its science fiction appeal and how it deals with the mystery without too many flash and gimmicks (mostly relying on some solid supporting characters, the kind that might pop up as 'characters' in a Hitchcock train picture), the acting from Gyllenhaal is really a winner here. Maybe it's cause of what's there in the character to explore, and his relationships and connections with the outside world that were left unresolved, but he really knocks it out of the park here, as he's stuck in this chamber of sorts for half of the movie in-between when he's zapped back to the train and has to think quickly on his feet. As an actor Gyllenhaal has always had his charms, but now as he grows older with this film and last year's Love & Other Drugs he's come into his own as an actor-star. Just watch as he calls up his ""father"" on the train near the end. It's more moving that I would have ever expected.Sure the film has a few minor faults with some of the supporting actors- I never believed that ""comic"" on the subway car, and the villain when he's revealed is a little too simplistic for this story- but the main story is tight and it makes real suspense out of the ""will this happen"" and then has a big reveal near the end that turns the story completely on its head. It's still a 'Hollywood' blockbuster, but it features the same attention to ""smart"" (or just not-as-crappy) science fiction that Jones showed with his previous film. I look forward to whatever he does next. 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

It's much better than they were. The dilemma that Colter Stevens faces is very different and unique. It's more akin to Jacob's Ladder.I think that Jake was fantastic so was Jeffrey Wright.

Source Code (2011),"With MOON, Duncan Jones created an interesting sci-fi premise based on some vague, implausible science and used it to explore questions of identity and free will. Here, he does the same thing, but the emphasis is more on the vague, implausible science and less on the character-based struggles. So, when the science starts getting more and more complicated and making less and less sense, it's a problem. I didn't really care how Jake Gyllenhaal was doing these things or what the scientific implications are, except that the movie kept trying to make me care about them. I liked the suspense and action of the first hour, and the more emotional route the film takes in the last part. But all this silly science kept getting in the way, leading to an unsatisfying ending that has little to do with the humanity of the story. I should also note that even though MOON was derivative in a lot of ways, this felt less original to me. It is a mildly enjoyable entertainment, well-crafted and refreshingly brief.

For the most part.""Source Code"" follows the same premise as the 1990s TV show ""Quantum Leap"" (in fact, keep your ears open for a cameo by a famous leaper) where the hero jumps into another's person's body via quantum physics. The theory of quantum physics is explained to the viewer in simple terms so that no one is confused. A military agency found a method to transport a test subject into the body of someone eight minutes before they die. The story allows a brief narrative on how it works; if it went any further it would have lost most of the audience.The test subject is Capt. Colter Stevens (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) a helicopter pilot in the U.S. Army who was recently on his third tour of duty in Afghanistan.Jones does a brilliant job of setting the audience up in the first scenes. We are there with Colter when he awakes in a commuter train bound for Chicago. He does not realize immediately that he is in a schoolteacher's body. He has the same reaction that most of us would in a new situation, immediately trying to figure what is happening. After eight minutes the train explodes and the Captain leaps back to his reality in a capsule at an undisclosed location. He is then presented a series of assimilation tests by Colleen Goodwin (played by Vera Farmiga) via a computer screen and video camera. She is with an unknown military agency but we, and Colter, are not sure which one.The task for Colter is simple; he must keep leaping back into the schoolteacher's body on the train until he finds the bomber. During these leaps back to the train he is developing a relationship with a friend of the schoolteacher, Christina (played by Michelle Monaghan).His missions continue to be eight minutes long and when he continues to fail he continues to blow up along with the train. The process then has to start all over. With each mission Colter is discovering more and more about the train, the bomb and all of its passengers.Is this starting to sound like ""Groundhog Day?"" It is similar in some respects but don't expect any cameos by a famous furry subterranean rodent or any catchy Sonny and Cher songs.The story continually pulls the viewer in not only because we want to know how Colter saves the day but also why Colter is in this situation in the first place. The story quickly becomes a ""who done it"" film with great ease because we care about the characters and their outcomes.Should you see this movie? Yes. This film had a story that kept you engaged. It also presented a real fear of terrorism that most Americans could connect with.Gyllenhaal is proving himself as a strong leading man. He can be tough, sensitive and comedic while performing the same scenes over and over again.The entire cast including the strangers on the train seemed to gel together and lead the audience further the down rabbit hole without losing us. Plus, in the end we hear a nice message about why it is still good to be a human in a world that is so bitter and filled with fear.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
an intelligent and interesting movie...though my expectations were much higher...,"Duncan Jones' sophomore directorial effort after the sublime Moon further proves he has a knack for intelligent, emotion-filled sci-fi's. Source Code is one of those movies which make you think and really make you realize that unlike some filmmakers there are some intelligent and creative brains out there who still believe in quality cinema. In a nutshell, the movie is a Sci-Fi action thriller and is brilliantly shot. I said brilliant because of three reasons:-1.The way of storytelling. 2.The visibility of the scenes, dialogs and the overall script. 3.The quality of the direction.The technical aspects of the movie are not too hard to understand and you are always captivated and captured by the somewhat volatile happenings. The action in the movie is first-rate and does provide the buzz expected of an action thriller.Here you follow the main character. When the movie starts, you know just as much of what's going on as our main character does: Nothing. The movie starts out with a man (Jake Gyllenhaal) waking on a train not knowing where he is. The girl in front of him is Christina (Michelle Monaghan) and she thinks she knows him, even when he insists that he is actually an army pilot named Colter. Going into the bathroom he checks his appearance and sees that he has someone else's face. When the train explodes Colter awakens inside a freezing cold container. He's addressed on a computer screen by Colleen (Vera Farmiga), a military captain who explains that he is part of a program called Source Code. It's administered by Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) and allows a person to inject themselves into someone else's body to relive the last eight minutes of their life. It is said not to affect the past but to address the future. As such, Colter's mission is to go back in time and find out who has placed a bomb on the train so that the bomber can be identified and stopped from setting off a second explosive in the city.The Story reveals itself in a rapid pace from the beginning to the end. It is a thriller that values its heart and its mind more than velocity or adrenaline. Working in the action genre, it's a more accessible film than Duncan Jones' leisurely paced sci-fi debut Moon. But with a solid screenplay from Ben Ripley the depth and the intelligence have not been forgotten. This is a highly economical film, working in just a few locations and moving vigorously over its lean ninety minutes. Jones is concerned foremost about the misuse of technology but equally the paranoia that terrorism imposes on ordinary people: an intelligent and timely theme, which surprisingly gives way to brief moments of humour. The human responses from the passengers as Colter interrogates them, turning their bags inside out, are quietly funny. Even more fascinating is the way the film touches on how racial assumptions are born from paranoia, like when Colter stalks a man of Indian appearance. These are issues visualised with intensity and originality. There are a couple scenes of gorgeously shot, tear-jerkingly beautiful brilliance. That, and the cinematography is worth noting- It is very slick and tone- setting.The acting is fantastic by everybody. Gyllenhaal is in this movie for nearly every frame and he's great in every scene. He proves he can stand his ground as a lead in an action feature. He succeeds in this role, where other actors may have failed. Gyllenhaal had the perfect persona for this role. He's got a forceful attitude with a sympathetic face. Michelle Monaghan has this innocent charm with her character. Vera Farmiga and the very underrated Jeffrey Wright give very interesting and complex performances as well.Despite all the positive comments above, I was a bit disappointed. The movie, performances, cinematography, script everything is great. It's just, I had a enormously huge expectation from this, which was a mistake. I wanted to feel the same way when I felt after watching Inception, which did not happen.I give it 7 for being a deeply enjoyable experience, although it should be noted that considering what was said above, it isn't revolutionary.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Brilliant concept. Great execution. A sci-fi classic.,"Another in a longish line of high-concept mainstream movies. In many of those movies it's fashionable to have a confusing story which people will interpret as being brilliant/genius and which has an in-built ""repeat"" viewing factor due to the baffling nature of the story which has just been told. Think movies like ""Inception"".""Source code"" is a far superior film to ""Inception"" but will probably lack the kudos of the latter. Briefly, the story concerns a commuter (""Colter Stevens"", played by Jake Gyllenhaal) on a train who has an identity crisis. Before he can resolve it, he dies with all the other passengers in a massive explosion. Afterwards (!), the man awakes in a weird chamber where he is questioned by military (or some such) personnel about who caused the explosion. Don't worry, this is not a 'spoiler'...it's established very early on in the movie that this is what has happened.Of course, you get questions along the lines of ""Which reality is real?"". Going with the sci-fi explanation (involving secret military experiments) you have a plausibility to the scenario which is very nicely unambitious and may in fact have some science (perhaps speculative) to it...involving information retained in the brain post-death...some 8 minutes...which gives rise to another gimmick of the movie...the character reliving those 8 minutes in order to solve the mystery of the train explosion. The latter part of the scenario may be hard to rationalise as remotely plausible, but I just ran with the premise...perhaps it might have been a more plausible story if the movie didn't go down that path...a more 'realistic' science fiction, perhaps.This is a great story which seems to have no loose ends to it, at least on one level...the film makers provide you with clues as to what is happening and you aren't left high and dry like similarly themed movies can do.P.S. on reflection, the part of the movie dealing with 'reliving' the 8 minutes of memory in the way that they did, did strike me as being a loose-end/plot-hole...but you just enjoy the ride at the time.A lovely, dark, morbid fantasy.If you like this film, some others and a video game with similar themes include:12 MonkeysThe matrixDark cityGroundhog dayAssassin's Creed (video game...personally I don't find the first game in the series to be fun to play...the sequel is much more playable).",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A good time, nothing special","After hearing the reviews for ""Source Code,"" I was expecting a compelling storyline, great acting, and an ""Inception""-like surprise ending. The most I can say about the movie is that it was just okay. The storyline, while repetitive, seemed to work very well. Though not everyone wants to go into a movie and see the same eight minutes repeated over and over and over, but I didn't have a problem with it. The scenes seemed to change just enough to still create a gripping story without spoiling the ending too soon.As for the acting, this, in my opinion, is one of Gyllenhaal's best performances. He and Michelle Monogan blend together very well. The whole movie seemed to be held together by the very limited relationships that Gylanhalls character had with the two scientists played by Vera Farmiga and Jeffery Wright.To talk about the ending without spoiling it will not come easy to me, so I'll keep it brief. I have heard and read from many critics that there is a plot twist in ""Source Code"" that really makes you think. I, however, did not get this effect. It was a surprise, but it was a very basic concept. That is all I am going to say on that.All in all, ""Source Code"" is a fun movie, with great acting and an interesting story to a point. Part of my problem with it was my exceedingly high expectations. The repetition worked for me, but I can see people easily becoming bored with it. Still, this movie was a good time and I look forward to seeing more from Duncan Jones in the future.",,Anonymous,Mystery
Jake is good in this,"I was very fortunate to be at the World Premiere at SXSW in Austin and attended the Q&A after with James Duncan, Vera Farmiga, Michelle Monaghan, Jake Gyllenhaal and Ben Ripley. The story line keeps you on the edge of your seat and adds in enough humor to make it a thoroughly enjoyable experience. There is amazing, subtle chemistry between Jake and Michelle which really is the star of the film, performances by all the actors are excellent. Beautiful cinematography that will make Chicago proud. The ending brings up more questions than answers, but it feels right, so that's OK with me. I am not a big sci-fi fan, but this film delivers on romance, suspense, mystery and thrills. Highly recommended.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A genre mainstay until another far-fetched killer brainchild comes across the big screen.,"This has got to be the best Sci-Fi/Love Story plot I've ever watched since The Lakehouse. I definitely recommend this movie for anyone who has got a knack of dealing with mind-boggling scenarios while enjoying the melodramatic mood. This of course has some violent scenes typical for its own stretched-out plot of a time bomb set on a train and afterward the possibility a citywide holocaust. Jake's acting has been driving and very involving. Michelle Monaghan is cute. She did it well and much relaxed. Though the mystery is easy off since the crime perpetrator can be guessed off pretty in the early minutes of the movie, the winning part of the movie is by how every piece of evidence is stitched into one whole revelation and the realization that this has go to be a love story. The ending surprisingly is most rewarding and would bring you to several what- if's and how-come's. Definitely worth watching and a genre mainstay until another far-fetched killer brainchild comes across the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
As Exhilarating As Inception,"Source Code is a Action Sci Fi Thriller film Directed by Duncan Jones (same guy that brought us Moon, 2009) This film centres a soldier who wakes up in another man's body. He soon discovers he's part of a mission to find the bomber of a Chicago commuter train. It's starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga, Jeffrey Wright, Russell Peters, Michael Arden & Scott Bakula. #FACT: Topher Grace was also considered for the lead role.SLIDER'S REVIEW: When I saw the trailer for this film, I knew I had to go see it. Last time I saw Jake Gyllenhaal in a major role was in Love & Other Drugs and his performance there was very heartfelt.When I watched Source Code I was surprised that it surpassed all my expectations, believe me when I say this is one epic blockbuster (a must see). It's one of the most thrilling rides I've been on whilst watching a film. The action is very hands on and detective like work so were exploring with the lead role, this made it very entertaining. I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say this is as good as Inception (yep it's that good). From the moment we meet Capt. Colter Stevens on a train this film had my full attention (it just grabs you from the word Go). I felt like I started off with the main character because he knows as much as I did when the film starts so it felt like we went through understanding the Source Code together.I loved the twist and turns the storyline takes, one minute I thought I knew what was going to be the outcome... then it switches. it has a very creative plot alongside the type of love story I could see developing. Parts of the film has that jaw dropping effect that just keeps getting better. I think most people who see this film will want to watch it again to understand it more or simply to just to watch it again. I loved the concept that a man could go back 8 minutes using a computer programme before an explosion in a bid to save lives. The visual effects of the explosions looked really cool to watch. The director has produced the world a smart action thriller that does its job extremely well and will be talked about for months to come. The Best Film in 2011 So Far.Jake Gyllenhaal has done it again. This has got to be his best work on screen in a very long time. His character as Capt. Colter Steven was a very heart pounding person to watch. He carried this film from the moment we set eyes on him all the way to the end. He's a smart and charming man that just had everything his character needed. A Very good actor. Michelle Monaghan is one pretty woman. Her character was Christina. She plays this neatly dressed, well-spoken woman exceptionally well. I'm sure it wasn't easy trying to keep up with forever changing scenarios. The women on the monitor screen is Carol Goodwin, her character is played by Vera Farmiga. She help us understand more as the film goes along. She also is a very good actress. Jeffery Wright plays a very believable Dr. Rutledge. I for one was surprised to see Russell Peters in this film (when did he become an actor?). I have to give credit to the comedian because he does an Applausable job, surprisingly the acting seemed to come natural to him.This cast was amazing as a whole.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A sci-fi version of Groundhog day,"In ""Source code"" main character Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) again and again relives the same 8 minutes. This sounds very much like ""Groundhog day"" (1993, Harold Ramis) in which weatherman Phil (Bill Murray) again and again relives the same day. Almost all reviewers of the film are making this comparison.In ""Groundhog day"" there is no explanation of the reliving. In ""Source code"" there is a sci-fi explanation that is revealed during the film.The result of reliving the past again and again is that at last you know exactly what the persons you meet are going to do, even earlier than they know themselves. In ""Groundhog day"" ample use is made of this comic situation. In ""Source code"" there is a running gag with spilling coffee on the shoe of the main person, but the emphasis is more on the facts that the main person doesn't know and which he has to accumulate iterarion after iteration.Another point of comparison is the relationship between the main character and the person(s) he (again and again) meets in his time circle. In ""Groundhog day"" Phil initially considers himself very superior to these small town people and only gradually loses his haughtiness. In ""Source code"" Colter also grows towards the people he meets (and especially one of them). He wants to save them from their impending death.Earlier in this review I wrote that in ""Source code"" there is a sci-fi explanation of the reliving of Colter. I am not going to describe this explanation, but will only reveal that according to this explanation the reliving is strictly speaking no time travelling. Nevertheless at the end of the film a philosophical question arises which is very akin to time travel movies: Can history be changed? For the answer to this question (according to ""Source code"") I recommend you to watch the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A fantastic time loop thriller,"Source Code (2011) :
Brief Review -A fantastic time loop thriller. It's good to know that Source Code came before Edge of Tomorrow; otherwise, it would have felt much less impressive to me since the idea of a time loop is quite similar. Nonetheless, this sci-fi thriller is more about the brain than physical action. What I am going to tell you (the story) may sound a little confusing, but you'll find it interesting, and I assure you it will be fun. Steven, a U. S. Army pilot, was dead two months ago, but his brain is sent to a different timeline through a new formula called ""Source Code."" According to the doctor who created it, SC is not a reality but an alternate dimension that allows you to be there for 8 minutes. During this period, the candidate has full authority to do whatever he wants but cannot change things in this delusional timeline since the results are already set. For instance, Steven has to save the train from a bomb, but he cannot because that happened hours ago in reality. He can only go back for 8 minutes and find the bomber so that the future bomb blast can be traced and defused with the help of his information. However, Steven is insistent about his ideas for saving the ultimate timeline and asks for one more chance to save the people on the train as his last wish. What happens after that is the main suspense here, and I won't spoil those last 2 minutes for you. Source Code is a very smart film, and it doesn't take too much of your time. This allows it to emerge as an engaging, pacy, and clever movie within that short period that hooks you through every single minute. I didn't even realize when that one and a half hours passed; that's how good the screenplay and narrative are here. By the time you understand the plot and the idea, half the film is over, with the next half holding more surprises and thrills for you. Isn't that enough for a sci-fi time loop thriller? It is, so do watch it closely.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Story wise a bad rip-off from inception, but overall fun to watch","First I have to say that it is hard to write a good review of this movie without giving any spoilers, so at the end I will make some remarks which include spoilers.I watched this movie in a theater were you pay very little to watch a sneak preview of a unknown movie which currently is not playing in any theater in the Netherlands. So I had absolutely no idea what to expect.The movie starts of really good instantly grabbing your attention and I must say, the movie does a really good job in keeping your attention through most of the movie. The filming and setting is great. The scenes are not grand but fits the story perfectly. Special effects and settings are top notch. So no comments there. The acting is good to very good. The main characters play their role perfectly and by doing so they make the story more intense. No comments there.However, I read some other reviews and apparently there are a lot of dumb people reviewing this movie. The main problem with this movie is that the background story/idea on which this entire story/movie is based, is completely insane, impossible and as far-fetched as I have ever seen. The movie is set in the present and presents it self as a physiological thriller (so no sci fi). But as I said, i can not give any details as that would result in spoilers. But just to give you a hint of how unbelievably stupid this movie is; normally when your body stops but your brains are still functioning, your alive, when your brain stops your officially dead. Not in this movie, in this movie, even though the brains are still functioning, your dead. How stupid do they take their viewers?all in all, good movie and a fun ride, however if you have any high education or at least your own opinion based on common sense, there will be a moment in the movie where you will be thinking, that is completely impossible. If the writers wanted to make this story believable they should have presented the movie in a different way and used a similar set up as in the movie inception. The source code is eventually a bad rip-off from inception, (background)story wise.Go rent the movie and I promise you will enjoy it, however be aware of some serious short comings in the (background)story.SPOILER ALERT: As there are a lot of people saying that this movie is intelligent I feel that I am obliged to explain the opposite. When our main character starts to thinks what the 'f' is going on, our big scientist arrives and asks, ""do you know something about quantum physics?"" ""because by the means of quantum physics we have made it possible to relive the last 8 minutes of someones memory"". Now I am not a quantum physics scientist, but the link between reliving someones memory and quantum physics is VERY far-fetched. As the end of the movie makes clear that he is actually not reliving someones memory but is in an alternate reality, the link with quantum physics does show up. So apparently they were setting up for explaining the alternate reality. Or did our scientist already knew? However there is still a big flaw there as well. There are an infinite number of alternate realities and actually ending up in such an identical alternate reality several of times is IMPOSSIBLE. Ow and if our main character is reliving someones memories, how then can he leave that train or even explore if there are no memories of doing something like that? So at that moment I was already thinking, here is something wrong. In the end, being an alternate reality, this is explained. At the end, as I stated above, another big flaw, our main character is apparently not dead, he has wires attached to his freaking head and you see him actually moving!!! So why kill him off???? Ow yeah, and in the alternate reality, what happens to the guy that in who's body the main character ends up? Well, i guess he is dead, great job soldier, killing a person in another reality and taking over his live. No excuse in the argument, he would have died anyways.

Worth seeing.,"Right from the start, the intense music and mind racing scene catches your attention...and also leaves you squirming with questions (e.g. ""What just happened?!""). This movie is about a guy named Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is on a mission to find the bomber of a train that exploded killing everyone on board. The twist? Well, it's complicated. Stevens has to constantly ""go back"" in eight minute intervals to the event to find out who the mysterious bomber is. He ""goes back"" through a program called Source Code which is a program that lets a selected being so-to-speak ""relive"" an event but not change the outcome or anything of the sort because Source Code acts similar to a parallel world. The movie follows Stevens' journey through the use of this innovative program that could perhaps save a future, bigger scale, bombing from happening. The only con I have in the storyline is the end. I felt it was too ""Hollywood"". It felt as if it went on a little longer than it should have.Acting-wise, Jake Gyllenhaal is not to be underestimated; he has come a long way from ""Donnie Darko"". Vera Farmiga (who played Goodwin, the lady running Source Code), was a star like always. Jeffrey Wright, who played the mastermind behind Sorce Code had a nice performance as a particularly mysterious guy. Michelle Monaghan was the love-interest of the movie, her parts were simple yet sweet. Russell Peters even had a small part in the movie. In my opinion, his acting was decent, but I would have liked to see him play himself (though his character is similar). Overall, in three words, this movie was: innovative (the concept was something fresh that I hadn't seen in a movie recently), suspenseful (you'll be guessing throughout the movie who the bomber is), and (incredibly) mind-blowing. This is one of the best new movies out this year and defiantly one of the best thrillers out recently.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Also, as I have a bit of a 'celeb crush' on her, I think Vera Farmiga's character came across slightly underdeveloped; you just didn't get to know anything about her.

But one can't be betting on just that producing a movie that will get on anyone's nerves when things aren't explained in a manor that caters to some respect for reality.There is nothing about quantum physics that allows for computer software to correctly guess what would take a molecule by molecule scanning and recording of an event in real time. There is also nothing about it, that would create parallel universes when the code is executed. And even if the latter would somehow be the case, we now have like, what, 15 freshly created universes in which 13 times people are dying due to a train bomb, shooting the ending in its own foot.There is nothing wrong with making a movie build on the popular assumptions of quantum theory, but if it doesn't even hold water in a Newtonian world, please rewrite the story or simply forgo the effort..1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The epitome of a popcorn flick,"*** out of (****)""Source Code"", Jones' sophomore directorial debut is, simply put, the epitome of a popcorn flick. It's visually astonishing, the action is well choreographed, and there are twists and turns at every corner. Sprinkle in a few solid performers and a well written script, and you've got yourself a good movie. Yes, ""Source Code"" may be that monthly action-heavy film that wins audiences over based on its titillation, but it actually has a bit more substance than your average thriller. The film actually has a nice message, and questions our perspective on life.First off, I thought Gyllenhaal, Monaghan, and Farmiga all delivered great performances. They did what they were supposed to do, and rose above what they had to work with. Moreover, the scenery was pure eye candy. The fact that this sucker has a budget less than one hundred million dollars is impressive. Not only that, but the action is top-notch. This movie is just replete with thrills.Furthermore, the script was very well developed. The twists were neat ideas, and their executions sufficed. Any problems? For one, there were a few unbelievable moments. I won't spoil them here but I'll give you a hint: it's towards the middle portion. I kept thinking, ""how did he get away with that?"". I guess because the director just wanted to get the scene over with.Not to mention, the end is very abrupt. It just ends. It's almost like after the climax, BOOM! It's over. There's no resolution. It wasn't a bad ending, it just wasn't a good enough one.All in all, ""Source Code"" should have no problem financially, critically, and universally.

"Short And Sweet,","Source Code is a fantastic movie with an extremely well thought out story line and an inspired cast.The whole plot to the movie was a very clever idea,and not at all a cliché story line that anyone could come up with.This is my first time seeing Jake Gyllenhaal in a movie before,and my first impression of him is good,I always thought he seemed like an average actor,but after seeing him in this I can see he is actually a really good and talented actor.The movie is very short,but it manages to fit in a much action as it possibly can in that short time.Definitely a movie that both sci-fi and action fans will enjoy.An soldier wakes up,for unknown reasons,in another mans body,and discovers he is part of a mission to stop a bomb that has been put on a train to Chicago.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An original movie that you'll forget the day after,"Source Code is an ""original Hollywood movie"". From my perspective, its plot is unique and makes the viewer wanting to see until the very end to discover what will happen, even though probably you'll predict what is going to happen before it does.Why did I put some quotes before and after the ""original Hollywood movie"" sentence? Well, as I said, its plot is not something you'll see everyday, but all the American techniques are there: the sensationalism, the brilliant genius, an ultra-top-secret government mission.Throughout the movie, you'll get the answers you're looking for, but they just didn't convince. I mean, I'm pretty sure it's possible to answer those same questions without using all that cliché that the blockbusters of Hollywood are used to—and here's a thing that had blurred some part of my excitement about Source Code: a movie with a great potential that lost it among schemas that people are already tired of.Technically speaking, the photography and soundtrack are good. And that's all. Worth to keep in mind that this *can* occur due to the lack of places our characters have been—three or four, at max—, which delivers a good experience, but an advise for you: don't expect anything breathtaking —you'll not get.Finally, it's a good movie. It will entertain you, for sure; it will hold your attention until its end—but the chances for your memories to forget about it the day after are quite high.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Muddled time travel oddity,"A bit of a strange one, this. From the premise and trailer it looked like just the sort of film that's up my street: a tense thriller utilising time travel in a more inventive way than most, packed with explosive action and a race-against-the-clock countdown. Having just watched it, I'm not entirely sure what to make of it all.For a start, despite the best efforts of the cast members, it's not the emotionally involving thriller that I was hoping. Gyllenhaal's soldier, despite some pretty hefty emotional moments, just didn't grab my sympathies as a leading man. Michelle Monaghan, as the train passenger he begins to develop feelings for, is bland, as if the romantic element is there just for the sake of it and the scriptwriter couldn't do anything apart from make her a one-dimensional figure for Gyllenhaal to fall in love with.Decent supporting actors, like Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright, are underused in stock roles. The action on the train is well directed by Duncan Jones, but the fact that Gyllenhaal can keep returning over and over saps the movie of impact and makes it all feel artificial; it looks great but is hollow inside. When Gyllenhaal believes that it's all a simulator early on, you're inclined to agree with him. The eventual reveal of the villain is underwhelming and, even worse, the time travel elements of the script become disjointed and muddled so that in the end, after the umpteenth twist, you feel entirely disassociated from the movie. To my mind, Denzel Washington's DEJA VU covers a similar premise to much better effect.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Rather predictable, but still surprisingly good!","It's not a high sci-fi, it's not a thriller, more of a drama, actually.Like most people, I liked Jake Gyllenhaal from Donnie Darko and I've been following his career (as well as his talented sister's) since. Well, it's definitely way better than Prince of Persia blockbuster, I'd tell you.The thing is, that despite quite predictable twists and turns of the plot and some pieces of bad acting (Michelle Monaghan was plain dull), there's a good camera work with carefully selected angles and lighting, JG and, of course, Vera Farmiga do their best and create great characters, music is OK and... all in all, it just leaves the right aftertaste.Good flick, most probably because it is not grim. It was easy to go either to heroic stupidity of most Tom Cruise' movies or dark thriller like Pandorum. 'Source Code' stayed on the edge, balancing - and it was very good.And no, don't you dare to spoil it with a sequel.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Beautifully Exceeds Expectations,"I walked in the theater expecting another Vantage Point...with just boring repetitions of the same crime scene, but the movie is fulfilling in so many other themes as well as having much more involvement that it was a pleasant surprise to go see it.Okay...I will admit, that the first 3 scenes or so are really...average. EXACTLY what you expect, even the explosion is done in a quick/rushed nondramatic and unconvincing manner.But one thing I enjoyed was that just about each time when Gyllenhaal's character gets sent back into the train via the Source Code, how1)There's a different objective2) There a subtle changes to pay attention to3) Achieving that objective often plays out awkwardly and comically.Going back into the train felt like an I-Spy game or even like Goosebumps books where you choose different endings. This part of the movie feels really free and loose, and Gyllenhaal really takes advantage that he knows he can do just about ANYTHING in this reality, though knows he has a goal to pursue--which may be more challenging than it seems.More predicaments, twists, character involvement and additional plots occur, too many of them do, so they're not all predictable. Also, this movie was truly emotional towards the end. It delves into what it means to live life to the fullest and to experience happiness.What I must admit also though...is that the ending took off the ""perfect 10"" star for me. A forceful moment in the storyline near the end was so perfect that you'll wish that was the ending, but instead, the story continues for an extra 5-10 minutes, in a fashion that provokes questions and confusion, and the real ending is definitely not as satisfying.BUT...the movie was still largely a great, and surprisingly entertaining ride, and a nice runtime too. The end WILL suit you better if you don't sit down and analyze it too hard. My theater, roommate and I all had fun.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Outstanding,"This movie sneaks up on you, despite the basic premise being laid out early on. It reveals slowly, with great pacing. The science fiction aspect of the plot is daring, but the story hangs on to it without getting drowned in concepts. The characters, the acting, are exactly what they need to be to make you care what happens next, and the ending is totally satisfying. You don't want it to end until the end, and when it does, you'll smile, knowing that it all worked out.Asks the same question The Matrix asked, but without the pretension, without the slow-mo fighting, just with a perfect blend of science fiction, metaphysics and heart.",,Anonymous,Mystery
A great start and a great ending,"As a big fan of Moon, I was admittedly expecting a lot from Source Code which was only further fueled by it's action packed/edge of the seat trailer. At the same time, I always knew it was going to be difficult to stay on track with an 8 minute changeover for the protagonist even at a shortish 93 minute runtime (the first and last 30 minutes of which are excellent)With that said, I enjoyed Source Code, Gyllenhaal plays the leading role immensely and actually makes the audience believe that he could fall for his opposite, Michelle Monaghan, in the few minutes that they only spend together.My only criticism of the movie would be that when outside the 'source code' the story gets boring very quickly and somewhere around the halfway mark, there is a 20/30 minute period that leaves you wondering if the movie has lost its way. Luckily it doesn't and there is an inception/shutter island-esque ending left with the viewers that will leave you thinking and hopeful of a DVD purchase to figure out what really happened!Definitely worth its money as a cinema visit but I've heard there are possibilities of some alternate endings and great extras on the DVD so you might also want to wait it out for that!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Duncan Jones pulls an excellent script together- top producer and Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan are both good actors and play their parts well in the film. The ending is really good as you don't expect Jake to review back to the team an 'addition' to what the source code can achieve I thought it was a good turn. I would imagine there will be a 2nd source code being produced soon I think it will work as the ending was left un- answered and open.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Jake Gylenhall again!,"I am such a big fan of this guy's movies. When was the last time I watched a movie that Jake featured and wasn't good? I cannot remember.

In this film, Jake Gyllenhaal is a soldier that wakes up in someone else's body and through an experiment by the government, he has got 8 minutes to find the bomber in a train. When the bomb goes off and Stevens finds himself in the pod again. He is sent back another time, yet still cannot find out anything. This sequence is repeated over and over again, until he is able to complete the mission, cause if he does, he is in in fact, changing the reality of today.

Great Story and idea makes for a well delivered sci-fi action Blockbuster.,"I enjoyed this Sci-Fi based movie, it was a great idea and an entertaining, gripping watch.Source Code is about a military used piece of software, that takes a person and patches into their brain and ability to allow the re-entering into any 8 minutes of the past. The US government is using this as part of their ant-terrorist program, using a soldier to execute a mission to find who bombed a Chicago train.I am not a Gylenhall fan but he is great in this, leading extremely well with a pleasing ensemble support cast. It is very Bond/Bourne like in its action momentum and pacing and delivers all it should. It does well to portray the frustrations, emotion and high level concept. It reminded me of a less impressive Deja Vu and the excellent Butterfly Effect.The film is solid, impressive and will leave mixed reactions to the ending but all in all a top ten movie of 2011.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Source Code is an above average movie that could have been better, but the final result is fine. 7/10","Characters and acting: First of all, Jake Gyllenhaal has proved himself. He's great in the role. Everyone else if fine. There isn't much character motivation or development, but characters are likable or understandable. There isn't much emotion though, except for a touching scene that (minor spoilers) involves a conversation between a character and his/her father.Story and dialogue: The story is what makes this movie. It's awesome and original. Despite some plot holes near the third act. The dialogue is fine, but sometimes there is too much exposition or the lines aren't exactly 'human'.Editing and pacing: Nothing spectacular or outstanding, but it does the job well. Let's say you wouldn't notice it anything good or bad.Cinematography and effects: Some really nice shots in this movie, but others are lacking. With some beautiful wide shots, but on the other hand some dark, barely visible shots. The effects aren't the best, but the movie doesn't rely on them, only uses them when necessary, they are fine for the size this movie has.Deeper meaning or motives/themes: Barely any, perhaps something that has to do with free will, or being human, but that's not really addressed.Tone: Mysterious, suspenseful.Emotional response: I was invested and excited. Wanted to know where the story would go.Rating: Source Code is an above average movie to watch on an evening with friends. Don't expect a great movie but a fun movie. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Not very much originality to be found here,"I had heard a couple of very good reviews of Source Code, but must confess to being slightly disappointed with it myself.Source Code tells the story of a Colter Stevens who is placed onto a train that is about to be blown up in 8 minutes. Colter Stevens takes on another persons identity when he is placed on the train. He must solve the crime in order that a follow up crime can be averted. He is repeatedly placed back on the train to see if he can work out who is behind the plot.Maybe I'm a bit too old to buy into a plot like this, so consequently I could never warm to the film. I am a big fan of Jake Gyllanhaal and he can't be faulted for his performance in Source Code. The same can also be said for Michelle Monaghan who certainly brightens the mood as his girlfriend on the train. The interplay between the two leads certainly bears comparison with a similar situation in Groundhog Day.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Unique,"So I watched this movie after having watched Tom Cruise's Edge of Tomorrow, which represent the same idea, but then, I realized Source Code is older, and makes more sense nevertheless (To me at least) and all you have to have as an film environment is a train where the problem as a whole lies.Jake Gyllenhaal perfected his role once again, the ending leaves you confused, it gives you mixed signals of whether it is a happy or sad ending.The movie isn't long, it's 1h30min only, somehow the movie loses a bit of steam midway but then regains it.Awesome. 8.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Terse code,"I love films or TV programmes that play with the idea of circular time and this movie is an especially good example. Like most of its type, it takes a little while to actually suss what exactly is going on, but once you settle into the rhythm of it, this is a taut, intriguing thriller which keeps you watching until the end.I got the references to the 80's TV show ""Quantum Leap"" right down to Scott Bakula's off-screen cameo as the voice of Jake Ghyllenhaal's character's father and of course it's not hard to see links to the likes of ""Groundhog Day"", ""Speed"" and even the old Powell & Pressburger classic ""A Matter Of Life And Death"" amongst others that I no doubt missed.Perhaps a little too much is compressed into the film's 90 minute running time, the way for instance that Ghyllenhaal so quickly finds first the bomb and then the bomber and possibly the freeze-frame moment on the train at the end is a bit too happy-clappy, but these sins are quite easy to forgive, given the main body of evidence here.Gyllenhaal and Monaghan convey an easy chemistry in their recurring 8 minute relationship and Vera Farmiga is also fine as the programmer with a heart who gives in to her humanity in allowing Gylenhaal's character a dignified release after he duly saves the world.All in all, this was a good thriller, well edited, shot and played delivering a race against time actioner alongside a make-you-think premise on alternative realities.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An Exciting Thriller with Bits of Science Fiction,"We need more filmmakers like Duncan Jones with a passion for great science fiction. His first film, MOON in 2009, was one of the best in years and his second while his second, SOURCE CODE, isn't as thought-provoking, it's still better than the majority of recent science fiction. SOURCE CODE feels a bit more mainstream than MOON, but it still focuses on an interesting story without relying on action to keep the viewer engaged. Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a helicopter pilot for the US military who unknowingly becomes a part of an experimental program called Source Code. He awakens on a Chicago commuter train with no memory of how he arrived, and he soon discovers that he's inhabiting the body and mind of a school teacher. Eight minutes later, the train explodes and Stevens is informed of his mission. The train had exploded in Chicago earlier that morning as a warning of future attacks to come and Stevens has been given the chance to relive the final eight minutes leading up to the attack and discover the identity of the bomber before he can strike again. Still, his commanding officers are being sketchy with the details of the project and Stevens begins to suspect there's something they're not telling him...Modern science fiction in the mainstream is pretty much limited to comic book movies and big-budget blockbuster fare (e.g. Abrams' STAR TREK reboot or Michael Bay's TRANSFORMERS series). Every so often, a shining gem emerges that reminds us that science fiction was once a great genre used as a means of getting the audience contemplating mankind's flaws and where they might lead us. In recent years, DISTRICT 9 reminded us of the horrors of apartheid and applied them to our first contact with an alien species. Jones' own MOON contemplated how human rights might (or might not) apply to clones. SOURCE CODE doesn't focus as much on big questions, though it does pose the moral question as to whether it was all right to force one man's constant suffering/repeated death if it means saving millions more. The movie does touch on Stevens' predicament and whether the program is justifiable but it focuses more on the mystery element as Stevens is given multiple chances to try and identify the train bomber. You would think watching him relive the same eight minutes over and over again would become dull, but Jones and writer Ben Ripley keep it fresh each time with new information and new strategies.Jones is displaying a knack for great casting. Gyllenhaal does an excellent job here as Stevens. He's confused, frightened, and dropped into the middle of a situation where he has no control. He skillfully relates with the audience, and it was the little things that hit me as his best moments. I loved his reaction to the news of his fate from the last mission he remember in Afghanistan. Little bits like that and his dedication to saving a woman he's been repeatedly reminded already died. Michelle Monaghan is adorable as Stevens' only ""friend"" on the train and growing love interest, and Vera Farmiga was a great choice as his military point-of-contact Goodwin. Honestly, I envy Stevens in a sense. Who wouldn't want to spend the rest of their lives with Farmiga's beautiful face staring down. Jeffrey Wright is the project's creator and an antagonist in his own way, valuing his project over Stevens life and rights.It doesn't feel as rich in content as MOON, but SOURCE CODE is still a strong second film for director Duncan Jones. It's enough to place him among the new era of emerging directors that I'm excited to see what they do next.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A nice piece of Sci-Fi... with a twist...,"Having watched, and loved, the first film directed by Duncan Jones, Moon (2009), I was very interested to see this, his second feature. Fortunately this time it was showing at my local cinema and I didn't have to make a forty mile round trip to see it. It's quite an interesting time-travel based story with a bit of a twist at the end. I'll give you my thoughts after this brief summary (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please find that bomber and save the day while I write the next paragraph).Colter Stevens is a helicopter pilot in Afghanistan who wakes up on a train sitting across from a beautiful woman, Christina Warren. He is confused and disorientated at first, but after a while he begins to calm down. Just as he thinks everything is going to be alright, BOOM the train blows up and he finds himself back in some kind of capsule. The face of Colleen Goodwin appears on a monitor and asks him if he has found the bomber. Even more confusion sweeps over Stevens as he tries to figure out just what has happened to him. Goodwin calms him down and sends him back in, explaining that it is very important that he finds the bomb and the bomber. She also explains that he will only have eight minutes each time. Going back, he realises that the woman across from him is a friend of the person he is inhabiting. He goes back quite a few times, each time to the same point in time and each time he discovers more about Christina and each time he gets closer to finding the bomber. He eventually becomes obsessed with saving Christina and the other passengers, and to this end he takes a massive risk. I will end my summary here, don't want the Spoiler Police after me.This is a very well made film with lots of attention to detail, everything fits and everything works pretty well. There are overtones of Groundhog Day (1993), in that a time period is repeated, but I found this one very different. One of the best performances from Jake Gyllenhaal as Colter Stevens since Donnie Darko (IMO). Michelle Monaghan did a good job as Christina Warren as did Vera Farmiga as Colleen Goodwin. Also an honourable mention goes to Jeffrey Wright as Dr. Routlege.Although not as good as 'Moon', IMO, I really liked this film and I would watch it again. It's nicely paced, there's a pretty good soundtrack, although it's quite subdued and at ninety three minutes, it's not too long. Over all, it's a well written, nicely paced piece of science fiction with quite a nice twist at the end. Comparisons have been made with 'Inception' but I'm not even going to go there, they are totally different Recommended.My Score: 8.3/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I feel that a stronger supporting cast along with another half hour or so added to the length and we would have a real strong film that merits a lot more.

Duncan Jones' sophomore feature applies his eye for detail to a more commercial property that is elevated by a high concept hook and Gyllenhaal's performance,"U. S. Army Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) awakens on a Chicago passenger train as high school teacher Sean Fentress with no memory of how he go their or why he's now a different man. When the train blows up Colter finds himself inside a capsule with a video monitor showing him his handler Captain Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) who is with a program called Beleaguered Castle under the direction of Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) using a technology called Source Code to send Stevens back to an 8 minute stretch before the detonation of the train with his mission being to identify the bomber to prevent a larger scale attack. As Colter repeatedly goes back through the 8 minute loop following leads and potential suspects he finds himself falling for Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) and believes he can save her, but Dr. Rutledge says in reality she is actually dead and this reality cannot be altered from within the Source Code, but Colter is determined to find a way.Source Code was written on spec by Screen Writer Ben Ripley. The script was sold in 2007 to Universal Pictures and was ranked on the annual Black List of best unproduced screenplays. When the film became setup with producer Mark Gordan and Summit Entertainment, Jake Gyllenhaal became attached to lead and lobbied for Duncan Jones in the director's chair having been impressed by Jones' debut feature Moon. Upon release the film received acclaim from critics who complemented its use of the time loop gimmick (leading many to compare it favorably to Groundhog Day) and solid box office returns. Not only is the movie an excellent vehicle for its lead Jake Gyllenhaal, but it shows that despite a larger budget and more oversight Jones can still deliver high concept intelligent entertainment even in a popcorn thriller.Like most time loop stories be they Groundhog Day or the more obscure 12:01, Source Code works because it knows how to setup the details and play with them by bouncing the repetition of these events against our protagonist. Source Code takes the established framework of time looping and applies it to a mystery/thriller setting pretty seamlessly and also integrating it with a clever love story that subtlety develops over the course of the movie while balancing against Colter's investigation of the bomber's identity as well as the parallel investigation of what happened to him and why he's with Beleaguered Castle. The movie keeps itself fast paced and engaging with some great tension mined from the premise and the characters are all given satisfying arcs that culminate in effective ways including a kind of cheeky cameo from Scott Bakula's voice on the phone playing a character in a subtle nod to the TV show Quantum Leap that had a similar premise about going to a past point and inhabiting someone's body. In many ways Source Code reminded me of a better made version of Tony Scott's Déjà vu which also tried to mix a traditional investigation story with a high concept sci-fi hook but I think this had a better handle on the material by keeping the pace lean and the direction free of any flourishes. The eventual reveal of who the bomber's identity was a little underwhelming, but since that's only a small blemish on the film in the grand scheme of things I was willing to let it slide, but it was definitely the last 10 minutes of the film that I felt elevated it from being good to really good and makes me sad that attempts to continue Source Code in either a TV series or film sequel have lingered in development hell with no sign of escaping.Duncan Jones shows his debut film Moon wasn't a fluke as he delivers audiences a smart and thrilling popcorn thriller anchored by a strong performance from Gyllenhaal. While it's not earthshattering material, it does boast a strong and well utilized high concept hook with the time loop and is used to solid and creative effect.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The information about what was going on was slowly revealed, adding a bit every loop, and created the same atmosphere as Memento.The second half of the movie, get's a little bit boring, because everything is already revealed and gets more predictable with each minute.

But the magic has been happened on the screen.I thought something before watch movie, later face is glowing and inside so much smiles...wow what a crazy story man.

Unique and fun,"As of now, this is my third favorite movie of the year.I love the premise of this film, and in my opinion it is pulled off very well. A man is part of a program that allows him to go into another man's body, 8 minutes before the train he is on blows up. IN that 8 minutes, he must find the person who set up the bomb, before the same man tries to blow up something else in Chicago. But as he begins to bond with one of the passangers, he wonders, what is the point, when every person he sees on the train is already dead, with no chance of coming back to life.This movie could've been very repetitive, but because of the great story, every second feels important. And it's also just a fun movie to watch for the action and explosions. And the twists are done very well, I never figured out what was going on.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Real thriller..,poor concept and many contradictions","Thrilling, Though incompletely explained. The concept is not well developed and leads to many questions in viewers mind. But time to time you can manage with all questions in mind with some incomplete answers of your own. If someone is looking for a thriller then this is the one that you shouldn't miss, but don't compare this with the movie 'inception' as the movie have got much developed concept than this. This movie would make you think about time, so someone who is in mood to watch some good sci-fi movie..,source code would be a good option for them. This movie would entertain you even after you watch it, Because the concept is filled on a beautiful pot with 6 holes and all you have is five fingers to block the holes, when you block one hole the concept leaks through another. Maybe i liked because i like to think and the movie gives a plot for viewer to think on a varied interesting concept. This is not a war movie or a gun shot thing, Its a pure thriller.",,Anonymous,Mystery
High concept at its best,"First off, I'd just like to say I had absolutely no desire to see Duncan Jones's Source Code (2011) upon hearing of it, but since the majority of my friends are male, I've come to accept that despite the fact that I'm a film student, I don't always get to pick the flick, and I will constantly suffer through exposure to explosions, muscles, bad accents, and aggressive one- liners. However, Source Code offered none of those things (well, except for the whole explosive device on the train part of the plot) and I was pleasantly surprised to find that. In this (romantic) action-thriller, Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) finds himself thrown into a serious mission where he must find the bomber of a Chicago commuter train—here's the shocker. while inside the body of another man! Essentially, Colter's mind is utilized as an experiment with a new program, ""Source Code,"" which somehow magically allows him to be in the mind of another man's body for the last eight minutes of his life— this man being a passenger/victim of the commuter bombing. This is a smart movie, or it at least comes off that way. I was so busy trying to keep up that I didn't even have time to think about whether or not certain aspects were actually plausible. I had accidentally left my diagram that lays out the development of a structured narrative involving time travel, the cerebral cortex, and existentialism in the car. My bad. But like many say, ""It's just science!"" Jake Gyllenhaal succeeds in this role, where other actors may have failed. He brought character to the character. Anybody can read a script out loud and call it acting, but Gyllenhaal had the perfect persona for this role. He's got a forceful attitude with a sympathetic face. Yes, this could be another macho thriller, but instead of a bulky, apathetic protagonist, we get an emotional, relatable, well-developed character. Source Code will provide you with an exciting 93 minutes of mind-bending. Sure, what you're getting is a high concept film, but it's high concept at its best.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Fine 21st Century Sci Fi Film,"After the commercial ,and critical success of Moon, Director Duncan Jones was handed a bigger budget and bigger story for Source Code. The results are impressive. A student and aficionado of the Science Fiction genre, Jones takes a good plot idea and gives it a 21st century makeover to establish himself as a credible modern protagonist in the field.Writer Ben Ripley's original idea is inspired- that an individual, in a parallel dimension might, for eight minutes, be able to affect the future, but not the past. This is ideal when you are trying to deal with a train and city threatening terrorist. In an amusing spin on Groundhog Day, our hero is able to keep returning until he gets it right, and thwarts the plot. Lead actors Jake Gyllenhaal as Colter Stevens and Michelle Monaghan as Christina Warren lead the action well.Jones worked the confined spaces of space station well in Moon, he also replicates a twist regarding the ambiguity of the exact circumstances of the main character. He replicates that skill well by placing most of the action in a single railway carriage. American Directors notoriously lose their way when given a fistful of dollars, rather than dimes, to finance their films, but not Jones. The money goes on one (frequently reprised) set piece action sequence and a convincing set and cgi. The result is compelling, thought provoking, entertaining and gripping.In a style which will excite Hollywood , the film is intelligent, but never self-indulgent and at 90 minutes is generally tight. Yet it is not flawless. A minor irritation is the inclusion of comic Russell Peters in a cameo role, demonstrably a fairly cynical attempt to create a broader North American market. It is unnecessary as he is not funny, although he apparently kept the cast amused between filming. The more significant failing is an appalling bolted on Hollywood ending that might have undermined the entire film if what had gone before had not been so good. Two excellent opportunities to end the film, a kiss and a freeze frame, are eschewed in favour of absurd schmaltz and a platform for a sequel. This is a shame, because the romance between the leads works well and reeks of a post production fix.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
good cognitive thinking,"Source Code A New PossibilityThe name of the movie is Source code. In this movie, the main star cast is Jake Gyllenhaad, Michelle Monaghan, Vese Farmiga, Jeffering Wright, Michel Arden, and Rusell Peters. The movie plot is set in the city of Chicago, America and whole movie ends in a day. The movie corresponds to thriller, mystery, Sci-Fi, adventure genre. The movie is of about 95 minutes and pace of this movie is bit fast.The movie was about a man who don't know why he was exists.It is like he slept a night before and now he was living someone else body and some other place. Everything that is happening around him, was not related to his life. He was struglling for truth and he has limits because he doesn't has that much time.The plot in this movie is based on cognitive thinking. The limited scope to live in that world for completing the mission was good and it is a very nice concept. the concept on which movie is based is very new concept and it is very unique too. Cinematics of this movie were very pleasing and environment looks very calm. When the movie started by the half an hour it is very difficult to understand what is going on but after some time, the story goes on and finally plot unveils the climax. The ending of the movie is the best part of it . I can't comment about music and sound effects used in this movie but they were good. I think it is future to our human universe. Watching the movie provides the audience with an insight and a journey into the world of Science Fiction consisting of cognitive thinking which cannot completely be expressed through words but by experiencing it live.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Quite Brilliant,"Source Code is one of those movies which make you think and really make you realize that unlike some filmmakers there are some intelligent and creative brains out there who still believe in quality cinema. In a nutshell, the movie is a Sci-Fi action thriller and is brilliantly shot. I said brilliant because of three reasons:-1.The way of storytelling. 2.The visibility of the scenes, dialogs and the overall script. 3.The quality of the direction.The technical aspects of the movie are not too hard to understand and you are always captivated and captured by the somewhat volatile happenings. The action in the movie is first-rate and does provide the buzz expected of an action thriller.Jake Gyllenhaal is a fine actor. He has portrayed the character of Colter Stevens, an American Army helicopter pilot, quite well if in not the best way possible. Vera Farmiga as Goodwin was convincing and looked appropriate in her place. Michelle Monaghan too acted well but her character had far less exposure and she had not a lot to do.For me the real winner here is the director, Mr. Duncan Jones, who has really put together a wonderfully captivating show. Definitely worth your time and money.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Incredibly Entertaining, Great Concept.","When I first heard of this film, I assumed it was going to be another weak, Hollywood blockbuster strung together with hundreds of mindless action sequences building up to a disappointing end. It seems that lately, Hollywood has realised the potential of mind-twisting concepts and is trying it's hardest to recreate Inception.This film, however, has surpassed all of my expectations and has turned out to be... incredible. Well, Very good at least. The concept is solid - well thought out and intriguing and doesn't try to hard to confuse the audience for the sake of depth. It knows it's a Hollywood action film and doesn't pretend to be anything else. That's not saying it doesn't have any depth whatsoever - it just doesn't overwhelm the audience with irrelevant, or redundant information - It tells you what you need to know.Combining with the incredible visuals and superb acting from Jake Gyllenhaal, this film is truly a film to see - it will have you hooked from start to finish. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Watch it if you're a die-hard Sci-Fi buff.,"In Source Code, we are introduced, once again, to the concept of repetition. A similar theme is also seen in Jones' ""Moon"" which was his first movie although this ""Source code"" borrows a lot from Tony Scott's Deja Vu as well .As Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal) wakes up on a train he with no memory of how he got there he soon realise that he's not the man he thinks he is. The audience is inducted into the main storyline very quickly as Colter dies after 8 minutes since he woke up and ends up with some memory loss in a surprising turn of events.The first few minutes are intense and intriguing enough for you to want more. And more is exactly what you get. Except it's only the same. but still, it's more. Don't ask how, but Stevens is trapped in someone else's body during the very last eight minutes before a bomb detonates killing everyone instantly. Over the course of the movie, we find Stevens desperately trying to figure out the what's, who's and why's of his mission while ""when"" is all that he knows. All this time he's forced to relive the same 8 minutes. His mission is to find the bomber.It's a nice concept and it's used well by the director. The main disappointment for me was the after ""Moon"", I was expecting the stars from Duncan Jones. Don't get me wrong here. Jones carries the story well enough to keep you engaged and thrilled, albeit with some goofy theories and unexplained(perhaps impossible) science. Gyllenhaal gives an average performance but his character's falling in love with Christina Warren is unneeded and unbelievable. Still, for hardcore sci-fi fans this movie is gonna keep the discussions open for a short while after the credits role out.Egidijus Mikauskas",,Anonymous,Mystery
"A thoughtful, sci-fi thriller","Jake Gyllenhaal plays Capt. Colter Stevens who travels back in time (sort of) and inhabits the body of a male passenger on a Chicago bound passenger train in the (8 minutes) leading up to a deadly explosion, which kills everyone on board. It's his mission to find the terrorist responsible.I really enjoyed this, especially the ending which (despite the super happily-ever-after) is open to interpretation or possibly even a sequel. I also loved how this movie slowly unravelled itself, with more pieces unveiled to both Colter and the audience with each subsequent 8 minute trip he took. I wasn't all that surprised by Colter's condition but it was still shocking and very sad.A pretty great movie I'm still thinking about.05.13",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A lot rides on  a film's ending,"Source Code is a very interesting little film. It follows in the footsteps of films like Deja Vu, Inception and Looper (although Looper was of course released afterwards). And one of the things these films have in common is that they raise a lot of questions and discussion after you've seen them. So I came to the IMDb message board for Source Code expecting nothing different. However what I found there, in comparison to the other three films, was different. The whole movie wasn't so much being discussed, but simply the ending. And the general question that kept coming up, which I admit had occurred to me also at the time, was 'does the ending make any sense at all?'Now Source Code is a mystery thriller, which is a lot of fun to try and work out, so I'm not going to spoil the ending for you. I'll simply talk about the implications it had. Firstly, it must be said that an ending that gets people talking at all is an accomplishment. After all, isn't that what every filmmaker strives for? Christopher Nolan ended Inception brilliantly by leaving a huge gaping question for the audience, rather than giving a definitive answer. Although he did leave clues throughout the story for us to go back and work out the answer for ourselves. Here, director Duncan Jones takes a different approach. He gives us a clear and absolute ending, but the clear ending he gives raises more questions than answers (an achievement in itself). Personally I didn't like it and thought (along with a few others I've talked to) that it should have ended at a particular point a few minutes earlier. I think you'll know which point I mean when you watch it.The ending aside, Source Code is a pretty entertaining, well produced and well acted film. Right from the start we are hooked into the mystery the main character finds himself in. We both find out information at the same pace and it makes for fun watching. There's a whodunnit aspect in there, which never takes center stage, but makes for a nice little addition to the story. Jake Gyllenhaal carries the film pretty well and Michelle Monaghan and Vera Farmiga provide good support throughout. Definitely worth a watch this one and I'll let you make up your own mind regarding the ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Being a fan of Jake Gyllenhaal, I finally decided to give it a watch, and it certainly did not disappoint. The film kept me engaged throughout, skillfully making each repetition of the eight-minute time loop feel fresh and unique. The storytelling captivated me, and while I could delve into the intricacies of the logic employed, I found the way it unfolded within the film's context to be enjoyable.Surprisingly, Source Code offered more character depth than I initially anticipated, enhancing the already entertaining narrative. It's a movie that exceeded my expectations, and I can see myself revisiting it with pleasure. With its quick pace, the film effortlessly flew by, ensuring there was never a dull moment.

"Different, engaging and satisfying.","'Source Code' is an interesting action mystery thriller that keeps its audience engaged from beginning to end through clever writing.The film gives the viewer just enough hook to keep him glued to the screen, contemplating what will happen next. I enjoyed this mystery element, and how more detail is revealed with every mission. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a great performance as soldier Colter Stevens. It's interesting that we never really know where Colter is - not until the final act, at least.Vera Farmiga also delivers an amazing performance, conveying so much emotion through facial expression. She's a great actress and although she sits in a chair for most of the movie, her acting talent really comes to the fore as Colleen Goodwin, who is somewhat of a mysterious character in the beginning - a character whose actions are sometimes questioned as we're not entirely sure at first whether her intentions are good or bad.The film pays great attention to detail. Detail, off course, being the very core of the film. The film utilizes every opportunity to its advantage. In a way this can be viewed as a time machine movie, but it does become almost as complicated as 'The Matrix' once they start explaining the source code during the final act - almost mind bending.'Source Code' is a fast-paced film with never a dull moment. Although essentially a sad ending, it is a feel-good movie with a satisfying finale. I love this film!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Duncan Jones seals his place among the top directors of today,"Most directors tend to stumble for their second film, others far exceed them while Duncan fits nicely in between those two extremes and follows up his very impressive debut, Moon, with this well-executed thriller.While this is more mainstream than Moon was it doesn't make the film any less thought provoking and exciting, if anything it exceeded my expectations. Based on what the film industry is churning out recently this film particularly stands out for me.But all the credit shouldn't be down to Duncan. The script is really well written with some smart dialogue and a cleverly crafted story that keeps you guessing. Jake Gyllenhaal also gives a very convincing performance along with a great supporting cast that overall will make this film go down as probably one of the more underrated films this side of the summer blockbusters.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Interesting but like a weak Twilight Zone episode,"This movie really makes all the mistakes that a Rod Serling or an Alfred Hitchcock would NOT have made. I don't want to give any spoilers but the issue here in this sci-fi area is about information. Who knows what about what? And it really does not add anything to the plot here the way it is done. It does not add anything to the suspense either. It just makes us wonder: ""Why are the characters pretending they don't have information of what is going on?"" It would have been much more interesting if the VIEWER did not know what is going on. But this cliché about the main character not knowing who he is, identity, etc. is just not working at all in this movie. The movie has other qualities though, and it is really like a Twilight Episode. One of the weaker episodes though.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The two Jakes,"Early in the movie Jake Gyllenhaal looks into a mirror on the commuter train and sees Sean, the passenger he's been ""zapped"" into, staring back at him. This moment reveals the film's - to me - fatal flaw. Shouldn't we be looking at Sean in the train scenes and only see Jake in the time capsule scenes? Of course, this would limit Jake's screen time - unless he played Sean and the other actor played the time traveller.You can imagine how this was pitched: INCEPTION meets UNSTOPPABLE with a bit of GROUNDHOG DAY and THE TIME-TRAVELLER'S WIFE thrown into the mix. The mix is a hell of a mish-mash. The film's dynamic pace - and Gyllenaal's considerable screen presence - carry the story past its many inconsistencies, but it's only fun while you're in the cinema. Its internal logic is flawed, particularly in the way it works up to a ""surprise"" ending which, when you think about it, isn't really that much of a surprise.

Tired Plot + Confusing Sci-Fi Tech = 2 hrs lost,"First: As an IT Professional, the title ""Source Code"" is a misnomer.Second: To anyone who was a fan of ""Quantum Leap"" - like I was - this movie comes dangerously close to that .. minus the 8 minute criteria.Third: The technology explained in the movie was a total white-wash of what is remotely feasible. The concept of retaining the soul post-mortem and basically drafting it into military service doesn't add up.Fourth: We the people are tired of seeing good ol' WASPie Americans, the kind that are least likely to be racially profiled, now becoming the poster children for anti-US, domestic terrorism in the name of ""Patriotism"".Last: The movie yields more questions than it entertains - a bad thing! It ends up painting itself into a time paradox (where if he goes back in time to fix 1 thing, what effect did that fix have in the future? is it the same future or an alternate? .. and so on) - a worse thing!

Excellent little sci-fi thriller which will reward those viewers who can discern the logic.,"Maybe there aren't any truly original ideas left in Hollywood, but occasionally a movie comes along and shows you something you have seen before in a unique and unexpected way. Think 12 Monkeys meets Groundhog Day with a twist ending. Top notch acting all around, Gyllenhall especially. The way the story unfolds and particularly the ending may be confusing and unacceptable to some viewers, but I am of the opinion that it all makes perfect sense. The viewer has to take into account that what the scientists are doing is experimental, and that the process they are using works differently than expected. Overall source Code is one of the most entertaining and well thought out sci-fi thrillers in recent memory. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better than expected,"From the trailer I expected an action focused film, but it ended up being a fun science fiction exploration that felt natural and as if the audience is in the same position as Jake Gyllenhaal. If you enjoy science fiction for with ethical and character issues then this is a good movie for you. Though it could have been more of a mystery or thriller style movie, the focus really is on how Gyllenhaal's character develops rather than the dramatic situation. Sometimes the next step or plot event that progresses the movie feels too easy and in once case contrived. Don't expect a lot of action despite frequent explosions.

That's the thing, I know it was intentional, and you have to leave some things to be discovered, but overall the first half of this film is just frustrating to watch. I'm an impatient person, but even then I be most audiences got tired of the cycle pretty quickly and just wanted some content. We all know what a time loop film is at this point, and it seemed like that's all it had to offer; a frickin' wild goose chase at every try. 'oh, I did this last time' etc. Wash rinse repeat. If done in a comedic fashion, say Russian Doll, it's just fun to ride along. Here however it's just annoying. Now, once the story started to unfold the last half of the film was enjoyable and offered up some interesting scenarios, interactions. Can he save the world? Is this multi-dimensional?

Flawed but still pretty nifty science fiction thriller,"A man comes to on a morning train. An unfamiliar train, and he's wearing somebody else's body. Confused, he tries to get his bearings but 8 minutes later a bomb blast takes out train and everyone on it. After a strange interlude, our man is back on that same train, back where he started with a mission to save the future. Yep, this is one of those time loopy science fiction thriller joints, but for a film with such hoary gimmick its actually rather decent stuff. It has problems, but first off here are the things that really work. Jake Gyllenhaal pulls off a great turn as the confused hero, his movement from perplexity to fragmented understanding and frustration, gradually into ultimate determination is the driving force of the film above and beyond the plot and e convinces every step of the way. Michelle Monaghan is a fine love interest/foil, sweet natured and pretty with the right flashes of shock and confusion at things going down beyond her comprehension. Jeffrey Wright is similarly fine as a secretive, gently amoral scientist, whilst Vera Farmiga is fairly convincing in a slightly underwritten sympathetic military role. The other big plus to the film is its tightness and measure of real excitement. Flashy effects work is largely eschewed in favor of clock ticking suspense and physical rough and tumble, also writing is tight and the viewer is placed in the same position as the hero, without flashbacks or extraneous character detailing we find out everything alongside him as the film progresses, maintaining a fair sense of mystery and making for the odd decent twist. The tightness of the thriller structure and its execution actually lead into the films problems though. At the centre is a piece of science fiction gimmickry explained with analogies and some one six fits all quantum physics jargon. It works just about well enough to hold things together, but it doesn't stand up to scrutiny and in the end hurts the film, as the final (seemingly tacked on) sequence is rather jarring. The suspect explanation also meshes with the structure to bring down the films potential as thoughtful science fiction, it is mildly thought provoking but doesn't really go anywhere with its mind expanding possibilities, nor the moral and existential questions that arise during the course of the film. I guess one is not really supposed to question a film in this way, being that it is after all a thriller and not some piece of ""hard"" science fiction, but when the potential is clearly there its hard not to be a little ticked off when it isn't realised. Still, by and large I had a fine time with this one on a basic entertainment level, I'll give it a generous 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Source Code. What is Source Code?,"A mystery-thriller that starts off with a bang!. Source Code will keep you engaged from the moment it starts. You will have a lot of questions like:Why did the train explode? How did Colter Stevens (Jake Ghyllenhaal) survive after the explosion? Wait, what is Source Code? Why cant I get off my seat?All of your questions will be answered as the movie progresses and no plot-hole will be left unturned.Character Development:We have a twitchy Jake Ghyllenhaal who does justice to his character of an anxious soldier who wants answers, who wants to know why he's in a train, who doesn't recognise his face. He slowly understands that he is on a mission. Colter Stevens (Jake Ghyllenhaal) is a well developed character who has a lot of back story and reason to be in the movie and his back story makes you have a special bond with him.We have the girl next door Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) who doesn't have anything to do before the 2nd half of the movie. Although, they did need someone talking to the protagonist in the entire movie and the way the movie starts-off, one would think that she was needed since the beginning but after re-watching several times, one would then start to raise questions over her character. A decently developed character no doubt.We have a bossy but good-hearted Colleen Goodwin (Vera Fermiga). Who plays a crucial role in the movie, her staying to the topic type attitude does save a lot of time for the movie to show us the things we want to see. There was no back story for this character but to be honest, it wasn't even needed because this character was complete without one.We have a strict Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) who aims for the goal he sets and nothing else. He performs just like any government agency top gun would. Doesn't want to answer any questions and only wants answers. The maker of the source code and an egotistical man who would sacrifice anyone (not himself) to get the job done.While watching Source Code, you will accuse everyone you see in the entire 93 minutes. Source Code doesn't only give you chills but also explains itself. This isn't the type of movie where the main focus is only on finding the villain. It gives you a great concept of how a man can go to the same place again and again for answers, it shows you the importance of life, it shows you how a man fights for his rights and it shows you how one lunatic can harm so many people.Direction:The scenes are brilliantly directed, being in the train for most of the 93 minutes, the director made it look so easy and the setting for all the scenes was perfect.Pros:*The acting by all the characters*The direction and the movie's setting*The fresh idea*Focusing on more than one thing*The mystery and thrill*The length of the movieCons:*The character Christina Warren being bland*The antagonist's foolish motive for the bombingVerdict:Source Code has it all, the action, the thrill, the chill, the love story, the bonding with the characters, a fresh idea that delivers. You will be seeing more than a mystery thriller. The direction and acting delivers, the story delivers but a couple of things fail.Christina Warren, a main character looks a bit bland and out of sync with the story in the first half. And the antagonist who has one of the most idiotic reasons to kill people even for a movie. Maybe, it's not his fault as over the years, we have seen so many evil masterminds with stunning reasons to be evil and then we get to see this villain who is just plain bad. A stunning movie no doubt and is recommended for everyone9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Duncan Jones does it again!,"Duncan Jones (Moon) gives us yet another short-and-sweet sci-fi treat with Source Code. I didn't like it as much as I loved Moon; but this is still a very respectable watch as some sci-fi is too outlandish and over-the-top for everyday people (non sci-fi fans) to enjoy -- this one has a story that I think should appeal to anybody (it simply is grounded in sci-fi).As the film plays out (quickly), we discover that Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko, Brokeback Mountain, Jarhead) is being sent into a parallel reality to find the source of a bomb on a commuter train headed into the metropolitan area of Chicago. Seated across from him is a pretty passenger who knows him (although he doesn't know her) played by Michelle Monaghan (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, North Country, Somewhere). With only 8 minutes at a time to move about and discover something new about his environment, our hero only has limited options.As the urgency presses, his supervisor who appears to him via video screen, Vera Farmiga (Up in the Air, Orphan, The Departed) reveals to him why he has been chosen for this task and why it needs to be solved. Her supervisor, in turn, Jeffrey Wright (Shaft, Casino Royale, The Invasion) wants her to keep mum on all info she offers him and the secret soon comes into focus.The film plays out at a taut pace and it keeps one's interest rather easily. Gylleenaal and Monaghan are two of my favorite in the upcoming-next-generation of Hollywood so they help make the film play-out even when we are questioning what it is exactly we are seeing. While this one does NOT have a Moon-esque twist at the film's end, it is gripping nonetheless.I'd recommend Source Code to anybody who likes suspenseful drama ... and leave out its sci-fi element entirely as it isn't what makes that film. THAT is Gyllenhaal and Monaghan.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good storyline,"First of all I was intrigued with the trailer for this movie when I first saw it. It was on my list of movies to see. So while the kids went to see HOP with their mom, I went to see Source Code and was not disappointed. This movie had a terrific storyline. I think I was glad to see a movie with a good original idea. Most movies I am looking at my watch 3/4 way through, but not with this movie. I was wanting more. There were some unanswered questions, but for the most part I was okay with that because with this kind of storyline I would think it was impossible to fill all the gaps. I thought the ending was good and wasn't left open like some movies do today hoping for the numbers to bring back a sequel. If you want to see a good thriller and a movie that has a good plot then see this...I don't think you will regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Source Code (2011),"""The film is a saddening bore, for she's lived it 10 times or more!"" Duncan Jones must really have some daddy issues, to disregard his father's words like that. Here he has Jake Gyllenhaal reliving the same 8 minutes in order to find a bomber. It's a great premise, and I'm not one to be offended by the casual use of science nonsense. This is no Moon. This is Jones doing a Hollywood film. He certainly does it better than most, and bravely explores the character of Gyllenhaal rather than the bombing itself. Unfortunately, his character is not one I particularly liked. I get what they were going for, but he was a whiny irresponsible man. He didn't seem to care about the lives of so many civilians, and was able to solve the case pretty darn quickly when he put his mind to it. Wright was simply horrible though. A terrible performance of hammy cheese. I have no idea how anyone acted opposite him, it's like they dragged a cartoon villain out to fill a vacant role just seconds before filming. His mannerisms, voice, dialog, and general presence, all really annoyed me. The pacing was the key to enjoying this movie. It had enough going on and a decent amount of time was spent exploring each plot strand. Highly enjoyable sci-fi hokum.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Solid,"For its second feature, Duncan Jones chose to remain faithful to a genre he seems particularly fond of : science fiction. And what's great about the English director is that he doesn't rely on a pompous, muddled science fiction, piling up information, it's always relatively easy to understand and that's one of his strength.He proves it once again with Source Code, which plot is clear and interesting, very well executed, dynamic and directed in a very sober and efficient way. Jake Gyllenhaal, probably one of the best actors of his generation, is impeccable, accurate from start to finish, even though his character didn't seem to allow him to give his best.Although the movie is overall good, the happy ending (imposed by the studio ?) is a bit of a letdown, it feels too contrived, especially compared to the frozen instant in the train that would have perfectly concluded the story.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"In fifteen years, this will be considered a classic.","I went around asking people, ""what did you think of Source Code?"" Half of the people I asked said it was awful. I HIGHLY DISAGREE. This movie has one of the most twisted, developed plots ever to be written. The acting was good. If you're able to understand it clearly, you can even point out information used for the film (which is what I did, making it more fun). It does get a little confusing near the end with the whole quantum physics thing. But if you're smart enough then you'll be able to understand - this movie is targeted at an age group that will mostly understand the confusing parts. But anyway, this movie has the rare mix of sci-fi and mystery. It almost like a science fiction detective movie. The acting was very realistic. When I watch movies, I don't rate acting based upon dramatization, but more on realism. Do I recommend it. Most definitely. It's a must-see, and no matter what kinds of movies you like, you will either love or somewhat like Source Code!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An effective sci-fi story with plenty of twists,"Take a measure of science, add copious science fiction, a few dashes of ""Groundhog Day"", a touch of ""Deja Vu"" and ""Premonition"", and presto you have Source Code.The first minutes of this film, eight minutes in story time, are a little edgy, uneasy, as if the actors are not sure where things are going, and I am captivated. Slowly a difficult first experience is made easier as the film reveals a deliciously inventive plot and sub-plot. And our main characters play it out so extraordinarily cleverly as the explanations for early clumsiness come thick and fast. And that is one of the exceptional talents of this film as it changes up the gears but keeps the suspense lingering right the way through.The editing, cinematography and soundtrack are very well done, and the sets are a work of art. Vera Farmiga, Michelle Monaghan and Jake Gyllenhaal are excellent and there is very good support from elsewhere too, as things rev up towards the final fifteen minutes or so.There are bound to be a few people who'll point out the impossibility, scientifically, of what we see, but remember they'll only be correct through what we think we know, not what we may come to learn. And this film does its own thinking on its feet to come up with a clever, and somewhat unpredictable, ending.This is more than worth a watch especially if you are feeling down and out.

"Hero tries to save the world and get the girl, but loses track of which world it is in the first place","""Source Code"" is a movie about trains blowing up, but with far more intelligence put into it than explosive action. The former is why I didn't see it at first, the latter is why I finally had to. Another movie that belongs to the science fiction romance genre. Heavy on the science fiction, light on the romance.Jake Gyllenhaal stars as a U.S. Army colonel who only knows where he should have been: in Afghanistan on a helicopter mission. He doesn't know where he is now: in some cell after a bomb on a train was detonated. The movie tells us everything we need to know about this new world he's in and the mission he's on. The description of this science fiction world was thought out way more than most Holllywood movies attempt. I appreciated that.The best part of ""Source Code"" was Jake Gyllenhaal and his character. He completely stayed in character, and the film managed to always keep the character in check. I felt for him, and I, too, wanted him to save the world and get the girl. The worst part, was the three or four endings that dragged on way too long. Hollywood couldn't just let a good movie be, they had to add multiple twists which undid the story they were trying to tell.""Source Code"" exists in a world where terrorists plant bombs, the hero tries to win the girl, and after awhile, things just stop making sense. Oddly enough it sounds like the real world, but it doesn't have to be. If only they knew to leave well enough alone.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Suspense keeps you guessing - Fine movie all around,"I rented Source Code from my library because I like Jake Gyllenhall, and had never really heard of this film.I was really surprised how good the whole package was. Gyllenhall is excellent as a military type name Colt whose last memories are of being in a combat mission in Afghanistan. Suddenly he finds himself waking up on a train near Chicago. He's like - yikes! what is going on, and who is this babe (Michelle Monaghan) talking to me that I don't know.Time goes along, and next thing you know, an event happens and now he finds himself if a metal box-like structure, with a military-type woman talking to him.He discovers he's part of this mission to try to find a bomber who is doing bad things around Chicago. As time goes along, he understands the gravity of the situation, what his real situation is, and what his options are. Then he goes back and repeatedly goes into this short time frame to try and find this bomber. It's really cool how each time he goes back, he has more and more comfort with his situation, because he keeps the memory of what he learned, and builds upon it. Gyllenhall skillfully plays with that to the max, especially at the end.Monaghan is terrifically cute and just the right foil for Gyllenhall's craziness. They have excellent chemistry. The movie succeeds with a terrific ending that only Hollywood can give you.This movie is a combo of so many different films, but it's still different, and keeps you guessing. Combine like Groundhog Day, Memento, Total Recall, and part of the Matrix, and you have Source Code. Outstanding work, really worth your time.Enjoy",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"A Solid Sci-Fi Thriller, But Lacking Depth","The film was good enough, but for a story unfolding within such a complex mechanism, I expected more pronounced sci-fi elements. Some processes within the film felt underexplained and insufficiently developed.There were certain aspects of the plot that the audience remained unaware of until the very end-perhaps a subtle nod to the film's own time-travel concept. I don't know, but in my opinion, if you're going to throw around a heavyweight term like quantum, you need to back it up with some solid groundwork.That aside, Source Code was a strong film. The performances were high quality, and the concept flowed well, maintaining a consistent level of engagement.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Where Avatar meets Inception meets the Green Zone,"I was really intrigued by the trailer of this movie and decided to go to the cinema for the first time for a pretty while. The film is very worthwhile and touching with a great main actor, an interesting plot, a lot of suspense and action, a twisted part towards the last third of the movie and a happy ending with a philosophical focus.The only problem is that we have recently had movies such as ""Inception"" or Avatar where people are getting transfered to different place and sometimes in the body of different persons in order to save the world or where they fall in love with a stranger. The conspiracy story surrounding this movie makes me rather think of ""The Green Zone"". ""Source Code"" is surely an entertaining and intriguing movie but it somewhat lacks of originality. A good twist, some emotional and dramatic touches and a very good acting still make this movie stand out and pardon for a rather mediocre script that also has a plot hole concerning the explosion of the two trains that works well timed even though the villain isn't able to observe the right place and time to commit his attack while the first train is also too late and should indeed have meet the other train a couple of minutes earlier than we see. Another thing that I must criticize is the weak villain that is not charismatic enough and I didn't like the rather superficial reasons and motivations for his devastating acts.Finally, ""Source Code"" is a very entertaining and worthwhile movie but slightly overrated and not as stunning, innovating or gripping as one might think. It's worth to be watched at the cinemas because of the visual and sound effects but a part of that, I would rather suggest to wait and loan this flick later.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Yes, it is 'Groundhog Day,' but with explosions","There's no other way to describe 'Source Code,' without comparing it to the classic comedy film, Groundhog Day. However, whereas Bill Murray was stuck in a day and had to get out, Jake Gyllenhaal's take is a little more specific: he's a member of a top secret military project who has to find out who planted a bomb on a crowded commuter train by 'living' the last eight minutes of one of the – now deceased – passenger's life.So, ala Groundhog Day, we get basically the same scene endlessly repeated with Jake learning a little more about his surroundings and the various perils he'll have to face as he goes along. There's not an awful lot more you can say about the film without giving important points away. And, with Source Code, less is definitely more. It's certainly not a long film and it's well shot and paced, largely to its director, Duncan (son of David Bowie) Jones. It's basically a simple, no-frills film and, if you're in the mood for some – slightly more – intelligent science fiction, then you could do worse than this one.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I'll Never Forget Our 8 Minutes,"Greetings again from the darkness. Duncan Jones (son of David Bowie) was the writer/director for a terrific 2009 film called ""Moon"" (highly recommended). Here he stays in the sci-fi realm with a thrilling and brainy script from Ben Ripley. The best, most accessible sci-fi films not only don't require the viewer to hold a Ph.d, but they also don't talk down to us. This is a fast-moving script with a smart (though a bit preposterous) premise, and plenty of reality to keep us glued to the screen ... and hanging on every word spoken.It's impossible to write much about the film and not give away some of the stuff that makes it fun, so I will be very brief. Trying to figure out what's happening, how it's happening, and whether they can stop it from happening again ... well, that's just about all a movie lover can hope for! So I won't give away any more than what the trailer sets up.Jake Gyllenhaal is Colter Stevens and he is involved in a remarkable project that allows ""time travel"" to a parallel universe so that a military contractor can discover the terrorist who bombed a train. The first time he wakes up on the train across from Christina (Michelle Monaghan) he has no idea who she is or where he is. 8 minutes later he is face to face with Captain Goodwin's face (Vera Farmiga) on a monitor and her voice telling him to calm down. Her boss (Jeffrey Wright) is some type of ambitious genius trying to make a name and a buck for himself.The story evolves by Gyllenhaal being sent back and forth between ""then and now"" on numerous occasions with the mission of uncovering the identity of the bomber. Of course, Gyllenhaal is a good soldier and wants to go above and beyond the call of duty. That's where the film gets tricky and brilliant.Director Jones works wonders with the camera and we are treated to some fascinating images - both large (Chicago) and small (Gyllenhaal in a train restroom). Great stuff here. That's about all I will say on this one. It should be obvious how much I like it. Also, a fun note ... the phone voice of Gyllenhall's father is that of Scott Bakula, who is known for his role in the TV series ""Quantum Leap"", also a time travel premise.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A great film...,"SOURCE CODEThis is a bit like Groundhog Day but with a mission. It was very good.The movie is about a bloke who wakes up on a train, but he is not himself. When he looks into a mirror he sees a different man. 8 minutes later... the train explodes killing everyone on board. Then he wakes up again in a capsule where he is told that he has to do it again until he finds the person who planted the bomb on the train... he then wakes up on the train again with 8 minutes to go until the bomb goes off.It is a bit confusing to begin with as it doesn't really explain itself until about two thirds into the movie. We were wondering what was actually happening and why. This film does keep you guessing though. There are a lot of people on the train an the terrorist could be any one of those people. The only problem is, my gorgeous girlfriend and I guessed who it was right from the beginning. That's not to say it is too obvious, we probably just got lucky.The film stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga & Jeffrey Wright. The acting is great... I can't say a bad word about any of the performances here. Jake does a great job.There are some really good slow motion shots when the train explodes too.

But at the end of the movie we hear someone telling to Dr. Rutledge that there was an attempt to blow up the train at 7.30 am but the attack failed. We know that colter saves the train from bomb explosion in source code but in the reality world indeed there was a train bomb explosion at 7.30 am and how did it turned as failed attack in real world by end of the movie. Also how can colter gets into the body of Sean permanently and enter real world from source code, whiles his body is still in the Life support and his mind is still active.Also at point we see colleen terminating the life support of Colter but at the end we see that his mind is still active and his body is still in life support.

Mind Blowing,"Take a dash of ""The Matrix"" and ""The 13th Floor,"" add a smidgen of ""Sphere,"" ""Donnie Darko"" ""Frequency"" and ""Paycheck"" and, voila, you have ""Source Code"". Jake Gyllenhaal plays ""Colter Stevens,"" an Army helicopter pilot whose last memories are flying sorties in Afghanistan, but suddenly finds himself in the body of a schoolteacher on board a double-decker commuter train speeding toward Chicago. Sitting opposite him is ""Christina Warren"" (Michelle Monaghan), a friend the schoolteacher has known for a couple of months. Eight minutes pass with no significant incidents, when suddenly the train explodes, incinerating everyone on board. Colter Stevens then himself strapped inside a pod, his only outside communication a webcam connecting to Air Force Captain Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga), who tells Colter the train was bombed earlier in the day by a terrorist and that, using his acute powers of observation, Colter must discover the identity of the bomber to prevent an even worse disaster. Colter not only takes on this mission for himself, he determines to discover the nature of what happened between his mission in Afghanistan and his current presence inside the pod.To reveal more would spoil the film. Let us just say it has a lot to do with the nature of ""reality"" as it pertains to quantum physics and Jewish Khaballah, that moment-to-moment reality is determined by consciousness.This is a ""small"" movie with big ideas. Like ""Groundhog Day,"" Colter keeps relieving the same experiences, expanding the possible outcomes in order to accomplish his mission. Production values are superb and the small supporting cast is professional, bringing just the right nuances to thinly written characters to make them believable. Gyllenhaal and Monaghan have great chemistry, thankfully, as they have little time to establish their relationship, due to both the repetitive nature of their scenes and their time apart in order to produce the necessary variances in the 8 minute segments.Many, especially those bound in causality and linear thinking, will find themselves baffled by this movie, particularly the ending. No, this isn't really about ""parallel universes"" or ""time travel,"" it is about the nature of consciousness as it relates to quantum probabilities. All life is lessons and the ""reality"" we see depends upon the lessons we need to learn. We truly are ""a thought in the mind of God"" and our fate can be changed from instant to instant. That is the lesson of ""Source Code"" and that lesson alone is worth a ""10,"" in my book, anyway.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

An intriguing movie but has its flaws.,"Beware of the movie that relies too much on flashbacks. Such movies usually lose their continuity as the audience is asked to re-watch scenes that have already been shown. A good movie is one in which the story movies forward. Flashbacks can actually assist in this process, but only to a point. And when the flashbacks further include material that are intended to mislead or confuse, like personality switches or the reworking of scenes already shown, the results can be a confusing mess, which is the case in this movie. This would like making a movie like, for instance, Gone With The Wind, but instead of opening the movie at the beginning with Scarlet entertaining her suitors and then proceeding form there, the movie opens with Rhett leaving Scarlett followed by a series of flashbacks revealing in bits and pieces what went wrong to try to keep the audience guessing. GWTW is not a sci-fi movie, yet the principal is the same. The movie offers an intriguing idea and tries to make a go of it, but it bogs down and it doesn't take much effort to connect the dots. By the third flashback it's obvious that the main character is being used for something and is not too happy about it.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Inception  meets Ground Hog Day,"I was really intrigued by the this movie after seeing the trailer. It looked like high excitement, just a bit of sci-fi, and action with a tad of romance all rolled into one. I couldn't have been more fooled.This movie is such a disappointment. Without providing spoilers beyond what the trailer provides, the basic story line is an army helicopter pilot (Jake G.) wakes up on a train, but soon discovers he's not himself (literally), and soon after the train blows up. He then finds himself in a pod talking to another military figure who tests him and re-thrusts him back into the train scenario.The plot unfolds slowly, as we gradually find out who Jake's character is, why he's in this situation, and why he's up against the clock to keep returning to the scene and solve the train bombing in the intermittent eight minute intervals. In this respect it's like Bill Murray's role in ""Ground Hog Day"". In the plot line itself, the sci-fi aspect takes us to ""Inception"" because the concepts presented really, really require you to suspend your disbelief and embrace this fantasy which goes from the believable to the ridiculous, by the end.There are the traditional good guys, bad guys, and the hero on a quest to save the train (and the girl).It is both exciting and boring at the same time, making you wish for the ending to come sooner. The only blessing is that it's a mere 93 minutes long.In my opinion this was probably and action movie made for teenage boys, but I'm willing to bet even they would grow tired of it.In summary. don't waste your time!",,Anonymous,Mystery
Familiar story but worth watching,"Jake Gyllenhaal is a helicopter pilot who finds himself on a train in the body of man who will die along with all the other passengers when a bomb on the train goes off. He has to find the bomb and the bomber and each time he fails he gets sent back in to try again. As he gets to know his fellow passengers he finds himself falling for Michelle Warren.I really enjoyed this film. The story is a take on the familiar science fiction plot where characters are experiencing a closed time loop, repeating the same time over and over (as seen in several Star Trek episodes and in Groundhog Day) but this film gives it a couple of nice little twists. It is probably a good idea that there is not a lot of detail given of the Source Code process itself. Attempts to explain such impossible things using current science would just not work and you only have to remember The Core to see what that could lead to. I am happy with science being substitute for magic in this type of film. I still wonder why a science technician has to wear in a lab coat in lab with very few chemicals or fluids. I know this just nit-picking but lab coats are utility wear and not a badge of office or a lazy shorthand for scientist.Nitpicking aside this film is worth watching. There is a bit of tension built up in the hunt for the bomber even if the climax did fall a bit flat. It does raise questions that it didn't really stop to answer about what the Source Code actually did but the twist at the end seemed more of a twist to characters in the film than it was to me because I saw as it as more a narrative inevitability.Rating 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just when you think you know ...,"Little twist in this movie make you change your mind how it is going to end. Slow to draw you in and almost uninvolving even if you know this is scifie give you ample ""Ah hah!"" moments, then put you back in that unsure mode. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Colter Stevens, an army helicopter pilot that finds himself flashed into the life of some other man riding a Chicago rail. He comes to facing a beautiful woman (Michelle Monaghan) who seems to know him enough to form what could become an intimate relationship. The panic of the first instance is monumental; he was in a rescue mission one minute then on a train with a crowd of people he has no connection to at all. The only problem he confronts though is that 8 minutes later the train explodes. From there is sheerly up to speculation. Personally, I believe that every decision you make changes the future. The creates parallel realities that could exist for any given instance. On this concept alone, this movie creates one alternate reality after another hence my comment on the ""Ah hah"" moments; they are quickly challenged. Even at the end you conclude it is over then it doesn't end. This is the way it is with alternate or parallel realities. It is never over, only different. Pleasing, suspenseful, oddly engaging, totally unbelievable you follow this near 2 hour romp into the Twilight Zone with surprise that makes it all worth the price of a ticket and maybe a copy of it for your own home. Granted, once you know the ending a re-watch just won't be a satisfying, but it is exceptionally well directed and produced. Recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A bewildered army captain must repeatedly engage in simulations in an attempt to avert disaster.,"Overall concept is interesting and the execution was well done enough to keep 8 minutes from being repetitive. I understand the need for goofy science, but it's still a bit clunky for a minute or two. I empathized with the main character's frustration at not being able to learn more about their situation, which kept my attention. I like how the characters were introduced - there were few enough named characters that one could get to know them. Graphics and visuals are good for 2011. Acting seemed okay-to-good (good from lead, okay from some sides). I like the ending; there are many, many inferences one can draw from the final scenes, and they lead to interesting places.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sore code?

Not to mention the fact that according to Hollywood all terrorists and modern evil-doers are white, blue-eyed folks is also getting a little repetitive (watching these movies one has the impression that Al Qaeda, for instance, consists of white, straight, Christian, patriotic, American men...).I would rather wait until they show it on TV, going to a movie theater is a waste of time and money.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Brilliant adaptation of physics to a novelty!!,"Brilliant movie. The theme of the movie was brilliant! The movie was based for more of the emotional and dramatic part than the fiction or the action! It payed off really well at the end! The film throughout the 90 odd minutes carries a deep story-line about a fallen captain!

The movie spends its cinematography mainly in few scenes but they adapt it brilliantly, Again this is not the kind of movie you need your minds wide open when watching, cause that is the biggest mistake you can do when you are watching this film.. But the best thing you can do is to open your heart to the characters and try matching with their thoughts and lines, and see how justifiable they are in their own minds.

Not upto the mark but good,I must say a very promising concept. Its not something we haven't seen earlier but it is a refreshed version. Still I feel Ben Ripley failed to justice with the plot. Duncon Jones has tried to direct it with efficiency but it don't stand to the level it should have gone with the brilliancy in concept. At one point of time I started feeling bored with the repetition of things and going through the same thing again and again without any limit. This is the same thing that happened with Vantage Point. The movie is very good despite of all the facts but it could have gone par limits. Climax will be quite surprising for everyone I guess. But there is no such thing like repeated viewings to understand. The climax was amateur and is left to be on the viewer's interpretation. But it's not at all done with the elegance it was left in Inception for example. Viewers are left confused as no information regarding it has been given and the climax ends as well without explaining things. Anyways I liked the movie as I said but I wish it was more powerful and more vivid.,7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Great movie, ending not so much.","Right from the start this film pulls you in within the first 8 minutes and never lets go. It keeps you thinking on your toes the whole time and I loved it. The only thing that ruined it a little for me was I kind of figured out who the bomber was before the movie hit it's halfway mark, it was more of a hunch but refused to believe it was that easy. After he was revealed I felt a little disappointed but nevertheless it was still a great ride.The acting was top notch, Jake has always been one of my favorite along with Vera Farmiga and Michelle Monaghan, perfect cast. Jeffrey Wright's character made me laugh a bit with his constant twitching when he talked but nothing enough to ruin it.Everything about this movie felt good and it was a smooth ride the whole way through. The only thing that threw me for a loop was the end, at first if they stopped where it made sense then I would have given it a 10 but then something happened that couldn't have happened since he really didn't technically travel back in time he was only reliving the moment from a strangers last 8 minutes, so how could that have any ripple affect on the present? I'll have to watch it again to get a better explanation but really it would have been better if they ended it after Colleen did what she had promised.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
426th Review: Groundhog Day goes Sci-Fi - good film to get you thinking with good thriller elements,"Source Code is one of those films where 40 minutes in your going meh, but by the end you're impressed. The premise is neat, that recreating an event over and over will lead to different results, but it's the mystery elements that carry this - and the human story that evolves that clearly lifts it from other such films.We found ourselves really walking out satisfied - and half-way through it seemed to be just the same scene over and over, but as the film develops it does truly surprise you.All in all, the concept will get you thinking what if, and the plot and the actors will have you engaged and enthralled.

Riddled with inconsistencies,"I like sci-fi, but it has to make sense in its own 'made-up reality' way. Take the Matrix: brilliant because every single twist and turn was neatly tied in, no loose ends, no plot lines that seem to defy the general direction the film is going in. But this, Sourcecode? You don't know if you're coming or going. The film is all over the place, broken chain of causation, contradictory events with no explanation, bits coming out of left field with no prior build up: messy, messy, messy .In other respects, the film is reminiscent of a dreamy ground hog day experience with lots of thrills and knuckle-biting action thrown in. What it could have done without though, was the hurried romance thread which seems to have been added as an afterthought.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Having said that,Source Code relies upon Quantum Mechanics in its storyline.Now Quantum Mechanics,as most people know,is one of the most complicated branches of Science ever.So naturally,the movie goer expects a twisted screenplay. But the biggest factor acting in the movie's favor is its lucid style of storytelling,that keeps the audience hooked to the screens from the first minute of the movie till the end. The movie reminds you of Deja Vu and Vantage Point at places.Especially,the Vantage Point's way of story telling,by replaying the some of the same scenes again and again,and at the same time,revealing some important twists along the way. Although an intense action/sci-fi/mystery thriller,the movie will be loved by men and women,movie buffs and non-movie buffs alike.

Time-bending thriller,"""Suspension of disbelief"". It's an agreement between viewers and the people who take it upon themselves to entertain us. We all know its fake but put that aside for the short time they've asked for our attention. In this latest Jake Gyllenhaal film, that agreement is stretched to its absolute limit and for some, beyond.Gyllenhaal plays army captain Colter Stevens who's suddenly found himself on a train across from woman who keeps referring to him by another name. Additionally, she's talking to him as if she knows him. After a relatively short time the train meets with a catastrophe and Stevens is in a confined area staring up at a monitor being asked to explain the events. Still struggling with memory issues, he's given the assignment, ""find the perpetrator"", and returned to the same situation. This series of events occurs several times in a way that would more likely remind many viewers of Vantage Point, assuming there are many people who saw it. That said, it isn't intent on inspiring a debate on the time traveler's paradox or parallel universes. It's a whodunit adrenaline ride made to entertain and it does just that.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the best action movies I've seen!,"I'm usually very picky with movies; there's very few movies who make it to my favorite list. If a movie I'm watching hasn't impressed me already from the beginning, I easily get restless and in some cases even leave the room. However, Source Code got me completely HOOKED.I decided to watch it since I heard Jake Gyllenhaal was the main character (I've seen what an amazing actor he is from previous movies)but it wasn't Jake who made the movie golden. The actual plot is what caught me off guard and kept me interested. The movie was breathtaking from start until finish, not leaving a single second where I'd feel bored. Even if the amazingly good looking Jake Gyllenhaal himself would've sat next to me while I was watching it, I still wouldn't have taken my eyes off the screen. Such an exciting story with unpredicted scenes and originality. I remember getting frustrated when I could tell that the movie was ending because I just wanted more, hoping that they'll make a sequel to it.It's not a typical action movie where there's tons of explosions and gun shots. Source Code had a certain class to it, holding back unnecessary action with a flawless plot. By making the Source Code the producer killed off the stereotype of action movies. It's quality over quantity in this one and I'm very pleased to have watched it. I hope all other action movies that releases in the future will be as interesting as this one.If you want to have a movie night with your family or friends I suggest this one without any doubt. It has everything in it; the hot guy (how old is Jake now again 'cause you can't tell by that gorgeous face), the pretty girl, the golden story, the perfect ending you wouldn't be able to guess and of course some of that physical action you expected from watching the trailer. I won't give it a 10 because I've seen better movies but I'll still give it 8 for not letting me down and being worth my time. Not a single second of my night was wasted and time well spent is exactly what this movie is about, right?",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Predictable and far from complex yet entertaining!,"While the premise sounds new and does have the potential of becoming very intriguing it sadly never gets past predictability. People like me who love science fiction will immediately recognize the similarities to a show called Quantum Leap. The nod to this wonderful series with Scott Bakula (star of Quantum Leap) playing the father was nice. But at the same time it showed how very flawed the plot of Source Code was. The scene was nice and strong only did feel like a rehash of a scene Scott Bakula had in one of the episodes which was so much better. Throughout the movie I felt it was like a rehash of something which was done before and much better. Not that the movie wasn't entertaining. But it sure lacked the depth and intrigue that could have made it a far more compelling watch.Sure the tech talk might be confusing and maybe will give the impression that it is complex.And it could have been if they added some layers into the story. Only it never does. Well,not in a way that it will surprise you.The acting is decent. Source Code could have used more spectacle though.Now it seemed like a production made for television.And there is nothing wrong with that.But I have seen better ones with more cinematic value that never got the recognition Source Code is having.

"'TWELVE MONKEYS' crossed with 'QUANTUM LEAP', eight minutes at a time!","'SOURCE CODE': Four Stars (Out of Five)Director Duncan Jones follows up his critically acclaimed low budget sci-fi hit 'MOON' with this critically acclaimed low budget sci-fi hit, although the film is more fantasy than science fiction since the science of it is not grounded in reality at all. It stars Jake Gyllenhaal, one of my favorite actors, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright. It was written by Ben Ripley (who's only other film writing experience is in direct to video and TV 'B' movie horror films, like two 'SPECIES' films) and was filmed on a budget of just $35 million. The film tells the story of a soldier who travels into the body of a man killed by a terrorist explosion for the last eight minutes of his life, repeatedly, in hopes of finding information that will prevent the terrorist's next attack. It's sort of like a variation on 'TWELVE MONKEYS' or 'QUANTUM LEAP' (Scott Bakula even has a cameo in the film). While the movie is completely over the top and unbelievable it's still a very well made and entertaining film.Gyllenhaal plays Captain Colter Stevens, a former airman stationed in Afghanistan who, as the movie opens, unexpectedly finds himself in the body of another man sitting on a train. After eight minutes the train blows up and Stevens then comes to in a capsule communicating with another military officer named Carol Goodwin (Farmiga). He discovers he's part of a military program called 'Source Code' and must continue to reenter the man's body for the last eight minutes of his life until he can gather enough information to discover the identity of the terrorist responsible for the explosion and lead authorities to his capture before he strikes again. While doing so he falls in love with another passenger on the train (Monaghan) and becomes obsessed with saving her life even though he's told it's impossible.The story is far-fetched but the characters are involving and believable. While the concept of the film is kind of routine and unoriginal the script is well written in it's details. The performances bring a lot of heart and emotion to the film, especially Gyllenhaal (like always) and Farmiga, and the directing is top notch. In many ways Duncan's two films are very similar in their core. They both deal with a man who unwittingly finds himself the tortured victim of a science experiment meant to serve a greater good. While this film is not quite as clever or interesting as 'MOON' it does match it's strengths in character development and emotional drama. Duncan is definitely a promising up and coming director and I can't wait to see what he does next.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j95Zjdlcbe0",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Why do they do this?,"First of all: why do they, in movies, tend to use wrong terms or combinations of terms just to look cool? When they are sending Colter (Jake Gyllenhaal) into the Source Code they say: ""Charge the drivers."" What the hell does that mean? It just doesn't make any sense.There are so many loopholes in the technology that is supposedly behind this Source Code project. I understand that it is fiction for mere entertainment, but at least try to sell it as if it were possible or at least logical.And then there is the plot itself, which is so simple and shallow that I was never 'in touch' with the characters or why they were acting the way they were. It was easy to predict the questions that were raised, and you can see the last 15 minutes coming from a mile off.The idea was nice, although it consists mostly of pieces put together from other movies, but the execution was just plain off.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"May this suspenseful Sci-Fi lead to more, equally impressive movies.","That time of year - beginning in the month of April - where truly great movies start to emerge is finally upon us, so it's no surprise that I should get exactly what I wanted out of the Sci-Fi/Suspense Source Code.The film stars Jake Gylenhaal as Colter Stevens, a US Army helicopter pilot recruited for a top secret operation known as the Source Code, which enables a person to relive the last eight minutes of a life deceased during a major catastrophe, and used to prevent further foul happenings from taking place. He is repeatedly sent into the scenario of a pre train explosion in the guise of another man to try and piece together the mystery of the bomber, all the while falling in love with a woman (Played by Michelle Monaghan) sitting in the row directly across from him.The film is directed by Duncan Jones, the man behind 2009's intriguing Moon, and he's obviously not a one trick pony. One of the things I love so much about the film is that it reminds me of the sort of film Alfred Hitchcock would have directed, right down to chilly atmosphere and editing, kinetic cinematography (Supplied here by the great Don Burgess), and a ubiquitous musical score which evokes all the tension that Hitchcock's longtime collaborator Bernard Herrmann would extract. Jones is a visually impressive director, and he only does good things for this movie.But the screenplay by Ben Ripley is just as much to thank for how good the movie is. He balances the arks of the characters, the action sequences, and the ever present desire to solve mystery in erect, orderly structure, and offers appropriate opportunities for the cast, specifically that of Gylenhaal, as well as Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga, and Jeffrey Wright, to truly shine and showcase their talent. Just be sure you're keeping your uninterrupted attention on what's happening.The movie is a huge collaborative effort, and as a result, a tense, intelligent film that must not be missed. May Source Code lead to other fantastic works in 2011.*** out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An intelligent thriller.,"Duncan Jones' sophomore directorial effort after the sublime Moon further proves he has a knack for intelligent, emotion-filled sci-fi's. His deft touch with both the action and dramatic scenes shapes Source Code into an edge-of-your-seat thought-provoker which stays with you well after it has finished. Scribe Ben Ripley also deserves credit for his multi-layered script which, although featuring a couple of plot holes for those looking hard enough, pushes the intriguing concept – that you can relive the last eight minutes of someone's life over and over again – past expectations whilst still maintaining a sturdy realism. On screen Jake Gyllenhaal plays Captain Colter Stevens – the man responsible for repeatedly going back through the last few minutes of another man's life to find clues as to who blew up a train – with a nice mix of individuality and dutifulness, smarts and bewilderment. He shares a natural chemistry with both Michelle Monaghan and Vera Farmiga, a victim of the terrorist attack and a fellow Army officer respectively, who are both outstanding in their own right. The trio invest the story with a believability required and subsequently give the moral questions posed a higher level of poignancy. I've always appreciated a thoughtful thriller and Source Code ranks among the best in this category. 4 out of 5",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Good, old-fashioned sci-fi thriller hokum. Go for it","Many of the objections cited here against various films, which invariably begin with the claim that 'this is 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back', baffle me. Those involved in filmmaking do so for any number of reasons ranging from the purely commercial to artistic and political, and however good or bad one thinks a film is, it is almost always very obvious why a particular film was made. And usually it is to attract a fee-paying public to cough up the readies to, naturally, cover all production costs and then turn a handsome profit. Source Code, billed as a sci-fi thriller, is one such film. But a great many user reviews on this website lambast it for 'poor science' and using various computer terms misleadingly. Well, what on earth were they expecting from a film? What did they make of the Star Wars series, of The Day After Tomorrow, Independence Day, Jurassic Park and any number of other films which deal, ever so superficially, science? So please don't be put off by some of the criticisms here. Source Code is a rollicking, very entertaining, intriguing and exciting film. No more, no less. It makes no grand statement, doesn't take itself too seriously, keeps you watching, includes loads of quite daft science, has a touching, though quite slight, romantic angle, and for my money is worth the time of anyone who would like to relax watching a well-made, entertaining film. Don't listen to the harping critics, sit down and watch this. You won't be a 'better person' afterwards, you won't have altered your political views, you won't be in tears, and you most definitely won't have learnt a little more science, but you will have enjoyed a great piece of sci-fi thriller hokum.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Just another flick to me,"This is a movie about data extraction from the human mind. When a person goes into a coma (for example), technology and professionals use a technique to gather information from a person who is unable to communicate. The information is gathered through tapping into the mind, to communicate with the mind of the person. A simulated world is created for the subject to walk around in and interact with (think of it like Avatar, but for people who are physically disabled throughout the entire body, except their mind). Then, the person has to accomplish some goal, because doing so is the only way their mind can communicate with the extractors. This is in part because they barely remember anything. So the problem solving, ends with a solution that is actually what the mind was trying to tell the extractors.But, it was just a decent movie to me. The ending is anticlimactic. It was also trying to have a twist, but for the wrong reasons. The writer was trying to be cute, rather than entertaining. The movie is kind of another ""protagonist reliving the same day over and over until they do something right"" story. It was like the writer realized that it actually wasn't too unique after all, so they tried to make the ending bizarre. It just came across as an awkward movie. I think this could have been better.

In his second film, Duncan Jones gives his characters a new dimension : the characters really stands, with more profound personalities. There is a better balance between the science-fiction plot and the emotional plot. To support this idea of a 2-axis film, it is interesting to observe that ""Source Code"" has two endings : the climax of the human emotions (son-father relation, and love), followed by the termination of science-fiction machine.Technically, ""Source Code"" is very good. The special effects are not overly present, and are serving the film purpose well. Nevertheless, the art direction is rather impersonal and it would be difficult to identify the film by its photography only. Jake Gyllenhaal is acting well (much better than in Brokeback Montain) and the supporting actresses (Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga) are convincing.This was a very enjoyable movie, and I am looking forward for Jones' next movie.

Move Thee Reviews: Just Lie Back and Enjoy the Thrilling Ride,"Director Duncan Jones (Moon) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain) draw me to Source Code, a sci-fi thriller about a soldier Colter who wakes up on a train and discovers he's part of a military program that enables him to return to the train as another man in the parallel reality. His mission is to uncover the identity of the terrorist who bombs the train in 8 minutes.Source Code is a fast-paced, tightly-plotted and gripping movie with adrenaline-pumping suspense, touching moments and surprising twists. Although similar events are shown over and over again, more and more conspiracies, secrets and twists are revealed each time Colter is transported back and forth between the train and the high-tech isolation unit. Thanks to Paul Hirsch's deft editing and the 8-minute time limit which adds urgency to the mission, our attention is held from beginning to end.What would you do if you knew you only had one minute to live? Christina would make those seconds count and Colter would kiss her again. The message of the movie is that we should make good use of every second of our lives so that we have no regrets. I am touched by Colter's telephone conversation with his Dad and his attempt to save everybody in the last ride.The movie is not flawless. First, not every idea makes sense when you think back. For instance, where is Sean's soul in the end? Second, the love between Colter and Christina can be further developed. For example, at which moment and why does Colter start to fancy Christina? Besides, Christina may not truly love Colter, which makes the ending less touching. Third, it is unlikely for Goodwin, an army officer, to help Colter. She may risk life imprisonment.Perhaps it's time to stop thinking too much.

There's heart and intelligence in this highly recommended sci fi action thriller,"This thing about alternate realities has been making us think a lot these days. Concepts of time loop and multiple worlds have left us mystified, if not perplexed, about the possibilities of another one (or even many) of us existing in another space. And what better devices than science fiction thriller movies could we turn to, to explore these beguiling ideas? After the success of his debut feature Moon (2009), English director Duncan Jones is back to impress us with another engaging production that will leave you wondering about the existence of another you in another time frame.Instead of a one man show (you have to admit that having Sam Rockwell as the one and only cast member in Moon was an ingenious move), Jones has an ensemble to work with this time. The story's protagonist is a helicopter pilot whose last memory is a flying assignment in Afghanistan. He suddenly finds himself in a commuter train and has assumed the identity of another man. Eight minutes later, the train explodes and he finds himself in a pod. It is then revealed that to prevent an impending bomb blast, he has to go back in time to relive those eight minutes repeatedly until he finds out the identity of the bomber.Wasting no time to explain unnecessary details, the thriller plunges into the action from the very first scene. With a screenplay written by Ben Ripley, Jones (also known as the son of rock star David Bowie) has managed to deliver another action thriller that entertains, without leaving the viewers feeling dim witted. The concept of this mode of time travel is fascinating enough to compel audiences – it's no walk in the park like 1993's Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray, as our hero is fighting against time to prevent another tragedy from happening. As absurdly outrageous as the plot may sound, the movie still makes you go along for the ride.One main reason why you'd have your eyes glued to the screen is male lead Jake Gyllenhaal's on screen charisma. After his somewhat lackluster performances in 2010's Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and Love and Other Drugs, Gyllenhaal wants to let you know that he is back in form. Here, he is a man who is on an urgent quest, one that showcases the handsome star's ability to capture your attention. His commendable performance is complemented by the pleasant looking Michelle Monaghan (Due Date) as a fellow train passenger, the ever reliable Jeffrey Wright (Quantum of Solace) as a scientist with a motive, and Oscar nominee Vera Farmiga (Up in the Air) as an air force captain, who manages to shine despite her role's limited scope to stand out.The film has also managed to avoid the trap of being drearily long. Its very serviceable runtime of 93 minutes is enough to leave an impact with your mind. Viewers who are familiar with how the average science fiction or action movies tell their stories will be pleased with how the last third of the film plays out. When the end credits begin rolling, you will be awed by the cleverly inventive script. Without giving away too much, you may also find yourself appreciating how scientific concepts of alternate realities and time travel are essentially humane in nature.www.moviexclusive.com",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Source Code,"Source Code follows a soldier, Colter Stevens, (Jake Gyllenhaal) who awakens to find himself on a train heading for Chicago. After talking to the stranger opposite him, Christina (Michelle Monaghan) who seems to know him well, he goes to the bathroom and standing in front of a mirror sees another person staring back at him. As we think about what on earth is going on, the train suddenly blows up and he wakes up, again disorientated, to another scenario. Leaving all those questions unanswered, it kind of drags you in! Now within a dark room we find he is linked to a program, the source code, that uses shadows of peoples memories to relive the last 8 minutes of their lives. Goodwin (Vera Farmiga), a sympathetic operator of the source code sets him the task of finding the train bomber so that other attacks that have been planned later in the day can be stopped before they occur.When I watched this movie, I thought that it was going to be solely the whodunit mystery revolving around the train and the identity of the bomber. However this is not quite the case as Colter finds himself unsure of his surroundings while not in the source code. This leads to the viewer having two riddles to solve- on the one hand who is the bomber and on the other the mystery behind who has put him into the source code and why is he there. I feel this puzzle within a puzzle adds to the excitement giving the movie several levels to work on.The one thing that this movie had to contend with is the potential for there to be large scenes of repetition whilst Colter is on the train reliving the same moments again and again. This is well handled with enough variety that you become more intrigued by what he is going to do next and start demanding that he pick on a particular character that you have had your eye on for a while rather than the one he is currently investigating.The movie is well acted with Gyllenhaal in particular putting in another strong performance to follow up his one in Love and Other Drugs with the relationship factor once again playing a strong part in his role in the movie. In general though the acting is impressive and I look forward to Duncan Jones (son of David Bowie wouldn't ya know!) next foray into the movie world because after this and Moon he has a lot of pressure to deliver something exceptional.The only slight issue I have with this movie is something I can't really talk about until you have watched it. So all I will say is this- I was not a great fan of the way things ended.Source Code looked like it was heading for a good haul before it was released and it does not fail to disappoint. I was never falling off my chair in anticipation but it is a cleverly thought out plot that is executed well with good CGI, acting, music and enough mystery to pull you through to the end. Not a classic but a very good watch none the less.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Source code? Author needs to work on basics,"Is source code cloud computing?.Movie uses 1)processing power of colter, 2)8 minutes memory of a victim and 3)a software to run these "" the source code"". I think the director could have got more memory instead of opting for free 8 minutes trial version. May be he wasn't sure if it would sell Instead of Jake, the processing power could also be outsourced to an Indian company. That would be a cost saver and definitely better performer. Instead of SW source code they could run "" April fool"" but it is already may. Also there has been quiet a bit of illogical stuff happening here and there. For example, the hero is in the memory of someone who is dead. But how can he do stuff which the dead hasn't done. I guess like in i ROBOT there is a limit of a dead mind. You can access the stored information but not create something new saying parallel universe. If I can imagine something, that does not create a parallel universe. If u alter an event in past or future only then a parallel one is created",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
As good as Inception,"I don't know if I'm the only one to make this comparison, but I can't avoid that.Both movies has no unnecessary introduction or explications, just throws the watcher in the middle of storyline. The only important thing is what happens from that point on.My only complaint is about the end. As I don't like happy endings much, and this is only reason to do not vote a 10. The movie could have been finished a more intriguing way, but the ending is not bad, it just does not satisfies me.In last hand, Source Code was the first movie after Inception that had my full attention every second.

well worth while,"Finally a movie worth writing a comment about. It was original and not some three minute remake of an existing movie or a cookie cutter piece of crap. I like the suspense and a cast of unfamiliar faces that doesn't have you thinking of the last movie you saw that super famous type cast actor in. Keeping the how and what of everything that happened before the opening scene makes for a good way stay interested in this film. This movie had that 12 monkey's feel to it but very different.

Mind-blowing movie,"First of all, when I first watched the trailer of the movie I liked it and I had high expectations about it. Eventually, it was as good as I had imagined and I enjoyed it. The plot of the movie was interesting, mysterious and innovative. The storyline was kinda well-written, but it was very complicated sometimes and it wasn't easy to understand what was going on. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and likeable. The filming location of the movie was only one, inside the train. The casting of the movie was nice and their performances were great. In my opinion, it was a very intense movie and there were many shocking moments. However, there weren't many action-filled scenes. The opening scene was very promising and definitely enjoyable. The ending scene was kinda unpredictable, but it wasn't very well-explained. Overall, ""Source Code"" was a nice film, intense and kinda complicated, but I would definitely recommend it to my friends! Last but not least, that movie probably deserves a sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
ground hog day goes sci-fi,"This movie was OK, but I'm not a big fan of sci-fi movies because they have too many plot holes. Basically, a military guy, Colter, keeps reliving the same 8 minutes over and over trying to find a bomber on a train. So after you see the third reenactment, it starts to get old. I will say most of the movie did make sense and it wasn't filled with plot holes. But the ending, I didn't get, that's where the plot holes come in. Was it an alternate world Colton was living in? If so, how did the lady get the text whom was in ""normal"" world?I did like the explanation the movie gave of how this was all possible and the state of Colter's body. It seemed plausible in the future.FINAL VERDICT: OK, I recommend it if you like sci-fi movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Plot holes,"I am sure I am in the minority, but I can't help but look beyond the surface to determine if there are any plot-holes. And there are. Now, I accept the movie's main premise (hey, that is what sci-fi's are about) but beyond that premise there are paradoxes.One thing I DID like about the movie was that it really was not an action movie. It had about 5 minutes of action and the rest was dialogue. I think 'action' is incorrectly describing this movie.The acting is good. If you like sci-fi, like your imagination to run a little wild, and don't mind plot-holes, this movie is for you.If plot-holes (i.e., inexplicable parts while allowing the main premises) bother you, then you might leave disappointed.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"This Decade's ""Minority Report"" is Here...","When I saw the trailer for ""Source Code"", I immediately thought ""this looks like it could be really awesome or really dumb"". I was kind of leaning towards dumb because there aren't many sci-fi thrillers that are good these days. So I held off on renting it. But I finally did because I saw the trailer again and was like, ""you know what, I'm going to watch ""Source Code"" finally"". And I'm glad I did.The plot of ""Source Code"" involves Captain Colter Stevens (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) being abducted by a government project so he can go back in time into the body of another man to stop a terrorist from blowing up a Chicago train. I have to say, this premise always sounded really cool. Anything involving time travel in any way shape or form is always a good thing. But the cool thing about ""Source Code"" is, as it's said in the film, it's not time travel, it's time reassignment. It isn't explained too well and I have a hard enough time trying to think about it as I'm writing this, but when you're watching the film, you understand, and that's really what matters. This isn't a time travel film you should go all sciencey on. It's just meant to give you a basic explanation for how the premise of this movie can even work.Acting is good. Nothing Oscar worthy, but good performances none the less. Jake Gyllenhaal is very good as Colter. He brings a lot of frantic and chaotic energy to the screen. Colter is a very believable character. You sympathize with this guy and you really believe him. It kind of reminds me of Bruce Willis' performance in the original ""Die Hard"". Even though he's in this ridiculous situation, he's still making wise-ass jokes and being smart. It's a really enjoyable performance that really shows how diverse an actor Jake Gyllenhaal really is.Michelle Monaghan plays Christine, Colter's love interest. Her character isn't that developed since we hear a lot of the same facts about her repeatedly, but overall she's a decent character. I didn't think she was there for much, except so that the ending of the film could even happen. But I'll get to that later.I like how small the scale of this movie is. Overall, there are three main sets; the capsule that Colter is stuck in, the headquarters for Source Code, and the train. You get associated with these areas real fast, and it kind of helps to put you in Colter's shoes. You're just seeing the same stuff over and over again. You already know where everything is, what's going to happen and how it will happen, but each trip is a little different.The final half an hour of the film is excellent. This is where Jake Gyllenhaal's acting skills are really spotlighted. He practically has this whole last half hour to show off what he can do. We get to see a cocky Colter, an emotional Colter, and a romantic Colter. We get to see all sides to this character in the span of this hour and a half film, and that's what makes him so believable.The ending is interesting. I'm not going to spoil it but I'll put my feelings out there. I think it was the right move, story wise, but I think it wasn't executed the best. It's still good, but I think the real thing that kills it is the lack of emotion in Jake Gyllenhaal's final narration. Especially because this ending is emotional. Overall, I think ""Source Code"" was very enjoyable. While not the most thrilling of movies and definitely not at all action-packed, ""Source Code"" will make your mind think. A lot of people might not get it, and a lot might think it was very generic, and I could see why. So I say, at least watch ""Source Code"". You may be surprised.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very Creative. Good Thriller,"Captain Stevens (Gyllenhaal) wakes up on a train and discovers he is in someone else's body, and he has a mission to find out who the bomber is.Remember Ground Hog Day? Avatar? Well, it's like them almostsomewhat...kinda. Stevens has to keep going back in time until he finds out who the bomber is.Just enjoy this and don't try to figure out how the Source Code interacts with things. It's like one of those time travel stories that you can never follow anyway. Accept it. Actually, that is all you can do because the explanation of the Source Code is lacking or I missed it. Oh, you get bits and pieces of the Source Code and who runs the operation, but the logistics of it is just not there for us to grasp. You understand about the 8-minutes of someone's life in that Stevens has 8-minutes to find the bomber each time he goes back in time. But, this concept is very creative and we are exposed, in theory, to multiple realities. (What you talking about, Willis?) Ah, so you were paying attention. You'll see when you come to the end of the story. Great ending btw.The acting by all, the dialogue, cinematography, and CGI make this very enjoyable. Good thriller.Vilolence: Yes.

An Interesting and Unique Thriller,"You have eight minutes to prevent the world from ending, but you have no idea where you are or why this huge responsibility is in your hands. What in the world do you do? Captain Colter Stevens is faced with this harrowing question and many more, and you'll find yourself looking for the answers with him in Source Code.I think you'd be surprised to here that Source Code is a movie for everybody. If you're looking for action, Source Code is your movie, it seems like there's an explosion just about every eight minutes. (you liked that didn't you?)If you're looking for a movie that'll make you think, Source Code is without a doubt your movie. But you don't HAVE to think during Source Code, I think it's safe to say you can have a below average IQ and still enjoy it unlike other sci-fi thrillers like Inception.When asked what Source Code's weakness is though, I'd have to say it really struggles with depth. Not only is there really no emotion in any of the characters, other then Gylenhall's, the film has a hard time helping us understand the characters at all. We touch bases with why the villain is doing what he/she is doing, but as interesting as it all sounds, we never truly understand him/her. To me, it's almost like Source Code decided to skip over this as if it was unimportant. And that same thing goes for all of the characters, not just the villain. A lot of the time you'll be asking yourself, why is this character doing this? Why don't they do this instead? So I guess what I'm saying is that in the end, the writing for Source Code is mediocre. It has it's high points but most of the time, it wasn't very good. It's an interesting premise and I can see were the writers were trying to get at with the main character and the villain and the plot in general, but it feels like it never really got there.The good news is, there were a lot of things that bailed the writing out. Duncan Jones, the director of Moon, is great and I think he did a good job dealing with the bigger budget. He showed me that he can direct those big action sequences just as well as anybody out there. The cast also did a great job with what they were given. Jake Gylenhall has clearly come a long way since Donnie Darko. His haunting performance in Brothers stands out as one of his best ever. I think he did a great job portraying Colter Stevens in Source Code, but that he could have come away with an even better performance if he was faced with a character with a little more depth. The music was not what I expected and at first I didn't know how it was going to work with the film but it ended up making a lot of situations more intense and more emotional then they would have been without it.In the end, there's no reason to be tough on Source Code. It's a very enjoyable, fast paced film and anyone can enjoy it. I was surprised that I had such a good time while watching it and I didn't regret picking it over Fast Five this weekend. Oh, and I was genuinely surprised that the movie went along without Gylenhall having to take his shirt off. . . sorry ladies!***/*****",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Overrated,"This movie is just okay. I don't get all the platitudes that all these reviews are giving it.The movie has an engaging start. You start to wonder what the story actually is. But as it goes on, it becomes worse and worse. Jake Gyllenhaal does a great job, but the rest of the cast are average at best. Specially the evil Dr. Which keeps talking about ""the source code"" (read with plenty of suspense). It seemed as though the writers had a rough idea but they clearly could not wrap it up nicely.

Thoroughly enjoyable entertainment,"Imagine a film that was a cross between ""Inception"" , ""De ja Vu "" and "" Groundhog Day"" and you will get Source Code and what a cracking little movie this is.There has been quite dirge of SciFi thrillers in the last 12 months and most have been really good , so Source Code had a lot to live up to and live up to it does.Jake Gyllenhaal plays a helicopter pilot who wakes up to find he is thrust into a situation where he has to find a bomber of a train heading to Chicago. he has 8 minutes to find the bomber but not just the single 8 minutes because somehow he is being thrust back in time to do the job of saving countless lives.Confused ? You wont be when you watch this because this flick moves along a really fast pace from the moment it starts and unlike Inception , you don't finish the film scratching your head wondering what the hell just happened.Gyllenhaal is superb , as is Christina Warren , the only one letting the side down is Jeffrey Wright , who plays Dr. Rutledge .

Lots of brains translates to an overall great film,"My faith has been restored that great movies will come out in 2011. Source Code is a highly original and fantastically well structured film from the director of the hidden 2009 gem, Moon, which to anybody who hasn't seen it, they are missing out on a major feat in science fiction as an art form. But Source Code is something entirely different. Our protagonist is Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) who wakes up on a train and doesn't know who he is or how he got there. He tries to make sense of all of his surroundings and just as he gets oriented the train explodes when a bomb goes off. Flash to a dark undisclosed location and Colter now finds himself waking up from something like a dream while a woman talks to him from a monitor screen. Colter quickly learns that he is part of a military project called source code which allows him to relive the last eight minutes of the life of one of the passengers. Through this technology Colter is supposed to find the bomb and the bomber in order to prevent a second attack. Plenty of other intriguing subplots develop and the film has a lot to offer, spanning a wide field of socio-political issues. The movie is smart, fun and even a little emotional.This is a surprisingly quiet film for something that is, in a way, categorized as an action film. But is more of an art film action flick that is significantly smarter than your average film of this nature. The story is very involved and there is a lot going on, and a lot to keep up with if you want to get the full effect from the film. The film impressively is able to please the simpler of movie goers with its suspense and action, while also appeasing the crowd that is looking for more thinking than just an hour and a half of escapism. Thus the film, for me, kept my brain working and my eyes glued to the screen, anticipating where exactly the film would lead. I can be easy to tell where some of the bigger aspects of the film are headed, but there are many different smaller parts of the film where you can't be too sure of how exactly it is going to unfold. Because of this I was very satisfied by the end of the film when everything was resolved excellently, while still leaving enough unanswered questions to keep the mind juices flowing. In a nutshell, this movie is smart.Ben Ripley, in his feature film debut as a writer does an excellent job on the script here. I wouldn't say it is the highlight of the film, but really there is nothing inherently wrong with any of the dialouge or any of the characters. The character of Colter has some great moments and there is some very well written dialouge between him and the various characters he interacts with. He plays a fairly existential role as the film explores the out of body, out of mind experience and gives it a sci-fi twist with the source code explanation. But he is a character who has to play a part in almost two separate realities simultaneously as he constantly jumps back and forth between the train and where the military is holding him in order to conduct the source code project. It is very interesting to watch how these two entirely different locations create this fascinating story, and it all fits together so well.Source Code is one of the best of the year so far, and with the next month or so's lineup for movies, I think it will stay that way, I'm sad to say. But it is OK because Source Code is an excellent film with a lot of brains, and plenty of flare to stay interesting. The story never falters and it never wastes time with any useless subplots. Every little thing plays a role in bringing the story to an excellent close, and overall an incredible story is woven, and everything is executed just right. It can be a little slow at times, but the film is fairly low key overall, except for a few moments. This film doesn't pack too dramatic of a punch, but it is simply just a good film that was made very well and provided for a much higher level film experience than what I normally receive on a trip to the theater.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's Deja-Vu All Over Again!,"Considering the strength of Zowie Bowie (AKA Duncan Jones)'s previous endeavours, this movie was something of a disappointment.The plot struck me as something of a patchwork knitted together from the ideas of other (better) movies. I'm quite surprised by how much material is rehashed here, most notably from the Tony Scott film 'Deja-Vu', which features an almost identical plot device.There are also elements lifted from features like 'Twelve Monkeys' and 'The Jacket' and 2008's 'Vantage Point' which, while not necessarily better movies, can at least hold their heads high in the non-plagiarism stakes.At any rate, if you can get over the sheer lack of inventiveness in the script, the movie has some mildly entertaining action scenes (well, a single action scene shown repeatedly), and some decent acting.All in all I didn't hate this movie, but it's quite depressing to see someone who was briefly shaping up to be a unique talent and a fresh voice in the Hollywood movie scene, simply decide to churn out a quite lazy and above all safe piece of movie making.

excellent!,"This movie was a top-notch thriller, and I'm glad I saw it.

He's even more puzzled when he looks in a bathroom mirror and sees a different face. It seems that he's part of a military experiment to investigate the fact that this train is about to blow up as part of a massive terrorist conspiracy, after which he will wake up in a pod-like interior, where he can communicate with other military officials. He can be sent back a bunch of other times to pick up more clues, but the catch is that he can only be sent back for eight minutes at a time due to constraints. I found elements of such movies as ""Minority Report,"" ""Back to the Future,"" and ""Groundhog Day"" in this film. I loved it and guarantee you will too.

Riveting - A unique story,"Ladies and Gentleman ... Duncan Jones .... once again.After creating a beautiful movie like 'Moon' Duncan has done it again. Albeit the story wasn't written by him this time (Ben Ripley wrote it), his direction was just brilliant. A story like Source Code needed a director like him eh! and of course great actors like Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga. Jeffrey Wright, Michael Arden and Russell Peters did their bit in the flick.Source code had more than a brilliant story to offer. It had both action and drama intermingled and must I say it proved to be a pretty good fest altogether. Jake Gyllenhaal is getting better day by day, whoa he was already good wasn't he since his teen years (Donnie Darko and October Sky still rule). With great movies like The Day after tomorrow, Brokeback mountain, Jarhead, Zodiac, Rendition, Brothers, Prince of Persia and Love and other drugs, he has another thriller to his name – Source Code where he Is the protagonist once again.In the movie he poses as a soldier who wakes up to find himself a part of a mission wherein he is supposed to find a bomber who is going to strike again as is told to him by Vera Farmiga. Source Code enables him to take someone else's identity and revisit those 8 minutes just before the train is brought to splinters by the bomb. No matter how many times he dies he is supposed to find the bomber and the bomb. The question is can he do it?Watch the flick for yourself because it's an action packed thriller which would definitely rivet you to your seats till the end.

A simple thriller with no mental stimulation,"I am not reviewing this, because I hated the movie so much, I am reviewing it for the sake of people like me, who were fooled into thinking that this one was somewhere on the level of Inception or any such similar movies, thus looking forward to a food and movie night and just ended up in bitter disappointment.If you are expecting a simple ""time travel"" action thriller, you are partly gonna get your money's worth, but don't expect this one to be great and mind boggling. It's not a movie you ponder for days, it's a movie you forget in hours.It is my fault, since my last 2 viewings were Primer and The machinist (which is a stunning movie if interpreted right), so I had very high expectations....I did think that a 7.5 rating warranted it, but sadly not.The plot is predictable, the ""time travel"" theories have no real depth, the ending is classic Hollywood, while the real shockers of this movie are the 2 actors. Not going to say which...you figure it out. I mean really shocking. In The machinist I was watching the amazing Christian Bale and in this one I was practically gritting my teeth together because of the acting...I heard someone comparing this to Inception. Please don't be fooled. Although Inception may be boring for some at some points, this one does not even get close. I mean come on...Inception had Leonardo in it...it's in another league, trust me.I usually agree with IMDb ratings, but this one really missed it.

Well Crafted Thriller,"SOURCE CODE has an element that is lacking in too many of the Hollywood CGI sci-fi experimental movies that are so very cloned these day - humanity. Much of the credit for this quality comes from the intelligent and imaginative writing of Ben Ripley and the tight direction by Duncan Jones, but the main reason this film works so well is the presence of charismatic and fine acting by Jake Gyllenhaal.The story borders on the obtuse: a device has been invented by Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) that can maintain a person in a state of recall much the way a light bulb has a glow after it has been extinguished. Rutledge has placed helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is missing in action in Afghanistan, in a capsule that is capable, under the direction of military officer Goodwin (Vera Farmiga), of projecting Stevens onto a train entering Chicago that has been planted with a bomb in order to discover the perpetrator who is apparently planning another bomb that will decimate the city of Chicago. It is a back and forth series of 8 minute exercises, each time Stevens relives the moments before a bomb detonation and gradually learns the the device and its owner. On board the train he meets Christina (Michelle Monaghan) who 'sees' Stevens as her boyfriend Sean and during these repeat flashbacks Stevens and Christina form a bond that makes Stevens re-think his 'purpose' in this military gimmicky.*In the hands of the wrong people this little venture would seem trite and silly, but with this crew of creators it becomes a puzzle that touches on tension, fear, humor, and warmth. That is what a superb cast can do with any material, but with this particular strange tale it works perfectly.Grady Harp",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Awful,"Worst film I have seen in years, it was £3 and not worth that. It's tedious, mind numbingly obvious, shallow and boring. Small characters, no development, no resolution, nothing to be learned from this waste of time.For a very similar film with some substance I would recommend Inception. It's marginally less tedious.This film has clearly received a high rating as its focused almost entirely on a single character as per films such as gran Torino, which apparently makes a film clever.Gladly I took it back and replaced it, because I fancied a drive, otherwise it would have been snapped and binned, rubbish.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Sci-Fi Thriller,"Source Code is a grabber of a premise, and Gyllenhaal is well cast as the unprepared observer trying to understand what's happened to him (the last thing he knew, he was flying a helicopter in Afghanistan) while being forced to repeat those same eight minutes over and over. Eventually, he decides to deviate from the program and try to save the life of a fellow passenger (Michelle Monaghan), even though she's already died in the bombing.Source Code's themes are similar to those in director Duncan Jones's previous film, Moon, and it has many of the same flaws: once again, he lays out the clues to key plot points so laboriously that we can figure them out ahead of the characters, and the naive existentialism falls apart if you think about it for any length of time. It is a film in which you must pay attention to properly understand the concept.It's watchable in spite of itself, and Gyllenhaal and Monaghan are great together. Source Code delivers the necessary thrills and suspense one would look to enjoy in a thriller. Although the film moves pretty quickly making the time go by rapid. It could have been a little longer in length. ==================================================================== ====== 
After a rewatch (03/01/17'), this film is more than great this time around. There are more subliminals and I had a better understanding of the film's concept in whole this time around. Source Code is a well crafted thriller and the short runtime (1hr, 33mins) works quite well in its favor. It allows every moment to be crucial and everything happening is quite important as the film doesn't drag or include any unnecessary or unwanted subplots that we are used to seeing in other films like this. The cast is great and everything is well connected in the end. Source Code reminded more of Edge of Tomorrow in a sense, as well as Unknown with Liam Neeson. Overall, this film is one of the greatest sci-fi films of this decade and is highly recommended, rating change to 9/10. On another rewatch 09/02/18' Source Code remains fresh and intriguing on multiple watches. Highly recommend for those still in the dark having not seen this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Conceptualized Looping,"Rewatch Review:
Watching this film for the first time(it feels like so) after a decade of its release and it still feels fresh to me mainly because of its concept which feels almost like an extension of The Matrix and the interjection of the Vantage Point. Both are great movies and a separate movie with a flavour of both feels like really a good watch but somehow or maybe because I've watched it after a decade, it felt like a usual movie to me, although it entertained me a little bit.OLD Review:
One of the good movie based on the Looping concept. Watched it with a huge expectation after reading some spoilers hence was not a big surprise to me except a few tid bits.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Source Code Review,"Until halfway mark everything seems pretty confusing, not on an Inception level, but it makes the viewer a little uneasy for not understanding much. The repetitions also seem a little pointless at first, but then you get used to it. The plot doesn't have many twists, but the story and the characters end up holding the audience for 95 minutes.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Source Code - 4.5 Stars,"Colter Stevens wakes up in a Chicago commuter train, and he's very confused. He can't remember how he got there, and he has no idea why the pretty lady across him keeps calling him ""Sean."" Colter goes to the comfort room and sees not his face when he looks at the mirror. When it seems that things couldn't get any worse for dear Colter, the train explodes. How frustrating.Here's what you need to know. Colter Stevens is a man on a mission, it turns out, and he must identify the bomber of the train he was in so a larger explosion could be prevented. But this is not an ordinary mission, because the military has developed a computer program, or something, called Source Code. With the help of this device, Colter will have multiple attempts at his mission, but each attempt will only be eight minutes long. Because we may never arrive at an actual review of this film if I try to explain the plot even further, for now, that's all you need to know.""Source Code"" begins like a lot mystery/thrillers. We are introduced to the Hero, the Mystery, the Threat, and the Goal. Here, our Hero is Colter Stevens. The Mystery is the identity of the train's bomber. The Threat is the possibility of a much bigger explosion, while the Goal is to prevent that explosion. Even with its stimulating sci-fi twist, ""Source Code"" could have been a failure if it followed the formula of its genre. Watching ""Source Code"" could have felt, what's a good word to use here, repetitive, if it wasn't for the guidance, heart, and skill of director Duncan Jones, the man who was also in charge of making, ""Moon.""Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/source-code-movie-review/",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better Than It Should Be Thriller,"Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up on a passenger train. He is confused and disorientated as the woman across from him engages him in conversation. How did he get here? Why can't he remember anything? Why isn't he with his battalion in Afghanistan? These questions abound in his head when an explosion is heard and the train car explodes killing all on board.After the explosion, Captain Stevens wakes up in some sort of simulation chamber. He is strapped to a chair and a small video screen appears where Mission Controller Carol Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) calmly requests that he recalls the incidents on the train leading up to the explosion. Stevens learns that he is part of a military scientific experiment wherein they can insert a consciousness into another body in the past for a span of 8 minutes. Stevens has assumed the body of a non-descript school teacher and he is continually sent back in time (much to his frustration) with the mission of determining who triggered the bomb so that future lives can be saved.We then sit back and get a mix of Minority Report meets Memento meets Groundhog Day as Captain Stevens continually travels back and encounters repeated behaviors from the passengers in an attempt to extract clues that will lead present day authorities to the bomber's capture.Upon his return visits, Captain Stevens is distracted by two involving yet distracting sub-plots. The first involves a budding relationship with Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) – a fellow passenger on the train. There is little chemistry to be compounded in 8-minute intervals, but Christina's involvement in the investigation will be paramount leading to the eventual climax.The second diversion comes with the Captain's attempts to determine his own fate. Why is he here? Did he volunteer? Why doesn't he have any recollection of the events leading up to his cooperation in the operation? Is he dead? These questions will impede his focus on the tasks at hand and cause for much confusion and stress between the Captain and the commanders running the operation (code named Beleaguered Castle).Sharply scripted by Ben Ripley (Species III) and efficiently directed by Duncan Jones (Moon), Source Code is better than it should be thanks to the combined efforts of the believable cast and the tension of a reducing timeframe in order to identify the terrorist.Dead ends do occur, but they are plausible actions taken in a live game of Clue where one query or investigation may lead to the exclusion of a potential threat. Gyllenhaal steps into a role that would likely have been cast to Harrison Ford circa 1991 and he does his best to help us forget that it's the Prince of Persia himself trying to help solve a case that will save millions of lives.The final chapters of Source Code are Inception-ish in that the ending can be argued for interpretation. Whether the laws of science and science fiction could be altered in a Twilight Zone finale might leave some groaning in non-acceptance. Add to that a few plot holes (one involving a gun) that just didn't make sense based on the parameters set by the premise, and the movie just fails to meet the mark of 'excellence' and has to settle for 'very good'.But that shouldn't dissuade anyone from enjoying an enjoyable film that can make rehashed scenes still feel new and exciting. There is some good action intertwined with an intelligent script that doesn't talk down to its audience as he barrels its way down the tracks.www.killerreviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
One of the greatest movies ever!,"Honestly, I can never get sick of this movie no matter how many times i watch it. The acting is on point, especially Jake's , and you can feel their emotions radiating from the scenes. The talk with his dad never fails to make me cry. I must say this is probaby one of my favourite movies of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
