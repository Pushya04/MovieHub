An incredibly complex work and one of 06's finest...,"The Good Shepherd 3.5/4 4/5The Good Shepherd is an incredibly complex work and one of the finest films of a quality ripe 2006. Oscar winner Eric Roth continues his brilliant work with this original screenplay, named one of the best unproduced scripts in Hollywood in the late 90's. A film about one of the CIA's founding officers isn't a dream project commercially for a studio but thankfully, the quality of the script was too great to ignore.Shepherd follows the life of Edward Wilson (Damon) through his college years at Yale to his ascension as one of the CIA's founding officers and trusted veterans. His extraordinary dedication to his work comes with an unbearable price as he must sacrifice his family to protect his country. At one point in the film, Wilson faces an enormous choice- does he abandon his ideals for what he believes is right? Would this abandonment render his life, almost solely devoted to his country, meaningless? This, as well as a depiction of the result of Wilson's decision, are just two of the moments of brilliance in The Good Shepherd.Wilson inhabits a world of betrayal and secrecies only enhancing the irony of the biblical quote inscribed on the CIA's wall- ""And ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free"". While we are given a glimpse into the life of a younger, more vital Wilson, the world he occupies creates the characteristically stolid, humorless man we come to know.With its vast emotional core, the film seemingly effortlessly navigates one of the most volatile periods in the history of American intelligence while remaining character based. At 165 minutes, it is overlong but remains engaging for the vast majority of its running time. Had a few relatively insignificant scenes been cut, Shepherd could have retained the thrilling and energetic pace it often possesses. However, the length is justifiable as the scope of the film is incredibly large and very few scenes can be deemed unnecessary or dull.Robert DeNiro's direction far exceeds that in his debut, 1993's ""A Bronx Tale"". Normally portrayed as a brute, here, DeNiro assuredly handles every moment with an innate tenderness we rarely see in his work. He appropriately treats Shepherd with a precise attention to detail often attributed to some of the greatest directors of our time.A silently haunting Matt Damon carries the film on his shoulders. Edward Wilson is completely introverted and while Damon internalizes his thoughts, some of the films greatest moments are when emotion unknowingly pours out of Wilson through a mere flicker in his eyes. Angelina Jolie and Michael Gambon deliver very strong turns amidst a one of a kind cast topped off by the return of Joe Pesci, whose last acting stint was 1998's ""Lethal Weapon 4"".The Good Shepherd is a film that demands to be seen. It is surprisingly apolitical as Wilson's life and its disintegration are the true story of this epic. While some call it ""unsentimental"", exactly the opposite is true. It is a testament to Roth's script that a film with such an introverted protagonist provides such a visceral, affecting experience. Shepherd is an intelligent, poignant look at the cost of blind dedication and constant secrecy. The effect this has on Wilson's life is irrevocable as we are taken on a remarkable cinematic journey, one that should be remembered as one of 06's greatest.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent,"Excellent.The good shepherd is an excellent film. The reason this film was dubbed the ""Godfather of spy movies"" is because ala the ""Godfather"" De Niro uses real life situations involving the CIA and blends them together creating a story around the lead character played by Matt Damon. In addition,several great performances in character parts complement Damon's performance, notably Michael Gambon and John Turturro were both superb. You shouldn't view this film expecting to be blown out of your seats, it is deep, and requires strict attention to detail. My wife and I viewed this film in a packed movie house and we were very certain that half the people in the audience didn't understand or appreciate what they had just seen. I am not saying you need to be of great intellect to enjoy this film, but one of the things De Niro manages to do is bring back a thinking man's drama that is often not seen in today's attention deficit, shoot them up, bang Â– bang movies. This film makes it obvious that Directors Bertolucci and Leone have left a huge impression on De Niro and the result is a movie that both would be proud of.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Too much like the agency it portrays: slow, murky, unclear and emotionally distant","Speaking as a viewer who had been eagerly anticipating the release of this movie since way back in the days when Leonardo DiCaprio was attached to star, I can honestly say I was very disappointed in the final outcome. Perhaps the film had simply become too hyped, with everyone proudly boasting it as ""De Niro's comeback"", but... suffice to say, no matter how hard I tried to enjoy this movie, it completely failed to entice me in any way, shape or form.Director Robert De Niro tries a bold new touch by attempting a ""CIA feel"" for the film, in the sense that an element of mystery is present throughout the entire plot, attempting to better immerse us in the world of lies, deception and uncertainty that was the early CIA. Unfortunately, this method backfires very noticeably, as the plot seems to weave all over the place and we are presented with flat, uninteresting characters who are denied the further development or screen time which might actually have made them appealing. We are simply presented with a slew of famous faces in tiny roles, appearing and disappearing so quickly we barely have the chance to register their presence, but there is no connection with the characters, nor the long, overly confusing convoluted plot they play a part in.But the film's real weakness is the apathy factor. In a recent interview, De Niro acknowledged his intent that the plot should be more elusive and less obvious, to make the viewer work harder and appreciate the film further. He then proceeded to mention how viewers should be emotionally affected and connect with the characters, even if the plot may not always be clear, and we may not always what's going on, or who's killing who, or why. This is where De Niro's film really loses its viewers; the fact that not only is there not enough emotional connection to coast by, ignoring a lack of plot continuity, but the fact that there is no emotional connection whatsoever. Not only do we not know what is going on, nor are able to keep up fast enough to catch onto what few plot clues we may, but we can't invest enough interest into the film to do so. After a few scenes of brief, murky, unexplained and unrelated plot excerpts and confusing flashbacks from present to past times (made more difficult by the fact that James Wilson, Matt Damon's character never seems to age, and appears the same even 20 years later) we lose interest entirely, and find ourselves unable to care for the characters, nor care what is happening. We are kept at such a distance, both through an intentionally unclear plot and by uninteresting flat archetypes of characters that any interest we might originally have retained in the film quickly evaporates.It's a shame that the film is so emotionally distancing though, as on the exterior it does appear to be a very stylish and classy piece of work. The cinematography is superb, capturing many unique, innovative shots and scenes, and the costume and set design are simply sumptuous, perfectly capturing the feel of the time period in a glossy, picturesque fashion. It is a shame how fully the apathy factor permeates the film though, because Eric Roth's script seems to be terse, tight, and engaging, but many lines are inaudible through muttering or fast speaking characters, and we are simply kept at such an emotional distance it is beyond us to make an effort to follow the rapid fire, confusing exchanges. We want to like the script, but it is so twisty and clouded with uncertainty, much like a CIA document itself, that we find ourselves also left in the dark.De Niro has assembled a stellar cast here, but he seems content to reduce most of them to very un-flashy cameos, giving us little chance to connect with any of the characters. Matt Damon is an effective figure as the film's star, James Wilson, remaining admirably cold, detached and stoic throughout the film, but the plot backfires once again - a lead character who is meant to be, all pretenses aside, boring, still comes across as boring, no matter how strongly they are played. Angelina Jolie seems a bit out of place as Wilson's spunky yet abandoned wife; she plays the part well enough, but fails to submerge her star power and charisma in a role where a much less noticeable and subdued female lead would've been far more effective. John Turturro stands out as a vicious CIA interrogator, one of the few flashes of emotion or engaging character action in the entire film, and Joe Pesci makes good use of his far too brief cameo as a mob boss. There are also noteworthy appearances by Michael Gambon, Billy Crudup, Alec Baldwin, William Hurt, Tammy Blanchard and Timothy Hutton, but their parts are reduced to far too brief and uninteresting segments for us to really connect with or care about their characters. De Niro himself almost steals the show with a tiny role as a military general who constantly complains about his feet.All in all, the Good Shepherd comes across as a tremendous disappointment, considering the incredibly successful film it was poised to be. Maybe I had too many expectations, having looked forward to the movie for so long, or maybe the film was overly hyped, but either way, the film falls flat as far too long, self indulgent, emotionally distancing and just plain uninteresting, wrapped together in a bundle of self-imposed apathy. All except for fans of Robert De Niro or the rest of the cast willing to sit through an extremely long and un-engaging movie should give this one a pass, lest De Niro's self confidence be flattened forever.-6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
The murky world of CIA deception as seen by one family man...,"Before I go on to praise the good points of THE GOOD SHEPHERD, I should mention at the start that the film badly needed some judicious editing. There are many scenes that go on for too long a time and are badly in need of some artful editing to get the point across just as well.Aside from length, everything else about the film is on the plus side--the handsome cinematography, the vast amount of settings, the background score that adds to the drama, and the performances of the entire cast which are uniformly good. I'm not a great admirer of ANGELINA JOLIE as an actress, but here I think she demonstrated skill at suggesting the loneliness, frustrations and jealousies of a woman whose life has to remain outside the boundaries of her husband's job with the CIA. Through a series of detailed vignettes, the murky world of an agent's life of deception within the government is sharply observed.More of a character study of Edward Wilson (played in stolid, very serious fashion by MATT DAMON) than a straightforward spy yarn, it manages to hold the interest even though it uses the flashback method of storytelling that is apt to confuse a viewer if it isn't done well. But here again, there is a flaw--it covers a span of twenty or more years but the aging of the central character is never quite convincing enough. Damon never looks that much older than his grown son--whereas a few gray hairs might have helped considerably. As his grown son, EDDIE REDMAYNE does reasonably well as the man seeking his father's approval.As for the supporting players in this story about one man's experiences in the newly developing CIA, JOHN TURTURRO does an outstanding job as a tough inquisitor and MICHAEL GAMBON is outstanding as a security risk with homosexual tendencies. ALEC BALDWIN has little to do but is intense enough as one of the agency's top men and others in the cast maintain credibility all the way through.The story itself is rather problematic in that nothing is what it seems and not all the information is readily given to the viewer in a way that makes sense. This is partly the fault of the script and partly the fault of director Robert De Niro who also assumes a small role effectively.But still, despite the handicap of being too long (and a bit too involved at certain points), it makes for fascinating viewing and is the kind of film you dare not divert your attention from for a moment. If you do, you are liable to miss an essential plot point.Summing up: Highly recommended for anyone with a keen interest in espionage dramas.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Edward Wilson Shepherds the Citizens of America,"""The Good Shepherd"" is my second best film of 2006. A lot of people who have seen it will think differently and I can understand that. This film is not for everyone, but the viewers who have a love for US History, The Cold War, CIA, Espionage, or Spy films should be pleased with ""The Good Shepherd."" It is very subtle, but extremely effective.""The Good Shepherd"" is told from a series of flashbacks during a two week mission to find the significance of a document that was sent to the house of Edward Wilson by an anonymous person(s). We see the rise of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) from his ranks as a Skull and Bones member to the head of the Counter Intelligence section of CIA.Robert De Niro directs this epic, near-masterpiece, of the creation of CIA through one mans eyes, Edward Wilson. Matt Damon gives a great performance and one of his best along with ""The Departed"" and ""Good Will Hunting."" Damon plays Edward Wilson who starts off as a Yale graduate and Skull and Bones member. He is recruited by an FBI Agent (Alec Baldwin) to spy on his poetry professor Dr. Fredrick's (Michael Gambon), who is believed to have set up a Nazi organization and is enlisting students and faculty members. Edward agrees to spy on his professor after some talking into and gets the names of the people Dr. Fredrick's has enlisted, which leads to his firing on the basis of his political beliefs.On Deer Island (Skull and Bones retreat) he meets Margaret ""Clover"" Russell (Angelina Jolie) who seeks out Edward immediately and finds something about him quite intriguing. Matt Damon plays ""the man made out of stone"" giving little to no emotional reaction to anything and just about everything. Edward Wilson is a man of few words, but he chooses wisely what few words he speaks.Edward Wilson falls in love with Laura, played wonderfully by Tammy Blanchard- a deaf women- but their relationship comes to an abrupt end as Edward finds that Margaret has become pregnant with his child and Edward is to do what is expected of him. This means he will have to leave Laura and marry Clover. A week after their marriage Edward has to go overseas during WWII, mostly working out of Germany, but is sent to London and joins the OSS (Office of Strategic Services), by General Bill Sullivan (Robert De Niro).After the war Germany is crumbling and Edward Wilson is climbing the ranks garnering more and more trust. The Soviets are now looking to acquire as many scientists as possible. In Berlin, Edward Wilson meets his adversary, codename ""Ulysses,"" and the back and forth battle between Wilson (His codename is ""Mother"") and Ulysses is something to really behold and some of the best scenes in the film take part during their back and forth battle of disinformation and counter intelligence and deception and infiltration of spies sent into one another's operations and then each adversary takes out these spies, then sends the ""message"" that these spies were found and disposed of. Was that confusing? Neither seems to gain much of any ground on each other until the end of the film where Ulysses sends a spy into Wilson's Agency and get's valuable information from someone very close to Edward Wilson. This information ruins the ""Bay of Pigs"" invasion which turns out to be a costly loss and damaging defeat. Wilson has to make a tough decision between his family and his country.Edward Wilson was a man of selflessness who put his entire life into his country and did what he could do with his son. He makes sacrifices for his country and for his son. He sacrifices his time and relationship with his family for his country. He sacrifices his true love with Laura and marries Margaret for his son. If you were going to sum up Edward Wilson it probably would be best to use the term ""selfless."" Everything he does is for his country and the future of it. We never see him do much of anything for his own personal joy. This kind of behavior leads to a marriage that crumbles and falls apart. He plays the protector and is forced to do things such as have people killed and interrogated for the greater good. All over an idea- Communism.I loved it. It may take a few viewings to fully understand the complexities of this film, but it is well worth it and an intense film with some great action and conversation throughout the film.9.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
Finally a film that doesn't assume you're an idiot,"After enduring trailer after trailer with endless stings of explosions, ridiculous CG-assisted stunts and mindless action, I felt very rewarded with an intelligent and intriguing film that defies the status quo of bigger and louder is better.The Good Sheperd doesn't insult your intelligence, it stimulates it, sometimes confuses it, and forces you to look several layers beneath the surface. It feels like a throwback to another era of films when the complexity of a character was of greater importance than spectacle.De Niro took a page from his producer's best work, Francis Ford Coppola, emulating films like The Godfather, The Conversation and Apacalypse Now. The drama rises not from the usual blatant conventional devices but rather by raising questions because of what we're not told and not shown. It requires a great deal of courage to use this style as films have gravitated more and more toward assuming the average moviegoer is of substandard intelligence. The scope of the film is enormous, yet the point of view is narrowly focused to be seen through the eyes of one man. There are a dozen of subplots, but all are carefully tied into the through-line of the story to match the main character's progression.The film may require some understanding of American history from WWII through the Kennedy administration. It starts with the later years of the story, The Bay of Pigs debacle, and traces the steps that lead to it, one of the more embarrassing moments in the history of U.S. foreign policy. I found it a bit annoying that Matt Damon's character, Edward Wilson, barely seemed to age in the film while others around him did (the best way to determine his age is whether he's wearing wire-rimmed or horn-rimmed glasses), but it didn't ruin the film for me.Overall though, definitely one of the best films of 2006. A rare film that makes you want to think and understand, rather than forget.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Tries to be great, but ultimately fails.","I found the core storyline not hard to follow, but because they chose to include so many under-explained tangents (it came off as a lame attempt to make it seem like it had more depth and girth than it actually did), the overall result is that the movie felt muddled. Add that to the problematic pacing/awful editing job, and this movie becomes the epitome of potential without successful followup.I saw it in a theater, so I got the chance to watch it intently, without interruption, but I kept asking my friend what time it was.... even as early as only an hour in! Not a great or even remotely interesting movie by any means, and some seem to be fixated on the idea that it *must* be great because it's a movie about the CIA directed by De Niro that doesn't have explosions/car chases or romance/sentimentality. But in the end, this movie is totally forgettable. It's not a deep or extremely intellectual movie, but rather just a simple story in a convoluted veil, attempting to hide that there's not much substance to this.Also, depth-less performance by Damon.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Interesting but overlong.,"Spy movies really aren't my thing. The slow ones I can respect when well-made, and the more explosive ones can be fun if they have good action set pieces, but I don't tend to go out of my way to watch spy-related films. But The Good Shepherd looked interesting because of the strength of the cast, and because it's one of two movies Robert De Niro's directed. He also has a supporting role here, and it's hilarious how almost every time he's on screen, he's sitting down. If a director wants a certain character to always be in a comfortable position, who can protest?Comparing it to A Bronx Tale, it's also a bit funny how that one feels like it pulls a little from Goodfellas, and The Good Shepherd pulls a bit from another recent (at the time) Scorsese film: The Aviator. It's got the same kind of glossy look and color scheme, and it's not surprising to find out they both had the same cinematographer.Look, rambling aside, The Good Shepherd is quite competent as a spy film, and it's interesting (if a little heavy-handed) how it uses a story that takes place between 1939 and the early 1960s to reflect all the U. S. conflict of the 2000s. Outside of acting, De Niro is politically outspoken, so I can see why this story would've appealed to him at this time.The Good Shepherd is just too long though, being 167 minutes in length. It drags at times, but again, going back to the whole me and spy movie thing, I often feel like these sorts of movies drag. I guess the huge runtime here just compounds that. It's nicely presented, and the performances are generally good. I felt a bit mixed on Matt Damon in the lead role, but that might be more of a writing problem. He's a character whose journey should be interesting, and kind of is on paper, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired.So, the film looks and feels good, it has thematic weight, and features a good cast, but it's also too long, narratively dull, and sometimes heavy-handed. It's interesting, and would be a recommendable oddity within De Niro's body of work if it had been 30 to 45 minutes shorter; that's really the biggest hurdle to enjoying The Good Shepherd, rather than merely having a decent amount of respect for it.",6.0,Anonymous,History
What is wrong with the critics???,"Though this movie was hailed as one of the greatest movies of this year, the Godfather of spy movies, I must say... poor spy movie genre. Is this really the best it's seen?Overall, what little strength this film had came from the minor acting parts, namely the performances by Tammy Blanchard and Michael Gambon. Though to be fair, the major actors didn't have much to work with. Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie were both flat and boring. I wanted to smack all the actors (except Gambon and Blanchard) in this movie at one point or another. Perhaps this film would have been better with more interesting dialogue, a more exciting plot. Maybe it was doomed from the start. I don't know.I really wanted to like this movie. I came into the theater expecting an exciting, well-executed dramatic thriller, but came out almost completely empty-handed. My whole family thought it was a disappointment. We all agreed DeNiro should stick to acting. But there's little to do now except pray this movie doesn't get an Oscar.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Damon is a Puzzle,"I had some mixed feelings about this film. First of all, it is so long that to sustain an interest in the frozen expressions of Matt Damon's characters through almost three hours is quite a challenge. At times I believe that he is actually becoming human. I'm not sure that we are really privy to his ghosts, even considering the letter from his father. When a movie makes the human beings so very cold, it begs some big questions. First of all, would be psychosis. Yes, I know there are patriotic zealots. This is just too much. On the other hand, this is a really interesting part of history. It is in the period where media didn't have its tentacles in everything; where spies could play at being spies and politicians didn't have to look over their shoulders. We also had the Russians and their potential on the minds of everyone, including school children. I think if Damon's character had just had a second dimension, it would have played a lot better. Even when his son comes into the picture, we know who his real child is. Like Jean Hackman in ""The Conversation"" the paranoia runs so deep that he couldn't get out if he could. He has sold all his options.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Quietly powerful and None of the flash,"It starts on April 16, 1961. Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is a top American spy. When the Bay of Pigs don't go well, everybody is suspicious of a leak. Then it flashes back to 1939 Yale University. He is a student and recruited by Bill Sullivan (Robert De Niro) to spy on a professor with German ties. He is forced into a shotgun wedding with Margaret (Angelina Jolie). The war starts and he goes to Britain working for the fledging American spy agency. He would become one of the best at counter-intelligence but his family life suffers tremendously with his wife and son (Eddie Redmayne).As far as I'm concern, director Robert De Niro is 2 for 2 so far. Matt Damon puts in a deadly quiet performance. This is no Bond movie. There are no flashy gadgets and movie contraptions. This feels like the real thing. A spy would obviously not talk about spy stuff. The internalization and the paranoia seems to hit the right notes. The family dysfunction follows logically. I guess people who want the excitement will have trouble with the quietness. I personally found it intriguing.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"has the makings of something greater, but it's too under-stated and secretive to really let a viewer in","I really wanted to love the Good Shepherd, but maybe like the main character of Edward Wilson it's a hard one to love even if one can admire/respect it in some ways. It's a film cluttered by being both too long and too short, where the pace feels plodding at times and with some unnecessary beats, and at the same time not developing quite enough on the points that could be more interesting. It's one of those films about a government agency (in this case it's inception) that I ended up liking more for what good things I saw than for the overall whole bang of the picture. I do have to give credit where it's due, however. Matt Damon, on a roll it seems after Syriana and the Departed, is at his most under-stated (and rightfully so, probably taking cues from Robert De Niro, a man who has under-stated sometimes as his bread & butter) in the role of Wilson, a man who sacrifices his own sense of truth for the honor of protecting the country, even if it means putting his own family into complete doubt about his character.Psychologically I was always in tune with what was going on, and like last year's Munich there's a good sense of demystification that goes on with how an organization is run/starts up. And De Niro has assembled such a top-notch cast it's hard to complain on that front (with great character actors like John Tuturro, Michael Gambon, Alec Baldwin, Billy Crudup, William Hurt, Joe Pesci). What ended up tugging me away from seeing this as a better film was the storytelling, or the sort of pull from really feeling connected with the material. Things diverge around in sub-plots, and sometimes it's gripping (like the torture scene with the Russian where LSD is used to try and reveal his name), but sometimes not so much, as with Wilson's affair with another woman. This side of it is a little murky for me- Angelina Jolie's character has an interesting start, with her practically jumping all over him when they meet, and once they marry and have a kid she becomes the dour note of his existence, even as he loves his son. I would've liked to have seen more about her, why she decided to be with him in the first place aside from the ultra-ambiguous ""you look like husband material"" line. It's also saddening, on the character-actor front, to see Joe Pesci (who hasn't acted in 8 years) in such a thankless part; I thought he would be there for more scenes, but it seemed like De Niro added him in as an afterthought.What is compelling, however, does show De Niro as a very smart director with enough class to not spoon-feed the audience 'things' that happen. It's got a main part to it that is worthwhile to tell, which is Wilson's connection to his son, and Wilson's connection to a Russian counterpart to his CIA operative as a Russian operative nicknamed Ulysses (there's one scene I love that involved a violin, I won't say which). A lot of what the Good Shepherd brings makes for some good talk after it ends, but more so about what didn't work then what did. It has the makings to be one of the finest epics ever made in this decade, but sometimes even someone like Damon almost becomes TOO understated in his part- bordering on wooden- in being secret to the point of inertia. In the end, the Good Shepherd gives enough to subvert the spy film specifically on choices of mood and character, but it's also confused in how it decides to spend its time getting to the story that really counts.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Remarkable,"I wasn't sure that a movie like this could or would still be made and released in this country.No, it wasn't Mission Impossible 6. It didn't have the overwhelming special effects, chases, explosions and gunfights one might expect in a spy thriller. It didn't need them. Thrilling enough was the exposition of character (imagine that). Plot? Whose real life has ever had a tight plot line? Edward Wilson's life meandered along like many do. In fact, I found it even more interesting because the turns Wilson's life took seemed dictated by his character and not just by his chosen profession.Courageous choices were made by DeNiro in making this film, by Damon in tackling the role with such coldness and stoicism, and by Jolie in passing on being a movie star in favor of being an actress.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Smoke and Mirrors with a Solid Ending,"""The Good Sheperd"" is long and very detailed drama portraying the beginning of the CIA. Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson who is a privileged youth from a wealthy family. His father commits suicide when Edward is very young because he had betrayed his country, but before he ends his life he leaves a note for his family. Edward picks up the note and does not read it for most of the movie. As the movie goes on, Edward goes to college, joins a secret society, and finds love, but his life takes a bad turn when he impregnates Clover Russell, played by Angelina Joli, and is forced to give up his love at the time and marry Clover. In the midst of all this, Robert DeNiro and William Hurt are recruiting Damon to start an intelligence agency. As soon as he is wed, Edward receives his orders to go over seas. From this point, the film takes a serpentine approach with a lot of smoke and mirrors. Through all of this, Matt Damon becomes more and more cold and deceptive towards his family leading up to an ending that fits the movie to a ""T"". Robert DeNiro in his sophomore effort as a director creates a movie that drags in spots, but overall is a solid story about the start of the CIA.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Huh?  Too fragmented and slow ....,"This a very long movie. It's a bit confusing unless you intend to rewatch the beginning after watching the end. Then ... you can understand the beginning better. Sound confusing? It shouldn't be this hard to watch a movie. Plus, the first 2 1/4 hours of this nearly 3 hour movie is kind of boring.The movie is basically about the life of a man during the start of the CIA. We follow him from his induction into an elite fraternity (or order) into his career with the formation of the CIA.If it doesn't sound interesting, that's because that's all there really is. Unless you're a CIA history buff and are interested in this stuff, it's a bit boring for the average viewer. There is only one place where there is a real plot - and that's right at the end for about 15 minutes.Furthermore, the way the movie is chopped up and given how long it is, it's likely you'll forget the what happened at the beginning by the time you get to the end.For the average viewer, this movie isn't really worth the time. For the CIA history aficionado - knock yourself out.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Constatnly interesting though rarely engaging,"Robert De Niro's second directorial outing is a passionate but strenuous account of the earnest rise to the corrupted fall of the US Central Intelligence Agency as seen through one main operatives' decades of experience. The lengthy, detail-specific, at times tedious pace will surely be off-putting to more casual movie-goers and all who are not inherently enthralled by the infinite webs of deception surrounding those in highly secretive governmental positions, though anyone choosing to stick it out may be pleasantly rewarded. Much like his script for Munich, Eric Roth infuses a factual urgency that compliments the fictional characterization to provide viewers with the best of both worlds. Only unlike Munich, The Good Shepherd's ambitious two and a half decade plot-line will bog down many participants with covert operation details at the expense of character intimacy and development (written intentionally that way to portray Matt Damon's ultra-secretive presence, but still suffering a lack of character explanation as a result).It is only late in the third act that this chronologically impaired film fleshes out some of the more personal and potent themes the labyrinthine story of mistrust and moral ambiguity provides, culminating with a conclusion that will somehow justify much of the muddled exchanges bloating up the run time. With a slightly hypnotic tension, De Niro manages to take all of the paranoid, world-view sentiment that is supposed to frame the C.I.A's often malicious intentions for the audience, and by the end spins it into a cohesive whole centering around this main character's eroding consciousness supplemented by his encroaching apathy.Thankfully, Damon is able to fulfill his end of the bargain by providing some of his most subtle work yet. It is often hard for me to be engaged by this actor, but lately you can tell he has been working on his game, and it has never been more obvious when watching his huge role as hollow-everyman-with-secrets Edward Bell Wilson. He is able to suppress nearly all of his less believable ""charisma"" in favor of the cold, calculated exchanges that give his character a more believable persona then what we are used to seeing from him, congratulations on rising to the occasion Mr. Damon. Ultimately the supporting cast gets the job done, but cannot help but feel superfluous when revolving around Damon's principal motivations.At times, De Niro's equation of secretive governmental policies to the same values that underscored much of his gangster genre work seems to rob individual scenes of some integrity, but for the most part the details are unveiled in a way that will appease both hardened C.I.A. buffs and more casual moviegoers alike. Certainly not for everyone though, those willing to sit through some unnecessary (though historically relevant), insider interpretations of past US events should be rewarded by the eventual formation of something entirely more substantial then the dry and cryptic details the movie frustratingly prides itself upon.",6.0,Anonymous,History
All Craft and no Substance,You can imagine that when it came to editing this film that they were scared that might lose for ever a few minutes of fine acting. Yes all these actors can act and they do it very well. They do it in worthy style in hushed voices for about two and half hours. But surely there is more to a good film than fine performances? In an effort to bolster the film they have stolen a central strand from 'The Conversation' (the reconstruction and deciphering of a taped conversation over a period of time) and mixed it with an array of characters who might have stepped from some mirror version of 'The Godfather' featuring families of WASPs and for good measure thrown in the worst part of 'Eyes Wide Shut' - namely the secret society that everyone who is everyone is a member of but of course is so secret no one knows about it. I suspect that if about 50 minutes were taken out of the film and the plot tightened up and if Matt Damon did not look perpetually adolescent then one might finish watching this feeling the experience was worthwhile. As it is some will be fooled by the smoke and mirrors that they have seen a masterpiece and others will have fallen asleep.,6.0,Anonymous,History
The Good Shepherd keeps its flock safe.,"Robert De Niro has crafted a story about espionage, lies and the American way in his second directorial bout. As De Niro borrowed from Martin Scorsese for his first film, A Bronx Tale, he borrows heavily from Francis Ford Copolla in this case and borrows well. This time around De Niro focuses on the inception of the C.I.A, and their involvement in various Government coups outside the United States, all in the name of freedom. Matt Damon stars as Edwards, the perfect arian specimen, bread into Ivy League stature and inducted into a secret society whose predecessors included ex-presidents, senators and congressmen. If there was ever a piece of solid film-making, The Good Shepherd would be it, never seeming too boring or overbearing in its 170 minute runtime. Paralleling the Copolla tradition, De Niro tells this story in a non-linear fashion, which ties in the two stories closer and closer as the film drives to its finally.The Good Shepard is not as good as A Bronx Tale, but on its own this film's character development does embody a larger scope, and deals with a much more global aspect than its predecessor. There have been many films like this, including Spy Games, that lack the mature and authentic inspiration that The Good Shepherd nailed in its entirety, whether this particular story was true or not. De Niro's role, or cameo in this case, seemed a little forced, and too contrived, but can be coped with, as his role is short and easily forgetful. Some of the dialog is also flawed, due to the scripts weakness in dealing with the underdeveloped female characters, thrown into the film for sheer tragic effect. The overall story, dealing with war-time, both intelligence and counter-intelligence, parallel the way wars are fought today. There are many aspects of the film that, deliberately or not, most likely the prior, mirror how Americans view threats outside the United States. Not only are non-democratic governments viewed as threats, but they are taken down by what this film proves is the ''heart and soul"" of the United States, the C.I.A.Despite the films political message, that might not be pleasantly received by most , and may be viewed by even more as an anti-American film, this is a more American film than initially perceived. The Good Shepherd tries to show the hypocrisy's and sheer ignorance that leads to many of the choices a government makes today, and ironically made the same mistakes in their choices years ago. Much of the film deals with war quietly and the basis that wars are fought not only in the battlefield, but more importantly in offices while wearing suites and ties. De Niro captures these actions brilliantly in this political thriller, and will draw a lot of unavoidable criticism due to his choice of material.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Good Shepherd Bad Shepherd,"First, one thing upfront. I used to do intelligence work many years ago. Life as a field op is not filled with fancy cars, beautiful women, high-tech gadgets and chase scenes. Largely, life is very dull and boring because it HAS to be. Secrets are rarely stolen. They're generally given away after the field op has established a track record of misplaced trust. And establishing that trust can take weeks, months, or even years. Also, if the truth be known, behind-the-scenes intel analysts do the real hard work ... though not as dangerous as the work done by a field op.In this sense, The Good Shepherd gave us a story about intelligence work as it really is. And Matt Damon's character gave us the ideal profile of a man who has what it takes to ""get ahead"" -- a dispassionate and aloof persona who would otherwise draw little attention to himself (except, perhaps, from higher-ups when he succeeds or fails in an assignment).One aside to that, though. One of the best representations of a field op when it comes to ""family life"" was probably given by Arnold Schwarzenegger in True Lies. A successful field op who wants to have at least the semblance of normal home life will provide his/her spouse with ""cover stories"" of business trips, etc., to explain his/her absences. Damon simply chose not to speak to Angelina ... and the real puzzler of this film is why Angelina didn't divorce him early on. In light of what I said in the last paragraph, I suspect that the BEST field ops make the LOUSIEST spouses ... so don't marry a spy (grin).Unfortunately, the majority of spy film aficionados prefer the fancy cars, beautiful women, high-tech gadgets and chase scenes. That's why the James Bond franchise has 21 films to its credit with #22 an absolute certainty in the future - and why The Good Shepherd will never have a single sequel.So, there you have it. The truth may set you free ... but it's not going to set box office records anytime soon.One final note that's neither here nor there. I think I'd have enjoyed the film more if it had been done in chronological order of action. One or two flashbacks would have been OK ... but after a while, it became rather tedious. It's why I prefer The Godfather ""Epic Version"" (sold on VHS briefly, then pulled off shelves - never released on DVD) to Parts 1&2 of the film ... since the generational aspects of the unfolding saga become more acute and memorable when told chronologically. And, The Good Shepherd spans 3 generations ... Damon's father briefly, Damon, and Damon's son who are all involved in government security matters.",6.0,Anonymous,History
An intelligent tale of duty and loyalty,"I went into the theatre with little knowledge but that I was going to be watching a film about a man who was one of the founders of the CIA. Expecting this, I thought this movie was outstanding and a mind game from start to finish.What one has to understand about the movie itself is that it is as complicated as the storyline. It starts out with two different time lines, decades apart and slowly one reaches the other. That in itself can be difficult to follow, but it is well worth the effort to pay attention because if you can leave the theatre understanding what took place, you walk away with a little more knowledge about the human complex.Because this is a story more about the soul and our humanity than it is about spies and country. Those are just the means by which De Niro uses.Every actor is placed remarkably well and no more so than Matt Damon himself. It is his acting that gives us Edward Wilson; a man without airs who doesn't compromise. The movie spans over twenty years and fortunately we see those years reflected in most of the characters. Angelina Jolie does the neglected, alcoholic wife superbly. William Hurt and Lee Pace as Richard Hayes both give a wonderful performance taking their character's flaws from subtle to substantial by the end.Some might wonder how so many actors could be recruited for such small roles, like Alec Baldwin, Michael Gambon, and Joe Pesci, but one only has to see as far as the director to get their answer. Don't let the big names and the anagram CIA get you. This movie is as edgy as it is intricate with twists and turns that take the viewer through the world of trust and the human element. A man like Edward Wilson is just the perfect vessel for the journey.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Know In Advance This Is Not An Action Film, And Then Sit Back & Enjoy It","I had a huge advantage before watching this on DVD. I was told by a good friend that it was extremely slow, and be prepared to be bored out of ""my mind."" Well, I wasn't bored, maybe because I now expected a slower, non-action-packed CIA-type film....and I wasn't disappointed. Actually, I liked it, mainly because of the cinematography. This is stunning in its photography. Kudos to Director Robert De Niro and Director of Photography Robert Richardson for their work in here.I also appreciated the low profanity in here. After watching ""The Departed,"" this far-cleaner film was a treat for the ears, too. Yes, there are a handful of 'f-words,"" but not much else including no blasphemy.But, I agree that this is a very slow film and it helps to know that in advance. It's also one you have to follow closely and time periods shift back and forth, mainly from 1961 back to the early 1940s.The story winds up presenting an interesting question which is posed to Matt Damon's character, ""Edward Wilson."" He plays an extremely loyal CIA man, a guy who is straight-arrow and one whose priority is country-first. The dilemma occurs at the end when he must choose between what's best for his son or his country.It's a thought-out, interesting story that takes a few sides to the left of center more than the right, but is not really a movie with any heavy-handed political agenda, mainly pointing out what it takes to be a successful ""spy"" and that this unemotional detachment can be rough on some people and their families.Damon heads an all-star cast that includes Angeline Jolie (who looks spectacular as a woman in the early 1940s), Billy Crudup, Alec Baldwin, William Hurt, Timothy Hutton and many others.This movie, I suspect, will either put you to sleep or fascinate you.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Good. Merely good.,"Short and sweet should have been Robert DeNiro's motto while making ""The Good Shepherd"". He managed to get top performances out of his A-list cast that complement the film, his facts on the beginnings of the CIA are incredible, and, most of all, his screenplay, written by Eric Roth, is nothing short of brilliant.DeNiro is used to epic movies that span long periods of time and draw extensive character portraits. I think back to The Godfather II, Once Upon A Time In America and Goodfellas (among others). He learned from the master, Martin Scorsese.""The Good Shepherd"" is an epic film. It spans more than 20 years and follows the lives of many characters, never overlooking any detail about them. Matt Damon's character Edward Wilson was taught by his father never to lie or lose face to his friends, or else he won't be respected. He then kills himself. Edward hears the gunshot. So, it comes as no surprise that Edward remains cold, hard and impenetrable throughout the entire film.I cannot say enough about the screenplay. Nothing is forgotten. A predominant theme in the movie is weakness. Everyone has at least one, for example, for an ex-soviet soldier turned cold warrior, it is the cold and for a CIA man, it is his homosexuality. Edward doesn't want to have any but does have one: Laura. He is truly in love with her. In fact, most of the few times he smiles in the film, it is with her. But as soon as he learns that she is his weakness, he coldly lets her go. Weaknesses destroy many people during the film and they resurfacing in this shadowy world.There is also Edward's son, who appears to be a weakness of his, but he learns to be dispassionate about everything, and overcomes his weaknesses. He is probably the ultimate CIA agent because he sees them in other people and appears not to have any himself.The screenplay does an admirable job at connecting everything. Edward's neglected son, Edward Jr., yearned most of his young life to be appreciated by his father. His psychology is just as fragile when he grows up, and longs just the same for his father's approval. This even leads to a heartbreaking moment near the end that fuels the film at the same time as it reinforces the nature of Edward Wilson.That said, as much as this project looks great on paper, the transformation of it to the screen is not as admirable. The world in ""The Good Shepherd"" is a cold and dark world which DeNiro darkens and makes colder. He populates them with shady people and shady locations. However, the movie is too long. This makes it hard to keep up with all the goings-on: KGB, CIA, Cuba... As the movie goes on, we lose the feel for the atmosphere and the characters that just keep coming.I saw this film twice and drew the conclusion that it is not so much about remembering all the names of all the people and who's working for who and all that, but about the feelings we get. Don't get me wrong, this is a great thriller. The beginning of the movie is great because DeNiro introduces us slowly to this shady world. The codes they use (""tie your shoes"" and ""there's a stranger in my house""), the promise of cool things to come all seduce us. But, about midway through, things just get too plain. There's nothing exciting. The stuff in this part of the movie are interesting, but as far as entertainment value goes, it doesn't match the first half.""The Good Shepherd"" will undoubtedly be nominated for many academy awards, mainly, best original screenplay. But it just didn't hit it for me. Seeing the previews for this movie, I was expecting more. I was a little disappointed. Nonetheless, go see this movie, it is well worth it. ""The Good Shepherd"" is an intelligent, good looking thriller. It just isn't concise.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Too slow, unrewarding, fragmented, pretentious, chaotic and pointless","This film is extremely inefficient, pointless, emotionless and suspenseless (save a few moments in the last hour). After two hours of watching I still found myself unrewarded for my patience. I didn't care anymore, it was going nowhere slow. A great movie is supposed to fascinate you from beginning to end, not to let you wait 2 hours for that to happen.There are countless characters and scenes which are completely unnecessary and get in the way of what could otherwise have been an interesting film. The way the plot swings back and forth to several periods (WW II era, fifties, sixties) is also very chaotic, under the pretense of being ingenious which only makes it worse.Because there's so much bits and pieces floating around it never can get deep. This film is too eager to move on to each next fragment of a story that has no clear direction. A poorly structured scenario is to blame in which a lot less important or even meaningless fragments could have been left out.No great cast could have saved this disaster. Imagine this film not being made by de Niro and not be played by the allstar cast it had. What value would it have? 1 out of 10 to compensate for the blind admiration of Great Names, this film is clearly overrated. I advise to go read the next chapter of your book instead of watching this yawn.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Solid narrative but mistakes intelligence and maturity for just having an overly slow pace,"Time will see Edward Wilson become involved in the disastrous Bay of Pigs with the CIA and trying to locate the leak that caused the operation to fail. Looking back we see Edward Wilson as a young man in his days at Yale, where approaches to work for the OSS sees him travelling abroad as Britain goes to war. Back at home his already weak family life is hurt by the distance as his wife gives birth to a son. At work his simple ideals are influenced by the sense of mistrust and paranoia that exist as part of his job and from those all around him.There is no denying that at times this film does move painfully slowly. Some people have claimed that this slow pace is all part of the film having a ""grownup"" narrative but this a bit like assuming that a car must have a stereo Â– they are common together but they are not mutually exclusive. So it is here as a mostly engaging narrative is badly misjudged in regards pacing, stretching the material so thinly at times that it does suffer; I can understand why this is accepted as being part and parcel of the story but I personally think that it is a flaw in the delivery.It is a shame as well because the story does have the potential to produce a grown-up espionage story where the sense of mistrust is as important as the actual actions within the story and indeed it does deliver this well, if you manage to overlook the sluggish pace. Some have claimed the story to be wonderfully complex and to an extent they are correct but this is as much to do with the structuring of the story as it jumps around in time. That said I still found the narrative interesting, but not to the point that I found it as strong as others have claimed.The driving heart of the film is left to Damon, who gives a strong performance that is the opposite of the equally good turns he has been giving as Jason Bourne. He ages his character really well without any significant use of make-up; the make-up of his character being enough for him to mark out that transition. The rest of the cast is ramming with star names but few are given the time to be more than ""OK"" and none match the consistent presence of Damon. Baldwin, De Niro, Gambon, Hutton, Sessions, Pesci, Blanchard, Hurt and others all provide solid support but I felt that, of all of them, Jolie stood out like one massive sore thumb. She is badly miscast and she pushes her character beyond what the material suggests she should be. She is a disappointment and distraction. As director, I did think that De Niro was lacking in some areas and that the ability to bring her in was one of them. Perhaps the pacing was another but blame for that also lies in the editing suite. Visually he has a good eye for the shot and makes some wide shots work just as well as close ones, both contextually working as well as visually.Overall then, an OK film that is some in the middle of the praise and criticism directed at it. It is a smart script but the pacing is not part of it Â– in fact it is an error in the delivery that damages the flow of the story and makes it harder work than it needed to be. The collection of stars (what is the collection noun for that anyway) are solid but slightly distracting Â– although none moreso than a badly miscast and misfiring Jolie. Thank goodness then that Damon provides a rock of a lead and makes the film better than it could have been albeit still less than the sum of its parts.",,Anonymous,History
Matt Damon is just not a leading man. No veritas.,"Robert DeNiro's fictionalized account of the creation and early history of the CIA is intelligent and well intentioned, with superb casting. Its most prominent debit is in the casting of Matt Damon as its lead, Edward Wilson, the young man at the crux of the genesis of the counterintelligence agency.The quiet, unassuming Wilson is a straight-arrow Yale student, part of America's upper crust, who vows to do good in the world after his father commits suicide, thus making him an easy recruit for a US general (DeNiro) who is planning a new, covert intelligence service after World War II. Wilson is stationed in London, and his cipherlike demeanor allows him to run counterintelligence for the US there, as German and Russian spies (and others) jockey for position in postwar England.The movie is bookended by the leadup to the infamous Bay of Pigs incident in 1961. There has been a leak on the US side, alerting Fidel Castro to the upcoming invasion, and Wilson must determine the source of the leak. All he has to go by is a hidden-camera film and some murky audio; he doesn't know where the film was recorded, and he doesn't know who the speakers on the audio are.As 1961 Wilson - by now, a seasoned espionage agent - tries to suss out what has happened, we flash back many times to his own early beginnings, how he met a young woman named Clover Russell (Angelina Jolie), how he was found by Phillip Allen (William Hurt) by way of the notorious (if it actually exists) Skull and Bones society at Yale, and how the relationship between Wilson and his son Edward, Jr., progresses over the years, as his dad is rarely home (he's gone for the first five years of Junior's life, actually).The movie works not because of Damon but because of the trenchant, complex plot dreamed up by Eric Roth. This is a movie that takes a driving force of a character's personality - i.e., Wilson's patriotism - and turns it around in order to both buoy the character and bring about his downfall. Anyone as single minded as Wilson is in this movie is going to face a rude comeuppance, but at the same time his tenacity at doing the Right Thing for America, his unwavering decency, is held up as a laudable ideal.The problem with Damon is the same one that's followed him throughout his career; he constantly looks unable to provide the panache that these meatier roles demand. In a sense, that's not a terrible thing here, as Wilson's unreadable countenance is perfect for a superspy: does the lack of expression mask myriad possibilities, or does it simply mean there's nothing to be seen? A more competent actor can essay a thousand thoughts without uttering a word, but with Damon one just thought there was't much there to begin with.He's surrounded by a very able cast, though, helping matters considerably. Jolie sparkles in the few scenes in which she appears as Wilson's wife, as do DeNiro, Hurt, Alec Baldwin, Michael Gambon, and Timothy Hutton. Perplexingly cast was the marble-mouthed Eddie Redmayne as Edward Jr., who's as dull-looking and unintelligible as his on screen father is hunky and articulate. It'd be easy to ignore this casting faux pas, but Edward Jr. plays a big role in the final twenty minutes of the movie, sadly.Another caveat: Although the movie covers a couple decades in time, Damon never ages all that realistically. Sure, he has a couple of crow's feet, but that's about it; oh, there's the time where he's inexplicably wearing what appear to be women's eyeglasses. (No, he's not undercover.) It's kind of funny (unintentionally) when you see the senior and junior Edwards near the end of the movie, and Junior looks about as old as his old man. They couldn't even pack a few more pounds on Damon? Give him a paunch, a stoop, anything? No, apparently we're supposed to go by the passage of time to show his aging, although everyone else seems a bit older - and wears it well (see, in particular, Jolie, who's absolutely wonderful, no matter her character's age).The Good Shepherd is a bit too long, although the story itself is well told. A good solid cast and a followable plot make this mostly enjoyable; it loses points for unbelievable casting and the usual so-low-key-he's-almost-invisible performance by Damon.",6.0,Anonymous,History
The Good Shepherd: An ambitious but uninteresting film.,"Honestly, I expected more from this film, overall it was a rather disappointing experience with an unattractive and unnecessarily confusing narrative. During most of the passages of time I got lost in the narrative, as the characters seem the same after 20 years, without any trace of aging, and to complete the confusion, the time changes are dry cuts, without any interconnection between one and the other. Other.Look, the film has good things, but it's too long and not very flashy, I'd even say boring, and that's impressive because I'm a person who enjoys slow movies, but the tone of this one simply made me distance myself from the main plot. A story that seeks to explore the drama of a man's life at the beginning of the CIA, merging the division of lies and mysteries between work and family, necessarily needs to create an emotional bond between viewer and character. This movie just can't do that, all the characters are uninteresting and boring, exaggeratedly dark and sleepy, I don't think even Dark left me with this harrowing feeling of seeing everything and everyone looking sleepy.On the other hand, the setting is very good, Robert de Niro knows how to direct the scenes quite well. The soundtrack is also very engaging at times. But otherwise I genuinely have nothing to say about it, I was expecting a mystery narrative with a family connection. The film even has a mystery thing that lasts all 2h40m, but it's so dull and confusing that it didn't involve me at all. I expected more from this movie, but I was disappointed with the experience.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Falls far short of a masterpiece,"Even though I'm pretty sure Robert De Niro thought he was making one. I have tremendous trouble with inconsistent characterizations and this movie is riddled with them.For one, the lead, Edward Wilson, played by one note Matt Damon (has anyone every given any thought to putting him in a movie with another one-noter like Helen Hunt - that would be a blast!)is a sensitive child who witnesses a horrific scene but goes on to star - as a woman, and well -in an operetta. That takes guts and a need for the limelight and a certain acting ability. However, this man is inveigled into becoming one of the first secret agents and a founder of the CIA. In total antithesis to the original set up.He is actively pursued by a fiery and beautiful Angelina Jolie, playing Clover - who gets that one shot and you're pregnant thang - whom he gun-shot marries, and then her character goes from fire to a compliant wet squid.Their son, who has that high-pitched voice and sensitivity to style (""you look so lovely, Mummy"") that cues from miles away how he's going to turn out but hold hard here, you're wrong again, this chappie joins the Secret Service himself and goes to Africa to fall in love with a woman.Matt Damon, Dorian Grayishly, doesn't age at all through the course of about forty years so one has enormous difficulty placing him in responsible middle or elder age - even though the flashes of timeline on the screen sometimes help, though they go back and forth quite irritatingly, to present to past to past-past and back again. Befuddling.There are many bit parts and Russian and American double agents, Michael Gambon raises the level of the movie quite a few notches all by himself. Even Robert himself appears and well too. But many minor characters, due to underdevelopment, are confusing in the thin threads of plot.There is the mandatory love-that-got-away but what anyone sees in the monochromatic Edward Wilson beats me.The murky underworld of the CIA is fascinating, I believe there are strong homosexual components to it (in real life) but these are never addressed here even though the plot came quite close with the son and then backpedalled like mad.Totally unengaging and overly analytical. It is impossible to care about any of these characters in anything more than a superficial level. A documentary would have been far more entertaining. 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Great Intense Movie,"If you're out to see a movie soon, this is one that should be on the top of your list. An all-star cast and an intriguing story isn't all that this movie has. It has some great performances from both Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie that are likely to get some award nominations.I won't give any spoilers, I'll just give my background and overall opinion. When I saw the commercials, I thought it seemed interesting, but not interesting enough to get me out of my seat right now to go see it. It just didn't seem to have anything totally different than other movies, other than the combination of actors. Since I just got to see it anyway, I realized that it's one of those movies that ends up being better than you think it would be.Matt Damon, as always, plays a good serious guy who's smart, savvy, and dedicated to his job. It kind of reminded me of his characters in The Departed and the Bourne Identity, except it's in a different situation and setting. His performance in this role was very fitting and believable.Angelina Jolie surprisingly worked well with this role. In the commercials I thought she was a little too wild compared to Matt Damon's calm character, but she really brought out the emotion of a wife who felt shut out and didn't have a complete relationship with and understanding of her husband.Robert DeNiro of course was great. It was a nicely added touch to an already good movie.While I wouldn't say it's as factual as the History Channel, I think the subject of the movie does put good insight on the history of the CIA. I think people who are into government/politics and history would like the storyline. It does focus quite a bit on his family relationship and how it is affected by his job in the CIA, and I'm sure any couple who has been in a similar situation would understand it.Overall, the movie was better than I thought and I would recommend it to movie-goers, especially those who like suspense and any of the main characters.",8.0,Anonymous,History

We are all boot-makers to kings.,"""The mental facility to detect conspiracies and betrayal are the same qualities most likely to corrode natural judgment."" Almost every year, there is one great film that slips under my radar. I usually wait for it to hit DVD because it keeps getting passed over for other films I'd rather watch. However, when I finally get around to seeing it, I wonder to myself how I ever let it pass me by.In 2006, that film is Robert De Niro's ""The Good Shepherd"". Here is a cinematic gem that hits all the right notes. It is a study in detail. It is a master-class in mood and tone and style. This movie is a fascinating character study and a riveting story of trust, loyalty and betrayal -- both personally and politically.Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is a gifted young man whose keen intellect and sharp observational skills soon catch the attentions of some important people. While attending Yale University, Edward is recruited into the uber-secretive college society known as the Skull and Bones. During the initiation ritual, he is asked to recount a secret that he has never before revealed -- a pledge of trust and brotherhood. He describes his father's suicide as a result of being a disgraced naval officer.The FBI becomes aware of Edward's abilities. His encounter with a poetry professor only serves to expedite his venture into the world of espionage.Edward's ties to that secretive community cost him his first love, Laura, a beautiful young deaf girl with a heart of gold and a pure spirit. Instead, a relationship seems forced upon him with Clover (Angelina Jolie), sister to one of his fraternity colleagues. An unplanned pregnancy rushes along the marriage plans. It becomes a loveless relationship between strangers.The film follows Edward's life, shifting between the 1940's and the 1960's, counterbalancing the eager early loyalty with the paranoid, lonely and resentful man he becomes later in life. ""The Good Shepherd"" is a finite analysis of a man who knows what the important things in life are (family, love, friendship, parenting), but substitutes them for patriotism and duty -- perhaps as a way of restoring his father's honor.What De Niro does so well is to patiently, rather microscopically, dissect Edward's life in the world of intelligence. Every detail of this man's soul is laid bare for us to see. It allows the viewer to respect and pity him at the same time. It is probably the greatest cinematic exploration of espionage ever made. We are privy to this character's very core.Consider the multiple virtuoso sequences in which the CIA lab technicians systematically analyze a fuzzy black & white photograph in conjunction with a low grade audio tape. It is a fascinating study in detail that serves as a microcosm to the entire movie. De Niro's legendary attention to the details of his portrayed characters has quite obviously transferred to his directing. Everything of value in ""The Good Shepherd"" lays in the subtle moments... the momentary glances... the uncomfortable silences... the verbal hints and clues.Also note the fabulous exchange in a covert London counter-intelligence office between Matt Damon and John Turturro. It is a fantastic exercise in screen writing, rapid rhythmic delivery and understated, yet mesmerizing, acting. It was wonderful to watch the ""Rounders"" duo reunite and square off with some great dialogue once again.This may be De Niro's epic creation, but in terms of acting, this is Matt Damon's film. What he achieves here is nothing short of... well, nothing short of De Niro at his very best. Damon picks the bones of his character clean. It is a performance that establishes him as one of the greats of a generation. None of his contemporary peers can carry the face of solemnity and gravitas quite as powerfully as he. This role is Damon's ""Raging Bull""... albeit a quiet rage. This is the best performance of 2006... from either sex.There are many fine supporting roles on display. Most noteworthy are the turns by Alec Baldwin as the all-knowing FBI agent, Tammy Blanchard as Edward's regrettably lost first love, and Michael Gambon as the wise professor who has been in the game too long. It was also a welcome sight to see Joe Pesci in a feature film for the first time in a long while. The entire cast is first rate -- an obvious sign that De Niro knows how to cast a film with actors as precise as he.This film truly captures how lonely it must be to work in the intelligence community, especially at that time. Half way through the film, Edward receives the news that his first son has been born. The resulting phone call to his wife is interrupted by air-raid sirens and horrible static. His wife asks if he is busy saving the world. He replies, ""Sometimes. What color are his eyes?"" When the line is cut off before she answers, we empathize with Edward's decision to sacrifice his own happiness for the good of his ungrateful government.When Edward unexpectedly runs into Laura, some years after their college romance, she confesses that she often wonders what life would have been like had they stayed together. It is a poignant scene, filled with regrets of what might have been.I watched two other films in the past week that were within touching distance of greatness. ""The Painted Veil"" and ""Goya's Ghosts"" were both in need of a little more patience -- maybe they were afraid to go much beyond the two hour mark for fear of being commercially unviable. At two hours and forty-five minutes, ""The Good Shepherd"" goes the extra mile, resulting in a complete filmgoing experience. Quite frankly, it is an unassailable masterpiece.TC Candler IndependentCritics.com.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Interesting as history; Weak as ""story""","The strong, silent type was a staple of old Hollywood. There is an art to making an outwardly dull and lifeless character appear mysterious and interesting in a film - a lost art. If director Robert De Niro knows the secret, he was unable to teach it to Matt Damon. The main redeeming quality of The Good Shepherd is its depiction of the good old boy network, specifically the Skull and Bones, and its role in the creation of the CIA. The film should have been a documentary instead of a drama.Like the characters in the film, the viewer never knows who to trust, who is lying and who is telling the truth. The result is a muddle. Hitchcock would have known how to handle the story. He would have shown us some things the main character did not know, creating dramatic irony and anxiety. This film merely leaves us wondering what the heck is going on. After a while, frustration trumps curiosity. The sense of bewilderment is aggravated by a plodding, somber soundtrack that frequently drowns out the dialog. It is a weak film that needs cellos to say, ""This is ominous.""There are some very good performances in the film, but not by the top three on the billing. Tammy Blanchard is endearing as Laura, a deaf young woman who is so lovable you just want to hug her. She would be mesmerizing in a bitter-sweet romance, maybe directed by Woody Allen. John Turturro predictably turns in a brilliant performance as Damon's assistant. Robert De Niro gives us a welcome break from self-parody with a solid performance as an old-school general. Michael Gambon and Mark Ivanir both deserve kudos. Joe Pesci is good, as usual, in a superfluous cameo. Did the editors leave Pesci in because he is ""The"" Joe Pesci?For all its faults, the film is worth watching, at least until a documentary on the subject comes out.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Very thorough and in-depth, well directed and acted espionage/spy movie","This movie has a slow to medium pace which may put you off, but try not to let it, as it has a stellar cast with strong performances alround and superb direction from Bobby D.You have to follow it along quite seriously as there are numerous minor plot twists that culminate to some nice treatments in the end.This movie does not bow out and offer a cheap ending for satisfactions sake like so much of Hollywood movies. It is very plausible and has a real-life feel to it, a bit like Spielbergs 'Munich'.Very impressed by the screenplay and direction - should get an Oscar nom for something.9/10",,Anonymous,History
Fighting your inner Damon,"More than a decade after Bronx Tale (an impressive debut film as director) De Niro comes with his sophomore picture. A big one by all means. That's not only the running time (nearly 3 hours), but also the cast (for details look on the IMDb site or the trailer for this movie, also found here on this page somewhere) and the beginning/birth of the CIA!Spy business has nothing to do with emotions and that is what you are getting here (although Matt Damon's character does have empathy and does trust people, for better or worse). But you will also feel emotionally detached from the characters, too. And that is one of the few points that I have to criticize. Because overall it's a good movie! One other thing being the running time. I can't say where something should've been cut out, but it is a very long movie (although mind you, shorter running-time movies have felt longer to me).The story is told through a the course of a couple of decades and is going back & forth in time. Which is handled very nicely by the script & De Niro. Although it might be confusing in the beginning, you will understand what's going on as the time progresses! If the 3 hrs. running time don't bother you, than watch the movie, it's worth your while! Matt your spy yet?",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Slow, but had the foreboding nature necessary for good spy film","The comment by an identity-stolen soviet spy midway through this film that Russia was rust and could barely hold itself together and that the Cold War was a USA invention reminded me of what my tax man said about the IRS, ""everyone worries without cause about an audit; hell, the IRS can barely keep its doors open it is so incompetent.""Maybe Russia was incompetent and the Cold War was a USA invention to keep taxpayers paying big taxes to the gov't to support it, and to give them something to hate other than their own corrupt politicians and bureaucrats. At times during this film, I was leaning strongly toward those views, as the people shown, who were supposed to protect us, were so corrupt and wrong-headed about what is good for America that they were obviously of the same breed that is causing this country so much of its world trouble today. Remember, the Skull and Bones Society of politically ambitious, ""patriotic"" Yale men displayed so often in the film is also the secret club where the two Bush failures-as-president got their ""patriotic"" start. Hmmmm.Matt Damon as the main spy Edward Wilson was a curious casting choice for the humorless lead spy, with his ageless boyish face and big toothy grin. Not whom I would have chosen for the part, but he did a serviceable job in a glum role. I once knew a retired FBI lifer and he was life-of-the-party cheerful, so the mostly somber, life-or-death tone of the CIA lifers in this film may not have been accurately depicted. William Hurt, Bob DeNiro, and Michael Gambon were terrific as high level CIA operatives/executives, as was Wilson's deaf girlfriend, a gorgeous Judy Garland lookalike. Angie Jolie was even pretty good as Wilson's bored and detached wife but was pretty much wasted in her role.Overall, I thought the film accomplished its end of showing how seriously close we came to war during the Bay of Pigs episode, which would have been enough material for any sensible film. But, no, it was an overlong epic running the course of about 40 years, with too many unnecessary side stories thrown in along the way that damaged the pacing and flow of a good spy tale, but that is the way of Hollywood film-making these days, as one good story doesn't seem to be enough for them when ten lesser ones are possible. That way, there is ""something for everyone"", but that can ruin even a great film by trying to get all of the available paying butts in the theater seats instead of just those wanting a great spy film with no unrealistic distractions thrown in.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Interesting film...Damon miscast,"Mr. De Niro has a fine cast to work with and gets some juicy acting from the supporting characters but in the end this film flops. Matt Damon is miscast in the lead portraying a glum, repressed, shell of a man with the weight of the world, or United States, resting firmly on his narrow shoulders. Damon is a solid actor but he is not at all suited to play this part. It was probably intentional that throughout the film Edward Wilson is never really there and all Damon does in the part is wear the same pinched expression from beginning to end. It would take an actor of great skill and nuance to make this role work and Damon is not that actor. He matches his pained expression with a flat monotone delivery of his lines. Damon delivers a line telling his son how much he loves him at a pivotal moment like he was ordering coffee or reading from a file to John Turturro (who plays his right hand man in the film).As I watched the film I kept waiting for the next supporting character to show up to give the film a kick. We see great turns from William Hurt, Michael Gambon, Billy Crudup, John Turturro, Alec Baldwin, and Mr. De Niro himself. Even Lee Pace brings some nice menace to his small part. Angela Jolie in a bland wounded wife role does all she can with it and makes you feel something for her as well. I have to wonder why Jolie took this part as it is poorly written and only distracts from the main story. I would assume it was to work with De Niro and the rest of this stellar group and to her credit Ms. Jolie does a lot with the little she was given.The best part of this story is following Edward Wilson through to the formation of the CIA. This is an interesting and exciting tale but unfortunately the decision was made to tack on a family drama as well. Wilson's wife and the character of Wilson's son are nothing but window dressing to try to provide a little more weight to Damon's character. It was a horrible choice to throw this in and you could easily have summed up their part in this story in a single scene. Edward Wilson after all ignores his family through the first six years of his child's life. We also as an audience are much more interested in the world of secrets and spies Wilson is at the heart of than the details of his failing marriage. It's hard not to feel like our time is just being wasted as we snore through the family drama portions of the film.There is a lot of effort and information put into creating the world of covert operations in this film and the filmmakers would have been best served sticking with that. They do a great job with introducing us to the language of spies and their ""black arts"" and to me at least it was clear that's what interested them in making this film in the first place. Throwing in the family drama just leaves you with a bloated 167 minute film that meanders too much. They would have been much better served spending that extra time in the world of spies and the countless stories that were available to them there. I would recommend this film to people that enjoy spy films and have an interest in history and the CIA. It has its rewards in these areas but to some folks I think they will find the film is a confusing drag. There certainly is a great movie to be made about the CIA and this is not it.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"A mature, unhurried espionage masterpiece","Wow! Thank you Hulu for adding to your line-up.I love spy movies in general and was pleasantly blown away. Very surprised this wasn't listed in most top spy film collections in the same breath as ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier"".This is not a film if you don't have patience. Also it's not for you if you choose to view entertainment through modern day social lens and political correctness... some part of racial treatments will likely offend your sensibilities. Instead, take it as a fictional yet historically rooted story. One which explores the conflict between friends and enemies, love and lost, and ultimately family and country. The cast was great! MattD did a great job playing the main role. Quiet, at times uncomfortably so, but the stoicism only magnifies his gravitas and a sense of strength.In the finale, the movie won't offer you convenient and tidy answers, but it did leave me breathless with how everything was tied together neatly with a bow.

"Slow, boring and disappointed","Sorry to say but this Movie was a HUGE disappointment in my opinion. Please, do NOT get me wrong, the performances from Damon and Jolie were great, although it's not always about the performance. I think Mr. DeNiro forgot that we'd be sitting in a dark stuffy room for 2Â½ hours while watching this flick.Basically the pace of the movie is extremely slow and drags and drags and drags, without advancing your feeling throughout the movie, thus making it boring. I felt like I was on a treadmill, the movie was going, but it wasn't going anywhere. There were constant flashbacks that made it very confusing as well. Also, it's a story on how the CIA was born so there was a lot of speaking in code which made it even more confusing. I think only someone who is employed in a similar profession as Damon's character would understand, appreciate and enjoy this movie. The only thing I kept thinking was, ""How much longer until the end??""Definitely this is NOT DeNiro's best movie while behind the camera in my opinion. Personally my favorite of his while director, A BRONX TALE. That movie is brilliant.In conclusion, I'd wait for the DVD so you could stop it when you decide you've got better things to do than watch this movie.

People will watch this film because of the stellar cast,"Robert de Niro stars in, produces and directs The Good Shepherd, a story based on the life of the founder of the CIA's counterintelligence operations, James Jesus Angelton (Edward Wilson in the story).People will watch this film because of the stellar cast: Matt Damon plays Wilson and Angelina Jolie plays his long-suffering wife Margaret. Robert de Niro, Billy Crudup, Joe Pesci, William Hurt and Alec Baldwin give ample supporting roles. While Jolie believably ages through the story, Damon doesn't seem to age at all; however, he remains as quiet and stony-faced as his character.While the cast generally delivers on the acting front, the movie needs sharper editing; it runs on too long. The exposition sometimes has sparks of brilliance but overall it can be tedious.Also, the situations can be quite ridiculous. I find it unbelievable for Wilson to be forced to marry Angelina Jolie (hello!). Also, with their genes, how could they have borne such a stupid and ugly son (bad casting!)? How he is able to become a powerful veteran operative was also not satisfactorily shown; it is just narrated and taken as fact. He shows dedication but not passion; it seems he has no reason to stay on at his job if he is so detached from everything, even from his son whom he claims to love.The movie ends abruptly, despite the length; there seems to be no justification in the end.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The Good Shepherd is a Bad Movie,"The Good Shepherd begins near the end which, in this case, is the immediate aftermath of the international fiasco colloquially known as the Bay of Pigs. Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is a highly placed agent of the CIA who had much to do with the battle plan and who must now fight for his very career and reputation. He's certain there's been a leak, and he determines to find it before he can be entirely disgraced. As he frantically works, he searches his own memories of how his current circumstances eventually came to be.In the form of flashbacks, we see Wilson as a young child who must deal with the trauma of the death of his father, career military man Thomas Wilson (Timothy Hutton). Later, during Wilson's days at Yale University, two things happen that will have a lifelong impact. First, he meets the pretty Laura (Tammy Blanchard) studying in the library. And second, he's invited to become a member of the secretive Skull and Bones. For awhile, he enjoys the fruits of both relationships. But his plans again veer off course when a fling with the sister of a Skull and Bones Brother (Margaret Russell, played by Angelina Jolie) results in her pregnancy.Wilson does his duty and marries Margaret. But even as he's going through the mechanics of getting married, he's propositioned by another Skull and Bones alum, the formidable General Bill Sullivan (Robert DeNiro). The general tells Wilson he's been tapped by the president to create an intelligence agency and he wonders if Wilson might not be interested in getting involved. It's difficult to tell whether Wilson accepts more to get away from Margaret's attentions or to fulfill his own ambitions, but accept he does and he's promptly shipped overseas.Wilson isn't home for the birth of his son, Edward Junior (played as an adult by Eddie Redmayne). He's too busy moving up the ranks and behind the scenes of clandestine international intelligence intrigue. And through it all, he begins to learn secrets that have a bearing on everything from his own personal life and loved ones to the very security of the country.Matt Damon is good as is Angelina Jolie (no big surprise there). My only real complaint about them is that neither ages convincingly over the course of a story that spans some 30 years. That is, of course, the result of make-up that's too subtle, but it's also the product of body language that just doesn't fly. Robert DeNiro is terrific in front of the camera (again, not much of a shock), and I really loved William Hurt's performance in The Good Shepherd. Tammy Blanchard was also particularly impressive. Eddie Redmayne, however, managed to get on my nerves in a big way with his effete over-the-top wide-eyed and eager-to-please performance. While this could also be a directorial flaw, I'm inclined to blame it on the performer here.The Good Shepherd was directed by Robert DeNiro. The project, a decade-long labor of love for DeNiro, was artistically handled, but I'm of the opinion that there was too much art and not enough substance. The inception of the CIA should be a very interesting story. Some behind the scenes tales of the secretive Skull and Bones should also be fascinating. But the combination of flashbacks and brief, often seemingly unrelated scenes evokes the effect of a strobe light at a party. It's cool to watch, but it makes everything seem jerky and some brief glimpses appear entirely out of place. In the end, while I understood what was happening, I didn't really care because the audience had simply been pushed too far aside. Perhaps the focus was too broad, and the movie should have dealt with either the CIA or the Skull and Bones.Of course, nothing so disjointed can be laid solely at the hands of the director and editors. The screenwriter is also very much to blame. This is a little hard to understand given that Eric Roth has such gems on his rÃ©sumÃ© as The Horse Whisperer and Forrest Gump, but the script here is never-the-less not as good as it should have been, and at least as far from as good as it needed to be. That's unfortunate all the way around since the possibilities were almost endless until they were dashed far too early and in a regrettably unsatisfying way.While The Good Shepherd is pretty to watch and has moments of genuine horror that ring terribly true (a torture scene involving a Soviet defector and the ultimate fate of an enemy agent who really only wants to retire to a normal life are particularly disturbing), it doesn't do its subject matter justice. In fact, it doesn't even come close. Even the moments of genuine artistry or flashes of brilliant performances can't save it. The bottom line here in my opinion is that those interested in either the CIA or Skull and Bones should read a book.FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Good Shepherd is rated R for ""some violence, sexuality, and language."" I'd call the movie a ""soft"" R in that the sex is far from graphic, and most of the violence is implied rather than seen on screen. What most makes The Good Shepherd suited only to mature audiences is the method used to tell the story. It would be confusing at best for those who don't pay rapt attention or for any who need a bathroom break during the course of what is a relatively long film . Frankly, though I didn't need any breaks, I had problems with the ""rapt attention"" part myself. I caught myself planning a grocery list a couple of times during the evening. If anything sums up just what I thought of The Good Shepherd, it just might be that.",4.0,Anonymous,History
The Wolf Shepherd,"Robert de Niro takes us into the dark world of the CIA with his film, 'The Good Shepherd'. The sacrifices involved, the lies, betrayal, scapegoating, murder and gradual loss of humanity is all rather evident in Edward Wilson's profession. Throughout the entire film Edward is rather quiet, observant, depressed, confused or stressed. The only light of real happiness in his life seems to have been Laura, the woman he wasn't destined to be with.He proves to be quite a crafted director. The way he sets the tone with subtlety, basically allowing the viewer to understand what happens without seeing it take place, and the way he tells the story, draws the viewer more towards Wilson's dark, depressing and dangerous world. A little historical knowledge may be useful but 'The Good Shepherd' does not demand that much from the audience where American history is concerned nor does it attempt to be a lecture of that subject. The first rate cinematography, skilled use of lighting and tense score are brilliantly effective.Robert de Niro assembles a stellar ensemble. Matt Damon is rightfully cast in the part of Edward Wilson. He delivers a subtle, intense and studied performance and ably carries the film. The supporting cast that includes well-known names like John Torturro, Angelina Jolie, Alec Baldwin, Tammy Blanchard, William Hurt, Billy Crudup, Lee Pace and Michael Gambon excellently fit their parts and do full justice to their roles.'The Good Shepherd' takes place over a considerable period of time and the character's aging is not well displayed. While the younger actors like Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie and Lee Pace look older, the more experienced actors like William Hurt and Alec Baldwin look the same throughout.

A man's career overtakes his life,"Matt Damon stars in ""The Good Shepherd,"" a 2006 film directed by Robert de Niro. It also stars Angelina Jolie, Michael Gambon, Tammy Blanchard, Alec Baldwin, Joe Pesci, and Billy Crudup. Damon is Edward Wilson, who is the head of CIA covert operations during the Bay of Pigs. It looks as though Castro was tipped off, and it's up to Wilson to find the leak. While doing so, Wilson flashes back over his life, which includes his father's suicide, a college professor (Gambon) who figures into his life later, the exclusive Skull & Bones club he belonged to at Yale, his own recruitment into the OSS, a quick marriage that cost him his true love (Blanchard), his long-distance marriage, and the lack of relationship with his son. Finally, in the present, he's faced with an agonizing decision.The performances are all good, and the film's flipping from the past to the present and back again is interesting and well done. It's a dark movie, with the introverted performance of Damon hanging over it. He's really terrific; he underplays, and you feel the solitary nature of the man and the feelings seething inside him. Only occasionally do they emerge, and his performance makes those bigger scenes all the more powerful.De Niro has assembled a wonderful cast, all of whom have outstanding moments. Jolie as Edward's alcoholic wife is effective; Blanchard is heartbreaking as Edward's true love; Gambon is his usual excellent self as a professor with a few secrets. But at the core is Damon himself. As a young man, he could have gone the Matthew McConnaughey route with chic flicks. Instead, he became an actor of quality in some substantial films.This isn't the most exciting film you'll ever see, but it is absorbing.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The Good Shepherd,"The Good Shepherd I had read the movie is long and that was one of the factors that I could not see it even after 4 weeks of its release in Amsterdam. This week no good movies were released and thus the stage was set for me to go and enjoy this Robert De Niro's third directorial movie.The story is about Edward Bell Wilson's life Â– from being a poetry student to being a civil servant in World War II, and later called to be part of the CIA (in the second half of the movie). It is a story about being torn between love, family and duty to the country. The movie runs in two parallel tracks Â–one of 1961 and the other of 1940s - with a bit of third track about the childhood of Edward Bell.It movie starts in 1961 with a love-scene recorded by CIA and they trying to trace the origins and unrevealing the secrets behind it. In doing so the story of Edward Bell is told to us Â– his childhood, his family, his love-life, his marriage, his wife, his son, and most importantly his job. I would not disclose the mystery of the love-scene and spoil your show, yet I would tell you that after the mystery of love-scene is revealed, there is a final note that captures the essence of the movie. I won't tell you that too.I liked the movie. It is technically very well made; it has strong script, tight screenplay, good editing, cinematography, sound-track, production details, art direction, direction and good performance by Matt Damon as Edward Bell who is the central protagonist of the movie.The mood of the movie is somber. I think it was intentional. It is slow paced Â– but interesting. Once the audiences agree with the aspects of the movie, the movie is enjoyable. Otherwise critically looking Â– it is laughable at times, and I will tell you why. I have four comments.First, the character of Edward Bell is unreal (I know it is based on true real life character). It is one dimensional and stony.Second, the way the period and people are captured is also unacceptable. Everyone talking in the same tone and mood Â– does not reflect the periodic richness of emotions it had. One scene stands out as a sore thumb is when our actors are walking on the bombarded side of East Berlin. The scene, music, the people Â– everything looked staged and characters devoid of anything going on around them talking of Swiss chocolate. That was funny.Third, even though the story and the main character are depicted for a 20-25 year period, the character remains the same in looks. Robert De Niro forgot that by graying a few strands of hair and making the person walk and talk a bit slowing does not depict age. I think he fails miserably in this aspect.Fourth, is Angelina Jolie suffering from some disease? She looked so bony and emancipated due demands of modern beauty that she looks shockingly unbeautiful.The intention of Robert De Niro would be to make a movie for Oscar run, it is a good movie Â– but not for Oscars this time.(Stars 7 out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,History

"A Great Cast, A Disappointing Result","Disappointing. What else can you say about a film that is much less than the sum of its parts? Second-time director Robert DeNiro does a credible job with this story about the CIA and the inner rot and sickness that must result from an organization based upon secrecy and lies. But the story itself lacks drama as told.Sporting one of the greatest casts ever assembled, ""The Good Shepherd"" follows predictable plot lines and regurgitates the commonly accepted history of an organization that seeks to make laws, not follow them. How can you lower your expectations when a film features Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie, Alec Baldwin, Robert De Niro, William Hurt, Timothy Hutton, Gabriel Macht, Lee Pace, Joe Pesci, Eddie Redmayne, John Turturro and others?Damon's character, Edward Wilson, is at the center of every scene. He is played as a solitary, emotionally-detached, emotionless drone who feels more like a victim than a perpetrator.The plot is disjointed. And, perhaps more importantly, it lacks a point of view. Not that we need to be told what to think, but a film that lacks a consistent or comprehensive viewpoint is like a ship without a rudder: it will travel and it will arrive at a (random) destination, but the journey will reveal little except that winds blow.Edward Wilson certainly is a character buffeted by the winds, but they are mostly winds of unknown origin and hidden intent.

Poignant and highly detailed historical movie,"I was curious for years about this movie as it's based on a part of American history (the ''birth'' of the CIA) and also because of its star-studded cast. A few months ago I finally watched it entirely and I was quite impressed in a good sense.The movie is told with the eyes of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), a young and brilliant student at Yale University that joins the lodge Skull and Bones, that has the future leaders of US intelligence. He is then enrolled in the OSS, trained in 1940s London and will be a lethal secret agent first against Germans and then the Russians. In fact, everything will be rationally plotted in the name of the supreme good: the security and supremacy of America dominated by the WASP aristocracy. All this will come inevitably to a price that includes also his wife (Angelina Jolie) and son.While this film is very long at 3 hours and 33 minutes, it's still worth the watch for the following reasons. The acting is great by everyone; Matt Damon is great and charismatic as always, and the rest of the cast is chock-full of famous names: Angelina Jolie as Damon's wife, Robert De Niro as General Bill Sullivan, Alec Baldwin (in the same year he worked with Damon in THE DEPARTED) as FBI Agent Sam Murach, William Hurt as CIA director Philip Allen, Joe Pesci as Joseph Palmi, John Turturro as deputy Ray Brocco and a few others give all excellent performances. Despite the pace was a bit slow, the story was entertaining enough to outweigh the slow moments and also the music was nice in some points. De Niro's direction is slick and fluid, and he really put a nice effort.If you are a history buff, THE GOOD SHEPHERD is a must see as it's also very accurate about details.

"""Cold is as cold does.""","""There were enemies without to destroy him, And spies and self-seekers within . . . ."" Eliot, The RockThe cold war fed the imaginations of many worthy novelists such as Graham Greene and John le Carre, leaving us with the impression of spies who gave up most of their personal life in clandestine service to country. In Robert De Niro's The Good Shepherd, Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), working on the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, flashes back to 1939, when as a child he witnessed his father's suicide and began a life of emotional withdrawal, a valuable attitude for his role in the emerging CIA but an inevitable loss to his emotional life, especially with family.Director De Niro knows quite a bit about intrigue given the dark figures he has played as one of America's leading actors. His lighting is consistently low key, as if a secret world lies behind every tenebrous shot. His frame is frequently static and spare, as if the void will be filled by inexplicable pain. He knows atmosphere and he knows lonely, isolated characters, as if Travis Bickle were being channeled into Edward Wilson.Maybe too isolated. Damon plays Wilson so minimalist that knowing the interior of his character is impossible. He is as stoic as Will Ferrell in Stranger than Fiction but without any humor. Ferrell failed to move me, and similarly Damon makes me feel cheated about being able to identify in some way with Wilson. But then, cold is a cold does. As for Angelina Jolie's Margaret, Wilson's wife, she is supposed to remain an enigma because her husband has marginalized her in his life so we have no chance to hear her lonely heart.De Niro captures the nether world of espionage, beginning with Wilson's induction into the Skull and Bones Society at Yale (W is an alumnus, not the best endorsement for the group's integrity), infamous for its secrecy and nurturer of national leaders, and ending with the Bay of Pigs loss and the challenge to his family unity.",,Anonymous,History
"Interesting, but hindered by its length","I am a big fan of Robert DeNiro. And when I heard about his official second picture, The Good Shepherd, I was very excited and intrigued all at once to see it. I waited for months for a trailer or even a hint at whether or not the small Oscar buzz was actually right about the film. I was saddened by the dying buzz, and even more so when I heard some of the reviews.The Good Shepherd is about the ""birth"" of the CIA and centres around Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), a fictitious character based on a real life person(s) involved in its creation. The film starts out with the botched Bay of Pigs operation in 1961, and continues to jump back and forth between the days that followed and Wilson's past before that moment. Starting with his moments at Yale and his eventual induction into the ultra-secret ""Skull and Bones"" group, it continues onto early savvy and spy-worthy tactic moments abroad during World War II, and then through the Cold War up until the Bay of Pigs.But The Good Shepherd is not primarily all CIA and political-based. There are many moments featuring Wilson's first love, Laura (Tammy Blanchard), a deaf woman he meets at school, and even more featuring his wife Clover, who later goes by Margaret (Angelina Jolie). As well, many of the key moments in the film are directed towards his relationship with his son, Edward Jr. (Eddie Redmayne as an adult, Tommy Nelson as a child), who he only meets after returning home from the war.On the whole, DeNiro's sophomore effort works well, but only to a point. It is excellently crafted, and the conviction he has for the work is shown throughout. The one thing that holds it back from being a true marvel or the so-called ""Godfather of CIA movies"", is the fact that it is just too long. Clocking in at 167 minutes, the movie just could have done with a good twenty to twenty-five minutes excised right out of it. It is interesting yes, but it is not particularly thrilling in most cases and probably could have been much stronger had the film been shorter. It is not that DeNiro does not know how to focalize on something, or know when to say enough is enough. It is the fact that some scenes just go on and on aimlessly, and others just begin and end in no time. His ultimate success as a director is seriously hindered by this, and is ultimately why the film will not hit as many audiences as it should.Eric Roth's screenplay is very well done, and highly proficient in the history it covers. Yes, it may be fictionalized for the majority, but it is still quite the intriguing take on such a tumultuous time in world history. At times however, it covers a bit too much and rails a bit off course (which was a problem for DeNiro too). The cinematography excels in many areas, despite being fairly generic in many sequences. The costumes are interesting and authentic all the same. They feel slightly contemporary in a few cases, but at the same time, feel as if they are from the 1930's to the 1960's. The dresses the female cast members wear are obvious look-alikes to those worn at this time period, but some of the suits the males wear feel a bit too closer to 2006 than they do the 1950's. I also liked how refined everyone was, and how they all felt in step with the era. Many movies created now feel as if the extras are all living now, and the main cast members are trying to live back then. Here, everyone is all the same, and no one feels or looks out of place.Damon, although quite strong in Martin Scorsese's The Departed, is infinitely more powerful here. Although his character looks and sounds one-dimensional, Damon brings a sense of urgency to him. Defined by a stern and melancholic look for about ninety-eight percent of the film, he really has to work hard to show any emotion other than being angry and disgruntled. His trademark smile appears only a few times, as he stays in check with his solid frowning face. His eyes really do more of the emotional output for his character, and you can really see the intensity in them as certain things are occurring. The hurt and aging eyes he sports are the decisive factor for his character, and are what helps propel him out of one-dimensionality.Jolie is okay in her role as the neglected wife, but she really does nothing amazing here. Her chemistry is lacking with Damon, and he just does not have any strength at all in her role, disregarded or not. Blanchard and Redmayne are particularly inspiring in their roles, and really help increase the emotional intensity of the film. Supporting turns from DeNiro himself, John Turturro, William Hurt, Michael Gambon, Alec Baldwin and Billy Crudup are all well done, and very focused. A bit more characterization would have helped for most of them, as they appear multiple times, and very little is said of who they are and/or their importance to the story. Oleg Stefan is a particular standout as the Russian adversary only really known as ""Ulysses"". He really chomps into his pseudo-villainous role, and has great chemistry with Damon. Joe Pesci is a sad disappointment, as the trailers make it look like he is someone important, but he turns in barely a five minute cameo filled with preachy anti-Pesci dialogue.DeNiro's ""pet project"" is an admirable work hindered by story and editing problems. The cast is top-notch for the most part, and despite its length, the film stays fairly interesting for the most part. A bit of a polish and more focus in certain areas instead of others could have only helped this film get the acknowledgment it should deserve.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Worth the trouble, despite pacing problems","I had ""The Good Shepherd"" lying in my ""to see""-pile for quite a long time before i finally popped it in the DVD-player. I always find it somewhat daunting to see movies that are almost three hours long.This has to be one of the most toned-down movies i have seen in quite a long time. Actually this movie and Zodiac makes me think that the toned-down movie might have sort of a revival now. Most movies made are still full of bells and whistles, the pace is high and the special effects are plentiful. Seeing movies that take more time to tell the story is refreshing, although i didn't think neither this movie nor Zodiac managed to balance the pace perfectly. Both of them become somewhat slow at times, and while i did enjoy both movies, they would have benefited from a more to-the-point story and narrative.I can start by saying what i did like about this movie. First of all i think this might be one of Matt Damons best roles. I'm not a huge fan of Damon in general. He's a pretty good actor, but very stiff and lacks the edge that would make him great. Here his stiffness works for him and becomes one of the characters main features. It works great. Second i liked the whole story and layout of the movie. The spy business is interesting and this is a very down-to-earth look at it, and probably closer to the truth than most movies. Third i liked that it was about the person more than anything. How much can a man sacrifice for his job and his country? All choices and acts have consequences, and they can be very unforgiving.What didn't i like? Well, i have mentioned the pacing problem. It's quite substantial through parts of the movie. Not only is the story moving forward very slowly, it also has the habit of moving back and forth in time for a while in a way that doesn't exactly clarify things. A more straight narrative that was a bit more quick on it's feet would have been preferable. Also the running time of 2 hours and 40 minutes is a bit heavy. Even though i was never really bored with the movie, i still think that in general most movies benefit from trimming some of the fat. This movie is no exception.In the end i found this movie to be enjoyable. It shows that Mr DeNiro is a competent director, able to tell a story in a sombre pace without boring the audience. The movie does have pacing problems, but in the end those problems are far outweighed by the positive features. Matt Damon is excellent in the lead, most supporting actors are great and the movie looks gorgeous. I would recommend it, although you need to know what to expect (a long movie moving at a slow pace) and take your time with it. I rate this 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"A thrilling film, concerning the early history of the CIA viewed through the prism of one agent's life.","In 1939, while studying at Yale University, young idealist Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) joins a secret society called Â¨Skull and BonesÂ¨. Due to his intelligence and unwavering faith in American values, Wilson soon becomes the ideal candidate for secret agent. And begins working in the OSS, precursor of the Central Intelligence Agency, during WW2. He believed in America, and he would sacrifice everything he loved to protect it. But his dedication to his country and his lofty mission is beyond measure. And without realizing it, his enormous dedication to his country has just taken him away from what is most important: his family. Neither his wife Margaret (Angelina Jolie) nor his son Edward Wilson Jr (Eddie Redmayne) will be able to make Wilson abandon his risky profession. Eventually Edward arrives at the new CIA headquarters, noting the lobby's Biblical inscription: ""And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you freeÂ¨ (John 8:32). The true story of the birth of the CIA through the eyes of a man who never existed !. All our dirty secrets start here !. Who is the good shepherd? The one who looks after his family or the one who looks after his country?This is the untold and thought-provoking story of the most powerful covert agency in the world containing dramatic events, thrills, intrigue, emotion, romance and family drama. The film is quite good but it suffers from being too long, resulting in it being heavy and boring, with an hour less in its tiring development it would have been much better. Second film after Â¨A Bronx TaleÂ¨ directed by the acclaimed actor, producer, director Robert De Niro who won two Oscars for his work in Â¨Godfather IIÂ¨, Â¨Raging BullÂ¨ and who also stars in this film that spans 40 years of history of the CIA and that highlights episodes such as the landing in the Bay of Pigs (1961) or the complexities of the Cold War in which corruption, intrigue and double spies abounded. The picture is a brooding portrayal of Edward Wilson who's recruited for a career in the newly founded Office of Strategic Services (O. S. S., the predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency) and as founder and agent of the famous secret organization CIA, who sees how his morale is being eroded by the fight against the KGB. While working there, his ideals gradually turn to suspicion influenced by the Cold War paranoia present within the office. As the President named Edward the first head of counter-intelligence. Being partly based upon the founder of the C. I. A.'s counterintelligence operations, James Jesus Angleton. The cast is completed by Oscar winners Matt Damon, providing a laconic and self-contained role, whose performance also earned him an Oscar nomination, and Angelina Jolie, previously awarded for Â¨Girl InterruptedÂ¨. Along with them, other good supporting actors giving good performances, such as: Alec Baldwin, Tammy Blanchard, Billy Crudup, Keir Dullea, Michael Gambon, Martina Gedeck, William Hurt, Timothy Hutton, Gabriel Macht, Lee Pace, John Sessions, Oleg Stefan, John Turturro, the also Oscar-winning Eddie Redmayne, among others, completing the ensemble cast of this film. Special mention for Joe Pesci , De Niro's good friend, appearing in one scene as a Mafia boss, he is a fictionalized version of Sam Giancana, it's mentioned that Fidel Castro has seized three of his casinos and thrown him out of Cuba.It displays a suspenseful and sensitive musical score by composers Bruce Fowler and Marcelo Zarvos. As well as colorful and evocative cinematography by prestigious cameraman Robert Richardson. And the film garnered an Oscar nomination for best artistic direction. The motion picture was well directed by Robert De Niro, although it gets a bit long and heavy at times. His second film, previously to a long career including a string of successes as an actor, such as : Mean Streets , Cape Fear, Raging Bull , Taxi Driver , Untouchables , Goodfellas , Casino , Midnight Run , Jacknife , Fifteen Minutes , The Score and many others . Long time after, he directed a nice movie : Â¨A Bronx taleÂ¨ (1993) with Chazz Palminteri and De Niro himself, and thisÂ¨ Good ShepherdÂ¨ (2006). Rating : 6.5/10, acceptable and passable , better than average . The picture will appeal to Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie fans.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"The birth of CIA, and the man at the helm of counter intelligence","""The Good Shepherd"" is an espionage thriller and drama that is billed as an early history of the Central Intelligence Agency. It has various accounts of historical events tied to the CIA. But it would be more accurate to view this film as a bio-pic of one person who helped launch the CIA, and then oversaw its counterintelligence operations. And, of course, that is highly fictional.Still, the life of James Jesus Angleton would be a fascinating study and history. In this film, his name is Edward Wilson, and he's played by Matt Damon. Judging from what has been known and written about Angleton's persona, Damon plays him superbly. He's a quiet, keenly observant, questioning and registering person who calmly files away what he sees and hears. The film portrayal of Wilson's family and personal life outside the CIA are completely fictional. For instance, Wilson has one child in the film -- a son; but Angleton had three children, a son and two daughters.Other than the role that Robert De Niro has in the film, I don't know what other CIA characters may have been based on real life people. De Niro's Bill Sullivan, whom Wilson and others refer to as the general, seems clearly to be based on William J. ""Wild Bill"" Donovan. He was a major general in World War II and organized and headed up the OSS (Office of Strategic Services). The OSS was the first U. S. foreign intelligence service and the precursor of the CIA which was officially created in 1947.The main historical events that the film covers are the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, and the defections of two of many Soviet Union officials. In real life, they were Anatol Golitsyn and Yuri Nosenko. In the movie they are played by John Sessions and Mark Ivanir as Valentin Mironov #1 and #2, respectively.While the movie is interesting, it's also very complex and quite difficult to follow. That's because it has many flashbacks and returns, but they aren't always relative. These forward and backward changes are frequent and at times don't seem coherent. Sometimes they break the thought trend at the moment for the audience. De Niro also co-produced and directed this film. It had a huge cost tag - a budget of $80 million, with a cast of many prominent actors.This is one time, with so much information and so many details covered in the story, when flashbacks should not have been used - or used very sparingly. It would have been much better in a straightforward, chronological order around Wilson's life. It's not hard to see why De Niro used his flashback techniques. He was trying to build and hold a sense of intrigue with the central aspect of a tape recording of someone giving information to an agent about the Bay of Pigs invasion. It was built around the suspicion that the Cubans had been tipped off about the invasion and knew exactly where it was to take place to defend against it. But in the film, by the second return to that aspect - or a ""forward"" to the present (in 1961), it wasn't hard to figure out what it was they were trying to pin down. And by the third return, I guessed correctly who it was that spilled the beans. A much later flashback confirmed that.So, again, instead of using flashbacks and straining the audience, the film would have been much better and even intriguing by not using the gimmickry and instead laying out the story in chronological order. While the media reception had mixed reviews, most were generally favorable of the film though some saw it as tedious. It had a fair play at the box office, but the domestic ticket sales of $100 million wasn't enough to cover its budget, based on the filmmaker needing 50% of the take to break even.I think there is one big important message that this film has. And that's that service in intelligence agencies is almost always going to be extra hard on marriages, families, family life, and children.",6.0,Anonymous,History
One of the Finest War/Spy Films Ever Made,"I love the previous review that states that here is finally an intelligent movie that assumes the viewer is not an idiot. Absolutely agree!Please forgive me, but I want to address the negative reviewers for a moment. It is a long film, yes: would you want a film with all your favorite actors in their finest performances to be a ninety minute romp in the park?This film demands as much from the viewer as the wartime tragedies demanded from the characters. Well, not nearly as much-- we should thank our lucky stars-- but why should we expect to give less of ourselves than they had to give? This is a (largely) true story of the formation of the CIA toward the end of WWII. Why should such a movie force-feed us every bit of information as though we are infants without intellect enough to figure things out along the way?Part of the enjoyment for me is the patience this film demands from me, as I must slowly unravel the secrets, stopping and revising my previous conclusions along the way.If you do not understand the plotline of a film that every fine actor under the sun has fought to be in, the fault may not be with the film. The murky, long, dark, flashbacks may hide a method related to the main character's own difficult attempts to piece together his own past. Some artfully constructed films may bear watching more than once. Rather than leaping to a complaint, you might allow a movie to educate you in how to watch a movie, even if it is only THIS movie you are to be educated about. ðŸ˜„While some films unfold themselves beautifully upon one watching, others ask us to return-- like a great poem or a fine painting-- to take another viewing experience, or perhaps yet a third, before we can feel we have compassed their depths. I think that THE GOOD SHEPHERD is one of those films that deepens with subsequent watchings. The detail in the faces, the objects, the sounds, the voices, the nuances and shadings of spoken words: all become more crucial in this film as the viewer pieces together the characters, the story, the alarming decisions the characters make, upon a second (perhaps) viewing. To me, a second or even third viewing is where these actors' fine performances come alive. This is where you see what they put into their characters, like a painstaking jigsaw puzzle, to build to each subtle moment that makes each person into the woman or man s/he is.This was among Eddie Redmayne's early roles, and it was clearly evident to the world that he would become a force among actors in a short time. Other favorite performers for me are the incomparable Michael Gambon, whose depth, charm, and pathos in his role as Professor Fredericks I will always remember, as well as Billy Crudup's chameleonlike performance as Damon's character's schoolmate, Arch Cummings, whom I did not even recognize as Billy Crudup!In my opinion, this is Matt Damon's best acting of his career, though most of all, I must say that Tammy Blanchard's heart-wrenching performance as Laura, a sensitive, hearing-impaired young woman, haunts me long after the film has faded into the past amid accolades for others.In sum, I say this movie is well worth watching if only for the wealth of talent in it, displaying their ample accounts. If you cannot follow the story, watch it again, and take notes; it's there. Robert DeNiro doesn't waste his time on rubbish. Neither do the likes of William Hurt, Alec Baldwin, John Turturro, Timothy Hutton, Angelina Jolie, Joe Pesci, Keir Dullea, Martine Gedacht. It was worth their time. It is worth yours.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A John La CarrÃ© wannabe that doesn't quite make it,"It's a fictional noir spy movie about the beginnings of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). It ranges from 1939 to 1961, shortly after the Bay of Pigs disaster. It follows Edward Wilson Sr. (Matt Damon), a Yale University grad and an early recruit of the head of the OSS, General Sullivan (Robert De Niro) to go to Britain in counter-intelligence at the encouragement of FBI Agent Murach (Alec Baldwin). Before leaving for Great Britain, Edward has two romantic relationships--with Laura (Tammy Blanchard) and wealthy Clover Russel (Angelina Jolie), marrying the latter when she becomes pregnant.In London, Edward becomes engaged with other former Yale friends in counter-intelligence, including Philip Allen (William Hurt), Dr. Fredericks (Michael Gambon), and Richard Hayes (Lee Pace). As the story unfolds, he encounters top British agent Arch Cummings (Billy Crudup), the head of Russian Intelligence known as Ulysses (Oleg Stefan), and various double agents.Once back in the United States after the war, Edward becomes part of the new CIA. His relationship with his wife is cold, but he tries to nurture Edward Jr. (Tommy Nelson/Eddie Redmayne), the cause of his forced marriage. Interspersed throughout the film, Edward learns more and more about a secret recording the CIA has obtained after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion that may shed light on a leak within the CIA that tipped off the Russians. He also works closely with two former Russian agents who claim to be the same Valentin Mironov (John Sessions/Mark Ivanir). Edward Jr. Also enters the plot by the end.""The Good Shepherd"" is a John La CarrÃ© wannabe that doesn't quite make it. The script by Eric Roth has both strengths and weaknesses. The blandness of Matt Damon's character is deliberate and effective. The slow unfolding of the secret Bay of Pigs recording is well done. ""The Good Shepherd"" also leaves the viewer wondering if there is any honor in intelligence services, which is also deliberate. However, too many subplots and cameo appearances complicate the story, and the injection of Edward Jr. Into a central plot character makes it all less believable.",7.0,Anonymous,History
One of the WORST movies I have had the displeasure of suffering through.,"This was truly a most terrible movie. There were a few good moments-like when Alec Baldwin, Robert DeNiro or William Hurt were on screen--but that only makes up about 15 minutes worth of film! As hard as I tried, I could not believe in Matt Damon's character or in Mr. Damon's ""acting"". He simply was miscast--too old to be a college student and too young to be a man in his forties. Almost every actor seemed uncomfortable on the screen. With the above mentioned exceptions everyone gave stilted performances. With all the talent available you can't help but wonder what could have been. The script certainly didn't help--all the back and forth in time--made for a disjointed effort. It is simply just one very bad movie that should not have been made. Sometimes there IS a reason a script lies around for a long time--it is not worthy of being made into a movie.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Espionage, One Slow Step At  A Time","THE GOOD SHEPHERD may take a lot of patience to sit through the nearly three hour tale written by Eric Roth (Munich, Forrest Gump, Ali, The Horse Whisperer, etc) and directed with meticulous attention to detail by Robert De Niro, but in the end the film about the creation of CIA (""ever notice that no one these 'the CIA' just like no one use 'the God'?""). And although the script confuses the viewer by its propensity to meander over many time frames and many places, the result is a tense attention holding look at the machinations of big government and frightening big Intelligence organizations.We first meet Edward Bell Wilson (Matt Damon, who carries the film well) as a son who witnesses his father's suicide, a fact he will hide for years. He follows in the family footsteps of attending Yale, participating in the infamous Skull and Bones secret club, and progressed to join the government as an agent for Intelligence, eventually helping to form CIA and participate in the Cold War tension with Russia and the Bay of Pigs incident. Wilson is a nebbish on the surface, but underneath lies a man devoted to his country and a man capable of maintaining heavy secrets, even from his wife-of-necessity Clover (Angelina Jolie) whom he marries solely because he got her pregnant. He is distant, covert, and seemingly cold, a trait that he will pass on to his son whose life following CIA results in tragedy.Along the way from this personal side of the story the plot is filled with politicians, spies, Russian, moles, double agents - all the expected and needed characters for a story of this sort. The cast includes such important actors as Billy Crudup, Joe Pesci, Alec Baldwin, a superb Tammy Blanchard, Robert De Niro himself, Keir Dullea, Michael Gambon, William Hurt, John Turturro, Timothy Hutton and Gabriel Macht, each performing excellent cameos. The production values are equally strong with Robert Richardson as director of photography mixing historical footage with atmospheric cinematography, a fine musical score by Bruce Fowler and Marcelo Zarvos, and a tight editing by Tariq Anwar. The film could easily have been cut by an hour without damaging the effect, but there is something to be said for the level of tension achieved by De Niro's choices that gives us a feeling of being a part of the Intelligence schemes. It takes patience, but the film is worth viewing. Grady Harp",8.0,Anonymous,History
Espionage - Alive & Well,"I enjoyed this movie, but it's a little slow for my taste. The plot is believable, the dialog well-written, and all the actors are great. I'm not a fan of Matt Damon, but he gives a laudable, understated, performance as Edward Wilson. John Turturro also provides a boost in his supporting role (as usual). The background behind the early years of the Central Intelligence Agency was interesting, including counter-intelligence during World War II, and later during the Cold War with the U.S.S.R./Cuba during the Bay of Pigs. I'm not entirely sure if this was Robert De Niro's first try and directing, but he should continue to do so - he's definitely an actor's director - along the lines of Clint Eastwood.",7.0,Anonymous,History
An important movie that only partly accomplishes its mission,"Robert DeNiro's ""The Good Shepherd"" may or may not be an accurate look at the early days of the CIA. But it deserves a chance with movie goers because it does at least make an effort to tear the veil away from America's mostly secret intelligence community.The story that it tells centers around a young man played by Matt Damon who is recruited for the spy agency right out of college just before the onset of WWII and follows his career, though flashbacks, up through the Bay of Pigs fiasco.While the film works well as history, it is less successful as a piece of cinema because of some choices it makes. One assumes the ""Good Shepherd"" title is supposed to describe a selfless individual who sacrifices his personal happiness for the good of his country. In order to do this, he pretty much walls himself up emotionally. Such could be one of the realities of the spy business, but unfortunately, watching an emotionally constipated man slog through a nearly three hour movie is not necessarily the most exciting of experiences.One wonders, in fact, if you could have told the exact same story, but made the fictional protagonist a lot more demonstrative. After all, Damon's character is not a field operative lurking in shadows most of the time. He's a desk jockey supervising the people who lurk in the shadows.His lack of emotions does play out as part of the story line, and his long suffering wife, well played by the beautiful Angelina Jolie, finds marriage to this guy a less than fulfilling experience. Actually, this is an angle that is much too underplayed, and we'd like to know more about their relationship, including the key question -- did he love her at all.The film features a number of well done supporting roles, but hats off to John Turturro, who plays Damon's assistant and resident thug with real style and conviction.But this movie is about more than just acting. This is a film that tells a fictionalize real life story and raises a number of disturbing questions. The questions are almost too numerous to list in any reasonable amount of space. But they include, who authorizes the CIA to plan the Bay of Pigs fiasco and similar clandestine incursions into the domestic politics of other nations? The President? By what constitutional authority? The film shows CIA wrecking the coffee crop in some other unnamed Latin American country so it can topple another government it doesn't like. Again, where does the US Constitution give anyone this right? In real life, we know the CIA helped Augusto Pinochet overthrow the democratically elected government of Chile in 1973. When did the American people authorize this? Did Richard Nixon tell us he was going to do this when he ran for re-election in 1972? The frightening thing this film does shed some light on is that a small group of men, members of the Skull and Bones fraternity at Yale, conspire in secret, making these kind of decisions, because they think they know what's best for us. But, as the coffee republic segment points out, it is also what's best for these men, who often find a way to cash in personally on the skullduggery they have authorized.We see this today, of course, through the workings of a little company called Haliburton.In fact, the people we see mucking things up today, the Bushes, Cheneys, etc. are all members of the same Skull and Bones secret societies that produced John Foster Dulles, his brother Allen, and the rest of the self proclaimed patriots who founded the CIA.The real irony, of course, is that they are proved to be wrong so often. The Bay of Pigs failed, and Castro remains in power to this day, but guess what, nothing bad has happened to America because of him. Vietnam ""fell"" and America is now busy engaging it as a trading partner. Again, nothing bad happened to America because Vietnam went communist.Not only are the CIA types wrong -- blinded by their own political ideology -- but despite spending billions of dollars on their spook projects, they often miss the big things. They failed to predict the collapse of the Soviet Union, failed to predict Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and, if Bush is to be believed, said Saddam was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction when he wasn't.Don't know about most movie fans, but ""Good Shepherd"" does not make me sleep better at night knowing we are in such good hands.",,Anonymous,History
"DeNiro tries, but ends up rambling","A fictionalization of the origins of the CIA, DeNiro's second film behind the camera tells the story of Edward Wilson (Damon) who goes from university lad to civil servant to one of the founders of the CIA, which gets its baptism of fire in the heated political climate of the 1960s as it battles the threat of Communism. Of course, the paranoia and intrigue soon envelop Wilson's existence.Well filmed but less substantial and much slower than it ought to be. 'Good Shepherd' is a great idea, discussing the origins of the CIA, that is ultimately too dragged out and not incisive enough to make it stick. The political intrigue never feels engrossing enough, the tension never consistently palpable enough, the sense of how Wilson's work affects the outer world never feeling present enough. In fact, half of the film is basically a biopic about Wilson, charting his youth and civil service days, as well as his courting and marriage to Jolie's character (this a film that clocks in at over two and a half hours, may I remind you), and though not poorly written, it wears out its welcome well before we get to any secret service business. This is a real slow burner, which not always a bad thing, but here, the pacing sags a lot because of all this perfunctory material that could've been condensed to a few flashbacks or even a vignette, instead of getting to the LeCarre style spy intrigue, which is when the film does pick up, but I really question if Eric Roth's script needed to be this bulky with material.On the plus side, DeNiro is a very strong director, with some really tense sequences and intrigue in that second half, as well as a very shadowy, almost sepia aesthetic to the film which enhances that sort of 'secret archive footage' look that fits a spy tale rather well. And well, with someone like DeNiro in charge, it goes without saying he roped in a bunch of strong performers, on top of a very restrained Damon, including the likes of Alec Baldwin, Bill Hurt, John Tuturro, Michael Gambon, Joe Pesci and Timothy Hutton. This wasn't a film made with slack, but it seems like the prestige came before the substance. Well performed and mounted, and not without ambition or merits, there is simply no denying where it fell down, and that makes 'Good Shepherd' a noble but still, nonetheless, disappointment all the same.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Entertaining Whitewashing of a Fictional Version of James Angleton,"I enjoyed ""The Good Shepard"" as an entertaining movie about a fictional character. However, any suggestion that this almost normal Wilson character is the very screwed up James ""Jesus"" Angleton degrades the movie by a significant percentage.Angleton leaves a lot to be desired as any form of ""Good Shepard"" and more like an accomplished black mailer in a position he never deserved to occupy. If this movie is meant to represent Angleton as a misunderstood genius in counter intelligence, forget it. It could only be considered a crude whitewashing of a person who is more likely a traitor, black mailer, and a mole handler when all is known about the strange character.If you don't agree, read about how Robert Hannsen became an FBI counter intelligence agent, FBI liaison with the CIA, and Russian mole who was supposed to be looking for himself and other moles for years. How would this happen if Angleton was worth 2 cents in establishing any sort of counter intelligence? He was too busy blackmailing everyone.If you look at this movie as pure fiction, it comes across far better than any real look at how the Skull & Bones, CIA, or other agencies operate. The romantic introduction of Angelina Jolie as ""Clover"" helps significantly, along with the less than ideal married home life.The story of a fictional life of a CIA recruit taken with continuous grains of salt and artistic license combines with a minimal look at how organizations that might network together produce people who take themselves too seriously is what we get. Reality is far cruder, and far less heroic.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Interesting and a little confusing at times,"This movie definitely has its ups and downs. The story has about fifty subplots that do tie together eventually but keeping track of everything is difficult. I can recommend this to any person though over 13 is better. The acting is one of the many good sides of this movie. Angelina Jolie against all odds was absolutely fantastic as Edward Wilson's wife. Robert De Niro played the general very well. Abother thing about this film that others always lack is the dialogue. Quotes from this film are still running through my mind. Lastly, finally we have a movie about spies that does not involve a bloody gun fight ever five minutes. This movie instead skips that and shows the trauma of Edward Wilson one of the first members of the CIA. In this movie it isn't about gun fights. It is about reflection and making choices about family, job, friends and country. Due to its confusing web of subplots you probably won't like it the first times but watch a few more times and pay careful attention to the dialogue (in this movie words tell more of the story than actions) and you will come to realise and see what a great movie this turned out to be.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Good Movie but meant for Home Viewing,"First let me tell you guys that i am a huge De Niro fan and anything that he has done so far has impressed me .... no matter how un-successful some films have been in Box-Office.But after watching this movie i genuinely felt that this movie can be enjoyed more in a DVD at the convenience of home comfort.This movie needs lot of attention to details and concentration and is definitely slow paced no matter how interesting the plot or the acting is.Thats why watching this movie in a theatre can be pretty daunting.I guess majority of favourable reviews in this thread have come from people who have watched it at home.But that said i would like to point out that the DVD pretty much sucks with almost NO Extra Features, No Interview or Behind the Scene stuffs.Just a few deleted scenes have been added and thats all.But i still believe that Robert's first directorial effort ""A Bronx Tale"" was more enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Disjointed & tedious,"I tried staying with this movie for an hour or so but it was so disjointed and tedious I finally gave up on it. I agree with another reviewer that the cinematography is good, but that cannot make up for the fact that the movie jumps all over the place without warning, which adds to the confusion. (At one point we're involved in the Bay of Pigs fiasco and the next we're in 1939.)I suppose the writer and director knew exactly what they were doing, and perhaps all of the disjointed sections of the story were tied together neatly at the end. If so it would require some serious twine.IMO a new viewer will find it very difficult to follow the story. DeNiro is fine actor, perhaps he should have stuck with that.",3.0,Anonymous,History
through deception know the truth,"Whilst reading John Le Carre's ""Absolute Friends"" I happened to see this Robert de Nero directed film. Both spy thrillers; both are stories about the abandonment of family for the ideals of State (Good Shepherd) or Beliefs (Absolute Friends). In fact in both all values are lost to an assumed greater cause. In my opinion the book has more depth; certainly depth of character. The film charts the evolution of the CIA as seen through the experience of Edward Wilson (Damon) through his college years at Yale to his humourless and quiet dedication as one of the CIA's eventual masters. Only star missing is Dame Judy Dench. But, who IS the Good Shepherd of the title? Not Edward Wilson; the word good could hardly apply to him; he's brilliantly played by Matt Damon as a cold psychopath; all 3 Brits acting in the film are double spies; Wilsons underling and overlings kill easily. His son is forever frightened; everyone deceives everyone. The only spy I ever knew was a decent chap; with humour and courtesy; he got blown up by the IRA. No mention of the CIA's involvement in that terrorism; although this was set in the era when it was learning its subversive craft. A thought provoking film. Why look at the CIA at its inception rather than what tricks it does now? Who is the Good Shepherd? Do you have to be deceptive to know the truth?",7.0,Anonymous,History
Tired of Matt Damon,"Is it just me or is anyone else sick of seeing Matt Damon in lead roles? I don't think he can carry a movie of this caliber. Personally I think he got lucky being cast in The Departed.He's pretty much expressionless throughout the film and the casting is downright strange. Angelina Jolie as his wife? Makes no sense to put her in this movie. The skinny kid as his son? How on earth did that guy get a job? Matt Damon is plain unconvincing as a father.Then again, De Niro is not exactly know for his great casting picks. Chazz Palminteri anyone? To be fair though, I think the pacing and the subtle story is written extremely well. Not quite 'The Godfather of CIA movies' as described on the DVD case, but you can sense the potential. Unfortunately let down by an incongruous cast.Note to Hollywood: Please stop casting Matt Damon in action/thrillers.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Utterly overrated,"This is a fine movie, but nothing more. Reasonably well-told story, using time shifts as a interesting (though hardly original) narrative technique.But it's boring, and doesn't have any artistic merit to make the boringness worth sitting through.Matt Damon, as usual, just plain sucks. You can say that his character in this movie is emotionless, and that explains why Damon displays no emotions of any kind. But then, how do you explain all his other movies? The guy makes Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson look like they have a wide range of expression. Christ, Bill *Murray* has more acting talent than this guy.Angelina Jolie, likewise, delivers a third-rate performance. To give her credit, her character and her character's behavior make no sense. Did the best she could, I think.Yawn.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Could have been very interesting if it had been more focused,The Good Shephard could have been more interesting if it had focused more on the relationship between fathers and sons. This movie by Robert DeNiro was trying to be a historical account of the CIA inception which is nice but not exactly the kind of subject to keep people interested for almost three hours. My husband I think was really disappointed when nothing blew up every five minutes and I tried to tell him before we went to the theater that this movie was not Spygames or James Bond. It was interesting and Matt Damon's character was nice to follow but it would have been better is they had cut out the husband-wife ridiculousness and concentrated more on the father and son relationship. In fact it should have focused on all the father and son relationships as more of the Lilly White Men in the movie were following after their fathers.,6.0,Anonymous,History
"Oh, no, Joe!","I think my friends must think I am the biggest freak in the whole world because I was crying after this film. I was so looking forward to seeing Joe Pesci, I mean the man hasn't done a film in almost 8 years, he's one of my favorite actors as well with Robert DeNiro, so this film was so exciting to me. Especially when I heard that Robert had turned down The Departed to work on this film, I could only think of how wonderful this film was going to be, I also promised myself I would never dislike a Robert or Joe film. Joe! Oh, my God! I cannot believe how he looked! It was so strange seeing him so aged and he was only in 2 minutes of the film! Robert, I just don't understand what encouraged him to do this film.Basically The Good Shepherd is based around the C.I.A. and Matt Damon. He is an agent who as a young boy found his father dead from suicide. But a clip of a man and woman making love keeps being brought up, we're not sure where it's going at first, but we realize there may be something going on deep in Matt's family, he realizes after a letter his father wrote, he has become him, maybe worse. Espcecially since he wasn't a good husband or father, only dedicated to his country and when he took the most important things in his life seriously, that's when it's too late.I so badly wanted to love this film, I really did, but it was just so slow and agonizing to get through with Matt Damon playing the lead, he's a good actor, but he's not leading man material. He is in every scene of this movie, now mind you this is a 3 hour movie, but it seemed like he only had maybe 20 lines, I mean, Robert could've cut some scenes in the film, now it's not that I don't mind a 3 hour movie, but it just wasn't a necessary length since it was mostly dragged out. And Matt just kept on making deep serious looks throughout the film, I just couldn't see him in this role. But I don't know honestly, like I said, so much was built up for me and I over all was pretty disappointed.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
Mediocre Movie,"I saw the movie yesterday and was rather disappointed.First of all I fail to grasp the story. What is the essence of the film ? When you are in espionage business, you lose your private life ? Well, might be true for a few businesses.And about the performance of the actors... How one can say that they were great performances is a mystery to me.Jolie and Damon fail to be believable both as young adults and as mid-forties. Damon offers no real feelings, which is part of the character, but how this can be a great performance remains hidden to me.I heard a lot of bad things about the movies, it being too long and boring. This is not the case, while it is rather slow, I was interested the whole time. But I failed to see the story, one day later the movie already is rather blurred in my mind, which usually only happens when I am under the influence when watching a film.So, in retrospect, while not being bad the whole film is clearly no masterpiece, since it lacks both a good story, a clear message and great acting.6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A masterfully crafted film reminiscent of the classics,"I have not seen a movie that I have been happy with for over a year, and I was very pleasantly surprised with ""The Good Shepherd"". The plot is intricate and keeps throwing twists and turns throughout the film. In addition, this film has single-handedly changed my opinion of Matt Damon. He was absolutely excellent in this thrilling drama, and in my opinion is worthy of an Oscar nomination, as is most of the cast. Robert De Niro showed absolute mastery in his direction of Eric Roth's screenplay, and the whole quality of the experience truly reminded me of such epic classics as The Godfather. ""The Good Shepherd"" is long in duration, but keeps you on the edge, making the time fly. Plus, the movie is truly star-studded with many of the supporting roles played by Hollywood Heavyweights. If you love dramas, political espionage, or just an excellent character-driven film (the depth that De Niro gives these characters is amazing), you will LOVE this movie!

It was awful,"Too long and boring. the story was very disconnected. in fact, there was hardly a believable story. many scenes were extremely disjointed. it didn't allow you to get attached to any of the characters. it was so hard to follow that I just wanted to leave the theatre. I was frustrated. Damon's robotic acting was dry and depressing and was not believable. We go to see a film to be entertained. We didn't want to have to sit there and have to try so hard to connect the numerous subtle transitions in each scene. You were constantly left one step behind to make the connections. And as soon as you did make the connection, many of them were scenes unnecessary to the film. they were stupid connections...many of which were not relevant to the weak story line. For instances, Damon and Joile had a one night stand. She gets pregnant. Her brother tells Damon ""you'll do the right thing."" OK, shotgun wedding, loveless marriage. They don't see each other. they both have affairs. the scene with Joile showing all that emotion over seeing the pictures of his secretive affair that she claimed humiliated her,was stupid. i didn't connect with that at all. it didn't add any value to the film. There was no scene to connect you with the son falling in love. So, I absolutely cared less about them throwing her out of the airplane and I didn't feel for the son's loss at all,or anything or anybody else. OH, I GET IT.

Do Not Waste your money,"With a cast that includes Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie, William Hurt, and Robert DeNiro, you would assume the movie would be entertaining. This is exactly what was lacking from the film. It never peeked an interest, raised an eyebrow, or even drew a smile. This movie lacked a motive, a climax, and most importantly an ending that would be expected with a movie about the CIA. Rolling Stone magazine called it ""The Godfather of CIA movies"". Whoever the writer for Rolling Stone was should be fired, because the only thing that could possibly compare this movie to any Godfather movie would be Robert DeNiro and Francis Ford Coppola(who was an executive producer). In all fairness, the acting was good,as expected by the 5 Oscar winning actors in the movie, and DeNiro did a good job of directing. As far as entertainment goes, I'd rather watch House of Wax, at least I would get a chuckle from that. It now makes sense why this movie was snubbed by the Golden Globes.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Was there any point to this movie?,"My wife and I went to see this movie attracted by the cast and our fascination with the world of espionage. The first 30 minutes of the movie was so dull that I fell asleep. In retrospect, and based upon my wife's assurance that I missed nothing, this was probably the best use of my time. In the ensuing 2.5 hours, I still don't think anything happened. I say ""think"" because there may have been some deep meaning that we, as non-Americans, missed. However, judging by the dazed look on most of the movie goers faces as they left the theater, I don't think we were alone in our confusion. (Avert your eyes now as I'm about to reveal what I think the point of the movie may be). If there was more to this movie than ""country first"", can someone explain it to us? 2 days after seeing the movie, we still haven't worked out whether the ending was interesting, simple or confusing. Another theory we are contemplating is that they forgot to finish the movie (or was it that they forgot to start it?).

A Nutshell Review: The Good Shepherd,"A shepherd tends to his herd, and keeps a lookout for that wolf in sheep's clothing. Robert De Niro directs The Good Shepherd, written by Eric Roth (who also wrote Munich, Ali and The Insider), a tale about the early days of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), its founding and the black eat black world of spy versus spy, as seen from the fictional Edward Bell Wilson (Matt Damon), tasked with the responsibility of setting up the all important counterintelligence wing.Clocking in at almost 3 hours, it is time well spent, as you observe how this side of the world really works - with its truth, supposed truth, and fabricated lies which look very much like the truth. Through Edward's experiences, you realize, just as he was warned very much early, that things are always not quite they seem, friends can be enemies and enemies friends, and that the only person you can ever trust, is yourself. And sitting through the movie, you'll feel somewhat frustrated as you also partake in trying to make sense of statements, of trying to figure out just who's who and who's right (or not) in this double-triple crossing world where betrayal and distrust are tasks to handle day to day.And does this constant looking over your shoulder and distrust affect your personal life? Sure. We see how Edward's own is a little screwed up, and while he keeps his serious demeanour on all the time, he's actually quite a Casanova. Trapped in a loveless marriage with Margaret (Angelina Jolie) with whom he married out of responsibility, we see how his profound deep sense of patriotism always put his country above self and family, thus bringing in so much tension, and it seemed to show that men in his position, have a hard time with work-life balance.The ensemble cast makes this picture very riveting to follow, and Matt Damon trades his fisticuffs as Jason Bourne for a more stoic performance as THE man within the circle of trust who's entrusted with the responsibility of learning from the British, and then setting up the counterintelligence team from scratch. Rarely smiling, strict looking, and possessing this no nonsense attitude. Being on the hot seat, he puts in quite a one-dimensional performance for the character of Edward, but you can feel his pain and dilemma of having to be the best character judge out there. Angelina Jolie has yet another flower vase role, with nothing much to do except to exude pain from within each time she gets rejected by Edward emotionally.The narrative is fractured and there's a constant flashback which weaves itself into the current timeline, making the flow quite jarring at times. By not having a younger actor for Edward in his youth, you'll have to rely very much on the dates that are shown to put yourself in the correct timeline. Up until almost two-thirds of the movie does the past catch up with the present, and it becomes easier then. Despite being billed as a movie about the founding of the CIA, you don't get to see that much, and the Agency more or less just sprang into existence in the movie.Despite its flaws, those who like the usual spy-vs-spy movies will enjoy The Good Shepherd. However, do bear in mind that this is not a fantasized stylized action movie like Bond or Bourne. There's no big-bang action pieces, but plenty of mind games, behind the scenes, and in actuality, a personal story of one man's struggles with grave worldly uncertainties and its share of shady characters.",7.0,Anonymous,History

The very short performances of Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci were also great. John Turturro was magnificent.Joseph Palmi (Pesci): Let me ask you something... we Italians, we got our families, and we got the church; the Irish, they have the homeland, Jews their tradition; even the n*ggers, they got their music.

The Good Shepard,"I think I enjoyed this film more than most. Perhaps I enjoyed it because I am a very political person and think so often about national and international issues. I am constantly trying to figure out which side is really right. It seems each decade I change my mind. Perhaps it is because history and its analyses change from era to era. With the exception of the moral superiority of WWII, US policy becomes, I think, questionable, throughout the cold war era and beyond. Perhaps no one is all right and no one is all wrong. This country has done some nasty things BUT so has every other country. International politics is not soft and cuddly and if one needs a teddy bear I suggest the CIA, FBI, etc. is not for you. This film, I agree, seems not to take a firm stand although it surely does give one pause as to US interrogation techniques. I think one can relate much to contemporary events and arguments against (and for) torture.The definite flaw, in my opinion, is the aging process of the actors. Angelina Jolie remains twenty something from decade to decade as does Matt Damon as does Tammy Blanchard and others. It was hard to tell the difference between the ages of Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie's and their son. That made it hard to follow and believe.I did love the performances though and I loved the subject matter despite the film's lack of statement. Perhaps every film does not have to hit one over the head (so to speak) telling us a definitive point of view but rather should spark discussion of, in this case, power politics and its necessary bedfellow -- immorality. How far would one go to protect oneself, one's family or one's country even if it meant that you had to commit an immoral act to do it? That is a good question and I cannot think of a better time in history to ask it. A warning: It is a long film but I did not look at my watch once!",6.0,Anonymous,History
Damon a master at portraying coat rack,"If you want to save money on an Eric Johnson concert, get a cardboard cutout of him and stand it in your room. Likewise, if you want to save some theater dollars, get a cutout of Matt Damon.If you like movies where the lead man stands around looking serious and speaks a line or two once every ten minutes while nothing happens around him, ""The Good Shepherd"" is the film for you.Everyone whispers. Everyone is serious. And everyone is consistently wrong, which may be the only high point of the film.Damon is a mirthless, stoic FBI agent in 1961 pedigreed by the Skull-And-Bones Society at Yale University in 1944. Later he is given a position in the CIA after it is officially formed. A few people die who might be spies, and a couple die who are. Matt stares forward, unblinking, being serious and stoic. This statue routine is quite a hit with the ladies (though it doesn't work for me), and it wins him an impromptu bones-jumping by Angelina Jolie. Damon also displays his fine acting skills by walking and wearing clothes...including a derby and birth control glasses. In one scene--which is destined to be an Oscar Clip--Damon is presented nude from the chest up covered in mud and birth control glasses. The director's imagination is astounding.So save your holiday movie dollars, spend them better on cuticle frames and shinbone polish.

The Missing Gold Miner,"Set aside whether you find this story engaging or otherwise useful in a human sense. I didn't.In such a case, what I fall back on is wondering whether it tells me anything interesting about storytelling. Its often that case that a bad story has a good metastory. And this is a natural because what viewers do is discover worlds through hints the filmmaker allows you to discover, some of them spoofed. That's what a spy does, and the most interesting spy is always the first spy of that type. That's why this story was thought to have value.But in order to exploit this intrinsic narrative fold, you need to place yourself 9as a filmmaker) at some oblique angle so that you can lever out the oyster. Alas, the filmmaker in this case is an actor, once intense, now merely famous. I've written many times about how rare it is for an actor to be able to make a whole film, or even understand the mechanics outside of acting.The art of acting is wonderfully complex, risky and rewarding to experience. But it has a different set of concerns. Its the water, and the filmmaker needs to worry about the river, its shape, banks and rapids. You need to set yourself in some dry place with shovels. You need to pan for gold. You need to fly as well as swim.This is a river as seen from inside. There's little here. Oh, and the history is not right, I am sure, and equally sure that the truth is far more interesting.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,History
A magnificent backdrop but not compelling enough,"The 'Good Shepherd' has always struck me as a kind of strange symbol for Christianity. Shepherds look after their flocks so the sheep can be killed and eaten. What's good about that? Fortunately, sheep don't have the intelligence to be paranoid.With Bourne Identity movies under his belt, Matt Damon has a good pedigree to play spy movies. Is this one a killer or dead on arrival? With a budget of $85m, we've got Oscar-winning actors, writers, cinematographers, and more stars than flocks by night ever get to see. Pet project of actor-turning-director, Robert De Niro, The Good Shepherd tells a story of the CIA from its early days, weighing in at just under three hours.The scene before the opening credits is the one which the whole movie revolves around, so get your popcorn early. Woe-betide those people who straggled in ten minutes into the film, blocking my view, looking for a seat in the dark and then mumbling into their sweetie-wrappers. They won't get it. Which is a shame, because it's a tantalisingly mysterious and artistically remarkable shot.A couple are making love. We can't see them clearly and, as we know it's a spy film, you won't need a Pentagon computer to guess it's probably film from a hidden camera. ""You're safe here with me,"" she whispers to him. Yeah right! Obviously they are key characters in a complex web of CIA chicanery, because Matt Damon and his team spend most of the movie trying to figure out who, when and where, and we have to wait till nearly the end to find out.But although The Good Shepherd is told from Damon's point of view, it's scope is epic, covering the years from 1939 before the CIA was even a speck in President Truman's eye, to 1961 and the Bay of Pigs. We see the founding years, the London Blitz, post-war reconstruction in Berlin, and increasingly intricate machinations as the Cold War gathers pace.Matt Damon (Edward Wilson) is recruited while still at Yale - and we see his face in one of the very few scenes where it holds anything but inscrutability. He camps it up in drag for a production of Gilbert& Sullivan. Later, he's initiated into a Yale secret society, the Skull and Bones. (This is a real society whose members include George W Bush and Bush Snr, as well as John Kerry.) He starts dating a deaf girl he feels genuine affection for, but she is slow off the mark and no competition for Clover (Angelina Jolie) who seduces him swiftly. Jolie doesn't feature in much of the movie, but when she does, she's as sexy as hell or acting her socks off. It's enough to make you wish she would put down her excellent humanitarian work long enough to take on more of the challenging parts for which is so eminently capable.Fast forward. A week after his dutiful wedding to a pregnant Clover, Edward is posted abroad for six years, during which time he learns to Trust No One. He also learns useful stuff like 'tying one's shoelaces' (code for 'bump them off please') and how to spot a German mistress telling porkies - and then tying one's shoelaces again. Every so often we flash forward to 1961 to an increasingly hemmed-in and worried Edward who's trying to figure out the pre-credits scene.This is not a whitewash film - most of the history has been painstakingly researched. People get bumped off or tortured, developing countries are subverted with economic dominance and espionage, and most of Edward's decisions are based on inaccurate or false information. But given what we know of CIA operations today, it feels a bit like a history of the United States that mentions, in passing, how terrible it was that we maybe killed some Indians. Instead of getting someone like John le CarrÃ© to write the script, or a CIA whistleblower like Philip Agee, we have polished performer and safe bet, Eric Roth. The Good Shepherd is a comprehensive collection of cinematic professionalism, but without the grit to make waves.Robert de Niro, in the director's chair, is sadly the weakest link. Although he handles it professionally, almost magisterially, he lacks the experience to slowly build momentum, convey gradual moral decay, or make this the Godfather standard-bearer of CIA films. He's done a fine job - just bitten off a bit more than he can chew. What he deserves credit for is attempting a classic depiction of one of the world's most important institutions and pulling it off with considerable dignity, if not quite the artistic flourish that he would have aspired to, given that his mentors are people like Francis Ford Coppola (who is executive producer). With sufficient dedication, it is easy to imagine De Niro pulling off an Oscar for direction in a future film: his grasp is very broad, and all it needs is tweaking.Of all the stellar names associated with this film, special mention should go to director of photography, Robert Richardson, whose beautiful lighting, compositions and framing give the Good Shepherd a very classy look. Using mise-en-scÃ¨ne rather than relentless action-effect, allows us time to soak up the atmosphere of lovingly reconstructed sets and adds to a feeling of historicity. Many of the English scenes are shot in subdued tones, reminiscent of The Godfather, and conveying a growing ominousness. Fades from archival footage to full colour are tastefully accomplished and maximise the effect of both. My one reservation is the over-use of unnecessary close-ups, which seems to suggest too keen an eye on the DVD market.The Good Shepherd is a slightly over-ambitious, over-long movie, but you should see it for Matt Damon's naked mud-wrestling and Angelina Jolie's hot vamp performance if nothing else. If you keep your expectations lower than the hype would suggest, you may well remember and enjoy the images of this beautifully portrayed if relatively storyless film.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Videotape vs. Audiotape,"Just a quick observation (correction) on the synopsis for The Good Shepherd. In the past I could have posted this in our discussion forum that was taken away from us by the management. I still miss it.The author of the synopsis repeatedly used the term ""videotape"" in describing the recording that Edward Wilson finds in an envelope as opposed to the ""audiotape"" that was actually delivered. ""Videotapes"" in a home consumer format did not exist back in 1961. Prerecorded two-inch size videotape had to be played on an industrial sized Ampex VRX-1000 Mark IV four-head video playback system with additional stationary heads for the sound track.

Being a citizen of the United Kingdom, I was under the impression that it was Great Britian that declared war on Germany. I just think that this film does a great injustice to all the, Welsh, Irish and Scottish soldiers that gave there lives in the Second World War. Shame on Mr Di Nero for this glaring error. Or is it just another example that anything outside of America is of no importance to America unless there is some gain in it for them???? Apart from this fact this is an extremely entertaining film, with fine performances from the whole cast, although I would point out that some parts were a bit drawn out. I would recommend this film if you are interested in political history.",7.0,Anonymous,History
a very intellectual movie for adults - finally!,"contrary to the above ""review"", this is an excellent movie, but - only for thinking adults. true, this is a relatively slow-moving rendition of the origins of the CIA shown through the eyes of its central character, ""Edward Wilson"" (Matt Damon), loosely based on James Angleton, the infamous head of counter-ops in the CIA.at DeNiro's direction, this beautifully played movie shows the audience the gray, somewhat dull world of REAL counter espionage, NOT the James Bond version. obviously, a movie is only a snapshot of real life, & the main goal is to attempt to provide a broad outline of the subject, which this movie does brilliantly. it captures the view of the elitist, who honestly believe they knew what was best for America, & this too, is displayed somewhat scarily via OSS recruitment from the very elistist Skull & Bones fraternity, which exists even today at Yale.the movie takes place at a time when the U.S. is controlled by the ""Wise Men"", and as personified in David Halberstam's book: ""The Best & the Brightest"". Matt Damon gives an Oscar performance as an introverted, same as any Washington DC middle manager taking the bus to work except he is going to the CIA, instead of an accounting job. he takes us into HIS world, showing us what it may have been like to be working in an organization that most Americans didn't even know existed at the time!to say this was boring is to express a total misunderstanding of what the subject matter is attempting to convey. the whole point was that most of the CIA's work WAS boring, everyday analytical work, not the phony crap we are subjected to in most spy movies. and, if it is sex scenes that make a spy movie, one should go see a less intelligent movie. even the most recent, and fabulous James Bond movie, has very little sex!DeNiro, as earlier pointed out as playing the ""godfather"" of the OSS & the CIA is a very uneducated comment. DeNiro is playing William ""wild bill"" Donavan, who was given the task of setting up the OSS, by Roosevelt, during WWII, which subsequently evolved into the CIA after the war. he (Donavan)populated both, with members of his own background, i.e., from the elitist eastern establishment. he was never thought of as a ""godfather""! however, the only quibble i do have with the movie is DeNiro's miscasting of himself which i can only attribute to his huge misguided ego. Donavan does comes off as a ""godfather"", & DeNiro's Italian-take makes the character more cartoonish than serious.the previous reviewer also totally misses the point of the Joe Pesci character, which was very central in CIA history, when the CIA unfortunately recruited the ""Mafia"" to aid them in the Bay of Pigs fiasco, the anchor period in which the movie takes place.it's a shame when so much rich detail is included, only to be derided, due to misunderstanding why it's there in the first place. if its any consolation, many of our moronic TV reviewers also miss the point of the movie with their mass-media dumbed-down reviews.and lastly, of course - DUH, there is very little action!! the CIA was NOT the Delta Special Forces, but a covert, deeply-hidden, analytical organization, much which involved infiltrating, passing along disinformation, & decoding - not exactly action-like as most think of when looking at a ""spy"" movie - think John Le Carre, not Jason Bourne! CIA agents don't smile, tell funny stories, are colorless, blend in sorts.unfortunately, the incredible brilliance of this movie is wasted on those who simply do not understand the nuance this movie is showing. there was no ""cool spy craft"" in those days. however, one of the COOLEST scenes does take place when CIA operatives are able to pinpoint where a liaison takes place through very hard dull work, which i won't describe due to spoiler reasons.this is a story about the CIA & its history, good & bad & gray; & where characters (as in real CIA life) whisper to each other, don't trust anyone as per the total fear of double agents which was the order of the day!if one wants a ""godfather"" moment - go see ""The Godfather""! if one wants to see a very well made intelligent adult movie, brilliantly acted, except for DeNiro (oddly) - go see ""The Good Shepherd""",10.0,Anonymous,History
CIA serious,"With a big star cast and big-name actor as director (and I enjoyed De Niro's previous outing behind the cameras ""A Bronx Tale"" and an interesting subject-matter I had high hopes for this spy-thriller, but ultimately found myself rather bored and uninterested in the final analysis.The setting up of the CIA and its interaction with British Intelligence and later of course the KGB made for intense viewing but by using a convoluted time-scale with numerous, non- sequential flashbacks, a preponderance of characters and an overlong running-time, it just didn't hold my attention enough. At its heart is a sort of whodunit as the Agency tries to unmask the leak to the Russians which derailed the disastrous US Bay Of Pigs to unseat Castro in Cuba, but you wouldn't need to be Sherlock Holmes to work who the perpetrator is so that I found myself getting ahead of the plot anticipating the inevitable outcome.Interwoven around this are various other plot strands taking in the Cambridge Communist spy-ring in the UK and the identity of a supposed Soviet double-agent, played out to a background of central character Matt Damon' life and times and his tempestuous relationship with his wife, played by Angelina Jolie and difficult connection with his son.For the so-called head of department, however, Damon isn't exactly discreet in his own personal affairs plus he rarely seems to demonstrate either the steely resolve or keen intelligence of someone so highly placed. The movie does have some effective scenes, including three dramatic executions and a shocking water-boarding torture scene obviously redolent of, at the time, recently reported front-line events in Iraq with the US military.The acting rarely rose above the writing in my opinion and while De Niro's direction is adequate and occasionally inventive he really should have edited at least half an hour off the running time and upped the pace generally.In short, a whole much less than the constituent parts.",6.0,Anonymous,History
How can you screw up with so many Oscar winners?,"Well they found a way. No plot whatsoever. You never knew what one scene had to do with the next. It was two excruciating hours of trying to figure out what on earth the movie was about. It's not that it's over anyone's head, it just never had a purpose or a point! I want those two hours of my life back. Getting into the specifics of why the movie was so pointless would have to include spoiling some of the scenes in the film, not the plot, because there was none.

The Good Sheperd: Keeps the Wolf from the Door.,"Men like Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) select a path of life set apart from society, so those living in the fold of our free system can do so, completely unaware of the man who holds the Sheperd's crook. Edward is a true patriot. The safety of the United States and it's citizens are in his hands. The elements of The Good Shepard are the life experiences of Edward and how after accepting a commission from U. S. Army Intelligence on the day of his nuptials, separates the young couple for the next six years. The bespectacled face of Edward Wilson hides the stone cold calculating heart of a man who knows he will come home from the war. He returns to a wife who does not love him and a five year old son who does not know him. The C.I.A. is the perfect government agency for Edward to continue his protecting of the flock. The sequencing of the film, is in itself a story about many secrets and who can be trusted with these secrets. Edward's right hand man Ray Bucco (John Tuturro) throughout the entire film gives a stunning performance well worth a nod for a recommendation for a Best Supporting Oscar. As The Good Shepard draws towards a close, the audience remembers that this was a period piece from the late 1920's through the mid 1960's and as Edward disappears into C.I.A. Headquarters one can only think of the next bespectacled Sheperd taking his place.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Worst movie i have ever spent $10.25 on!!,"I went into this movie not really knowing what to expect but from what i read about it, it looked pretty interesting so i went to see it. After the first half hour, it still hadn't caught my attention or the attention of my friends that I went with. Many movies are slow in the beginning but this movie never sped up and it just dragged on and on. After the first hour and a half you were just like ""Is it over yet?"", and yet when you looked at your watch, there was still an hour and twenty minutes left. Throughout the movie you would just see people walk out, and I am not saying just two or three but a good number of people. At one point during the movie I turned around to see how many people were left and many of them were sleeping, now what does that show. This movie was truly awful and I DO NOT recommend that anyone should see it but if you really want to see it and waste your money, go right ahead.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Just found the film slow and boring,"This film was far too slow paced with not enough happening to draw the viewers interest in.The lack of any elements that make you identify with individual characters is so sad, this film could have been so much more.There could have been a deeper emotional attachment by FOCUSING the people involved more intimately instead you have a far flung mish mash of events and characters and nothing really drawing you in to their world and their reason for being the people they are.You know whats sad is that when the female Russian asset gets thrown out of the plan you are jolted that something important has happened to impact a persons life, but almost immediately you get pushed into more of the films drudgery and non eventfullness.I found this one of the greatest cinematic bores of all time. I would like to see a remake with some PASSION in it! As opposed to the mindless drones inhabiting this lifeless feature.I can't remember Matt Damons character getting really angry or wildly happy just the same sombre stoic zombie state that flowed on to the whole movie.

muscular and fascinating,"It's an unsentimental story about the world's most famous intelligence agency.

Intriguing to a point,"""The good shepherd"" gives some idea how the CIA is formed! I don't know if it is accurate or not! When it comes to the spying game it always will be guess work for the ordinary viewer! Everything these agencies do are secret to the public! So how can we know for sure what is truth or not! I do think that information is the key and especially the one who controls it! I saw a lot of things in ""the good shepherd"" I liked! But there are some things that I will never understand! I am amazed that agents who have very dangerous jobs still get married! It is obvious that their jobs come first and the wife and children second! (Maintaining cover seems pointless since the adversary's that matter already seem to know who you are! Example: Matt Damon (named mother by the Russians) encounters Ulysses (the Russian agent) who seems to know everything about him but he doesn't know a single thing about him! This way having a wife and children can become a considerable obstacle in doing your job properly)! The problem is the fact that not very much is happening in ""the good shepherd""! The plot starts out very intriguing! The way this intrigue plays out however is disappointing! It could have made more impact if we learned more about Matt Damon's character and his motives! May be that I will watch this movie again and have another opinion! For now I have to say that I am disappointed and that only the cast make this movie worth watching!",6.0,Anonymous,History

No Heros Here,"The word that comes to mind to describe this film is ""melancholy"". This realistic and thoughtful portrayal of the CIA from birth to the mid sixties is bathed in melancholy. The sets, costumes, backgrounds, music are all shadows and fog. The acting - across the board - is excellent. The De Niro character (based on Donovan, creator of the OSS, precursor to the CIA) is the only one who doesn't fit into the white, Yale, upper class world of the CIA in its infancy. Be prepared for a world of deceit and treachery. The ending doesn't pull any punches, and does De Niro proud. No Hollywood ending here. This is the brutal, ugly world of espionage.

"Suffocated by its own ambition, but not that bad overall","The obvious inspiration is Scorsese and Coppola: like they masterfully handled the world of organized crime in epic (especially when it comes to the length) films like Casino and The Godfather, Robert De Niro, who won his two Oscars under their direction, aimed to do the same with The Good Shepherd, his long awaited pet project on the early years of the CIA. His ambition is evident in every frame, that's unquestionable; unfortunately, it is that same ambition that ultimately brings down a considerable part of the picture.In pure Marty style, the movie starts with the story close to its end: in 1961, Edward Sullivan (Matt Damon), one of the founding members of the CIA, is made aware of the Bay of Pigs disaster, realizing one of his men must have switched sides. Toss in a couple of explanatory conversations with colleagues John Turturro and Alec Baldwin, and then the narrative begins to jump back and forth, revealing the whole sorry tale: how Wilson originally joined a college organization named Skull And Bones in 1939 and formed a strange bond with a professor (Michael Gambon) who seemed to have Nazi sympathies; his doomed love affair with a deaf girl, Laura, truncated when he impregnated and was forced to marry Margaret ""Clover"" Russell (Angelina Jolie); his dealings with Russian and British counterintelligence, which eventually made him the ideal choice for creating a new agency inside the US government.All this is compressed in a 165-minute opus: overlong in most cases, but far too short to tell everything De Niro has on his mind. Much like Scorsese's Gangs of New York, there's a distinct feeling the director intended to cover a larger time-frame than just two decades, but was forced to back down for the sake of accessibility, part of which requires a ""reasonable"" length for the theatrical release (the DVD is a rather different matter, as seen in the longer versions of The Lord of the Rings). Sadly, that's not the film's only problem: at almost three hours, one wouldn't expect the makers to make audiences unsure as to whether they can get through the first third of the feature. With continuous time shifts that make Memento look like the most streamlined of flicks, The Good Shepherd doesn't really help its viewers follow the events easily; in fact, it almost alienates them before reverting to some sort of linearity once it's past the one-hour mark.Of course, maybe such an approach suited the subject, as this is meant to be a cold, objective look at what happens behind the scenes of covert operations: aside from one execution in the first act and a harrowing torture sequence in the second, it is all very cerebral, the center of attention being the chain-smoking guys in hats who pull the strings rather than the hit men who carry out the assignments. In that sense, Matt Damon was a good choice for the lead, Sullivan being the perfect chance to deliver an anti-Bourne. And he succeeds admirably: cold and distant, like a real spy, Damon's performance might be perceived by some as static, but is even more effective when put next to Jolie's pointless screaming. Hers is the only miscast role in the film, although Billy Crudup's English accent challenges realism at times. The rest of the supporting cast does a remarkable job, but suffers from the same defect as the plot structure: having the likes of Baldwin, Gambon, Turturro and De Niro himself (in his best acting role since Jackie Brown) in the same movie is always a pleasure, but reducing their presence to a series of cameos that are consistently alternated doesn't do them much justice. I mean, what kind of person would cast Joe Pesci in his first job since Lethal Weapon 4 (which was released in 1998) and then give him only one scene? Surely the old goodfella deserves better, right?So, it is very long, that's a given. The first hour is frustrating to say the least. The ensemble cast isn't exactly used to its full strength. And yet it's hard to fully condemn a stylish, ambitious labor of love like The Good Shepherd: for all its flaws, it is admirable for the tenacity De Niro showed by refusing to abandon the project - hardly your regular Saturday night movie, but worth at least one viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Like watching a robot for 3 hours,"After seeing the commercials for this film, I was eager to go see it. A spy thriller about the origin of the CIA, with DeNiro, Pesci, and the star of the Bourne Identity sounds like a good idea. Unfortunately it turns out to be 3 hours of boredom in which Matt Damon walks around like an expressionless robot for the whole film. Even the sex scenes were devoid of emotion.The film chronicles a young Ivy League man's rise through the ranks of the Office of Strategic Services, and its successor, the Central Intelligence Agency, from his pre-war college fraternity days to the Kennedy/Johnson era. Along the way we meet lots of shady people who can't be trusted and so forth. DeNiro is the seldom seen godfather of both intelligence services. He's in the film for like 5 minutes. Pesci is in it even shorter.Despite the exciting events Damon's character is involved in, including various hot spots from wartime Europe to revolutionary Cuba, there is no action. None. The film doesn't focus on the history of the CIA, it's really about how a young man loses his soul amongst the dark shadows, yada yada yada. There is a brief scene near the beginning of the film where Damon is yucking it up with his fraternity buddies, and then for the next 2.75 hours he has no expression, no smile, no emotions whatever. Couple that with the lack of action and the slow-moving story and I was more interested in the conversation the jerk in the seat behind me was having on his cellphone than I was in watching the movie. Even the supposed twists are uninteresting, ""who cares"" moments. There are many opportunities to see some cool spy craft, but they are lost, as is the opportunity to tell us something about the CIA's history, good and bad. Instead we are treated to scenes where the characters whisper to each other, even inside secure offices, so that I actually had to move closer to the speakers to hear what was going on.""Godfather of the CIA""? Not hardly.",1.0,Anonymous,History
SEE  IT IF YOU MUST!  As A Movie It is Exciting and Fun... But!,"This movie is largely DISINFORMATION. It suggests that the CIA and by implication the BUSH family was NOT TIGHT with the NAZI's prior to and during WWII which by many historical standards is a lie.In addition, the IMPLICATION of this movie is that the CIA was NOT complicit in letting NAZI's into the US after war when again, as a matter of historical record - many low level NAZI's were brought into the US after the war. How do I know? For one... again... the historical record bears this out... and two... I have personally met several who worked with my father for 45 years in the defense industry - AND NO... they weren't rocket scientists.Further, I pity the minds of the poor young saps that watch this movie and think that the Bay of Pigs invasion was caused by a COWARD and TRAITOR or LOOSE LIPS in the CIA. Again,... my understanding of history and if you check your research will bear this out too - The Bay of Pigs went bad because Kennedy wouldn't order AIR SUPPORT for the invasion force.All the DRAMA and the double dealing, complicity to murder, political assinatons and all that is pretty much well characterized but as I left the theater I kept asking myself what the REAL MESSAGES were in this movie. It GLOSSED OVER the role of the CIA in overthrowing popularly elected left-wing governments (of which there were so many instances we would be hard pressed to list them here)while centering the whole thing as a power trip parade around the issues of what it would be like to be a major player at CIA in its days of inception. As a thrill ride and adrenalin rush for the geezer crowd or a cerebral look at how cool it would be to be a 'real' James Bond for the young set IT MIGHT BE ENJOYABLE. Anyone, however, with a social conscience from the boomer generation will probably leave the theater feeling that they were 'slimed.'I actually laughed out loud at one point during the movie. Matt Damon's character has turned an alleged Russian Spy and low and behold they bring in the 'real' person whose identity this fellow had assumed and they beat him senseless and then with Matt Damon's permission they dose him with ACID. At which point the guy starts entering a rapture state either reaching out to his physical blood father or an imagined image of the god of his understanding and is experiencing bliss. Then in a moment of reflection and then soberness he looks at the intelligence officer and tells him the plain truth. ""The USSR is nothing but fresh paint on a rusty infrastructure and will rot from the inside."" And in an homage to the MK-Ultra program (in reality run by the CIA in the 50s - dosing unsuspected citizens with LSD) the guy jumps out the window 6 floors to his death. (I was the only one who found this poor souls experience comedy - the geezers and the youngsters were silent throughout.)Frankly folks... After the first 12 minutes I think I pegged the movie correctly! Smoke - Bullshit and Mirrors. Total Disinformation. And while I am not accusing him of being an agent of the CIA nor complicit in writing a script to dis-inform the rubes of America on the true history and roots of the CIA, I don't think Robert De Niro could have done a better job of doing just that - even if he WAS on their payroll.Angelina Jolie by the way was panned generally in the media as unbelievable in her role as the wife who lived a lonely existence in fear, dread and resentment for 25 years as her husband went for to save the world for democracy, but I thought she was very credible. I had never seen any movie before with her in it and I thought she did a great job. Great acting all the way around and even though the movie was too long, I was so rapped up in it I didn't bail midway through for a pee break.For intrigue and a look at duplicity and a general hose job on Skull and Bones Society at Yale, and for the acting I give the movie 5 stars.As for historical accuracy I give in 0 Stars. For a rewrite of history I take my hat off to the insidious bastards that wrote the script.Your impressions may vary. If this has intrigued you... go see the film. As I said I does a great hose job on the Skull and Bones Society.And the guy who played the beaten and LSD dosed Soviet Citizen should get some sort of accolade in my opinion from the academy for his bit part.",,Anonymous,History
Great Movie,"A three hour movie usually is not going to appeal to me, yet this one was just fine for an afternoon's viewing. Be sure to bring your drink inside the theater and don't go in hungry.I loved the photography that brought me right into DC of the 1960s and back to Yale in the 1930s. Someone needs to receive a reward for the photography and music that bring you deeply into the secret world of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) super-spy, the OSS and CIA. We see the almost accidental development of the current US Central Intelligence Agency from its World War II beginnings in the OSS to the present.The story gives a hint of all the old stories of how the intelligence agencies began with Ivy League recruits who managed to hold on into the post-war era and further recruit more Ivy League spies, both for good and bad. With wide-ranging intellectual talent that many of these men brought with them, they had a surer hold on how other parts of the world, especially their governments, would act in a given situation.The tough guy spy is not left out, however, but shown to be a sort of assistant who can be counted on to beat the hell out of someone or even kill them when it is in the national interest. Apparently, according to this movie, recent CIA misbehavior did not begin on 9/11 and the rounding up of Alcada suspects all over the world.You should love the stage setting scenery where we can feel that we are watching Skull and Bones secret meetings, recruiting of spies for the USA and recruiting double agents and defectors. A few blunders are thrown in to cover that part of CIA history, as are various incidents of attempts to blackmail US agents with sexual secrets. Sometimes we note that the American agents rightly do not trust fellow agents and others in their own government.Personally, there are a few things that I did not understand at all. Wilson, the iceman's, married life is one big mystery in the movie. It does give the writers a chance to show off the often frustrated CIA wife and how she can make trouble for the agent, dedicated to his job and sometimes tempted by others.A few incidents were not explained enough for my thick head and I will not go into them since asking any questions or commenting might possibly give away a little bit about this movie. That they remained puzzling is, in some way, fitting as we would not have answers in real life either.Having spent a lifetime in the State and Defense Departments, in Washington and overseas, I can say that much of the movie rang true. Without knowing any specifics many of us heard and saw enough to recognize some incidents in the movie were loosely based on true happenings.If you have ADD, this movie is probably not for you, but if you want to see a well-made drama, based on some general truth about our spy agency, then you should go see this on the big screen, not on DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,History

A great sad huge spy epic.,"For anyone who remembers and cares when Hollywood produced interesting films for adults in the 60s and 70s, titles like The Manchurian Candidate, The Great Gatsby, The Conversation, The Godfather / 2 , Chinatown and in the 80s, Tucker are celebrated and revered..... Well here is a 160 minute drama that in a combination of all of those titles, and impeccably produced by Francis Ford Coppolla.... and with an astonishing Directorship by Robert de Niro. THE GOOD SHEPHERD is an excellent and absorbing drama, a spy thriller that is about a wonderful charming youth turned into soulless man via the emotional cruelty of politics and espionage. Many parallel 2007 themes are obvious, right down to a folded paper suicide note burning down in a miniature image of the World Trade Centers falling. Scenes set in the 20s and 30s are superbly evoked and overall the art direction and set design and imagery of this expensive thoughtful film is as interesting as the grey subject matter itself. Then front and center is Matt Damon yet again fully shouldering a huge and absorbing epic level classic style drama. He is never less than mesmerizing and astonishing. Angelina Jolie is even gorgeous and fascinating in what would normally be the Sharon Stone role. Perfectly cast edited and realized this is one great paced spy drama that is as heartbreaking as it is real.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Lonely and Friendless Man Bred by His Own Fabrication and Lies,"I've been really picky with movies as time has gone on, sort of being less generous with how I rate movies that I see. The more of an authority on something you are, the more critical and knowledgeably harsh you can be. The last movie I saw, and I see at least about ten or fifteen new ones every week, that I would rate 10 out of 10 that I'd seen for the first time I saw October 6, and that was The Departed, and even though I rated it 10 out of 10, I still have had to learn to live with the original score, which is fine but so light for such a heavy film and kind of a waste of Howard Shore. I'd commented here on IMDb for The Graduate and Raging Bull, but both I'd seen before. I've finally seen another one for the first time that I cannot help but rate that high, and that is The Good Shepherd. It is fantastic.I guess it's no wonder why Robert De Niro is, as a director, possibly one of the finest of the past half-century. Yes, he's that good. I think it's because ever since 1967, he's been taking direction from nearly every legend there is. When he was barely making it in the late '60s, early '70s, he was working with De Palma, then he got with fellow Italian-who-grew-up-on- the-streets Scorsese, and also worked with Alan Parker, of course Coppola, Bernardo Bertolucci, Sergio Leone, Michael Mann, Michael Cimino, Tarantino, John Frankenheimer, Alfonso Cuaron, Ron Howard, snitch-but-good-director Elia Kazan, et al. For almost 50 years, he's been constantly watching it done by the best. If you think about it, he's learned the best way you can.The cinematography is perhaps the best I've seen all year. Somehow, the film captures atmosphere and holds it, never letting it escape for one second, and slowly it segues from atmosphere to atmosphere, subtly changing not its mood but its feeling for its surroundings, almost as if we are actually there standing with the characters. The slow, patient musical score never falls into the trap every other espionage film falls into, letting the orchestral music become tainted by electronic noises and techno beats, to the point where it's nothing but a violin or two and a cello repeating a few catchy bars while the drum machine takes over. The Good Shepherd has an emotional, elusive symphonic underscoring. The script is extensive, extremely subtle, and rich in its drawing of its characters.The film's star, Matt Damon, continually proves himself to be one of his generation's finest actors. He never takes a wrong step, or at least he hasn't for a very long time. Just this year, he matched and paralleled his co-star in The Departed, and almost precisely a year ago he was, to my surprise, a highlight of Syriana. Even though he's made some roles his own and has really impressed before in films such as The Talented Mr. Ripley and Rounders and I've never had a bias towards him for any reason, I simply nearly always would prefer to see another actor in his place. He's never stricken me as a particularly deep individual, thus I always see Matt Damon rather than the role being played by Matt Damon. However, he is really beginning to grow on me. His performance here in The Good Shepherd is one for the books. He becomes the shelled, withdrawn yet completely assured man that he plays.Angelina Jolie may give her finest performance in this film, her character so deeply sympathetic to us. Crudup in his seeming new wave of clean-cut refined roles, De Niro himself playing an unusually humble and minimal character, and even Joe Pesci in a return from eight years off screen in a scene as an Italian-American, are all very convincing performances and very very high points their careers.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Lengthy and thought provoking,"With a run time at nearly two hours forty five minutes, a lot of story was to be held and taken place. This is a film with different sections and uses flashbacks and several different non linear way of story telling. There is some clever scenes and some scenes of mystery and intrigued but also some scenes that are quite bland and drag on. The story is somewhat interesting but does require much attention to detail.One thing which is quite off is the fact that the story changes in different decades and we see very little change in make up to both Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie's characters (as in they look as if they hardly aged 20 years later). Without the subtitle card noting the specific date, this may have confused many people.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A spy with no appeal,"The biggest mystery in this so-called spy thriller is trying to figure out why so many beautiful women are throwing themselves at Matt Damon's character, a guy who is so dull, so boring, and so milquetoast in every possible way that he is one of the most unattractive and unappealing characters ever tasked with holding down a nearly three hour clunk of a movie. Damon in this movie has about as much sex appeal as a piece of stale wonder bread. Maybe if it was Affleck I could've overlooked it, but not Damon.De Niro hasn't directed another film since this one, and that's probably a good thing. Because folks, this movie is bad. It's very, very bad. But for me, the Golden Rasberry Award should go to Eddie Redmayne and his very punchable fish face. Redmayne plays Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie's son in a brilliant stroke of casting stupidity.I'll concede the guy has turned in some good performances over the years, but this sure wasn't one of them.For all the talk of CIA spy work and the toll it takes, we don't really see a whole lotta spying going on. At one point, Jolie screams at Damon, ""I don't even know what you do!"" And I said, ""Neither do I!"" We're just supposed to believe that Damon is a great spy. Ok, if you say so, I guess. He sits at a desk and occasionally takes a phone call after hours, but sure. Why not?",5.0,Anonymous,History
Welcome to the CIA,"For years, I had read about the CIA's dirty tricks, but it never totally clicked in my mind what sort of people must work there. Robert DeNiro's ""The Good Shepherd"" shows what kind of people, and the movie does a masterful job at it.We start in April, 1961, when the US is launching an the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba. When the whole operation fails, agent Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) heads to the CIA headquarters to help investigate. From there, we see his life story. They begin with 1939 Yale, and his initiation into Skull and Bones (hmm, now who does that sound like?). While we see that it's a vile, disgusting society, it can't begin to prepare Edward for the intrigue in which he's about to get involved. This includes discrediting his literature teacher (Michael Gambon).Despite his shotgun marriage to senator's daughter Clover Russell (Angelina Jolie), he immediately has to go to England to help them fight Germany. But when the war ends and tensions between the United States and Soviet Union arise, he sees it as his duty to help spy on the USSR. Moreover, Gen. Bill Sullivan (DeNiro) proposes a new agency to replace the Overseas Secret Service. So, the founding of the CIA in 1947 lays the ground work for sixty years of evil activity all in the name of national security.But one of the ugliest things that the movie shows is Edward's relationship - or lack thereof - with his family. Practically ignoring his wife and son, he always comes across as totally soulless; then again, you have to be pretty soulless to work for the CIA. And in case it looks as though his son may have spilled a few secrets to a woman in the Congo...well, Edward has no limits. And his co-workers have no scruples about spying on him.All in all, this is surely one of the best movies of 2006. Watching it, you may start looking around you, nervous about the people in your vicinity. It's that intense. When I first heard about what the movie portrayed, I got the feeling that it may have been loosely based on George H.W. Bush, although I then learned that he was never actually an agent. But overall, I definitely recommend this one.Also starring William Hurt, Billy Crudup, Alec Baldwin, Hanna Schygulla, Keir Dullea and Joe Pesci (where have those last two been?).",10.0,Anonymous,History
A flawed but fascinating epic,"Robert De Niro's direction of Eric Roth's layered evocation of the early years of the CIA stumbles here and there - not least over the casting of Edward Wilson, the brilliant ""everyman"" hardened into a not quite soulless operative by the times and the events he lives through (Matt Damon again pushing the boundaries of what a still young actor can credibly pull off and this time coming up just short, but close enough) - but over all the film soars on so many levels, the intelligent viewer has to be swept along in the sheer intellectual adventure.As with many historical works - and more than most - the more you know of the history which inspired the film, the deeper the impact of work of all concerned. The CIA in recent years had gotten a very bad rap both at home and abroad as its periodic shortcomings have been exposed and through the misguided right wing efforts to justify them or blame them on ""liberals,"" and the film does not attempt to change that, although it does show the fair minded the underlying necessity of SOME effective covert intelligence gathering agency.Roth and Di Niro make some aspects of the 50's (in the last half of the film) unrealistically dark - quite clearly neither grew up in the suburbs of Washington where many knew their neighbors worked at Langley, but few (including the wives of these employees) knew exactly what they were doing - or often, where - but the largely top drawer cast elevates the occasional ""spy/thriller"" stereotype to literature.Di Niro was able to literally pack the film with some of the best and brightest talents Hollywood and London had to offer and it shows in the hold his by turns mystifying, enthralling and heartbreaking (waiting at the church) story maintains on the audience.Possibly the best example is the young character actor who ultimately brings the balance of the film into focus as the father sees the turning points in his own life in his son's. The son is played by Eddie Redmayne, a British stage actor who has already piled up half a dozen important film credits before opening this month (April 2010) on Broadway in RED - recreating his London role in a dazzling ""two hander"" opposite Alfred Molina as modern artist Mark Rothko - almost certain to bring him a Tony nomination at the least. In THE GOOD SHEPHERD, Redmayne's range and power as the son trying to live up to a father impossible to understand and carve out his own life with the values they share gives a texture to the story and a depth to the relationships that is quite dazzling - and the film has character after character doing the same thing (especially telling performances from Michael Gambon as a possible double agent and Oleg Shtefanko as a transparently single one are alone worth the film); creating a real world where we are all to used to seeing only the thinnest of story lines.Some will be reminded of John Le Carre's THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD, a Cold War film that anticipated the end of same, but while set at an earlier time, THE GOOD SHEPHERD is both less bleak and far more sophisticated in it's story telling. Not every twist works, but the whole more than justifies the few parts which fall short.Go with an open mind on the subject and an appreciation for great acting - even in the case of Damon's over carefully restrained one - and you'll realize how much of this film is brilliant. The immediate impression of the film may only be seven of ten stars, but the afterglow is eight or nine.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Lord Moran's Diary,"When Matt Damon pulls the book off the Russian's shelf (towards the end of the move), a few books to the right is a book entitled ""Winston Churchill from the Diaries of Lord Moran"". This book was published after the death of WSC. The copyright was 1966. Obviously the movie was based 4-5 years earlier. It wouldn't have been such a big deal but they specifically mentioned WSC- ""Churchill was right~ we shouldn't have stopped until we got to Moscow."" I thought that was a rather sloppy goof on the part of the props department. How difficult is it to pop open a book to see if it was made prior to the era you are depicting? The jumps back and forth between the two eras weren't done very well~ rather confusing at times. Overall, I thought the movie was rather boring.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Testing your tolerance to the limit,"This film is about the life an agent in the CIA. His family life is in a state, and he has to find out who is the traitor inside the CIA.The film was painfully long. I thought it was boring after 20 minutes of the film, I seriously felt I could not stand it anymore after 20 minutes. In the end, I endured the whole 3 hours of torture. There were so many unnecessary scenes, and each scene was far too long. I kept waiting for something to happen, but nothing ever happened.Despite its length, there is little that was actually told. It was complicated by the fact that the story was not linear, but jumped from one time point to another. The first 1.5 hour could have been cut from the film without affecting anything. The scenes pivotal to the film were all in the last 1 hour.I seriously recommend staying away from this film.",,Anonymous,History
"Could Have Been Better, Could Have Been Worse","This movies falls into the category of ""Love It or Hate It"". If you are viewing this movie for a semi-historical account of the formation of the CIA (as I was, you will be deeply disappointed).

There is a constant background theme that the majority of the political, business and military decisions in the United States in the 40's-60's were made by an elite group of secretive men. How true that echoes with the view of today's government in which so many believe the same thing.Matt Damon puts in a solid performance, but Eddie Redmayne failed in his role as his son. Eddie tries to replicate Matt's performance as a quiet, serious & solitary man, however just comes across as stupid.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Pretty good overall,"'The Good Shepherd' is at its best when it sticks to nuts-and-bolts cinematic fundamentals: good acting, good shots, engrossing characters, engaging story lines. It is at its worst when it descends into ""evolutive"" political moralizing: the Cold War was a crack, the Soviets were never a menace, all the U.S. wanted was to keep up its military-industrial complex, the WASP was desperate to keep the Irish Catholic and the Jew out of the rungs of power, etc. etc..All the same, the film manages to pay tribute both to American history and sociology as well as to the greatness of American cinema. Taking care to show a good cross-section of the post-war U.S. society, the film manages a good send-up of the worst of Old Yankee Puritan society in chronicling the devastating effects of hard-line, Manichean detachment on life. Matt Damon's character is appropriately cold and dehumanized, unable to respond to his dutiful and perceptive (""Bonesmen first; God second"") wife, played brilliantly by Angelina Jolie. The melodramatic music recounts to great effect the banal but lovable blockbusters of the 1990s, before giving way to the chilling silence of the rude awakening along the path to sophistication.Overall a carefully if a bit too cynically crafted work. It does make for an excellent diversion on an evening when one is feeling nostalgic for times past long before one was in fact born. I certainly enjoyed it on a solitary holiday in NYC on 31 December 2006.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The Sometimes Good Sheperd,"** out of **** The Good Sheperd starts off slow and continues the pace all the way through the film. If you make it to the end, you almost want to congratulate yourself for being able to stay awake for almost 3 hours.When I found out DeNiro was going to be directing this film, I was excited as I am a huge DeNiro fan. The film is Robert DeNiro's second in which he directed. The first being the cult classic ""A Bronx Tale."" ""A Bronx Tale"" was solid because DeNiro was the set director. "" The Good Shepard"" DeNiro took over the directing job during pre-production. The film was mess before it got started.The film is about how the CIA came about. It's an interesting story that loses interest fast. Matt Damon is Edward Bell Wilson, a man who never intended to be involved in any type of government agency but had his destiny fall in the palms of his hands despite his dreams. And though he is perfect for the job and a true American, his personal life suffers because of it. Matt Damon is great in his performance and is reason number one why we continue to watch this film.The second reason is Angelina Jolie as Edwards wife. Sexy and beautiful, she plays this part with real emotion and the audience suffers with her, not because of her. This may be one of her finest performances as she is real convincing.The rest of the film is slow and sometimes hard to follow. The story is told in the present and the past and finally, they meet up with each other for an ending that is probably supposed to be surprising but isn't because either you see it coming, or you just don't care about any of the characters that it involves.All in all, it's an OK film with fine performances and some interesting scenes. It is a film that I would have waited for the DVD or even cable because at least if I fall asleep, I fall asleep at home instead of a theater chair.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"""Friends can be enemies, and enemies friends""","Friend or foe, the O.S.S. will know. This is a brilliant depiction of the early days of the Central Intelligence Agency, through the eyes of a sinister and yet highly astute man, Edward Wilson played by the very intelligent Matt Damon. Damon's Harvard Ivy League education certainly didn't dampen his ability to play a Yale - Skull and Bones Society member recruited by an even more powerful agency in its inception.This is not a film for the impatient or weak and it's not a film for anyone lacking the historical knowledge of the era. There's nothing funny about it, it's deep, multi-layered and complex. It's morally challenging and through the eyes of Wilson you'll find yourself living through a dark period of deceit and espionage, you may have to watch this one twice.With an amalgamated A-list cast every performance is superb. There's a haunting feel to the film, an eerie and elusive plot that makes the viewer work hard to comprehend and appreciate it.-Eric Statzer",10.0,Anonymous,History
Intriguing story yet not the best of spy movies,"The story uses back and forth story flow very nicely in building the background story completely and at the same time focus on the issue at hand. The espionage details are depicted and presented very nicely through the extensive help from the camera angles and zoom plays. I must say I was amazed to see so many big names performing greatly in this movie. Matt Damon performs greatly here, going out of the Bourne espionage character that made him famous, into one that is non operative yet still demands at least the same attention to detail. Angelina Jolie managed to pull out the balancing side for the story. Michael Gambon and Alec Baldwin also did well in filling in the shoes of those characters that don't take much duration.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Exquisitely well done, depressing, spy/counter-spy story","For the masterful casting and locations, the atmospheric settings and the spot-on performances, I would have rated this gem a sound 10. But the subject matter, espionage and counter-espionage during WWII and the post-war creation of the CIA from the wartime OSS and what happens to the families who live with secrets - ultimately in every area of their lives - is wrenchingly depressing, making my vote a 5. I grew up in Washington, DC during the 50's and found this film seamless in its portrayal of sets, costumes and social mores of the time. I was completely transported to the world view in which I grew up. While my family was nowhere near the government policy or social position portrayed here, the 'safe and sane' world of the fifties, helmed by war hero President Eisenhower, was a time of wholesale family and social secrets and I can attest to the Edward Jr.'s sense of bottomless, amorphous fear about the things unsaid but hinted at when he accompanied his parents into the mysterious world of grown-ups.",5.0,Anonymous,History

"uneven and gives away few secrets, a lost opportunity","For sure there are people who found this moving to be revealing and perhaps shocking. However, if you were already aware of the real history of the 20th century, it is soft, almost pablum. Only once does it start to really cut through the hype and deception and start to get at reality. I won't give it away directly but look for it during an interrogation.Most of the acting is effective and at times, excellent. Angelina Jolie is probably the biggest acting disappointment but her material was one of the weakest parts of the writing and it could be argued that giving her that role was not a good casting decision. In fact, the entire handling of the marriage and relationship between Damon and Jolie felt more like an awkward sub-plot rather than one of the main building blocks of the film which it was.The set direction and lighting were very good. The camera angles and editing were conventional and relaxed but there are times when one gets the impression that some more dynamic work in those areas could have added to the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,History

The pacing of the film seems to be completely even throughout - it doesn't matter what is happening on-screen - the editing is exactly the same, the shots are the same, etc...For example, the film opens up with a quick succession of set-up scenes, to introduce you to the character and the situation at the time. A few short scenes with expository dialogue.

The cast is great and there are really no weak links performance-wise - Damon is the weakest, as he really doesn't do anything but stay quiet and stone-faced - and there are some interesting scenes, but everything is so stretched out that the film is as long as possible. The layered and intriguing screenplay would be a lot better if it didn't take half an hour to tell a single important plot point. It's very similar to Syriana, in that it takes the longest possible route to tell a story, perhaps intending to appeal to adults but really just turning off everyone. Also, because it tries to tell the entire story of the CIA, there's no sense of a singular story or a climax. The direction is mostly solid, but the film is entirely too dull and dreary to really be that appealing. It's well-acted and well-written, but terribly paced.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Intriguing subject of early history of CIA,"The Good Shepherd's subject material is very intriguing but the movie has some problems. The story revolves around the character of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) who is asked to join the agency to run some operations back in 1939. But the current time line is actually 1961 so the movie goes back and forth in time as different incidents take place within the agency. The main problem with the movie is that it is trying to do too much. There are so many characters in the movie and because we see them only for a brief period of time, we don't feel anything for the characters. There is not enough character development. It is essential for a movie to establish some kind of bonding between the audience and its characters. This movie fails to do that miserably. Although I had no problem with Matt Damon's acting before, I was very disappointed by his flat performance. I am not sure what his character is supposed to be. Is he supposed to be brutal, cold-blooded person? Or is he supposed to be devoted to his work at all costs, moral/immoral, good/bad, brave/coward? His character lacks depth and is very flat I am not sure what he is. Since his character is the focal point of the story, it really takes away from the film's power. All the other characters, Sam Murach (Alec Baldwin), Philip Allen (William Hurt), Edward's son, his son's girlfriend, and all the other characters have so little screen time, audience doesn't know what to feel about them. The only characters that seemed to convey some real emotions were Edward's wife (Angelina Jolie), Edward's mute girlfriend Laura (Tammy Blanchard) and John Turturo's character: Ray Brocco. All the other characters had their functions in the story but conveyed no importance to me. This could be a very good TV series. Develop all those characters and stretch them out in a 2-3 year season TV series.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Intelligent and well made but the overly heavy feel will leave many alienated,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningRobert De Niro's lengthy second directorial outing was the subject of mixed reviews when it first came out that made it a hit or miss affair in cinemas. While it was hailed as a decent and admirable piece of film-making, it's length and heavy subject matter marked it as one that might not go down well with certain other members of the film-going population. And on this rare occasion, the critics mostly seem to have got it right.It's one I left, or wanted to leave, until it came on TV on New Year's Day, but even then the length put me off (what with all the other Christmas TV I'd been taking in!) But I decided to rent it instead, and finally put some time aside to take it all in. This is De Niro's take on how the CIA was formed, by a group of young men belonging to a secret order/society just before the second world war broke out, who came to be headed by Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) an idealistic, patriotic American who's been striving for truth and justice since his father committed suicide as a young man. We follow his journey as his loyalty is tested as the war starts, being asked to gather evidence against his mentor Dr. Fredericks (Michael Gambon) who's suspected of being a Nazi sympathiser, onto years later when the Bay of Pigs Invasion breaks out in Cuba and a mysterious sex tape appears to be the exposure of a traitor selling American intelligence to the Cubans, through to Wilson's personal life living a double life with a sweet deaf girl he met in a library, and the fiery Margeret (Angelina Jolie) with whom he's forced into marriage after getting her pregnant. But will his son come to be the straw that broke the camel's back?That's the plot description and as you can see, it's a lot to take in and I'm not sure I pieced it all together right. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent person who can handle strong, challenging stuff like this, but I'm also a young person with, suitably, the attention span of a knat and yes, I must admit at times I did find TGS a trifle over-whelming and hard to follow. We need as much intelligent cinema as we can get at the moment, what with our culture being dumbed down to the point of collapse, so the film is actually quite refreshing, if nothing else. Sadly, it also smacks of being somewhat over-ambitious, with a distinct lack of humour and light through-out (bar seeing Damon in drag singing 'Poor Little Butter Cup', funniest drag queen since Gary Busey in Under Siege!) that only serves to make it an even more alienating experience. It's a mature film, and will probably be appreciated more by a seasoned crowd. The new generation of cinema goers are getting stupider, but this may not have done as well as it should more because of how inaccessible it might have felt to a lot of people more than the other reason.The performances are pretty faultless, Damon a revelation as the self contained, humourless Wilson and Jolie showing some of that Changeling greatness as his strong willed wife. Being that it's his film, De Niro gives himself a small role with very limited screen time, ditto the likes of Alec Baldwin, William Hurt and Gambon, whilst fine, accomplished actors like Timothy Hutton and Joe Pesci get virtual cameos in even more secondary roles.Overall, this is compelling, challenging, inspired, intelligent, original cinema, a perfect retrospective piece from De Niro in the autumn of his life and career, that sadly has a lack of appeal to the target demographic of cinema goers, for whom it would probably come off as too heavy, humourless and ambitious. One that might be better on a second viewing, me thinks. ***",7.0,Anonymous,History
Wait for it on video,While I found it very interesting it does drag on several times during the film. At over two and a half hours long it is better seen at home when you can hit the pause button and stretch. There are some very dramatic performances and a very interesting story but I found myself yawning several times. You need to pay close attention to details as the story goes from past to present and back and forth. There are some subtle things that you must watch for and that is all I will say about that. Matt Damon gives a very believable performance and Angelina Jolie is excellent as well at a role very subdued from previous roles. The lack of excitement (and blood) was a disappointment for most in the theater that saw it at the same time as I did. If you are looking for assassinations and killings there isn't a lot of this.

I see the movie winning some awards as the quality of the technical rendition of how to do a movie is superb. However, that does not go for the editing.

Wonderful in the extreme,"In a year of woefully pitiful theatrical epics, finally at the end of the 2006 rainbow, we have bright and multi-colored winner. This movie starts at the beginning and takes you through decades of counter intelligence activity with a small but necessary touch of humanity, country, agency, and of course, protecting a loved one at all costs. All evil things are always done in the name of God and Country and this spares no illusions on that point. The effect that this movie has on ones humanity is reflected by the effects that this group has on it's country. As young Edward's humanity lessens, his home and personal life is affected and so is it reflected with the countries failed actions, ie. the bay of pigs and the loss in Edward's life. Well thought out for over ten years by DeNiro as a pet project, like a good wine it matured well. This is definitely an Oscar worthy picture, but with the pursuit of happiness in the running and us becoming an overwhelming PC country, I doubt it will get any Oscar nods. Sad though, so sad.

Dry spy,"For realistic spy film lovers, SHEPHERD delivers. For James Bond-style film fans, it likely will be a colossal bore. Matt Damon is career CIA agent in the early days of the agency. The film plays out like a Graham Greene story, as we follow Damon through the years, with the story not always being told in linear fashion. The director (DeNiro) has surrounded Damon with several big-name stars including Alec Baldwin, Angelina Jolie and DeNiro himself. Damon is fine, but the film goes on too long. And again, it will appeal mainly to a certain audience segment, the kind that cherishes a film like THE THIRD MAN or THGE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD. All others, beware.

Almost -so very close,"As a person who grew up around all that arrogance in the 50s, I must say the movie almost caught it. It went a long way to portray the attitude with which this element of our government was born, nurtured and finally took over the motus operandi of the boys in charge. what it missed is the absolute certainty of those characters - of their righteousness, and complete self assurance with which they go about their daily business - what makes it possibler for Guantanamo to thrive - They are better than us, they know more than us, they are smarter than us, and they know what's best for us. But as I say I was almost convinced. And I know these people. They don't judge themselves, they don't check themselves - they were BORN right! Intrinsically through every fiber of their body it is a forgone conclusion. Good Ol' Boys they call 'em. It's how a Vice President can shoot somebody in the face & get away with it.In any case - the movie is waay too long - like you tried to stick Godfather I II & III in the same movie.

"Read Berardinelli, Please","Do you want to know whether or not this film is for you? Go to ""External Reviews"" and read James B's review which acutely points out that this is not a film for the little kiddies that would prefer lots of violence and explosions. It is a ""thinking man/woman's"" film, and the 2 & 3/4 hours fly by if you allow yourself to be absorbed by the all-important question: Was the OSS/CIA career path worth the life devoted to one's country. This is for the viewer to determine as DeNiro smartly decides to put aside his own more liberal politics, to allow the tale to flow.

Proper Buttons,"Greetings again from the darkness. This one sure looks and feels like masterpiece film-making. It has a tremendous cast, renowned screenwriter (Eric Roth), passionate director (Robert DeNiro) and a near fool-proof subject ... the birth of the Central Intelligence Agency. I believe these are the reasons many are rating the film so highly. As an avid movie goer, I can usually connect with at least one character in a film, especially a THREE HOUR one! Not here, this film treats the viewer unfairly. It requires us to think and pay attention and think some more. For what? There is no payoff. All we get is an empty story, numerous time frame jumps and a bunch of characters who all seem to be playing a part in a school play.What prevents it from being totally ridiculous is the professional approach the cast takes. Only a couple of scenes are over the top, while most are actually so subtle that I found myself wanting to yell at the screen. Matt Damon is near robotic in his performance and when they show him walking, I couldn't help but think of 'Hands' in ""Boston Legal"". And what's with Angelina? Was she supposed to be 20 or 40? Couldn't tell most of the time. This film has more whispering than any Junior High history class and William Hurt takes mumbling to a whole new level. The manner in which Alec Baldwin's character just kind of appears from time to time made me think it was some SNL skit and what kind of casting puts Billy Crudup as a Brit? Aren't there sufficient working British actors to play this simple role? The rest of the cast is rounded out by DeNiro (appearing only a couple of times), Michael Gambon, Timothy Hutton, John Turturro and one all too brief scene with a very Italian Joe Pesci.Sadly, all of this is not enough to save what could have been a mesmerizing tale of espionage and intrigue. It was cool to have legitimate news reels of Castro and JFK, but the film really sagged during the ""movie"" parts. Very disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Its a Snooze-fest !!!!,"Well, i went to see this movie on insistence of my cousins and their friends( Who wanted to see the CIA movie). The movie starts off and i was expecting some thriller sequence building up. Matt Damon acted well( You can compare his acting to some of the sequences in Talented Mr Ripley). The story went back and forth between 40's and 60's. But after about one hour i felt that its too slow. Too much of information is being given. There is no element of emotion, comedy or thrill. I started looking at the people sitting besides me(my cousins of course). One of them is sleeping with his legs spread on the adjoining seats and the other one is looking at his hat again and again. :) I tried to avoid them, and concentrated on movie again. Angelina Jolie was completely wasted in this movie. She has about 10-11 lines in the whole movie. Same is the case with Robert deNiro. Joe Pesci has just one line. Well i felt this movie was a complete snooze-fest. Unluckily for me i had slept for 2 hours before watching this movie:) I think instead of giving details, they should have concentrated on the suspense part of the movie. This movie deserves 6/10 because its a good effort by De Niro. He tried his best and Matt Damon also acted really Well. He was so stubborn in this movie that at some times i felt like kicking his ass. Guys watch this movie on your own expense. For me it was a total money and time wastage.",6.0,Anonymous,History
What a cast!!! But what a waste of time... Horrible movie,"This movie is a prime example of why you should not see a movie just because it has great actors.This had to be the biggest waste of 2 1/2 hours in my entire life. I saw the previews and I was amazed that they had Damon, DeNiro, Hurt, Baldwin, and Jolie all in the same film. I thought this was going to be a must see. I usually like films of this nature, the kind where you have to pay close attention to get the full benefit of the film, but I was really disappointed with this one. Boring, drawn out, dry, confusing, and an extreme lack of any action at all pretty much describes this film entirely. The biggest flaw of this film was Matt Damon's son in the movie, this guy was the biggest pansy I've ever seen.

Instead it was a wasted three hours. I kept waiting for something to happen. Nothing did.The historical footage could probably be considered the highlight of this film. I'm not sure that it can all be blamed on De Niro. The script seems to be the primary source of boredom though De Niro adds nothing to it to give a life of its own. The flashbacks were confusing while jumping from decade to decade without rhyme or reason. This is story telling at its worse! De Niro, stick to acting.",,Anonymous,History

By the end, you know you've seen a story, and you know what happens, but you have no damn idea how you got there.Character development is sacrificed in many parts for this confusing web of mini stories, but what character development there is, it is superb.

Is It Over Yet?,"""The Good Shepherd"" is an engrossing movie; very watchable. All of the performances were outstanding. Angelina Jolie, taking on a different kind of role for her, does an excellent job as the high-society, charming girl who becomes the neglected wife. Matt Damon, in possibly the most stoic portrayal of the year. leaves something wanting. The passion the character should have, the drive to be successful and for the success of the C.I.A., never comes through. The characterization is totally dispassionate where it should be the opposite. The motivation for the character's resolve and dedication never comes through. One gets the impression the character is a drone of a fifties ""company man"". Go t work day in and day out at the same company for thirty years and then retire. His personal life is totally disconnected from his career (thus the neglected wife). Damon is most charming in is college days, and again at the end of the film when dealing with the problem his son creates. Interesting to watch, but not one to recommend. I think the directing (de Niro) too much reflects the fifties as baby boomers remember it; and not as people actually lived their lives.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Bob Barr will not be POTUS,"The advertising was that this movie was CIA version of the ""Godfather"". However upon watching it, I could not really find that. The Godfather was all about the mafia, respect, and loads of revenge killings on top of honor in NYC. This was about a man setting up the CIA and his problems.I have no problems with the film beyond that except for its length. There is some good storyline in this film. Although a lot of the time it was tedious detail. But beyond those moments, there were several interesting parts. I like the give and take with the Russians and I was intrigued by the ending.Overall, its not bad. But surely its no Godfather. ""B-""",6.0,Anonymous,History
Some what confusing,"I liked the movie a lot; although at times I was a little confused. some of the events I am familiar with, i e the Bay of Pigs. I think the intrigue is well done. I also think it does a good job of exploring the loneliness and lack of trust in anyone an agent has to deal with.What confused me most was that it seemed to imply that Edward Wilson was the man who founded the O S S that eventually became CIA. I know that Wild Bill Donovan was the mastermind behind the OSS. I was expecting to see a movie based on Bill Donovans life and work as the founder of the agency. While I realize that a fictional movie is just that, I was still disappointed to not see his involvement with the OSS and his relationship to Roosevelt explored.

Couldn't keep my eyes open,"This would have been a cracking 90-minute movie, but like so many recent Hollywood efforts it's far too long.There's some genuinely interesting stuff in here. The dissection of the photograph and tape by the CIA technicians is interesting and impressive. The period pieces in London and the US are great, but Germany looked very like a film set to me. In general, however, the sets are fantastic and the various periods and places - with the exception of post-war Germany - feel authentic. I particularly enjoyed the Skull & Bones Club (isn't the current President a member, maybe his dad too?) and the dodgy Cambridge boys who ""stick together like glue""! Michael Gambon is terrific, as usual. But the big US stars - De Niro, Jolie and Damon - are at times laughably bad. De Niro's US General with the sore feet made me laugh out loud. The script didn't give Matt Damon a great deal of scope for showing the full range of his acting talents; even so, he was amazingly wooden and dull. John Turturro was the best of the US actors, but then at least he had some interesting lines to say. And where was Bob Dylan?",6.0,Anonymous,History

I do not like Matt Damon (wife disagrees) but he did do a pretty good job.Has a slow gentle pace with an extremely effective conclusion.

"Long, but kept the interest","Bobby deNiro has got a lot of knowledge of the CIA, and has done an overwhelmingly amount of research for the film.

I liked the input of Alec Baldwin, but he seemed like he was focused on ""The Departed"".Deniro also brought in Joe Pesci to have some fun..:) He could have cut about a half hour/45 min of the film, adding more intense scenes over dialogue..All in all pretty fun film.:)",7.0,Anonymous,History

Should have seen it on DVD.There were a lot of good actors in the flick, such as Matt Damon, Robert Dinero and Angelina Jolie. But there was very little action and not enough tension to carry a movie that had this small amount of action. I also was looking and holing for more in the way of James Bond-ish spy things. There was also little in The Good Shepherd as far as the inner workings of the Central Intelligence Agency, which bummed me out.

Il Conformista re-visited,"I've watched The Good Shepherd and really enjoyed it. Well written, well cast, well acted and directed with the right tone, I still believe that the narrative bites off a little bit more than it can chew. Not even a running time approaching three hours can save the film from being overly complex and a decent background in modern history would certainly help the viewer's comprehension of events unfolding on the screen.Having said that, I believe it is a very good film indeed and clearly inspired by certain classics of the early 70s. I've noted at least one commentator, who drew valid parallels with the character of Michael Corleone as played by Al Pacino in The Godfather films. Nevertheless, I think it greatest source of thematic inspiration is Bertolucci's Il Conformista and the character of Marcello Clerici as played by Jean Louis Trintignant. In that film, the conformist of the title, plagued by his personal demons, longs to be a loyal follower, to belong to the state. In doing so, he deceives, betrays and murders, giving up his personal integrity, his humanity, his sense of self.Il Confomista was considered a seminal masterpiece in its day, and attained a broader distribution in the United States through the intervention of bright young American directors, including Coppola, Scorsese and De Palma.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Fascinating; I'm still thinking and remembering.,"At urging of friends who know my background, I saw the movie last night. No critic (insufficiently knowledgeable) of actors, movie direction, an the like, I do know ""tradcraft"" and the CIA. I can say, therefore, that like the company, the movie is a ""wilderness of mirrors."" I knew ""Virginis Slim"" Angleton, and recognized him immediately in Matt Damon's performance. I also recognized others like Kim Philby (who I was alerted by a guy named Bill Harvey was a KGB agent I might -""probably"" was his term - be assigned as a mission). Some other figures in the movie are a mixture of real people. The dates - defections of Anatoy Golitsyn and Yuri Nosenko, for instance - are out of sync with history. The Bay of Pigs landing was betrayed by the members of 2506 Brigade, who could be heard in Little Havana Miami and elsewhere (Useppa Island, for instance),bragging and threatening concerning it weeks before. It happens that I myself was there in December, 1960, and in Cuba during the month of January, 1961.Otherwise very close to the truth as I know it, Churchill's ""riddle, wrapped in mystery, inside and enigma,"" The Good Shepherd may BE the truth. In my book ""Letters to Aaron, the Hal Luebbert Story,"" I tell of my recruitment at sixteen, to be trained in assassination of (foreign) leaders. As far as I know, ten men were so trained (by, among others, the new 10th Special Forces in Bad Tolz, German. When JFK threatened to tear the CIA to pieces, the team was ready.The movie, of course, only hints at the CIA's ""orchestration"" (CIA organizer Frank G. Wisner's favorite expression) of the Cold War. It doesn't mention the military-industrial complex (President Eisenhowers's coinage) coup d'etat that was the CIA's primary mission and raisson d'etre. That the coup, the reason JFK was killed, succeeded is the only possible explanation for our history (fifteen trillion dollars in military spending, for instance) - since the time.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Dreamy account on the creation of the FBI,"The Good Sheppard, seems to be a very surrealistic, dreamy account on the creation of the FBI, this film was kind of light on action. I would have to say that Robert DeNiro did a good job as director. I was not happy with the time jumps which seem to happen a lot in today's films (examples this film and All The Kings Men). This kind of film technique requires the viewer to seriously interject him/herself into the film, but this is not the kind of movie which lends itself to serious on the fly study, simply put it is long and drawn out. You can get up walk out and come back and feel like you haven't missed much. But I liked the wide screen version for the excellent scenes. I was just hoping for some more action. If you look on the back of the DVD case it states that this film is ""The Godfather' of CIA Movies"" well in truth this film could in no way achieve that statement.",6.0,Anonymous,History
America Guarded By A Nest of WASPS,"I came away from The Good Shepherd terribly disappointed. A really talented cast was very wasted in this fictional retelling of over 20 years of American espionage.The USA got into the spy game on a permanent basis real late. We had intelligence services during all of our Wars up to World War II. It was deemed something to be handled by the military up until then. Our attitude was best summed up by Henry L. Stimson who said that line about 'gentlemen do not read other gentlemen's mail.'Stimson served in the cabinet of three American presidents and the last one, Franklin D. Roosevelt, had a different view of espionage. Knowing that the USA would be entering World War II sooner or later he felt the need for this country to have an espionage agency, the equal and superior of what our friends and foes had. The man he selected was World War I hero and Congressional Medal of Honor winner, William J. Donovan. In previous films he's been portrayed by George Brent in The Fighting 69th and Joseph Crehan in O.S.S. That is General Sullivan who director Robert DeNiro portrays.Donovan by all accounts did an outstanding job in organizing the Office of Strategic Services. But for some reason the OSS was disbanded after World War II. Bill Donovan ran afoul of Roosevelt's successor Harry S. Truman and there's lots of speculation what caused the rift. Truman's memoirs are silent on the issue.Anyway from 1945 until 1947 when the Central Intelligence Agency was born, we had no espionage agency. Those were critical years and this country played a whole lot of catch up. Donovan aka Sullivan had nothing to do with the CIA, in fact was frozen out of the agency. A whole lot of his people joined it though, including our fictional protagonist Edward Wilson as played by Matt Damon. This is the most glaring factual error of The Good Shepherd.Matt Damon is our WASP type protagonist who joins the OSS after graduation from Yale. He's a member of Skull and Bones, the elite fraternity of Yale and the OSS and CIA did in fact try to recruit among America's WASP first families on the theory that they had the most to lose if the country went down the toilet. Not true however that it was exclusively a WASP preserve.The personal story is the best part. The demands of his job put an unbelievable strain on his marriage, one by the way that resulted from a pregnancy during a one night stand with Angelina Jolie.Look for a good performance by William Hurt as Philip Allen aka Allen Dulles. The Dulles family God only knows has been accused of a lot of things, many of them true. No one ever accused them of being thieves however, the failure of the Bay of Pigs was enough reason for John F. Kennedy to demand Allen Dulles's resignation not some Swiss bank accounts.In contrast to Hurt look also for a small role from Joe Pesci as the Italian Mafia guy who's lost big bucks when Castro took over the hotels and casinos. As I write this, a whole lot of American companies are ready to move back into Havana once Fidel Castro no longer fogs a mirror. Only it won't be the Joe Pescis who will lead them.I don't know if anyone remembers, but shortly after 9/11 the U.S. government issued a clarion call for those who were gifted in Farsi, Arabic and all kinds of exotic languages. Just because the Cold War ended and the Soviet Union went out of business, didn't mean a happy ending. Our biggest intelligence failure was a basic one, the failure to perceive a new threat. We were still turning out experts in Russian and Chinese from our universities including the elite Ivy League ones like Yale. Only now are we turning out the experts needed for a new challenge. Again, playing catch up.Matt Damon's self contained performance and a talented cast in support are reasons to see The Good Shepherd. Don't take a short cut and write any term papers based on this film.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Subtle Suspense by a Masterful Director,"DeNiro's brilliant directing kept me spellbound. Matt Damon is riveting as Wilson, a character whose interior is knowable only through our identification with him, as he travels through a world of people who may or may not be what they seem. Almost every scene is exquisitely, truthfully rendered. The only phony notes: The timing of the news that Wilson has gotten Clover pregnant, brought to him when he is on the beach with Laura; also phony is the ability of deaf Laura to lipread words on lips that don't enunciate or are not even visible. This is not a film for those who must have lots of gore and flashy violence; it's hugely suspenseful but subtle. Someone once defined the difference between literary and commercial by saying that ""commercial"" featured large events, while ""literary"" had to do with the ramifications of those events. In that sense, DeNiro and Roth have given us a literary film about those who are in the business of espionage, a subject that is ordinarily rendered as slick and superficial. In a crowded theater, where there is a huge likelihood of people talking, there was absolute silence for the nearly three-hour length of this excellent movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Wait for the DVD,"I went to this film wanting to like it. The story seemed interesting and the cast had many of my favorite actors. The film is advertised as a story about the beginnings of th CIA. Well its not really, it's a hodge podge story of one man's life within the CIA. I am not a fan of movies that jump back and forth in time to tell a story. In some cases it can work but it is only a device and should be used sparingly. The Good Shepherd does this many times. The movie has a few glaring errors in it which make little sense. Overall the cinematography was good and there were some good scenes along with a few good lines but this film telegraphs where its going a lot. The movie is a little long at almost 3 hours. About 45 more minutes on the editing room floor would have improved the pace and not really lost any of the story. It's just my opinion but I think your movie dollar would be better spent renting this for $3 than paying $20 for a theatrical showing. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,History
A moody slow- burn spy thriller,"This was still a tedious, slow-burn of a movie and I will admit to not always having a clear idea as to what was going on and having to pay close attention to the dialogue, as a lot of it is spoken in riddles. A cast of heavy weights is what really makes this watchable.The story starts in 1961 at the CIA covert operations during the Bay of Pigs and then follows Edward Wilson's career in flashbacks. Matt Damon takes the lead here, his character is serious, self contained and hard to get a read on. Damon seems to play a lot of these 'silent' characters.It continues to flip back and forth between the 40's and 60's; Damon is a student at Yale, his recruitment through the Skull & Bones fraternity, a shotgun marriage to Angelina Jolie (in a small role), his early spy years in London during WW2 and the blitz (which was re-created well) a couple of affairs, the cold war and disillusionment and distrust with the agency.Along the way he rubs shoulders with Alec Baldwin, Billy Crudup, Joe Pesci, John Turturro, Timothy Hutton, Patrick Wilson, Robert DeNiro, William Hurt and Eddie Redmayne plays his son.I wouldn't say this was a great movie, it tries hard, has a stellar cast, nice cinematography but takes itself too seriously and ultimately is slow, dry and confusing in sections. There is also zero action (if that's important to you). As for Matt Damon's character, as the Russian says ""the silence is deafening"". 1/25/15",6.0,Anonymous,History

Although the storyline did hold my interest for most of the film, I found the movie to be a long, dry, and somewhat slow affair. It concentrated more on the life of Edmond Wilson, a CIA agent, rather than on the creation of the CIA, which we only learned about in the context of his life. The movie did do an excellent job portraying a man who sacrifices his personnel life for the sake of his job. The opening sequences involving the Bay of Pigs was also done well. Neverless I went to learn more about the CIA and the movie told me no more than I already knew. Overall, I was disappointed and would give it a B- to C+ since it was off target.

More Fitted to the History Channel than the Multiplex,"Just because you work with Scorsese doesn't mean you can be Scorsese.Robert De Niro's ""The Good Shepherd"" is more fitted to the history channel than the multiplex. It takes an incredibly dry and dense look into the birth of the Central Intelligence Agency from the 1930s to 1960s.It's a three-hour epic that constantly feels like three hours. It doles out information and new faces, never holding your hand as you constantly struggle to soak it all in. Screenwriter Eric Roth does get points for treating the audience with respect. If only he and De Niro could have figured out a way to deliver this information in a more entertaining way.De Niro's production team is more than up to the task as everything is period-accurate, from the sets to the hairstyles. Veteran DP Robert Richardson conceals everything in shadows, heightening the deceit and intrigue within this cruel world.An all-star cast has been assembled, so there's plenty of famous and pretty faces to look at. Joe Pesci even shows up for two minutes to say the n-word. Matt Damon's performance is similar to his one from The ""Talented Mr. Ripley,"" as he perpetually has a stoic face and fedora. Jolie takes a subdued role that doesn't properly use her stardom.""The Good Shepherd"" is an okay movie that I would gladly watch again, which is a lot more than I can say for some movies that I find good. I'll just make sure not to watch it at night, as I (along with everyone else) will fall asleep.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Three Hours of Enthralling Entertainment,"I was overwhelmed by the quality of this film. It is a fictional representation of the birth of the CIA and its first director, James Angleton. From the little I've read of Angleton, he was the poster child for paranoia, and Matt Damon does him justice in a superbly understated way.Damon plays Edward Bell Wilson who begins his career as the master of covert operations and misdirection as a young boy when he conceals the reasons for the suicide of his father. Edward shows some semblance of normalcy during his college years, but personal circumstances and his involvement in covert operations during World War II turns him into a nationalistic automaton. The United States of America is his true god and family, and even though he is a good man at heart, he is no real husband or father. Damon's often silent - never overt - acting paints a startling portrait of a complex man.The film is peppered with big stars, but John Turturro stands out as Wilson's right hand man. Turturro is chilling as the person who actually carries out most of the violence seen in the film. Wilson appears to be totally non-violent, and Turturro is his grimly capable Mr. Hyde.More that just a telling of the start of the notorious agency, this film is also a love story, a family tale, and a mystery. We are treated to views of the mystifying Skull and Bones society of Yale University. As a matter of fact it plays a big part throughout the film supporting the rumors that most high-ranking members of the CIA are also members of Skull and Bones. In the love story, we get a hint at what Wilson might have become had not circumstances conspired against him. And the family tale focuses upon the father-son relationships of three generations of the Wilson family. All of these are bound tightly around the real central character - the CIA.I have read several reviews that compare this film with The Godfather, and it certainly has many of its excellent qualities. Its production values are top quality, all of the acting is far above average, and Robert De Niro skillfully heads up the whole thing to give the viewer nearly three hours of enthralling entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Good Shepherd,"So rather than spend a fortune on special disguises, plastic surgery and prosthetics, the secret of being a successful counter-intelligence agent is loads of Bryclream, a pair of thick-set spectacles and a fawn, knee-length, mac. That's what puts the c into overt! That theory sort works for Matt Damon here with this lacklustre drama set around the time in world history when the American government realised they needed to gather intelligence about whom their potential 20th century foes might be. He is ""Edward Wilson"", who after being sworn into some top secret masonic style of society at school finds himself learning the arts of espionage in a wartorn London, then to Berlin, the back to Uncle Sam where his accrued skills leave him well placed to root out Nazi sympathisers and Soviet agents and defectors. Initially he is full of the joys of spring, his task a patriotic duty. Increasingly, though, as his hastily arranged marriage to ""Margaret"" (the sparingly used Angelina Jolie) starts to suffer, cynicism creeps in and what semblance of decency he had begins to become subsumed into a determination to get results - regardless of the methods frequently employed by his sidekick ""Ray"" (John Turturro). Robert De Niro clearly has pulling power with his directorial promise, but most of the supporting cast add little to this muddling drama that trips over it's own cloak way too often looking for the dagger. Quite where Billy Crudup's accent came from is anyone's guess and the plodding nature of this rather wearisome, if stylishly filmed, drama makes it quite a slog to sit through. It's all just a bit too self-indulgent and presents us with a rather ungracious and arrogant side to an American superiority complex that I found a bit dull.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Most of the people that get truly hurt are bystanders and mostly innocent, although not perfect either. I thought this movie took a serious look under the covers and had a lot of heart to go with it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Interesting but it's very long.,"I think this movie deserves 6.5 stars. The biggest problem of this movie is that it last too much(167 minutes), I think 120 minutes would have been much better.The performances are very good, specially Matt Damon who in this opportunity plays a CIA man which is totally opposite to the one of his Bourne's films. the movie is entertaining at the beginning but as long as this is running one doesn't care much about the movie because it's very long and it's told in a slow pace, but the last 20 something minutes are very entertaining again.This movie is about Edward Wilson, who is one of the founders of the CIA, where we can see his life since his last year at Yale university passing his relationships with 2 women and his son, his participation in WW2, his relations with Russian agents until his investigation to discover the leak about the Bay of Pigs Invasion.............If you liked the film JFK (1991)maybe you will probably like this movie too.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Had to use Sunk Cost Fallacy to convince myself to watch to the end,"Don't make the same mistake I did. After 3 hours there was no pay off in the end - it just ended. Mercifully. Even the stellar cast assembled could not save this film from itself, a reminder that even the most brilliant actors sometimes should not and cannot make the leap to being even a competent director. Attempts to draw from Citizen Kane in it's non-linear storytelling and sometimes visual style, and fails to come up with a voice of it's own. The characters are flat and unmemorable as we watch them through a window just moving through the story while failing to establish any rapport or investment with them as a viewer, so that by the end of the movie we really don't care what happens to them. There's precious little tension and the few twists and turns the file does provide, ultimately are rendered moot when the film just ends and you're left asking yourself, ""What was the point?""",4.0,Anonymous,History
Long and boring,"Not only was this film long-drawn and boring, but it was also unrealistic and very difficult to find out what was up and down. Who did Edward Wilson refer to, and who did he receive his orders from? Did he have all this responsibility just working from home, making all these decisions himself? A man that was an expert in poems, and never joined the army?Matt Dillon (Edward Wilson) was a right wooden face from beginning to end. I used to think he was a good actor, but after watching this? No. If the film was cut down to 1Â½ hour and Matt Dillon was more expressional, then perhaps it would have been worth watching.",,Anonymous,History
The Film Spies on the Spys but Not the Agency,"Director Robert Di Niro Succeeds in Placing the Audience in the Time and Place of the Settings, but is Less Successful in Analyzing the ""Big Picture"" in His Picture about the Early Days of the CIA and its Precursor the OSS.By choosing to Go Deep into the Ramifications of the unbridled Secrecy and its effect Personally on Key Figures, the Film Fails to lay out in its Three Hour Running Time any Serious Successes the Agency Acquired and Any of the Failures, and its Devastation Globally.The A-List Cast are Equipped with a somewhat Skimpy Script full of Mannerisms and Behaviors that One could Gleam from a Public Relations Release. Norman Rockwell Portraits on the Outside and individual Human Flaws on the Inside.

Early CIA,"The early days of the CIA via the life of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), an agent with a strong loyalty and a weakness for women. The movie requires your full attention as there are a lot of characters, a lot of moving pieces, a lot of cloak and dagger, and a lot of dialog is cryptic. It spans nearly a 40-year period with frequent jumping back and forth, so it's easy to miss something. The tone and tenor of the movie was heavier than the plot and script.

Excellent spy drama has plenty of intrigue and a great cast.,"Edward Wilson (Oscar-Winner:Matt Damon) believes in America and certainly having safety of his country. Edward thinks back in his days in College as a young man, being a member of ""Skulls & Bones"" at Yale and his first true love (Tammy Blanchard). Edward is been asked to spy on his college professor (Michael Gambon) from a FBI Agent (Alec Baldwin). Since his professor is a supporter for the Nazis. Edward does his undercover work well. After he graduated from Yale, he's asked to be a spy in Europe and represent a young official U.S. Gouverment Agent as well for the ""Office & Strategic Services"". But before he was send to Europe, he had a one-night stand with a woman (Oscar-Winner:Angelina Jolie) and she becomes pregnant. Which he was forced to marry her and leaving the true love of his life. When Edward is been sent home after World War 2, which he was there living in Europe for six years. Which he finally meets his son Edward Jr. (Tommy Nelson) and trying to make his relationship work his wife. Now Edward is working in the United States for the Central Intelligence Angecy (CIA). Which he's one of the covert founders of the CIA. But Edward's once idealism turns dark for him, when everyone he knows seems to be keeping secrets from him. He can't trust anymore including those are close to him. Now he has to watch out for his son, which he's now an older young man (Eddie Redmayne). Which Edward Jr. wants to follow his father footsteps and he falls in love with a mysterious woman (Liya Kebede), who's also a spy but working in opposite sides. Which Edward has to think what is best for his family and for business as well.Directed by Oscar-Winner:Robert De Niro (A Bronx Tale) made an fascinating film about espionage, family, betrayed and the safety of America. Damon is excellent in his performance, which one's of his best roles to date. De Niro has a great eye for his cast of characters including John Turturro, Oscar-Winner:William Hurt, Keir Dullea, Oscar-Winner:Timothy Hutton, Oscar-Winner:Joe Pesci and more. De Niro shows that he could be a great filmmaker as well being an great role. De Niro has a small supporting roles in the film as well. His second film is actually fast-paced for a picture that is over 2 hours and 40 minutes. He has a well chosen cast to play great characters in the movie and the premise is quite powerful. Some critics are calling this ""The Godfather"" of CIA Movies and they are probably right as well.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD's only feature is the Deleted Scenes of the film, which they are just as interesting as the final cut of the movie. I would have loved to listen to a filmmaker's commentary or watching behind the scenes footage. But that's probably for a future DVD release. Since this picture is a fictional story but it is actually heavily based on fact. This is about a man, who's believes in the safety of his country, he's willing to scarified everything including his family and his own life to keep it safe. Since this film was a box office disappointment, despite being well received by the critics. It is the kind of movie that plays well on DVD. Don't miss one of the best films as 2006. This film received Oscar Nomination for Best Art Direction. Written by Oscar-Winner:Eric Roth (Forrest Gump, The Insider, Munich). Super 35. (**** 1/2 out of *****).",9.0,Anonymous,History
more of a documentary than a film,"This exhausting 2h40m marathon of a film covers the initial birth of the CIA as it is known today, with Matt Damon playing the role of (under another name) James Angleton, future director of CIA Counterintelligence, and literally everyone else out-acting him in every scene. I'm sorry Matt, but grownup roles do not suit you. Scenes between Damon and Turturro, or Damon and Gambon, or Damon and Baldwin, really show how little depth Damon has in this role.From a script perspective, well, the film is well made, well shot, well lit, good sets, good costumes, but it's increeeeeedibly tedious. It makes no effort to have any accents, any points of interest. You know, the way humans tell a story?You have a framing device, you have 2-3 main plot-building scenes, you got another 3-4 support scenes, and you got a big showdown.Instead Shepherd wants to tell you aaaaaaall the story of the CIA, all of it, all. Of. It. The whole lot.See, in making a film, you need to set out with the mindset that you are a storyteller, and you will use the story to CREATE AN EMOTION into the viewer. You do this by picking a finale that is particularly compelling and then you create a story structure that guides you to this.But .. unfortunately this was not to be. Which is a shame, because the work that went into Shepher is evident, i mean, even Anglina Jolie managed to do a good job, but after the first 50-odd minutes of plot that goes nowhere, and a new plot sets in, and then ANOTHER, you just give up.My vote: 6/10 - but i would recommend this only as a documentary.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Ermmmm?,"I think this may have been better at the cinema, to be honest. I tried to watch it the other night with my girlfriend and a couple of glasses of wine and ended up switching it off due to having no idea whatsoever what was going on. The problem is that it isn't abstract or artistic enough to be interesting despite being nonsense (such as a Lynch film like Inland Empire, for example), it simply just doesn't make sense and is therefore very boring.I'm quite sure that in the captive environment of the cinema it would be easier to follow, and gut feel tells me that it is probably a great film if you're patient enough - but watching it at home on anything less than a personal cinema: don't bother unless you are prepared to watch it 2 or possibly even 3 times.",5.0,Anonymous,History

The plot might be very intelligent, and it is certainly thought provoking. But perhaps it only looks as if is intelligent.

Underrated,"When I heard about this film I thought that it would be my cup of tea. I am interested in espionage, history and the Cold War and I like Robert De Niro. This film tells the story of the birth of the CIA during the Second World War to the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs invasion. The film focuses on Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) who starts out as a student at Yale University, gets recruited to the CIA and raises up the ranks. He first spies on his English professor, suspected of being a Nazi sympathiser and recruiter, for the FBI. After that success, the head of the OSS recruits him and sends him to England to learn the tricks of the spying trade. He slowing make contacts with American and British figures and works his way up to a senior officer in Berlin at the end of the war before becoming the head of counter-intelligence. The film also focuses on Edward's personal life. He is emotionally dead and never shows any feelings. He ends up marrying a woman named Margaret (Angelina Jolie) because he gets her pregnant. He has a strained relationship with his son who tries to follow in his fathers footsteps. Edward was never able to be with the woman he loves and I personally feel sorry for his wife because she lives a lonely, isolated lifestyle. The film also looks at many aspects of espionage and controversial bits of America's and the CIA's history. This includes the Americans helping Nazi scientists to work with them, the use of waterboarding and LSD and working with the Mafia during the Bay of Pigs.Some people have criticised Angelina Jolie as Margaret, I personally think that it was a good move because she is meant to be someone very attractive and able to seduce Edward at first. She is also a good actress, she has won a Oscar and has done very well in a lot of her films.If you are anything like me then you will find this film very interesting.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Bit Long But Demonstrates DeNiro's Strength As a Filmmaker,"Joseph Palmi: Let me ask you something... we Italians, we got our families, and we got the church; the Irish, they have the homeland, Jews their tradition; even the n_ggers, they got their music. What about you people, Mr. Wilson, what do you have?Edward Wilson: The United States of America. The rest of you are just visiting.There's something about the C.I.A. I find so damn intriguing. Maybe it's the secretiveness, the espionage, the danger -- I don't know, it just seems so --- cool. After the release of the powerhouse revival of the Bond series, 'Casino Royale' I was all pumped to see De Niro's second film 'The Good Shepherd' surrounding the birth of the C.I.A. There have been so many movies released about the C.I.A. in recent years -- Spy Game, The Recruit, Mindhunters, etc. -- but 'The Good Shepherd' proves to be better than all of them. It's an intense, intricate and beautifully-made film, that has very few flaws. The only unfortunate thing about 'The Good Shepherd' is the fact it was released in 2006 -- a year filled to the brim with impeccable movies, forcing this great but not great enough film to be lost in the shuffle and stand a chance at little to no awards recognition.Matt Damon is the star of the film playing the cold and composed C.I.A. man Edward Wilson. Damon perfectly captures the part with a brilliantly subtle performance that is his best work yet. In my mind, he should receive an Oscar nomination, but seeing how much competition there is this year, I highly doubt that will happen, at least not for this movie (I think he has a better chance going supporting with 'Departed'). The rest of the cast is hardly given enough chance to shine with roles ranging from 25 minutes on screen to 2 minutes on screen. Angelina Jolie, who has probably the biggest part of the rest of the cast, is decent as Clover, Wilson's wife, but nothing special. William Hurt and Robert DeNiro are spectacular as ever, as are Alec Baldwin, Michael Gambon and Billy Crudup. Tammy Blanchard impressed me with a short role as Damon's cute little deaf love interest, and it was nice to see Pesci acting again even if he was only on screen for 2 minutes. By the way, Pesci owns those two minutes.The real treat of the film is DeNiro as the director. Here DeNiro provides us with breathtaking work that we'd expect from acclaimed veteran filmmakers like Scorsese, Spielberg or Kubrick. It seems as though every shot of the film is perfectly captured with a sense of gloominess that perfectly sets the tone for this somber epic tale of loyalty, betrayal and sacrifice in the name of one's country. Eric Roth, the co-screenwriter of Munich, Forrest Gump and The Insider, provides a screenplay that is for the most part great, but could have been shorter. In my mind, although many will disagree, 'The Good Shepherd' could have been about 10 - 15 minutes shorter and it still would have been just as powerful, but that's just a small complaint to go along with my numerous compliments.All in all, 'The Good Shepherd' is definitely worth catching in theaters if you think you can handle a two hour and fifty-five minute movie that isn't Lord of the Rings. For all of you expecting this movie to have all this action and violence in it -- you got the wrong the movie. 'The Good Shepherd' doesn't use explosions and blood to entice it's viewers, it uses realism and intelligent plot twists. Grade: A-",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Intelligent, phenomenal and self-assured","DeNiro does a masterful job here ... patient and self-assured. I saw it when it first came out and remember thinking it was too long back then.

And nothing is spoon fed - everyone is a suspect. And I suspect that's why I enjoyed it so much.Great work by all here - cast, crew, director, and writer. The only minor complaint is Jolie feels a little bit of mis-cast here. Her performance is fine and she does great - so it's not a knock on her - she's a total pro and is totally believable. But there's just something about her that feels a little incongruous with the rest of the cast. Like she's too beautiful to be a part of this world (and maybe that's intentional - to motivate Matt Damon's one moment of weakness and his fatal flaw in the film)?",9.0,Anonymous,History

Intriguing,"It has been a long time since I lost sleep trying to understand moments from a movie. Am I the only person in the audience who thought that Angelina (Clover) was already pregnant and looking for a ""fall guy"" to marry? I can see that the son was supposed to look like Matt (Wilson), but I certainly would have wondered if I'd been set up and wondered whether or not the son was my own or not. Apparently he saw enough of himself in the boy to to come to love him as his own, but I can't really say that I blame him for taking the first opportunity to get out of town. What on earth did Angelina expect after she attacked him at first meeting and then roped him into marriage? Her obvious affair, lack of communication with her husband during his absence (neglecting to even mention her brother's death - in Burma? Was that supposed to be CIA business too? ), and request for separate bedrooms -made me wonder what the fuss was about when she found that he had had his own affairs. The jealous act simply didn't make sense...And we were supposed to get that she was a ""good"" mother? She seemed totally out of it throughout the movie. What about the other Yale boy who approached him after his induction into Scull & Bones about his father's betrayal..and then his apparent accusation after the Baby of Pigs disaster?

"Terrible, to say the least","Never before have I had the desire (or indifference for that matter) to walk out of a movie theater until I saw this film. There's a lack of a compelling, semi-coherent story line that makes you question why you even want to see the ending. The plot spans for approx. 20 years and tells Matt Damon's character's story in a flashback way but does not spend enough time developing any of the characters what so ever. You feel like you are thrown into this story with out any background on anyone, and while searching for it throughout the movie within the 5 - 7 minute (very extensive!) unsequential scenes, you find nothing to understand these people better.Matt Damon is so incredibly stone faced and dull throughout the film that its hard to believe hes a real person, let alone someone acting as a real person. There were too many short and blunt scenes when there should have been longer and more emotion filled ones. I understand that this is a movie about the beginning of the CIA but in order for something to be interesting and to make a connection to the audience the characters have to strike a cord. I couldn't tell you one thing about the protagonists character, as personality and morals and judgment.I felt that there was absolutely no climax what so ever and no driving force. You really just don't care how it ends because you don't care what happens to anyone. It really baffles me how this movie is getting great reviews. Maybe I'm missing something but this is only one out of a handful of a lifespan of movies that I would absolutely never see again.As a closing anecdote, about halfway through the movie, when my friends and I realized we just wasted $9.50 and started to talk amongst ourselves, the people sitting in front of us joined in on our conversation trying themselves to find something interesting and stimulating.

casting excellent except for Angelina,"A major quibble with the movie: Angelina Jolie was sadly miscast. She wasn't a '50s-looking or acting character at all. Her acting style has solidified around her appearance and she's now unable to break out of that mold. Matt Damon's portrayal of his character Wilson, on the other hand, was well-done and authentic to the era. Certain of the events in the movie, while based on actual occurrences, were ""Hollywoodized"" for sheer drama, but others were actually underplayed, which intensified the effect. The cinematography was excellent, and the musical score blended well with the action, never being obtrusive. An excellent portrayal of a time in our history when actions were taken that still resonate in today's events.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Godfather of boredom (and non-linearity),"This film was beautifully shot and well acted (I think) but why? Nearly 3 hours wasted and I have barely a clue as to what I watched. As the film shifts about a dozen times from past to present to somewhere in between and back again, the story, the continuity, and the point, is lost.I suspect maybe there is something to this film if one were to watch it several times intently.

I like the intrigue, conspiracy, covert operations, and unexpected betrayals. While this film has some of that, it is not enjoyable. This film is really just a boring tale of the life of a CIA agent, told in such a non-linear way as to be an effort to watch.I feel I am being generous to award it 3/10 stars, as it has monumentally achieved the 3 things a good film should not be: boring, boring, and even more boring.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Ample rewards here for the committed-- of mind and body,"The good news on Mr De Niro's version of ""CIA: The Early Years"" is plentiful enough:(1) the script has more than sufficient history and skulduggery, both real and made-to-fit-the-movie, to keep the cleverer sections of one's brain engaged throughout the film's long running time; (2) there are considerable and sustained chunks of good acting on display, including fine contributions from sources you'd expect (John Turturro, John Hurt, Sir Michael Gambon, De Niro himself) and some you might not (Alec Baldwin and Angelina Jolie); (3) the production values,attention to period detail and the like are impressive throughout, cumulatively producing just the kind of atmospherics a good spy movie needs; and (4) the conclusions to be drawn are, if you will, clear without being obvious: some but not all of the dots are connected for you, while the direction and tenor of the film leave progressively less doubt about what the whole enterprise is saying *tout court*.Bravo to all that. At the same time, however, one would be remiss in not mentioning several irritants, e.g. Why couldn't the make-up people age protagonist Damon (and Jolie to an extent) more convincingly? For that matter, why use Damon in the first place? While he has shown himself a fine actor in certain roles, this one fairly cries out for Russell Crowe, one would think (or was he simply otherwise engaged at the time?). And what are British viewers to make of Billy Crudup, playing an Oxbridgeian, potentially Philby-like characterÂ…but with an accent which seemed to be hovering around between the Midlands and the mid-Atlantic looking for a place to land?Finally, a philosophical question: Given that the film is based in large part on the life and experiences of James Angleton (the externals thereof, in any case), was it wise to offer up this version of AngletonÂ—who was nothing if not a colourful characterÂ—as a virtual cipher?All told, this is a film which amply rewards the committed viewerÂ—but do bear in mind that the commitment is one of both mind (no simple Bonding here) and body (at nearly 3 hours, preponderantly the posterior and kidneys).My advice: furrow the brow, train a bit and go for it!",8.0,Anonymous,History
What a mess!,"The only reason I give this movie a four is due to the attention to detail from one period to another, other than that this film is an absolute mess. This film is overly confusing, and does not provide the viewer enough information to know what is really going on, or to care for that matter. Jolie's character is completely insignificant, aside from the fact that the character is strange from the beginning. Damon's character is completely boring. I directly attribute the problems of this film to the director Robert Deniro. For example there is a collage of scenes about 45 minutes into the film where the viewer is supposed to be absorbing what amounts to be a significant portion of the plot. Unfortunately in this ten minute dash we are exposed to at least 10 different parts of as many conversations, and we have no context in which to refer to, so frankly no one has any idea of what the hell is going on.

long but involving drama,"Robert De Niro's second directorial effort ""The Good Shepherd"" purports to tell the story of the birth of the CIA during the heyday of the Cold War. Based very loosely on the lives of two intelligence officers, James Jesus Angleton and Richard M. Bissell Jr., the movie is a strong but patience-demanding work that will have some members of the audience sitting up in rapt attention while others squirm restlessly in their seats. At 168 minutes and with little real action to speak of, ""The Good Shepherd"" is admittedly not the easiest sell for a mass audience, relying as it does on atmosphere and dialogue - and the patient goodwill of its viewers - to get its message across. I can easily imagine a person watching this film with one eye planted firmly on his wristwatch and the other on the theater exit. I'm happy to report that I was not one of those people, for despite a few longueurs that occur towards the end of the movie, I found this film to be both compelling and eminently watchable for most of its duration.Matt Damon, who ages remarkably little throughout the 23-year time span covered by the story, plays Edward Bell Wilson, an agent specializing in the fine art of counterintelligence. With a screenplay by Eric Roth, the movie uses as its framing device the Bay of Pigs fiasco in the spring of 1961 and the suspicion that a mole in the agency must have tipped the Cubans off as to the American government's plan of invasion. From there we flash back to 1939 where we meet Wilson as a student at Yale recruited by the FBI to perform surveillance on a poetry professor with possible ties to the then-burgeoning Nazi Party. From then on, the film traces the arc of Wilson's life as he gets rooked into a largely loveless marriage (if one can call having to marry Angelina Jolie being ""rooked""), trains as an agent with British Intelligence and then the O.S.S., then helps to lay the groundwork for the American ""peace time"" organization known as the C.I.A. The movie cuts back and forth between the two different time periods with only a few moments of confusion evident along the way.Wilson is probably the most button-downed, completely internalized character to hit the screen since Heath Ledger's Ennis del Mar in ""Brokeback Mountain"" (though the character here is not nearly as fully realized as that one was). Wilson is a man almost totally devoid of humor and emotions - in many ways, the ideal person for the life of commitment and loneliness that spy work, by its very nature, demands. Wilson barely cracks a smile throughout the course of the story, and he is so thoroughly absorbed in his work that he doesn't see his wife and young son for literally years at a stretch. Wilson is surely one of the least audience-friendly of recent movie protagonists - or at least he would be if Damon did not convey the sort of puppy-dog vulnerability that actually makes us care about the character. Despite the fact that we know he has dedicated his life to a cause that he considers worthwhile and noble, we have a hard time approving of the way he treats his wife and family. Yet, Damon is able so show us that Wilson is not all that crazy about himself either and that he would lead a different life if only he were able to crawl out of his own skin and start all over. But this he cannot do, so he remains locked in his fate, true to what he knows how to do and hoping for a little redemption at the end if the gods should deem him worthy of that blessing. Damon plays his cards so close to the vest that he makes us continually re-evaluate the character without ever revealing more than we need to know about him. Wilson may at times be taking stock of his life, but the filmmakers don't feel the need to blatantly spell all the details out for us. It's in what's going on BEHIND those bespectacled eyes that the true drama lies.The movie does not shy away from the ugly realities of life as a CIA agent, showing us the cold-blooded ruthlessness and mounting paranoia that come with any life built, as this one is, on deception and distrust.Rather than aiming his film at the action crowd, De Niro has decided to focus on the characters and dialogue and simply hope that his audience will follow along with him. As a director, he brings a quiet, subdued tone to the story, the better to match the persona of his main character. In order to create a mood of contrasting emotions, cinematographer Robert Richardson uses a dull palette for the scenes set in the present, and a glowing, sepia-toned look for those set in the past.De Niro has assembled a veritable who's who of Hollywood's biggest and brightest to flesh out the minor roles - William Hurt, Alec Baldwin, Billy Crudup, Timothy Hutton, John Turturro, Joe Pesci, even De Niro himself - but, frankly, their parts are so limited that none truly stands out, thus clearing the way for Damon to take center stage. Jolie has rarely looked so dreamily beautiful before, but even her screen time is too minimal for her to make more than a glancing impact on the film as a whole (it's hard to believe any man would be as callously indifferent to the Jolie charm as Damon is here, but then, hey, that's Hollywood).This is clearly Damon's film and he proves once again that acting does not need to be ""theatrical"" and ""showy"" to be effective. His performance is the glue that holds this long, potentially unwieldy film together.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Great, but still, no Departed","Although the movie was rather lengthy, it nevertheless delivered a superb message and stellar acting by Damon, Jolie, DeNiro, and Crudup. The movie is set in a time when the country was in high suspicion of Russian military competitiveness, and succeeds in setting the atmosphere of dubiousness and mistrust. Damon plays a man with one facial expression (seriously, his face doesn't change throughout the course of the film) who quickly becomes one of the main facets of the newly constructed CIA. Jolie is also terrific, one of the first good performances I've seen her in in a long time. Billy Crudup has the cutest English accent and Deniro is Deniro, an acting God if there ever was one. The film is worth the time spent because it educates the viewer on the time period and the emotions exhibited by those affected by espionage. Definitely, worthy of best picture and best director nod for DeNiro. The man can do no wrong.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Big Disappointment,"I was eager to see this even though it was under 60% on Rotten Tomatoes. I guess I will go back to not seeing something in theaters if it can get a fresh rating.The movie is about nothing. The story doesn't make you care about the main character, his marriage, or his lost love. The ""Birth of the CIA"" story has nothing to say, not about the creation of the CIA, the difficult role they play, and the decisions they make. With three or four possible tales to tell, the script doesn't deliver any of them. It either needed to be much longer to tell all the stories, or cut down a lot to be interesting.Basically, the movie has nothing to say, and takes a long time to not say it. If your compelled to see it, wait for DVD, not worth the ticket price, and nothing will be lost moving to a TV.",2.0,Anonymous,History
"Good movie, must buy on DVD","This was a very good movie, it kind of moves slow at first, and a lot of the time your wondering what some things have to do with everything, but it all comes together in the end. Matt Damon is a man of little words, and doesn't say much, but words aren't needed, thoughts and emotions are read in his face.I wouldn't recommend this film for anybody who has trouble following flashbacks and remembering details that happen in the beginning because that is what the movie is made of. THe movie spans over the time of about 20 years, following Edward Wilson (Damon)and the effects he has on the CIA and the effects they have on him and his family.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Good Sleeper,"So, I have read some of the reviews here, and intelligent is not a description I would offer this film. An attempt at serious perhaps, but not a great film by any means.As many have noted, the film is long and tiresome. It is very difficult to keep up with the jumping time lines, and the plot is equally difficult to ascertain. Unlike a film such as Pulp-Fiction, you never quite know where you are in the story. Nothing ties together well, and the biggest letdown is that the end of the film is hardly a worthy conclusion for three hours of waiting.I say this, don't take my word for it. If you can bear three hours of dragging dramatics, see it for yourself and be the judge. Just don't forget to have a pillow with you, you're going to need it.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Best Movie I saw In 2006,"I loved this movie, the acting, The directing, The story line, Another great performance by Damon & Baldwin. Anything with Alec Baldwin is good, he nails all those small roles. Denerio does not make himself a main Character and as a director really takes you though every possible aspect of the story. Matt Damons facial expressions, or lack there off really spells out the type of man he is. It never changes whether its with a meeting with a mortal enemy or a conversation with his wife, he is expression less as he is emotionless. When the movie ended I wanted to see more, not because I felt like there was something left out, but because it was so intense and so well done I could have sat there for another 2 1/2 hours. Out of a possible 1 out of 10 rating I give it a 9. A must see.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The Poor Little Lamb Who Has Lost His Way ...,"THE GOOD SHEPHERD is a story that has been told before, in many guises. Director Robert DeNiro and screenwriter Eric Roth attempt to disguise the story by draping it in cloak-and-dagger attire, but going undercover doesn't hide the basic narrative at all. It is the story of a man who places his devotion to his career over his duties as a family man, all the while destroying the family even as he intends to protect it. The pretense that the film is a layer by layer revelation of the history of the CIA doesn't accentuate, but distracts from the human drama, and only unnecessarily pads the film with details that are sometimes fascinating and sometimes just clichÃ©.Matt Damon plays the fictional Edward Wilson, and the story follows this character's youthful days of semi-innocence to his rise as the head of the CIA, culminating with the Bay of Pigs incident in the early 1960's. Damon plays the part quite well, but it is a performance of determined emptiness and shallow emotion. That is, of course, the point of the character, but it is also the fatal flaw of both the role and the film. It is hard to care about someone who finds it hard to care. And like Edward, the story strays so far away, and for so long, from his family, that the emotional impact is greatly muted.The human drama is almost like bookends: we learn about how he gets sucked into marriage at the beginning and how his family gets sucked into his professional web of intrigue at the end. But for the bulk of the movie we seem to check into his family life just to let us know they are still around. And when the story does circle back around to Edward's relationship with his son, Edward Jr. (played by Eddie Redmayne), it all seems greatly rushed, with key moments edited out. It's like DeNiro looked at his watch and finally realized he had dallied too long on the cool spy stuff and had to make a mad dash to get home on time. Plus, the ponderous espionage trickery throughout only serves to make the sudden twists, turns and revelations made at the end appear to be unnecessarily contrived.The film is carefully made and DeNiro has a good eye for the camera, there's nothing too showy or too overly dramatic. And his ability to assemble a strong cast that includes Angelina Jolie, William Hurt, Billy Crudup, Timothy Hutton, John Turturro and others, certainly doesn't hurt. But the film's lack of focus leads everything astray. I suppose Edward Sr.'s descent into joyless isolation as a human being is supposed to mirror the CIA's journey from noble cause to sinister depths, and that is all well and good as far as it goes. But, ironically, by the time the film ends amid the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs mess, the message seems to be not that his career has harmed his family, but that his family has harmed his career. Like Edward, the film doesn't have its priorities straight.",4.0,Anonymous,History

Listen Very Closely and Pay Closer Attention,"This movie is one that you have to work at and it is a real Hoot. First and foremost no one in the theater could hear what was going on. Yes, it is a spy movie, but no one sitting in the theater was going to give away any of their secrets. They were so serious about what they were talking about that they didn't want to tell us and we paid for them to let us in on what was going on. Finally I told them to turn up the volume and then we could almost hear what they were saying to each other. One of my friends that came up to me after the movie, and wished us a Happy New Year, then remarked to us that he didn't know a bit more after saw the movie than when he first went in, in which my wife quickly agreed with him. He then ask me if I knew what in the world the movie was about. Well, I can say that I did get a general knowledge of what was going on, but I did think that the movie could have been a lot better. If you like a spy movie then you might like this one, but be aware that you only have an outside chance of liking this movie. Some of the people in the movie left before it was even over, and I think they left because the movie just didn't make any sense and it was just to hard hear and to follow. Matt did a great job as did all the other's in the movie it was just too poorly shot. Although as I said if you really like Spy movies when believe me this Movie is for you.

Unconventional in a good way...but be prepared to engage yourself in this movie...,"A brilliant movie. It is, perhaps, a bit hard to follow. You may want to watch it again. It's a bit unconventional as you may be lost if you're searching for traditional hero-like character, but in another sense, you are more involved in the movie and it forces you to reflect on yourself. I will say no more...as I would like to promote more people to see it rather than just to discuss it...but I think Robert De Niro deserves proper credit for this film. Some other big names went into the production of this movie, as well, such as Francis Ford Coppola...who is responsible for two of my favorite movies, ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""The Godfather Part II."" I enjoy movies that give you something to walk away with...that may be something like a personal reflection or a different view of the world. This movie will give you something to walk away with, even if they are questions you've already asked yourself time and time again. Perhaps, as a politics and philosophy senior who's headed into the ""real world"" next year, these questions are different for me, but I'm sure we can all relate to our own jobs and values. Following along with the storyline may be a challenge, but along with the lessons learned from this movie, I would recommend reading Plato's ""Republic"" (his section on the family unit) and watching the movie ""Syriana"". If you're looking for diversion, do not watch this film! If you're looking for a political movie...but would like more diversion I'd recommend ""Pan's Labyrinth""...it takes place in Spain but the main character looks strangely similar to Peron of Argentina.",10.0,Anonymous,History

It was like Bobby D wanted to strangle the drama right out of his story.And it looked like a Calvin Klein ad. The lighting was so fake and the art direction so self conscious.

I thought that it was a slow moving movie and the flashbacks made it confusing, but the artistic flow of the movie was creative and I give a lot of credit to De Niro and the cinematographer on making a very good production. I believe that they may have used some of the styles used in Capote because it had the same flow in that retrospect is has potential for success since the academy enjoyed Capote and gave it the highest honor, the Academy Award for Best picture.

Don't miss this movie!,"This was a great movie, Matt Damon has always been a fantastic actor, and it shows again here.I like the film for a few reasons. I like all the main actors, and even though you sometimes run the risk of having too much star power when casting a bunch of A-list actors, this movie had enough supporting roles filled with new actors (and even some supporting roles filled with great names like Alec Baldwin, Timothy Hutton and Billy Crudup) that the integration of the two overcame that risk. I very much liked the historical and literary references. For those of us who are too young to have remembered (or were even born yet) during this time, it was very educational. At no point did I get any feel of Hollywood sensationalism.

A Finely Disguised Mess,"""The Good Shepherd"" is a semi-engaging, but ultimately flawed film that cannot seem to find a way to make any point or to develop more than one of its characters. This is a shame, as the cast (particularly director/co-star De Niro, Billy Crudup, Timothy Hutton -- in a very abbreviated appearance, and Oleg Stefan) want to make this a meaningful film.Instead, ""The Good Shepherd"" finds itself fumbling the story of Edward Wilson and his experiences from Yale in 1939 to working for the CIA in 1961. Without ever developing or realizing the world from which Wilson must have come -- the WASPish, old-money, perpetual holders of power, or giving any insight into the world into which Wilson later finds himself, De Niro instead takes nearly three hours to present a perpetually quiet (and perhaps shy) Wilson, portrayed awkwardly by Matt Damon, and little else. The most revealing and truthful (to the Wilson character) line comes in an almost throw-away scene later in the film, but even then De Niro fails to capitalize on it.""The Good Shepherd"" is well shot, and it demonstrates a high level of respect for both the eras (late 1930s-early 1960s) and to film conventions that help audiences identify with them (though De Niro handles the music selection for the film admirably). Throughout it, and ultimately more so at the end, ""The Good Shepherd"" simply has nothing to say.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Regarding the movie,"While I agree on some of the points that were made regarding the movie, I find it interesting in the way these people handled things during that time. Many people that will go and see the movie did not grow up in the 50's and 60's thinking that at any moment that the USSR would and could attack at any moment with missiles across the Arctic circle much less Cuba. I was an Air Force brat and we had a foot locker for each family member stored in the borax mines in CA should the time come for us to leave the base. It was amazing as to the number of spies, sleeper spies, and wannabe spies that were running around in the states. If you read history books that would detail out the activity during this time. This film would fit right in. This film only focused on a couple of things in general, Duty, Honor, Country. You have to ask yourself the question, would you do the same thing? A possible answer today would be ""How much are you going to pay me?"". Interesting how our values have changed in over the years.I liked the film for the period in which is focused on.

He may be able to play a credible Justice Scalia in some other movie, some other day perhaps! The movie itself is slow, pointless, and tedious mess! The worst direction I've ever seen from an a-list actor turned director! Who is going to believe a twenty year old character played by femme fatale Angelina Jolie? What about this kid who played Damon's son? Was he suppose to be gay or what? Neither the screenplay nor the director bothered much to explain to the audience the logic behind of what unfolds on this drama turned disaster, you just have to take a leapt of faith and accept everything as a matter of fact! Joe Pesci appears in one scene not to add more depth to it or to add a new dimension, He only appears so The Character played by Damon Can say ""All the foreigners are just visiting here"" . Why was Damon's son in Africa hanging out with black girls? was he already working for the agency? Was he living there? Was he working for the UN? was he selling guns to Al Queda? No one knows! The truth is that no one really cared much about this particular guy in the first place! This Mess of a movie goes on forever!

I think we give the CIA too much credit,"Generally speaking i try to hold myself to a couple rules about movie viewing. 1. Be wary of anything starring Matt Damon 2. Shy away from any movie where Angelina Jolie isn't wearing spandex. This movie however flew in the face of both of my rules of thumb. Matt Damon actually does a surprisingly good job, its got to be hard to play a character that is written so well its almost too realistic for its own good. Angelina Jolie plays a decent role as the dejected wife of a man she barely knows and Alec Baldwin...well considering how much practice he has acting out the same character its hard to say the he did poorly. Robert De Niro has essentially attained an acting status where even his horrible roles can just be chocked up to the desire to make money, but he is a movie icon for a reason. My favorite part of this movie is that it seems as if Joe Pesci came out of retirement, i mean you can't not like Joe Pesci. Overall i would say that this is definitely a movie worth watching very acceptable cast and you can tell that the movie is about the story and not how many times they can squeeze Matt Damon's face onto the screen.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Excellent Movie, but a little too long...","Overall, De Niro did an amazing job directing this movie. Definitely an amazing look inside the inner workings of the CIA during it's infantile stages. Well acted by the entire cast. Specifically, Damon. He has come a long way. I definitely think he's got a legitimate shot at an Oscar if not for this, then definitely for The Departed. There were times when the movie seemed a bit scatter-brained and a little long and drawn out. The run time was about 2h 40m. I thought the story could have wrapped around 1h 45m or 2h. Just to see how Damon's character must lie and keep lying to keep himself and the CIA going was unbelievable. The strings that were pulled from over here to affect things thousands of miles away fascinated me. Long story short, pardon the pun, De Niro deserves an Oscar for this amazing movie.

The rest of you are just visitingÂ…The Good Shepherd,"The Good Shepherd tells the story of Edward Wilson and his ascent in the ranks of the CIA's Counter-Intelligence division. This stoic Yale graduate found himself at the cusp of war with an offer to help serve his country, and, as is shown throughout, the call of country and brotherhood will always supercede that of God and family. Wilson's life becomes so caught up in his job, which was necessary to keep his country thriving throughout World War II and the Cold War that all his personal attachments slowly deteriorate. Wilson loves his son, but only with his heart left over from loving the values his country gives him. A true utilitarian, he doesn't have the ability to side with a single person when the whole of America's fate lies in the balance. He is a man of strong convictions and controlled actions, and although it seems his life has destroyed that of those close to him, it was in fact his own life he destroyed so many years ago.I give De Niro much credit for delving into a subject as ambitious as the start of the CIA in just his second feature film. Not only is this subject matter complicated and shrouded in mystery, the structure of the script is one of shifting years and flashbacks. We begin in 1961 as the Bay of Pigs Invasion fails miserably because of a breach in intelligence. The duration of the film shows us how Edward Wilson has gotten to the point of being lead on a failed mission, and to solving the question of who turned their back on the country. Wilson is played magnificently by Matt Damon, his emotions always held close and, while etched in his features, always bottled inside. This nuanced performance truly encompasses the character's conflicted nature between serving himself and serving his nation. His evolution from an ambitious college student playing women's roles in plays to the hardened man able to see the enemy as a statistic is heartbreaking, especially as we see those few people who tried to save him from his path of eventually solitude.Being such a long film, spanning three decades of history, there are many supporting players coming in and out of view. Most do an admirable job in keeping appearances up by playing against Damon at multiple points in his life. Michael Gambon deserves notice as a man who worked in the business yet knew what it could do in destroying any chance of love in one's life. He knew how life would end if he didn't give his all to the job, but didn't care about the consequences when the alternative was turning himself off to life's pleasures and beauty. Angelina Jolie surprised me in her role as Damon's wife. Her emotional range was vast and she played it nuanced enough for the audience to be able to feel for her plight. However, while Jolie did well, her female counterpart Tammy Blanchard truly stole the show. I had never heard of her before checking into people's reactions about the film. Many said how good Blanchard was, and after seeing for myself, I can't do anything but agree. She is the true love of Damon's character, a beautiful romantic who's deafness never stood in the way of how they felt for each other. Her innocence is a metaphor for the film and Edward Wilson's journey through it. Once she was removed from his life, humanity was lost forever.While the story was wonderfully constructed and perfectly revealed its motives, it was not a perfect film. I don't pin its failures on any one person, however, but instead on its epic scale. Maybe De Niro is to blame for not using different actors in portraying Damon and Jolie's characters in younger years, but the aging process used was not believable. As shown in 1960, they are done up nicely, wrinkled and etched with the pain of a long fifty years of life. The real trouble is in the early scenes. While Damon probably could have passed as a college student in the 30's, the filmmakers decide to use his natural look for the 40's and try to make him look younger with a badly done hairdo for the college years. As for Jolie, they decide to use her natural look for the 30's and end up making it look like a 35 year old is hitting on a 20 year old. I also think, while Billy Crudup is great casting as an intelligence agent, he is a horrible selection as a British intelligence agent. The accent is horrid and one of the few blemishes acting wise here. My main criticism, though, is the length. Yes, the time flew by as I became enthralled in the story, but it still could have been tightened up. There are many scenes that could have been excised without losing any insight into the proceedings. The most blatant moment was the five-minute scene that brought the great Joe Pesci out of retirement. Besides the final line by Damon, (which could have been put somewhere else, as it was a great line), the whole scene appears to be there only to show Pesci off and does little to advance the plot.Besides these minor squabbles, The Good Shepherd is a remarkable film. Many speak badly about it as the action is not there, there is little espionage and spy genre aspects, etc. This film is not a spy film, but instead a human portrait of a man who slowly watching himself go down a path that his father went down. In living his life for his country he never allowed himself to live his life for himself. While America was able to flourish his own love for life was stunted and he could do nothing but watch everything good in it slowly fade into the past.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Classy and memorable,"We live in an age when movies dealing with topics such as these must feature likable heroes and outlandish violence to keep the audience entertained, yet here is a movie that asks us not to sympathize with its protagonist - but merely to understand him and to appreciate what he believes in.Edward Wilson believes in America, and he believes in the sanctity of his government and its commitment to bettering the lives of its people. The Good Shepherd tells of how he helped to form what eventually became known as the Central Intelligence Agency, and studies the negative effect it has on his private life.This film's director, Robert De Niro, shares Edward's passion for the CIA Â– he has been working on developing this film for at least nine years. The emotional and intellectual drive of the sort of men who would sacrifice so much for their country is what interests De Niro, and it's what gives the film a center. Here he has crafted a remarkably classy and well-observed (albeit fictionalized) ""what-if?"" chronicling the existence of the Central Intelligence Agency and the people who contributed to its formation.Edward Wilson is not a real person, and since there have never been any definitive files released divulging into the history of the CIA, De Niro and screenwriter Eric Roth rely upon various external sources to develop the movie. Wilson is most likely based upon James Angleton, for example, who was Head of Counterintelligence for almost two decades.Regardless of how accurate its historical elements are, the movie's real backbone is the study of the conflict between devotion to one's country and devotion to one's family, which could not be any realer. Edward finds himself sacrificing his relationship with his wife and their son for the sake of his country, and De Niro captures this poignancy in subtle scenes of human conflict. There's no corny exposition or Spielberg-style finale recap (as per the otherwise excellent Munich which Roth wrote) Â– the movie raises questions carefully about patriotism and obligation to family without dumbing down the material and taking its viewers for granted.The story may sound grand on paper, but The Good Shepherd is, in many respects, a small-scale epic Â– it isn't as big, bloated or operatic as one might expect Â– especially with a supporting cast featuring such renowned actors as Alec Baldwin, William Hurt, Joe Pesci, Billy Crudup, John Turturro and even De Niro himself. Nor is it as energized and direct as De Niro's last directorial effort, A Bronx Tale, from 1993.It is, instead, a rather plain and decisive feature. It's what a film about the mundane day-to-day life of a man in the CIA should be Â– it doesn't conform to the Hollywood spy-movie formula which requires there to be sequences of action and peril. Matt Damon may have played the ruthless assassin Jason Bourne in the past, but his performance here is a polar opposite: he is an average, boring everyman. And to his credit, the dull, monotonous characteristics work perfectly Â– he captures the essence of a pencil pusher and as his emotional detachment increases throughout the course of the movie, he becomes almost entirely loathsome.Some have complained that the movie's dragging pace and its unfocused narrative (the film jumps back and forth freely over the course of the story) are to blame for its lukewarm critical reception. Others have even gone so far as to criticize Damon's performance, complaining that he fails to create any rapport and that there is no connection between the character and the audience. But The Good Shepherd is a film entirely about the sacrifice of one's life for country, and as a study of this sense of blind patriotism it succeeds wonderfully. ""Get out while you still have a soul,"" Edward is told by one of the film's veteran spies. They're the words of an old man who has come to reflect upon his past, questioning the value of his sacrifice over the years. They are also words that come back to haunt Edward towards the end of De Niro's movie, which is one of the best of 2006.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A reign of confusion,"The Good Shepherd, coming so hot on the heels of a reinvention of James Bond, does much to stand out from the pack. Instead of making espionage seem more exciting or glamorous than it really is, it attempts to show the profession in its natural state. Unfortunately, it does this using a fictionalised version of a founding member of the CIA. This approach has its upsides and downsides, of course. Since the CIA's archives are full of disinformation, it is expecting far too much that an account of the organisation's history be completely factual. However, the narrative style creates an abundance of confusion. The first thirty minutes in particular can be summed up with a quote spoken by James Woods during Videodrome: ""So when does the plot start to unravel here?"". While I applaud the effort to make a film that does not assume its audience is borderline retarded, allowing ease of plot navigation does allow some of the deeper details to shine through. But this is a moot point, as much of the best experience the film offers is in reflecting on what one has just seen.One of the film's key problems is the decision to not use any makeup or other such special effects to age Matt Damon as he takes the journey of his character. With an actor who is capable of appearing to be in his fifties under the right lighting, this is not such a big deal. But Matt Damon is not such an actor. He looks like he should be on one of those high-school soap operas that were all the rage in the 1990s, not portraying a man who could order the death of anyone he pleases. Angelina Jolie, who is far more believable as a covert agent even in the 1940s, is instead relegated to a sideline role as the long-suffering wife of our central character. If it had only relied on the performances of these two main actors, The Good Shepherd would have sunk to an embarrassing low. Fortunately, the story instead focuses on ironies, making its point by showing the yawning gulf that widens every time Damon's character is forced to put his job before his family. This is indeed where The Good Shepherd derives all of its strength.The film adaptation of Fight Club was criticised by fans of the novel for changing the story structure into a linear pattern, but I think The Good Shepherd illustrates why this is actually a good thing. As The Good Shepherd leaps back and forth between the CIA of the 1960s and the events leading to its foundation, confusion reigns as to who is doing what and when at times. When the narrative does become focused enough for the viewer to understand what the story is about, the realisation takes over that a good forty minutes of the script could have been jettisoned without the slightest impact to the story's cohesion. Yes, these forty minutes attempt to make other points, but they do not add anything. Another problem is that, given that the central mystery of the film is who gave away one of the CIA's big secrets in the failed Bay Of Pigs invasion, the answer is foreshadowed in such a ham-fisted manner that the audience spends much of its time waiting for the central character to catch up with them.On the plus side, it is quite astounding that a film of such length about one of the world's nastiest government organisations contains so little actual violence. Instead, it focuses on the organisational and familial relationships of its pioneers, building all of the characters as human beings. This way, when the assassinations or suicides do come, they have about ten times the impact of the myriad of slayings that occur in such films as Goodfellas. Towards the end, when we are shown there is literally no one that Matt Damon's character will not kill for his country, it sends a shockwave of revulsion through the audience. But it is also the dialogues that hammer home the point of the film. When we see the offices of the CIA about to open as Damon eyes the unfinished furnishings, we are given one of the best in-film explanations of the story's inaccuracies and fabrications. Sure, the CIA is intended to have civilian oversight, one of its members jokes, but they must be mad if they think we are going to let them in on any of this.In the end, what makes The Good Shepherd work is that unlike a lot of films supposedly based on facts, De Niro apparently stands by every creative decision made in the process. Sure, the film is very loose with the facts as they are officially known, and the characters are amalgamated, but there is no apology for it. Indeed, as I said above, there is even a good justification given. A lesser director would have used the fact that the facts as the public are allowed to know them and the real facts are two different things to gin up the script and go down the James Bond route. Although there is one dialogue that was recently featured in similar context within a Bond film, its usage here confirms the greater authenticity of the new Bond compared to its predecessors. The ""get out of this business while you still have a soul left"" speech is going to become a staple of spy films for a long time to come. And the end of The Good Shepherd particularly reinforces it with actions rather than words. Its just a pity that the rest of the film seems so jumbled and out of (narrative) focus.All told, I gave The Good Shepherd an eight out of ten. That De Niro worked for over a decade to get it made proves that there are passions worth fighting for. It is one of the most enjoyable films I have been confused by in years.",8.0,Anonymous,History
tedious and fragmented,"Beware of flashbacks! It's a rare film that bounces around in time without losing its audience. Not only did I lose my way, but I lost interest. Matt Damon's character was too self-contained to care about, and it simply went on being fragmented and confusing for far too long.As with many films about spying, this one tried so hard to impress us with the complexities of being a spook that I was mostly just baffled by the twists and turns. I kept asking myself a lot of questions like ""Now who's THAT?"" and ""Why's he doing that NOW?""It's possible I'm just too stupid to understand, but I suspect that it's like a mystery novel, in which there's a tempting notion that you can somehow deduce who the murderer is from clues in the story, but in fact you really can't until key facts are revealed at the end. I'm a bit skeptical that any viewer without specialized knowledge could ever really follow this film.I had the same problems with Syriana, but at least it lacked the flashbacks.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Worth seeing but not for Matt Damon,"Good movie and could follow the somewhat complex story line. Thought Matt Damon was very unbelievable -- he looked too young throughout the movie to be believable. Thought Angelina Jolie was good but nothing unusual about her performance. The real female star was Tammy Blanchard who played Laura -- I hope we see more of her. The real male star was William Hurt -- always creepy and interesting -- a good combination for this film. Robert DeNiro as General Sullivan was good but an Italian playing an Irishman -- even with the New York accent as a common thread --was not very believable. Wild Bill Donovan, who started the OSS and Sullivan's obvious model, would not be pleased.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Spy Who Left the Rest of Us in the Cold,"As a filmmaker, Robert DeNiro shows the influence of his generation of great directors like Scorsese and Coppola with this epic-length 2006 film. In fact, there is a certain structural similarity to ""The Godfather"" in DeNiro's careful unfolding of the time-spanning story penned by screenwriter Eric Roth. The plot focuses on a fictionalized account of the first twenty years of the CIA as seen through the experiences of one agent named Edward Wilson, an intentionally cryptic study in excessive self-control which makes him ideal for his career. Ironically, the main problem with the film is the stoic coldness of the central character for which DeNiro and Roth cannot seem to find a voice that would make the story resonate. There is little sense of a personal journey for Wilson, even though there are hints of it beginning with his father's suicide, which is used as a leitmotif throughout the story.Another frustration of the film is the constant time-jumping between the fallout over the failed Bay of Pigs mission in 1961 and key episodes in Wilson's earlier years. The technique doesn't make the drama any more interesting than it really is. Unfortunately there is no getting around the fact that despite the handsome production detail, the movie is a slog at 248 minutes and quite often, an amazing bore. DeNiro has assembled a can't-miss cast, including himself as a pre-CIA operative, but for the most part, they are stranded by a script consisting of coded exchanges and predictable dialogue, the latter most prevalent in the domestic scenes. Matt Damon does all he can as the poker-faced Wilson, but he is given little latitude to elicit empathy for his character.While she starts out with her fiery persona intact, Angelina Jolie has a progressively smaller role as Wilson's increasingly embittered wife Clover merely defined by how shut off she is from Wilson's clandestine profession. DeNiro inexplicably does not age either Damon or Jolie with any conviction over the course of the story, and there is an oddly unsettling dynamic when they are shown as the parents of a fully grown son. Better among the huge cast are William Hurt as a lifelong mentor; Tammy Blanchard as Wilson's true love, a hearing-impaired coed with whom he is reunited years later; Billy Crudup as a rather fey British counterspy; Alec Baldwin as a covert FBI agent; and John Turturro as Wilson's no-nonsense colleague. The 2007 DVD is short on extras, as it just contains seven deleted scenes of little additional interest. Unsurprisingly, the taciturn DeNiro does not offer a director's commentary here.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Pretentiously Absurd,"A dull plodding work, pretentiously earnest at best, that could benefit from being trimmed by an hour and excluding the distracting cameos. While constructed in an exercise in literary cinema, the viewer is treated to a CIA history taken from the archives of pop culture and urban myth. Best viewed at home with a finger on the forward button. Is it written in Matt Damon's contract that he doesn't age while his co-star, the most decidedly un-WASPy Angelina Jolie, must play a hag worthy of the first act of Macbeth? The theme of corruption played out in career and family has been done before better in the ""Godfather"" trilogy, which Deniro must have known. Incidentally, the Bay of Pigs failed in much the same way as way as most military operations do when they run into swampland, but in this movie character, and not geography is destiny.",3.0,Anonymous,History
I just want to add one thing,"I agree with what has been said in praise of this movie. It's very good. I will not repeat others' comments, although I support them. I'll only add one bit. The film mentions the cause of the Bay of Pigs fiasco as being the fact that the Cubans knew when and where the attackers would land. While true, the movie does not mention the main reason the operation was a bloody disaster: the fact that President Kennedy canceled the mission's air support at the 11th hour. Was this left out for any reason? It distorts the uninformed viewer's understanding of that ugly episode of history. I wonder if this is due to ignorance or bias.",9.0,Anonymous,History

This guy is stone and about as interesting to watch as one. The cast includes a lot of highly regarded names but everyone is more or less a stiff.Now, maybe this is an accurate portrait of the time, the profession and the people involved Â– but then it is not really a funny portrait to watch.

"Bad script, non-existent characters, ""Get Smart"" parody","A draggy, clichÃ©d, and in keeping with a deplorable modern trend, a too-hard-to-hear for us older folks, movie. There were no characters to care about, and the acting is overrated. John Turturro caricatured himself. Matt Damon totally failed to create a character probably because of the bad script. But a good actor doesn't start shooting until he's figured out who the person is he's going to play, and Damon failed. The Jolie character was a total clichÃ© from top to bottom. The cloak and dagger stuff was almost caricature. I thought I was watching an old episode of ""Get Smart."" The jumping back and forth in time served no purpose other than to confuse us.

Family Man - Not,"I've said it before and now I'll say it again after seeing this movie, a further vindication of my basic philosophy concerning any espionage agency of any type of any country in the world: keep out all marrieds, all family types. That's right: no husbands, no wives, no fathers, no sons; no mothers, no daughters, no friends of either persuasion. And no pets, especially, no pets. Get the loners. Don't worry -- there are plenty of them out there. 95% of the impediment to effective operations within these agencies -- and you've seen it in ""Sheperd"" as you have in ""Russia House"", and, I dare say, as you will see in the next big spy thriller with Jammie Foxx (name escapes) -- is, once and for all, relationships.

"So long, so underdeveloped","This movie achieved the rare feat of being way too long and yet underdeveloped. It's like watching part of 20 different movies about the same guy. Half of the scenes seem almost unconnected to the other's, other than Damon's character is in them. For example, Pesci's scene serves no purpose other than to give Pesci something to do and to provide lines for the trailer. It's boring, it's long, and it's tedious. Now I know why the story of the birth of the CIA went untold for so long. Because it's so boring.Damon does not do a good job. His character is supposed to be going through a transformation similar to Pacino in the Godfather, but Damon plays the character the same way throughout. So you never get the feeling that the CIA made him into what he becomes. He seems that way all along.Also, Damon and Jolie don't age in the film even though more than 20 years pass. At the end, Damon has a son that looks the same age as him.This is a wonderful looking film. But it is very slow and very boring and deeply flawed.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Angelina Jolie: they needed someone else,"I don't know why the review says Jolie did a good job. I thought she was awful.She shows up, and is having animal sex with the main character in a matter of seconds. I know we can't expect much else from Hollywood these days, but it was too jarring, and she made it worse.She seemed inconsistent with what was going on in several places, almost as if she just happened to be walking through the set of the wrong movie.Yes, in a few parts I thought she did OK, but then there was the scene where she finally gets really mad at ""mother"" for never being around. It was way overdone, and out of character, given that she'd said very little about it before that. Of course, I'll admit that part of that was bad editing or something. The film frequently showed you things without explaining them, and I don't mean as a means of showing a shadowy world either, I mean outright editing storytelling mistakes because there was no information or correlation with the rest of the story.Finally, Jolie acted like a 1990s woman the whole time. Did anyone tell her that this movie was set in 1939-1961? Still, I thought the movie was really good, even though it needs to be re-edited pretty bad.I enjoyed the close look at an individual of that time period, and the mental games.One thing you must do when seeing this movie is try hard to remember even little details, because they are important later on.I thought Alex Baldwin was very good, in spite of the short time on screen, and everyone else did a really good job too.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Long, drawn out, and downright boring look, at the history of the CIA.","Credit IMDbLaconic and self-contained, Edward Wilson heads CIA covert operations during the Bay of Pigs. The agency suspects that Castro was tipped, so Wilson looks for the leak. As he investigates, he recalls, in a series of flashbacks, his father's death, student days at Yale (poetry; Skull and Bones), recruitment into the fledgling OSS, truncated affairs, a shotgun marriage, cutting his teeth on spy craft in London, distance from his son, the emergence of the Cold War, and relationships with agency, British, and Soviet counterparts. We watch his idealism give way to something else: disclosing the nature of that something else is at the heart of the film's narration as he closes in on the leak.I really don't remember a whole lot about this one. Other then it had a great cast, I found nothing overly interesting.

Early history of  US version of international espionage from OSS through early CIA (Bay of Pigs),"Movie is well produced. My original intention was to see ""Casino Royale"" and found out it was sold out... ""Good Shepherd"" had some seats available. Had not heard anything bad or good about it... Figured that it would be interesting since I like John LeCarre books and found Norman Mailer's book ""Harlot's Ghost"" intriguing (no pun intended) so figured I would take a chance... It was a riveting three hours, you had to stay awake to follow plot. Twists and turns kept me thinking... Not the blockbuster or special effects that Casino Royale would have been, but definitely NOT a waste of time! Happy I saw it.

Am I the only one who hated this movie?,"This movie was way too long and not coherent enough to keep my attention for that long. I was constantly checking my cell phone for the time and 3 hours seemed to take forever. I also think that Angelina Jolie wasn't that great in the film and I am a huge fan of hers. Matt Damon was very good and so was the guy who played his son. The entire movie goes back and forth between the past and the 'present'(1960s). This makes it really hard to follow the movie which has a very complex story line that ultimately resulted in me having no idea what what was going on. If you really want to see this movie then wait and rent it. It'll be cheaper and you can pause it and take a breather. Basically, this movie didn't live up to its hype.",3.0,Anonymous,History

I found the Alex Baldwin, Michael Gambon, William Hurt and Tammy Blanchard above average. I think Robert De Niro outdid himself in his direction and his portrayal of Wild Bill Donovan (Sullivan) in the movie.

Was not Thrilled,"I was just plain and simple not thrilled. I hope I am not the only one either. In a movie with so many names and common faces(Damon, De Niro, Angelina Jolie, Sir Michael Gambon, Alec Baldwin), one would expect perhaps a better overall production. The plot had so many dead ends and inconsistencies it was hard to keep up with. Matt Damon is a tremendous actor, but in this film his character was lamer than a duck. I found myself not caring at all about ANY of the characters whatsoever. I am not sure about DeNiro's directing style either, I think that this was a major contributor to the weakening of this film. Various characters flocked in and out of the plot line while it jumped back and forth across a span of 20plus years. All of which contributed almost nothing in my opinion. Of course, maybe I am being a little too harsh, there were some strong points. I did enjoy the lighting and cinematography.Overall however, I found myself fighting off the incessant burden of severe boredom, and more fascinated with counting the number of people who either passed out or got up and left. Not what I expected to see, and I would not recommend this to prospective viewers.",5.0,Anonymous,History
An atmospheric and intelligent watch,"The Good Shepherd contains all the elements a good espionage film should. Note that I said a ""good espionage film"". It's true this will leave much to be desired for those who like a few gunfights and a car chase thrown into the movie mixing bowl. However, outrageous action often serves to detract from a strong plot and is frequently a trite and premature release of powerful tension.I enjoyed this film immensely. The more energetic and climactic scenes were not over done and still left a foreboding atmosphere that would have been a shame to dissipate after building for some time. One of the strengths here is that nothing is ever fully resolved. Much like in reality, it seems were are holding back an inevitable tide or overcome small obstacles only to confront the next.De Niro's direction is brilliant and the dark visuals add to the noir atmosphere. Damon's subtle performance fits perfectly into this landscape, with every small and subtle action so much is displayed. The hallmark of a great performance.If you are a fan of intense, intelligent films and enjoy having to concentrate and think instead of just watch, then The Good Shepherd will not disappoint.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"""Hello Mother...There's Been a Stranger in our House""","Matt Damon gives an ""out of this world"" performance in SHEPHERD and his strength of character and his subtle handling of ""Mr. Wilson""-an irony for the lead character to be named after President Woodrow Wilson who wanted ""isolationism"" for the United States-throughout the film is one to admire and remember. From the first scene to the last, ""Mother"" was a tower of strength in taking on the enemies of the United States for The CIA.Oh yes, ""The"" should be connected only with God, but in many ways the CIA played that role in its fight to dominate the world and make it safe for the ""American brand of democracy"", perhaps colored and shaped from that infamous fraternity, Skull and Bones.Angelina Jolie also is wonderful in her role as the wife who suffered from her husband's absence and his own personal brand of isolationism towards his family. Her luscious beauty was perfectly captured in her role on the screen.THE GOOD SHEPHERD is first and foremost such an intelligent and well written, directed and produced film with a great cast and a vast array of well constructed characters. But Matt Damon was like an orchestra leader in conducting the fascinating story of espionage and for providing us with a character who had the strength and wisdom of being ""the good shepherd"" for our CIA. I hope Mr. Damon will be awarded at Oscar time for a nomination as leading actor, as he well deserves it for bringing to the screen such an intense, intelligent and emotionally deprived character as Mr. Wilson.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Surpassed my expectations.,"This always looked like a good movie but I was afraid it would a difficult one and one that would be not always easy to follow. A typical movie that would also be full of itself and would try and look smarter and extra complicated than really necessary. I'll admit that in the beginning it also looked that way, when it kept jumping back and forth between past and present time. It made it hard to always understand what was going on and who all those characters were. But about halve an hour through the movie it got better and more understandable to follow, since it also becomes slowly obvious that the leaps in time were put in for story purposes and in the end were also actually essential for the movie.The movie is still an hard one to follow at certain points, which is mostly due to the many characters and names appearing in the movie. It gets all the more complicated when it seems that not all characters are who they say they are. The movie is especially difficult if you don't know at forehand what it is about. It doesn't become obvious in the movie until late that it's about the founding of the CIA.The movie its story didn't seemed to be the most interesting or intriguing (At first I was like; Oh no! Not another movie about the cold war!) one to follow but the movie makes some interesting and great choices, that always keep the movie intriguing, mysterious and in parts even tense. Thank the writer and director for that!It seems to me that the movie was deliberately kept small. They could had easily overblown things, especially with this sort of cast but every character and role in the movie is as big as needed and the movie does not have the usually typical thriller elements or other action spy-movie elements, though the movie in essence of course still is a spy-movie. The fact that the movie wasn't made as big was probably also a reason why this movie was a pleasant one to watch.The cast is great. Robert De Niro obviously had no difficulties with getting some big names to appear in his movie. Some even settle with appearing in some small roles. I'm talking about people such as Michael Gambon, John Turturro, William Hurt, Billy Crudup, Alec Baldwin (it's funny, the older he gets, the better his acting) and even Angelina Jolie, who is the second billing actor of the movie its role is kept small. It's really not the sort of role she usually plays. Also De Niro himself makes an appearance in the movie as does his good friend Joe Pesci, with his first role in 8 years.The main character is not always an easy one. It's a very quiet man, who also doesn't really seem to known how to express his feelings and therefor not the most appealing character, though definitely not the least interesting one of the movie. It's the reason why this probably isn't one of Matt Damon's most memorable roles but it of course doesn't mean that he didn't do a great job.What probably surprised me most about the movie was how well balanced it was. It isn't just a 'drama' it isn't just a 'thriller', it's a mix of several genre styles that all work out great together. Especially the relationship elements of the movie worked out well. Normally it's just put in the movie for commercial reasons and to appeal more to a certain group of audience. But in this case it was a real enrichment for the movie and its story.The movie also definitely has style. Visually the movie is good looking with the good cinematography from Robert Richardson and the nice looking sets and costumes that help to set up the right atmosphere for the movie, that's also consistent with the time period the movie is set in.Of course there still are some lesser things about the movie but especially for a 'non-director' like Robert De Niro is, it's a really great and well made movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,History
Central Intelligence,"Very loosely based on the life of the CIA Head of Counterintelligence during the 1960s, this drama looks at the early years of the agency and its difficulties with the Bay of Pigs. The structure is quite innovative with the film flipping back and forth between the World War II years and the 1960s as the protagonist, played by Matt Damon, is haunted by memories of past failures after being accused of an intelligence leak. Engaging as all this sounds, the film is oddly hard to get through. The lack of makeup to age Damon is the most obvious vice; the story is impossible to follow at times with it unclear whether certain scenes are taking place in the 1940s or 1960s. Then there is the absence of any passage of time between Damon's son as a preteen and adult (Eddie Redmayne is great in the role though). The film's biggest setback though is the fact that Damon's character is cold, reserved and uncharismatic throughout. With his constant poor choices in life, he becomes an incredibly hard person to like. He is not just flawed but almost without virtue. That said, his extreme willingness to put his work/country ahead of his family is certainly curious and the overall film offers a fascinating portrait of individuals doing morally ambiguous things in the name of protecting their country - the most memorable of which is using LSD in an interrogation (with obvious results). Add in a solid supporting turn from Tammy Blanchard, and 'The Good Shepherd' certainly has a number of things going in its favour, but one's mileage is likely to vary based on patience and interest in the subject matter.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Character study of a man in the CIA,"I saw this movie for the second time and found it every bit as good in 2009 as it was in 2006. It has a British atmosphere, quite different from Matt Damon's other work. It is a psychological spy story about a young man who makes his career with the CIA from the time of its creation. He stays there and the nature of the work takes a toll; in fact, it overtakes his life. The protagonists are engaged in a career of civilian warfare. We witness the old boy network from the upper-crust schools, the lack of real friendships and trust, and the failed home life. Damon's character evolves from a liberal arts student at Yale where he is smart and respected to a shadowy, stooped figure who realizes what his life has done to him. (The comments about him not ageing are not particularly relevant because you can sense it in his acting.) The character does not say this in so many words but it is clear that he has regrets. He is a private man who can keep confidences and this is why he was recruited for the position as a young man. In the end, he comes to grips with the person he has become but he is still capable of knowing the difference between virtue and vice, despite a career that is morally neutral. Angelina Jolie is the long-suffering wife and plays it to a tee. The expanding gulf between them does not diminish their love for their only child, played by a talented young performer, Eddie Redmayne. Because of him, Damon shows that he is still a human being.His mentors are played by performers like Michael Gambon (who pays a price for his indiscretions) and Robert DeNiro, who shows he is capable of not being completely consumed by the organization he headed up. There are brief appearances by actors like Joe Pesci, Keir Dullea (who goes back over 50 years), and Tim Hutton. His old girlfriend Laura (Tammy Blanchard) was his first love and he has a touching encounter with her much later in life.A very good movie and a class act by Matt Damon.",9.0,Anonymous,History
ageing and narrative thrust,"A well-mounted, solidly-performed piece that somehow never takes off. Maybe it's because I watched it in two sittings, but the plot structure felt episodic; nothing ever came to the boil. Also, the ageing of the leads over time was unconvincing. A film like 'The Sea Inside' is much more impressive on this score. Here, the fact that Damon looks little older than his grown-up son was a little jarring. Richardson's lighting is flawless, but didn't evolve with the story particularly. Score was very good, however. Worth seeing, but don't expect to be gripped.

Once Upon Time In The CIA !,"The intention was great; telling the history of the CIA, the controversial concept of the good shepherd, and the drama of that character. This is all good. But too much also!First of all, it's that desire of making a mini-series out of one movie. The multiple story-lines, along with some actors who looked superficially the same, not to mention the boring pace of (Matt Damon)--all of that managed to distract us all the way.(De Niro) directed only one movie 13 years earlier, (A Bronx Tale - 1993), and what a fine movie that was. But in here, he wanted to make an epic, like Sergio Leone's epic about America (Once Upon a Time in America - 1984), Scorsese's epic about the mob (Goodfellas - 1990), or about Las Vegas (Casino - 1995), where he was the lead actor in all of them. Though (The Good Shepherd) turned out to be something like the trilogy of (The Godfather) packed together inharmoniously!Over and above: the casting. Despite all the effort that (Matt Damon) did, he wasn't the suitable man for the job. He looked 25 years old all along, especially in front of (Angelina Jolie) who looked 10 years older than him. He wasn't the man with the stony face, who seemed having all the secrets of the world. You can say that again about the first nominated actor for the role (Leonardo DiCaprio). Because, to tell you the truth, the best man for such a role was (De Niro) himself, but when he was younger.Another defect which's quite fatal: the implicit supposition that the audience knows the background of the events, the characters, or even the intimations. For instances, as a poor man myself from where exactly may I know that in the spying business tying the shoe is a signal to watchers that the meeting went badly?, or that (Joe Pesci) was representing a real wise guy?, or the truth about (Ulysses)? In fact, I knew all of that by reading about the movie, not from the movie itself!After 167 min of extremely jammed script, unexplained events, too many characters, boring presence; mainly from (Damon), you might feel horrible rejection for that movie, despite the good music, cinematography, and intention.

Great story and good acting -- a bit slow though,"The CIA has all the answers to everything except how to be human. In the height of the Cold War, the CIA is formed to save the American way of life from the communists. One man, Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) sacrifices everything for his love of the USA. This movie depicts a depressing story about happiness and how it is never found by this man who Russia calls ""Mother"".Trust no one. This is the premises of the whole movie, and directory Robert De Niro does a good job of showing how this lack of trust makes being happy impossible. It is refreshing to see a movie about a secret government agency that didn't involve high-tech inventions and crazy action sequences.

The film is, also, a fictionalized account of why the 1961 ""Bay of Pigs"" confrontation failed (for the USA) and/or was successful (for Fidel Castro). Although it is, as Mr. Ansen describes, ""spellbinding"", film is more of an ""intellectual-"" than an ""action-"" thriller. And, Mr. De Niro does not ""star"" in the film; he is the director, and essays a relatively minor role. Herein, De Niro proves he should direct more often - both more ""commercial"" films, and a sequel to this one.The story begins in 1961, with the clandestine taping of an act of sexual intercourse, between two unrecognizable individuals. Then, in a ""characterization"" moment, Mr. Damon (as Wilson) sticks a model ship into a bottle. Obviously, these two events are symbolically connected; in fact, the entire film deals with ""intercourse"". Eventually, the grainy couple will be revealed, and rather artfully connected to Damon's ship-building hobby. Watching ""The Good Shepherd"" will require your full attention throughout. Especially, read the small subtitles regarding setting; the film makes some time period jumps, which will otherwise be confusing.Performances are uniformly excellent; the collaboration between the cast and De Niro is essential viewing, for anyone interested in the individuals involved.Damon's portrayal is cold, aloof, and almost entirely humorless. At age six (a 1925 flashback), he is psychologically wounded by the suicide of his father. You should note that Damon's character loses his father when he is six years old; and, later, he enters his own son's life when his son is six years old - making the two ""Wilsons"" connecting puzzle pieces. A failed poet, Damon is lifelike only when interacting with certain relatives and acquaintances; otherwise, he carries his emotional wounds, as a walking zombie, until the film's burning closure.Supporting performances have varying levels of importance. Ms. Jolie (as Margaret ""Clover"" Russell) rises to the top of the list; introduced ""in heat"", she recalls Garbo's erotic seductiveness, then Madonna's ""come hither"" look. With, perhaps, a scene excepted, Jolie's work is wonderful. Certainly, her character shows Damon's limited interest in sex. Probably, we see his entire output on screen. Although captured by Jolie, Damon loves a beautiful deaf woman he meets in the library, Tammy Blanchard (as Laura). Mr. Roth's script ""consummates"" this relationship exquisitely; first, with partially deaf female spy Martina Gedeck (as Hanna Schiller).Damon has other relationships to watch closely - with professor Michael Gambon (as Dr. Fredericks), who can see Damon's suppressed poet; and son Eddie Redmayne (as Edward Wilson Jr.), who cannot see his father at all.Damon's CIA ""godfathers"" include Mr. Hurt (as Philip Allen), Mr. Baldwin (as Sam Murach), and De Niro (as William Sullivan). The more traditional ""godfather"" Joe Pesci (as Joseph Palmi) has a small role, which reveals something not only about America's ""exclusive"" secret clubs, but also about Damon's character.Yet, no illustration of character beats Mr. Turturro (as Ray Brocco) identifying Damon with the line, ""They said you were a serious SOB that didn't have any sense of humor, there can't be two of you.""Some of the turncoats are too obvious, though their performances are faultless. Last, but certainly NOT least, Robert Richardson's cinematography and the Bruce Fowler/Marcelo Zarvos soundtrack (a symphony of sadness) reach unsurpassable artistic heights.All perform masterfully.********* The Good Shepherd (12/11/06) Robert De Niro ~ Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie, Michael Gambon, Eddie Redmayne",9.0,Anonymous,History
horrible,"this movie was terrible it was talking an hour or two then two people die oh and in the beginning he bangs Angelina but other than that it was a complete snore-fest! don't waste your time or the money on this one. i found the plot was not easy to follow my husband and i had no interest we actually left the theater about 2 hours into it. we had a better time at home, i definitely like Robert dinero but i wont be watching films he directs anymore.further more i think this movie should have a warning label affixed to it to let the viewers know there is absolutely no action contrary to the preview's and trailers. i was very let down because i thought this would be a great movie judging by the teasers and preview's however i was wrong.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Do not see this movie,"This movie went nowhere! It jumped back and forth between a 20 year period without much warning. It's 3 hours long with a very predictable ending. Do NOT waste your money on this movie! Matt Damon plays a good part but the movie as a whole was very disappointing. The female acting was bad all around. The was also too much male nudity, and lack of masculine characters. Damon's son is a cry baby with no spine. There was very little focus on the founding of the CIA or the effect it had on American foreign policy. It's more of a personal story about the character that Damon plays instead of a ""Spook"" movie. The movie could have been done very well if it was only 2 hours instead of three. There were a lot of scenes that went on and on for no reason. Please save your money, you can thank me later.",1.0,Anonymous,History

Worst film since Syriana,"WHAT!?!?!?!This film was awful.A waste of almost three hours of my life. Everybody walked out of the cinema looking like zombies. I almost died of boredom.The best bit was when the guy in front of me's mobile phone went off, and some people shouted at him to shut up. Not that being able to hear the film properly would have let them understand the plot any better.This was the worst film i have seen since syriana, which was boring and almost as long.The worst thing is that this will probably win an Oscar. Because it is a deep, meaningful film. And nobody really understands what went on, but they all feel clever if they pretend that they do.I would have enjoyed having my eyes pulled out more than this film.I think that the CIA should consider forcing people to watch this film as a new method of torture.Please do not waste your money or your time on this terrible movie.",1.0,Anonymous,History
In three respects instructing.,"I take the view that 'The Good Shepherd' is in three respects an instructing movie. From a historical point of view it has great value as we see the critical events in the nineteenth century which could give rise to CIA of the United States of America institution. The question whether CIA played an important part as safeguard against war is made clear. From a social point of view 'The Good Shepherd' points out very clearly the impacts of CIA institution on daily life of agents, their families and citizens. The questions about the many choices a CIA agent has to make between his personal life and his work as an agent and the dangers of intangibility and personal power are made clear. Does the end of CIA institution justifies all means even if you as an agent and your family suffer from it? From a political and legal point of view it makes an interesting contribution to a discussion about the causes and effects of CIA institution in the United States of America in the context of world peace, international order and democracy.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Stayed on the dark side,"On the conscious level, there was no real reason for releasing this movie. This was no spy thriller. A long movie with no character showing any positive qualities tests the patience of the most devoted movie fan. The characters were not even enjoyably evil, like in Sin City. They were just boring. The characters were created by someone writing from their shadow (Jungian), which is why they came out so unattractive.This movie was more likely written at the unconscious level, and written there for a purpose. The CIA was portrayed as the source of evil and incompetence. They were selected to be the fall guy for America's foreign policy failures, particularly the Bay of Pigs. This strategy takes the politicians off the hook for bungling decisions about national security. I would imagine that leaders of both parties would support using the CIA as the fall guy for bad decisions. It is left to the observer to determine who will benefit most from a public who actually is influenced by this movie.",2.0,Anonymous,History
This is a must see movie for those interested in the OSS's evolution into what is now the CIA.,"Having read a lot of historical material on the evolution of the OSS into today's CIA, the movie was great in making history come alive in the persona's of the movie characters. The attention to detail, especially in the dress, decorum and personality of the main characters helped those of us just a tad to young to remember them when they were in the news. Matt Damon's performance was so intense you believe he spent hours reviewing old footage to perfect the mannerism of his character. At three hours in length, you don't feel the movie ever really drags because each different sequence builds upon the others to give you a comprehensive understanding of the era. If you don't understand the intense concerns and apprehension of the people living in working in this era then you can't grasp the seriousness that the main characters project in every detail of their lives. This is a movie for history buffs and a movie for OSS/CIA story buffs. This is helpful to understand the focus and resolve the character's are hyper-motivated by. These were frightening times for American's and especially for those who were in positions of influence. Information is the commodity and all the key player nations are in the market. For me this movie transported me to that time and reflected the drive and information and the need for an agency to take it all in and process it into that which is relevant and that which could be. It was the time period for the ""space age leap"" for those into spy trade-craft and the movie fully develops the events that brought it about. It does it in an intriguing manner that has you following every move without distraction.The one area the movie falls somewhat short in is that of accoustics. In some of the crucial lines spoken by the characters, many audience members had trouble hearing some of the dialog that you must here to understand crucial aspects of the plots. Get a good seat where you are near a speaker and listen carefully to the quieter lines. If you have to leave your seat, try to have someone ready to bring you up to speed on what you've missed so you can stay abreast of rapidly developing situations. Pay close attention once the main players start to inter-act so you remember who each person is and what their function's supposed to be.If this is an era or subject your interested in and you listen carefully and keep up with the players as they are developed, you won't be disappointed. It's a fast faced movie with intricate sequences. The actors/actresses play their roles so well you start to believe your flashing back to that critical time in history and get to watch a fledge-ling government agency evolve at a pace set by the nervousness and paranoia of the period. When you leave you understand some of the earlier admonishments given by the older characters to their young successors. It is a riveting movie that doesn't disappoint the viewer if they stay on tract as it develops. When it's over you'll not only understand why the CIA is what is is today but you will understand an entire generation and the aspects of what shaped that generation; good and bad. It is an awesome production that is perfectly cast to provide the viewer a great movie. If you have interest in any or this criteria, this is a must see movie!",8.0,Anonymous,History
My God!,"The film The Good Shepherd is about a man's life of corruption and is also about the start of the CIA. Edward Bell Wilson (Matt Damon) is a smart and handsome man who's got it all, and when he is asked to join the club in his University called The Skulls, he meets people with big connections, one of them being General Bill Sullivan (Robert De Niro) who wants Edward to be a spy in the war that is taking place at that moment in time. Edward also encounters Clover/Margaret Ann Russell (Angelina Jolie) who he gets pregnant on a one night stand and for his future plans and career in life he decides to marry her without any Love for her and the baby. Edward's brother gets involved and also later on in the film his Son does too in his Father example. The film shows what life is like being a spy and what effect it has on you and the people you love.I did not personally enjoy this film one single bit, even though it had a great cast and a absolutely great Director/actor Robert De Niro. I felt as if nothing was put into this film, including Matt Damons talent as a actor, in the film he show no talent and in my opinion any one could play that role. Basically the film was pointless and boring it ends as it begins, no difference apart from the start of the CIA.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Snore Fest.,This movie squeezed 5 min of suspense into 3 hours of movie. Very boring dialog the characters were not explained very much. Jumps around a lot to different time periods. Acting mediocre at best. No chance for academy awards. No explanation connecting Joe Pecci's role with the plot. No explanation regarding the deaf girlfriend. The movie leaves too many lose ends to ponder. I think they are counting on the big guns actors to pull traffic into this movie. All of the exciting parts were shown in the trailer for this movie. We kept waiting for the pace to pick up and it never did. The Matt Damon character is boring his whole life is his job. He really never says much.,3.0,Anonymous,History
Great Cold War Spy Story,"An introspective narrative of the day to day life of a high ranking member of the CIA.This is not James Bond; and if you expect that, like most of the rest of the reviewers here evidently did, you're going to be disappointed.Real intelligence gathering isn't Aston Martin driving and Babe chasing. It's about thousands of people who sit days and nights listening to foreign language tapes for key words, hoping the sequences and meanings of those words can be interpreted in such a way as to confirm them as being our adversary's responses to our own sequence of signs; given to trigger those responses and thereby divulge things that were unknown about them or their own intelligence gathering, or who they are and how and what they're doing.The only times anything exciting happens are when someone from one side or the other flips, and many times that's the only clue you have that your whole operation has been compromised and you, your family, loved ones or your nation are in mortal danger.If you want to know about the temptation, personal detachment and the degree of secrecy required to do this duty, you'll probably love this movie.If you're still drawn to the clock-like James Bond Action Hero format (*yawn* ""They're in the control room. Must be going to end in fifteen minutes...""), then you'll probably be very bored with this. Some people are drawn to on screen gasoline explosions like moths to flames.I'll admit: I purposely avoid movies like that. They give me nothing I can use once I leave the theater. I need stories, ideas and characters I can think about. I need irony. I need things that aren't that easy to figure out, like things in my own life or the lives of people I know.I can understand why some people don't like this movie. The plot is very complicated and we like our movies simple and straightforward.Conversely, our president is George Bush and most Americans probably believe he's an honest man. Most Americans today probably don't question the story of Al Qaida and the WTC or whether Iraq threatened Saudi Arabia before the first Gulf War or whether the Soviets were a true threat to the US during the Cold War.However, this story unwinds in such a way as to make you think like the characters in it. You realize how little you know and by realizing that, you learn. You may not get all of it as it goes along, but you will understand it's message when it's done.It shows but doesn't tell.

The human costs of spookdom,"Candidly, I was looking for a damning expose of the most 'successful' secret society of the 20th century, the CIA (the Cartel's Insulation Agency). And we do get some of that. Robert DeNiro, playing the General ""Wild Bill"" Donovan originator of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) which became the CIA, says:""I deeply worry about the agency becoming not the eyes and ears of the country but its heart and soul.""The story centers on the Matt Damon character, Edward Wilson, who becomes the prototypical CIA agent, then the HMFWIC (head modular footlocker what's in charge) of Agency operations. We open with footage of the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, compromised by an intelligence leak.Wilson's career being in jeopardy, he endeavors to find the source of the leak.As the main story moves along in the present (the early 1960s), the movie flashes back to key points in his life. In the early 1920s, his father (Timothy Hutton) implores the boy Edward to always tell the truth. When Edward leaves the room, his father proceeds to shoot himself, leaving a note; Edward quickly reenters the room before the adults arrive and secrets the note away.This fatherly admonishment to tell the truth gives deep irony to the profession Edward later chooses... as does the note, which Edward does not open until nearly the movie's end.The essence of the flashbacks is to flesh out the character of this unremarkable remarkable man who comes to represent the quintessential agency guy. In the years leading up to WWII Edward attends Yale and joins the Skull and Bones (S&B) secret society. (Both presidential candidates in 2004 were members of S&B.)Through a friend at the S&BÂ—the impression is virtually anyone powerful in the political establishment is a memberÂ— Edward gets the attention of General Sullivan (the Wild Bill Donovan character). The General picks Edward to be his main OSS guy in London, then follows that up with a postwar elevation in the CIA.Edward falls in love with a woman named Laura who is hearing impaired, but because of an indiscretion with the aggressive sister, Clover (Angelina Jolie), of his S&B friend he leaves Laura. Back then, especially if you have political ambitions, you marry what you impregnate; Clover turns out to be a long-suffering thorn in Edward's side.The boy the Wilsons raise turns out to worship yet fear his father. As he grows to adulthood he insists he, too, wants to be an agency man. Yikes. Edward loves his son. Indeed, a primary focus of the movie seems to be the workings of Edward's shutoff personality as it experiences the heights of love and depths of despair over key people in his life....For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2007",8.0,Anonymous,History
Deconstructed storyline which hasn't been dramatized properly.,"I found this movie incredible boring. Matt Damon did his best to underplay his part and he succeeded to an extent that I felt left out. Who was he really? What was his motivations? Did he care for his girlfriend, why did he take a poetry class etc? Several movies have a fairly simple plot and storyline. And sometimes you get the feeling that the director tries to deconstruct the storyline in order to add some sophistication to the movie and to challenge your intellect; they sort of deconstruct it. In this movie you constantly jump between 1941 and 1961 in a very annoying way. Its confusing and instead of keeping the suspense up you give up on the film.One of the most boring scenes that appears again and again is a scene wherein CIA agents are trying to determinate what is going on in a movie-clip with a guy and a girl lying in a bed that Matt Damon has received. It just goes on and on with a description of details from this clip without any point to this at all.This is not a story about CIA but instead a story of a young guy with autistic tendencies who is a total stranger in his own life. Sort of makes me think of ""the stranger"" by Albert Camus./Sigmund",2.0,Anonymous,History
"A nice pace that is slow, dry and complex that fits the story of espionage & counter intelligence","Very different than ""The FBI Story"" with James Stewart, but of course this is not a PR movie about or for the CIA. Counter intelligence is a dirty and dark business testing and affecting those engaged in it. The story captures this ""darkness"" and the ""political"" intrigue with it's dry pace and flashbacks and with some interesting sub plots that give it suspense and drama. There are no crazy inappropriate action scenes to spoil the thematic point. Although this movie gives a glimpse on the beginning of the CIA and what it will become the story is really about one man's journey into the CIA from it's start and portrayed with critical pieces shown of his life as the ""Good Shepherd"" and how he becomes woven into it. We follow with him and begin to see and understand how it fits for him but with a price but also like him we too never really get close to the other characters in his life because he cannot either and this feeling of emptiness becomes our struggle and disappointment just as it his. The story brings us closer to appreciate family at the end but is it too late for us along with him to appreciate it. Some things in life require sacrifice or is this price too high for some but not others? Duty, loyalty and responsibility are things that potentially restrains affection and love ...or is there hope that it is never too late?",8.0,Anonymous,History
Confusing Timeline,"Although an interesting history, the back and forth time-line was very confusing. This was in part because the two main characters didn't age over 20 years. The acting was good but the time-lines were so back and forth that it was difficult to keep up. I often knew the time period based on the age of the son.Disappointing for that reason.It was odd to see Angelina Jolie in a supporting role.

"The Good Shepherd Â– Quite Good. Quite Slow, Though","Why, oh why are the new films so long? The typical film nowadays is not less than 2 hours or so. Often, in such films, like Syriana or the like, the mere duration spoils the whole picture. You wait patiently when the film finally ends up, or, if you are at home, check with your DVD remote how many minutes are left. The same goes on with The Good Shepherd. A very good director's work of great Robert De Niro is marred much by the 2-hours drag. Mind it, the film is very good, this is a very serious work with so many good stars involved Â– Matt Damon as a main hero, Angelina Jolie as his unhappy wife, Robert De Niro, Alec Baldwin, among others. Another great plus here is the plot Â– the formation of the CIA, and its genesis, its activities, its struggle against the Nazi, the Communists and the like. I am Russian, I remember clearly the Cold War years, the very fervor of Russian and US agents fighting against each other. I must admit, the Russians are shown very well, quite correctly and pretty accurate here. The family drama of the main hero is shown superbly. His constant absence from home leads to adultery, to broken home, to tears and the tragic life of his wife and his beloved son. I never liked Jolie much, as well as Damon, but here they are very convincing and their tragedy is depicted very well. When it comes to the family tragedy of their son, it all becomes really horrible. The terrible choice Â– whether to pursue a successful career or to spare the family Â– plagues the hero of Damon and he chooses badly. His family is nearly non-existent and he suffers greatly. Among the certain minuses of this film I should again emphasize its length, its certain lack of tempo and then, there is too little of Mr. De Niro! He is appearing twice only and that is a sad fact. Alec Baldwin is another secondary character here and that is also sad, we wish he were here more. However, the film is very good at showing the American society of 1930-1960's. Kennedy, Castro, The Bay of Pigs, Soviet spies, Cold War, Nazi, Berlin Â– all is here and all is shown through the eyes of US citizens. Another great achievement is the grim portrait of that stupid, terribly self-righteous secret society of ""Skulls"". That is true; America is so equal in many senses, that some people badly need some ""secret circles"" to become more ""sophisticated"" or ""chosen"". Here, De Niro is absolutely great showing such a shallow mob of puffed peacocks who are trying to be somebody very special. And again, the main idea is consistent Â– when the duty is too big, families die. Great work, suffering of those mistakes described above. But then, there is not a perfect film, yet.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Ultimately unfulfilling,"There were some parts of this movie that I really enjoyed. The sense of betrayal, the uncertainty of social relationships, and the often unfulfilling nature of life when circumstance makes things difficult for us were three really interesting elements. However this film was just far too flawed to really enjoy.So many of the scenes were redundant and didn't really serve to establish anything that wasn't already quite clear throughout the entire film. Matt Damon's performance wasn't really believable. I can't recall him actually making a facial expression the entire time. I thought Angelina Jolie did a fine job with the character, especially as the film progressed.It might actually be a quite enjoyable movie if a good deal of the substance-less scenes were removed, the casting was a bit more considered, and the performances the actors gave toward the end were as solid throughout. The narrative involving Tammy Blanchard was very intense, and quite interesting. It was perhaps the most genuine feeling part of the entire film.Perhaps it was just that the broader narrative of the story involving the actual CIA dealings was so incredibly vague. It focused very intensely on the intricate relationships constantly in flux, constantly facing uncertainty and betrayal, but they didn't actually seem to be talking about anything at all, in any of the scenes.I've never walked out on a movie, or fallen asleep during one, but I must admit this is the closest I've ever come.Overall it's a good effort, worth renting, but too long and unfocused to really garner too much interest.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Slow and Odd,"Matt Damon goes around with no expression wearing his dad's hat and overcoat, occasionally banging a woman. DeSneero directed the movie so that the character he plays in it is the BiggaBossa, Brando in Godfather.

Did everyone simply owe a favor to De Niro? It is drawn out to say the least/predictable/boring as hell. The 168 Min's. running time was completely unnecessary, in fact it was unbearable towards the end.The only the thing that kept me from walking out was the unyielding thirst for something to tie together in a magnificent way, thus vindicating the miserable hours already spent. There were SO many scenes that could have been more effective by truncating them. Ie. The picture that they dwell on for what seems like forever. I don't want to spoil anything, but just the way they edit these particular scenes into spots where they completely don't belong, you know the picture's significance immediately (I'm talking of course about an actual picture, not the film).Speaking of that, the sequence of the scenes appeared to have been hastily agreed upon. They must've had way too much footage in the end and didn't know what to cut. It makes for a very confusing first half of the film.All this having been said, the film's plus side would be the phenomenal acting.

A very specific and subjective film...,"Okay, this is just one of those films that is not for everyone; and in this case it is not because of strong or unusual content but simply because not everyone is gonna find this film entertaining...If you are a person who feels that a film should 'entertain' (which can mean MANY different things from intellectual stimulation to damn good looking strippers : ) then you might be one of the HALF of the viewers who found it boring, dull, unemotional, etc. However, if you happen to be one of the OTHER half of the people who have seen this who really enjoyed it, you'd have to appreciate it simply for the way the story itself was crafted and told, and even acted. Even then, of those who DO rate the movie highly, there are MANY who complain of it being too long, or too confusing, or particularly that Matt Damon's acting was too 'Wooden' or 'Unemotional' or that he 'Does not have the emotional depth' to portray this character.BUT, and it's a BIG BUT like Mariah Carrey's, remember that this was a PET PROJECT of De Niros for several years and it was his vision; so, likely the 'way' that Damon portrayed the character was specifically DIRECTED. If you think Damon cannot act at all just go back and see 'GOOD WILL HUNTING'. Don't get me wrong, I most certainly do NOT think that he is one of the better or greater actors around, but I do feel in my lowly and wretched opinion that De Niro crafted the film EXACTLY the way he wanted it presented. But, that doesn't mean that everyone is gonna like it or find it personally 'entertaining'.To me, the time went VERY quickly by and I personally felt completely 'gripped' by the story. I didn't feel that it was too long; actually, I don't have any complaints about it at all, really. Remember too, that a number of the Cold War Spy Films in the 1960's, the ones done very seriously, were almost downright morose in mood. Very serious and realistic, along the same lines as this film but not nearly as complex or polished. 'THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD' for example, was likely considered NOT 'entertaining' to many. Also too, many of the British Spy Films were sort of like this one too in the sense of being heavily weighed down by characters and details as opposed to straight out 'ACTION' which would be considered more 'entertaining' by people in general.So, all in all, an extremely well crafted film and well acted by all (YES, even the 'wooden' Damon, who remember is becoming emotionally zombified pretty much because of all the stuff he has to do) Oh yes, someone wrote here too that they felt that the editing was poorly done; I have to take GREAT exception to that. If you feel that the film should have been shorter, then fine. But the actual editing was done extremely well. Just check out the scene where they are 'interrogating' the Russian guy, not to mention many other key scenes where the editing is done so well that the tension is racked up almost to an unbearable degree.An excellent film, just not for everyone...",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Very good, ignore the bloke who would rather of spent $10 on gas","This is a spy movie in the old school way. Yes it is slow but that's the whole point. It's the behind the scenes of the CIA so the whole point is that it's not meant to be action packed and gun tooting. The performances all round are brilliant. Matt Damon once again proves that himself and Ed Norton are the best actors working in America at the moment. It is interesting to think that Damon is currently giving Bond a run for his money in the new Bourne film, as one of the best and most believable 'action' spies on film. And then a year earlier he was playing an equally believable spy of a different kind in The Good Shepherd. I thought this was a great, un-rushed and intelligent film from De Niro, which also offered us a little history, which may of scared American audiences. If you have a brain you will enjoy it.

"Terrible, Boring Movie","Whenever Angelina Jolie did not wear the bright red lipstick, you knew that was a signal that this was a ""dramatic moment."" I think Damon had about 100 words of dialogue in the whole movie -- lots of ""looks"" instead of dialogue. His son was probably the most unbelievable and poorest casting I have seen. I think they put in false front teeth to make his mouth look more like Matt Damon's -- sooooooo distracting. The costume designer got stuck in the 1940's style of dress and even after Kennedy was elected (and all the Bay of Pigs scenes) the men continued to wear hats. When Kennedy was sworn in he did not wear a hat and you could almost hear all the men in the world tossing their hats into the garbage at the same time.",1.0,Anonymous,History
WASP heaven,"I love this movie. WASP influence may have lessened over the past 3 decades but it doesn't change how it shaped the United States of America and enabled its success. Good, bad and ugly.

Matt Damon the best part of this Film,"With all the great actors and actresses in this film one would think that this film would fly off as a great piece of art in filming. But the script was confusing, the characters were not clearly defined as to their role in this story. I was confused as to who was on what side, who was a spy and who was the good guys. I found the whole film very confusing. So I sat in the theater just watching the Wonderful Matt Damon for two hours. Who I might add did a bang up job of acting. Angelina Jolie's part could have been played by any actress, not a remarkable performance. Kept wondering when the next Lara Croft movie was coming out, so I could appreciate her talents as an actress.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"Oh my, this movie is definitely going to win an Oscar because it's so damn boring","Sorry folks, not all movies that win Oscars are boring, but no one can argue that those more so-called ""intelligent"" and ""complicated"" movies, especially movies that portrays a story of a particular person (and mostly dull-characters), has a lot higher chance to win an Oscar or get nominated, than movies such as ""Dude, Where's My Car"" or ""Not Another Teen Movie"". Those movie critics are the most boring group of people with hardly no sense of humor. Just like what Richard Curtis said: I would rather make a movie that the critics hate but the audience love. And every movie maker should have this in mind.Well, after a long suffering 2.5 hours of life wasted watching the awfully dull and extremely anti-climax movie, I think it has a huge chance of being nominated for an Oscar (both film and for its leading character - Matt Damon), but it will never win most people's heart as we pay money to watch movies to get enjoyment, not to suffer and watching a horrible life-story of a no-body for 2.5 hours!

What a masterpiece,"This isn't your run of the mill spy thriller. If you've read 'The Company' by Robert Littell, that should serve as a prerequisite for this movie. This does not move at a fast pace and it's not meant to.Matt Damon is quite incredible, as he is in most movies he picks up. The supporting cast is incredible and everyone works almost perfectly.So who should watch this? A Le Carre fan with the penchant for a good old spy thriller and happy to sit through a movie that isn't in your face with everything.Based on a CIA legend, this is quite the great movie made all the more worthwhile by the terrific acting.

Comments on movie,"It was very hard to drag myself through this movie. Deniro does not know how to direct actors to get the audience to perceive a lot of subtleties. The depth of people was passed over completely for a shallow narrative. Without knowing much about that era, a lot of info could have been included to inform the audience. Scenes jumped around in an erratic manner, not cohesive.The depth and purpose of the CIA was not made clear. I felt like I wasted my time watching and waiting for something, anything to become purposeful.I do not recommend this movie. Why do some people think they can act and direct. It doesn't seem to work that way too often. Missed the boat totally.",2.0,Anonymous,History
1961 plus flashbacks,"I am 6 in 1961. Deniro is about 17. He remembers better than I.For me this is a story about naÃ¯vetÃ© and the desire to preserve it. Which can not be achieved successfully apart from an ivory tower lifestyle or serious mental impairment. It also lightly discusses systematic corruption, and undue influence.The French dub this type of story a 'Roman a Clef'. Definition online.We can say that as a mystery it follows true to type. All the pieces are there to be assembled at the end. There are no surprise rabbits pulled out of the hat.So this is pretty much history dramatized with rather understated plausibility.The cars, the clothes, the attitudes of the characters, are really well realized with certain allowances made for the early 20th century flashback scenes.In this time almost everyone was a 'straight man'. The characters portrayed are more tightly wound even than that. Though I think Deniro and Damon go a bit too far in that regard.The Whole Cast is simply stunning. I bet they did this for the love of it.Even the smaller parts are played by notable heavyweights, so well that you can't really see just how good they are.To fill out your understanding of what will follow this story in the real 1963; Everyone knew that Joseph Kennedy was rather bent and not unsympathetic to the Nazis (but so was Ford). Though I am sure he deplored their methods.But this story is rooted in the NINA discrimination resulting from the Irish Famine because though hardly mentioned JFK and the consequences of WW2 & WW1, the Great Depression and Prohibition weigh in heavily here.So the scene with Pesci's mob character is essential if underplayed. Why?Recall that J. Edgar Hoover has been running the FBI since the Depression -- and all that goes with Hoover...
JFK is supported by the mob in getting elected. Part of the deal is that, even though the mob will lose Cuba ( something they built up during Prohibition) they won't get hammered in the USA, except that John and Robert start moving against them, but that is after our last scene here.It parallels the commentary about living with the English and they with the USA -- an illustration of 'politics making strange bedfellows'.My mom used to say if you lay down with dogs you get up with fleas.This whole story is about getting rid of fleas. And how expensive it can be to get clear of a debt you have incurred or how upset folks get when you ignore a debt -- see Russia.As well as what your choices do the those around you.No matter how desirable you might think that the early postwar era was . . . Or the 1960s . . . You do not want to return to that.This WILL BE a cult classic long after we are all gone.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"too long, not too interesting","The movie was under-researched, the political point was clear Â– CIA is not black and white, it's gray. But there were so many points that did not add up, and from the historical not correct. In the 60's no one finds a problem with the son of the main character marrying an African girl. The biggest concern is that she is a Russian spyÂ… just sounds hard to believe. CIA believes a man who failed the polygraph test without doing a background checkÂ… The gay theme that is persistent in the movie Â– men in female outfits (onstage), men being too close to each other, the professor, men fighting in the mud naked (not sure if that is a historical fact or imagination of the director). There are only hints of homosexuality, nothing in the mainstream of the movie, was it an attempt to grab attention? Just saw no point in it besides the popularity reasons. Overall, the movie was lacking coherence, excitement and was off on historical facts. Although, it's always a pleasure to look at Matt Damon :)",1.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent film with images from other great films,"I greatly enjoyed the film. The influence of Coppola is noteworthy. The CIA technicians efforts to get information from the video and audio was reminiscent of Coppola's The Conversation.The larger comparison is with Coppola's Godfather trilogy. In a sense this movie inverts the Godfather. Don Corleone emphasized family over country, Wilson abandons everything for his country. The scene with Pesci in Miami was a recreation of Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth in Miami in the Godfather II. So many of the details were borrowed in that scene.DeNiro as director brought aspects from a prior effort ""a Bronx Tale"" the focus on a destructive father/son relationship and a young mans interest in an inter-racial relationship.This film is best enjoyed by an audience that has lived through the cold war, and remembers the feelings of the Bay of Pigs incident and the Berlin Wall. the use of film clips of Kennedy and Eisenhower brought realism to the film.Many familiar with history will recognize real people and real events being fictionalized. I would have preferred that the real and familiar names were retained for the major characters. If we can see Kennedy and Eisenhower why not use the name Allen Dulles or Bill Donaldson.Nevertheless I enjoyed this powerful drama. I like films that pay homage to other great films.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Too long and tedious,"I went to see the movie with my girlfriend and five of her Stanford colleagues. I and one of the other guys were the only people from our group, who didn't fell asleep. The movie is very long, almost 3 hours and the story moves very slowly.Angelina's role is very friendly and honest women, I don't have to mention beautiful, who has to suffer all the time. Matt Damon's character supposedly is very talented, everyone likes him and adores him, but he doesn't show any extraordinary skills. His relationships are very illogical. He is loved by the most beautiful woman in the movie (guess who?), but he doesn't fill the same way and prefer to have affairs with deaf women (yes deaf).I love movies with Robert De Niro, but as a director he did a bad job. I would have skipped that movie if I knew it was going to be so tedious.",4.0,Anonymous,History
"Superb, intense account of the inception and early years of the C.I.A.","Superb pseudo-docudrama using fictitious characters and narrative to represent a more-or-less accurate account of the origins and early operations of the Central Intelligence Agency (C.I.A.). Matt Damon assumes a role against type here, as the carefully meticulous, self-controlled, colorless protagonist Edward Wilson, who is a pivotal higher up in the CIA in the 1950s and 60s. His devotion to family and to his job inevitably leads him into crises of priorities and conscience for which there are no satisfactory solutions.The other subtext of importance is the pervasive sense of distrust that overtakes Wilson and everyone else in the agency. Who's spying on whom? Who in the agency is a double agent? Is the Russian spy who flips actually the fellow he claims to be? Damon offers a brilliant turn, one in which he sheds the whip smart cockiness we saw in his characters in ""The Departed,"" ""Good Will Hunting,"" and ""Rounders,"" among other roles, in favor of a plodding, depressive, burdened yet resolute character, just the traits one might expect in a principled man who carries the shame and responsibility associated with his father's suicide years earlier.The rest of the superb cast are also fascinating to watch, including fine turns by Alec Baldwin, William Hurt, Michael Gambon, John Turturro, Billy Crudup, John Sessions and DeNiro himself. Mr. DeNiro can take credit for evoking these uniformly excellent performances. Angelina Jolie, as Edwards' wife Margaret, is left behind in this fast company, adding only ornamentation to the proceedings. My grades: 8.5/10 (A-) (Seen on 12/29/06)",9.0,Anonymous,History
Tragically wasted opportunity,"This could have been the best film of the year. The acting, cinematography and production design are all first rate. The film was simply way too long. I think you could have told the same story in 2 hours and 15 minutes without cutting a line of dialogue. That is how meandering the editing is in this story. It is truly a shame because the story is compelling, but by the end you are begging for the end to come like a Russian spy's bullet to the back of your head.Damon gives a stellar performance, but it seems like the film is DeNiro's personal crusade against the WASP establishment as he seems intent on portraying all of them as either latent homosexuals or just incredibly fey males who seem to want to dress in drag at any social occasion. While Ivy league schools do have this tradition, it seemed like his own personal fetish to continually hammer the point in the characters played by Gambon & Crudup.I think very few films warrant being over 2 hours (""Schindler's List"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" come to mind). Sadly lots of films this year have this affliction (""Babel"", ""Bobby""). Maybe it's a disease infecting cutting rooms all over Hollywood?I must it give it 5 for all the technical aspects of film-making, but the story is more like a 3. Could have been an 8 or 9 with a serious re-cut.",5.0,Anonymous,History
A bit slow and confusing to follow,"I really wanted to like it since it's had great reviews, but moving back and forth through time to help explain the current story line was confusing as were some of the characters. It was undoubtedly part of the plot concerning the main character's not knowing who he can trust. I just found it plodding and didn't have the pace or riviting storyline to keep my interest. It was hard to feel sympathetic for the main character, he had zero personality and virtually no friends. It was difficult to grasp his intense desire to protect the US at all costs. Maybe there were some clues from his father, but even that was not enough for an 'ah ha' moment to explain his actions.",5.0,Anonymous,History

A Complete Snoozer of a Movie,"Who knew the story of the early days of the CIA was such a boring one? Or at least, it is in the hands of Robert DeNiro, who directed this film that I sincerely wanted to like and instead was utterly bored to death by.And please understand me -- I don't use the word ""boring"" lightly. I don't like it when other people use it, and I think it's usually too easy and lazy to do so. But in some cases, it just simply fits, and this is one of them.""The Good Shepherd"" is boring because the pacing is as monotone as the color scheme (which is all browns and grays by the way). It's boring because the script is a muddled mess and leaves one unable to make sense of anything going on. It's boring because it's peopled with characters who aren't in the least compelling. By the time the movie was reaching its conclusion (a long, LONG nearly 3 hours after I took my seat), it was coming at me as a series of disconnected scenes with no relation to one another, and I couldn't have cared less how it ended.Matt Damon plays Edward Wilson, an early CIA operative who dedicates his life to the service and sees his personal life go to hell for his efforts. There's nothing necessarily wrong with Damon's performance -- I believe he plays the character exactly as called for by the script and director. But he's fighting a losing battle, for what makes Wilson such a perfect CIA agent -- his elusiveness, his opacity, his withdrawnness -- are the same characteristics that make him such a blank slate of a main character. With this vacuum at the movie's center, there's simply no chance for it to ever come alive.""The Good Shepherd"" is an admirable effort, I guess. You can tell that DeNiro has a passion for the story he's telling. But it's been a long time since I've been so disengaged during a film. The movie is all whispers, shadowy silhouettes lurking in doorways, portentous looks; one character gets killed, another is thrown out of a plane; there's domestic drama, sex and drunk scenes -- and nothing ever heats up to more than a low simmer.Billy Crudup and Michael Gambon deliver the film's best performances; unfortunately, they also have two of the smallest roles. Angelina Jolie, looking incredibly too perfect as Wilson's long-suffering wife, is utterly wasted in a clichÃ©d role, in which she pops up every fifteen minutes or so to yell shrilly at her husband. Other actors include William Hurt, Alec Baldwin and DeNiro himself, none of whom registers in the least.Pass this one by.Grade: D+",4.0,Anonymous,History
"Great Movie, But Is Too Long","The Good Shepherd is a great movie; the story is engaging, it was well cast, and the characters are well developed. But, unfortunately the length of the film makes it difficult to keep you interested. It should have been cut down to under 2 and half hours; as it stands, the movie is closing in on 3 hours. I believe that is a common problem among a lot of major films in recent years; audiences typically do not like much over 2 hours.With this said, I actually enjoyed this film. The pace was slow, yet deliberate and consistent, and this helped to develop the characters and the story. I'd enjoy seeing De Niro direct more films.Damon was excellent in his role and I think Jolie did a great job as well. I would have enjoyed seeing more screen time for Alec Baldwin and De Niro.The story projects a nice historical timeline of how the CIA was developed. It is interesting to see how the CIA worked up to the 1960s. There are also some great personal stories involving Damon and Jolie's characters that are woven into the scope of the history of the CIA. These personal stories add great depth to this film, so that the story is multi-dimensional. I don't want to give away too much of the plot since it is a thriller with a rather intense ending.If you like the spy genre, films of historical significance, and good thrillers, then this movie is for you. If you like to see how the personal lives of historical figures influence their decision making; even within the scope of their important jobs, then you will also like this movie. If you prefer action and a story with a fairly quick pace, then you should avoid this movie entirely. Rating 8 of 10 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Good Shepherd - A Muddled Story,"Having studied the JFK assassination and knowing something about CIA history, I understood some of the key scenes and characters portraying historic events. But the average viewer without such knowledge will be utterly lost. On the whole, I found this tale painfully slow, with too much emphasis on romantic subplots which either went nowhere or did little to push the story forward. The theme of courageous self-sacrifice does not measure up to the movie's billing. There are few surprises. The chief character does as expected. For the most part, he is a ruthless spy master, humorless and detached.This is a movie which using the same dramatic setting could have gone off in a totally different direction, rather than that of rah-rah patriotism. It is a classic case of producer and director utterly missing their cues.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent Movie.,"The movie was good. I enjoyed it. I have just a few complaints. The first being that I felt that the movie was advertised incorrectly. It's less about the ""birth of the CIA"" rather a story about one of the first CIA agents. It's about his being in the CIA and how it affected his life and such. Not about birthing the CIA. Also, the movie was a bit too slow moving, lengthy, and only because there were scenes in it that weren't completely necessary and seemed to act as filler to just make the film longer. Other than these few problems, I considered the movie to be really good.Robert DeNiro has a talent not only for acting, but seems to be on the road to becoming a good director also.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent fiction about the formation of the CIA,"I thought this was a very good movie. I read a few ""comments' here before seeing it and have to disagree with those that panned the movie, its direction, or its actors. Matt Damon plays an excellent role of a man that devolves from intelligent up & comer to a member of the paranoid ""black ops"" spy world.Damon's character Ed Wilson is a man that is clearly not a reacher for the fruit. He loves one woman but is trapped into a marriage without love, he has a secret in his past that you can tell is always silently on his heels, and he never knows who to trust because invariably he trusts the wrong folks. These lessons occur all through the story setup of the character and return to haunt him, as evidenced by his actions later.The storyline was easy to follow and maintained my family's interest throughout. If any detractors it would be the length; avoid the large soda at the theater because you won't want to miss the ending or the setup to the ending.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The Worst Serious Spy Movie Ever Made,"We were anticipating an A quality movie about the founding of the OSS and later the CIA, but what we got was a dreadful, stilted, boring and false movie; a failure from A to Z.The claim this is the best spy movie ever made is nonsense, particularly for anyone who remembers The House on 92nd Street, The Man Who Never Was, or at least 300 other pictures made by skilled directors who knew how to drive a story home to the audience.All the events in this film had the makings of great drama. They were, after all, the great historic events of the last 70 years. But under Robert de Nero's misguided direction nobody in this picture is given any character, personality, motivation, nobility, or any other human characteristic. Even the Angelina Jolie role is lifeless, and how de Nero squeezed the vim and vigor out of Angelina is anybody's guess.We only watched the first 65% of the movie, intending to see this long film over two nights.

I personally feel that this movie was very intelligent and kept me interested the whole time.

Don't go into this movie and expect it to grab your full attention, you have to give the movie your full attention, if that made any sense. This isn't an action movie, its not really a romance, there are a lot of events that happen in this movie that are confusing but you should be able to figure out. It is quite long but worth it, there are some slow parts but just pay attention and you feel yourself becoming more and more interested in what is going on.

Cold Warrior,"""The Good Shepherd"" is a rich, sprawling film stuffed with fine performances and capable of expanding to take in vast chunks of history or narrowing to concentrate on delicate human moments.It's a movie in which world-shattering events and piercing domestic crises are given credibly equivalent weight. Directed with smooth craft by Robert De Niro (!) it reveals a great depth of detail and parallels actual events so plausibly that it's relevant today although it deals with events of more than 40 years ago.Matt Damon stars as Edward Wilson, a taciturn and precise scion of New England whose life has led him from family tragedy to study at Yale to intelligence service in London and Berlin during and after World War II to a position as spymaster at the fledgling Central Intelligence Agency in the first decades of the Cold War. Wilson is a bloodless mixture of patriotism, poetry, shame, guilt and WASP noblesse oblige. He's a scholar and a Skull and Bonesman, a closet romantic and a professional cipher, a world-class compartmentalizer who keeps his private and working lives rigorously separate -- or at least as separate as events allow.Wilson first appears in April 1961, when he authorizes the CIA's botched attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro by invading Cuba's Bay of Pigs, and the film travels backward into his life as he tries to uncover the source of the intelligence leak that doomed the operation. We meet his father (Timothy Hutton), his favorite professor at Yale (Michael Gambon), his Skull and Bones brother (Lee Pace), the deaf girl he loves (Tammy Blanchard), the fast girl he has to marry (Angelina Jolie), the FBI agent who first engages him in spying (Alec Baldwin), the founder of the wartime intelligence agency who recruits him (De Niro), his tough second-in-command (John Turturro) and his nemesis, a Soviet spymaster (Oleg Stefan). It's a full, colorful company, spanning the globe and the years, and yet all of them have their proper places in Wilson's obsessively tidy mind.Damon is the buttoned-down, bled-white center of the film, a still, calm, hyper-alert presence whose silences force others to speak rashly but which also keeps at arm's length the people to whom he should be closest. It's a fine turn in a film filled with wonderful acting: Baldwin's seedy G-man; Gambon's shady aesthete; Blanchard's earnest shy girl; Jolie's domesticated, willful wife.Now and again, Eric Roth's script slips into melodrama (how does a Russian spymaster get in and out of the U.S. so readily?). But it's full of believably pseudo-historic detail. De Niro stages the film with impeccable fidelity and moves it along with remarkable fluency and grace. It's nearly three hours long and dense with twists and secrets, yet it plays like a dance: smooth and handsome and full of life.It's the type of film that may be forgiven its imperfections when they are compared with the vastness of its accomplishments.",9.0,Anonymous,History

If you are expecting an interesting and creative CIA cold war story then DO NOT SEE THIS DULL ONE,"This movie was horrible. It had little emotional connection and when the director tired to do this it usually failed miserably do to lack of a build up. There is not a single climactic moment really. The plot was all tangled and unclear. There were basically 3 CIA stories being rushed and unclearly described, unfortunately along with 3 of Matt Damon's boring love affairs and silent dialog. Although the acting was fairly good, It was very uncreative and poorly directed. The movie may have been good if the personal life of the character was reduced to simple amplified scenes with more emotion that connected together. And only if the CIA stories were much more clearly portrayed with Matt having real dialog action and hands on time that showed the view what was going on and how it was being taken care of. This was sadly not the case and the movie drags on for way to long, leaving me to give it a 2 out of 10 for all of it's failures.",2.0,Anonymous,History

The most intriguing and absorbing of all Espionage/CIA thrillers.,"A highly intriguing,very absorbing and ambitious epic that is carefully executed with dead pan seriousness.It's one of those fascinating failures that should be put aside and analyzed separately,in the likes of Life Aquatic,I heart Huckabees etc.It's one of those unique films that aren't entirely successful but leave a heavy impact.And De Niro's epic is one such film.It's so interesting that it keeps you hooked in the situations,in its characters but ultimately,you lose interest and will find it hard to digest as it comes close to three hours of running time and feels too long.But it nevertheless deserves a lot of praise.A film that took a long time to come to the screen and when it comes,you realize how much work is put into this anatomy of the birth of CIA.And Eric Roth's complex script aided by De Niro's impressive direction makes this one of the most intriguing of all Spy/Espionage/CIA films.Edward Wilson believes in his job more than anything in the world.He would put his life to risk to serve his nation.But the more deeper he goes into what he does,the more wreaked he becomes.His job requires him to isolate virtually from everyone,including his family.Spending a lot of time away from home just to get the job done.His life becomes a puzzle and a living hell as he's surrounded by people he doesn't know whether to trust or not.He is committed and all but he is left as an inhumane being.A being who is devoid of emotions and has forgotten who he was and what he has become.As the cold war and the rise of CIA plagues him,he is filled with paranoia and fear as he begins to lose touch with reality and is afraid to make contact with anyone.He becomes a ghost.Matt Damon's performance is mesmerizing.It's a very sophisticated character to play and he gets into the character and expresses everything the character goes through.Never once he makes you feel like he's himself. He becomes the character, he becomes a man who seems to be a reflection of a ghost.Increasingly isolating himself from his family just to get the job done, makes him all the more gripping.He does a terrific job,which is evident.It is his best performance to date, believe it or not. He has your attention throughout the long running time and never once letting you get fed up of his character. His expressions and his movement all makes you feel sad for this character.De Niro,who also has an important role in the film,comes off with an impressive work. He presents a fascinating character study and anatomy of CIA workings, for-adults only picture that should go down as the most intriguing films about Espionage to come to screen.And as a director he gets full points for setting up mesmerizing shots with his DOP and showing us a very ambitious epic that might be flawed, but is something really to look out for. For me, it was the best Spy film since the Bourne movies.But the film lacks a strong emotional value.Whether it's deliberate or not,it's up to the viewer.But I felt it did show the human side of Edward Wilson. And the relationship between him and his wife was brilliantly presented.Their quarrels and troubled relationship and all are was well executed. But Jolie wasn't all that impressive.Apart from them,the rest of the big cast was brilliant.The production boosts high quality and is filled with intricate and stunning moments.The cinematography is flawless but the editing was weak.The film needed to be trimmed for at least 20-25 minutes.It often feels like he's presented us his Director's cut.But I think it was very necessary. De Niro took his time to show the details and rise of the CIA, and I fully praise him for that.The length might feel long but it was required.At your own risk,watch the film if you want.But don't expect lots of action like those Bourne films delivered or explosions Spy Game delivered.It's a thoughtful,deeply psychological drama.It's a thriller.It's one of the best films of the year,and it certainly is worth checking out for its ambitious presentation.And it's way better than the somewhat disappointing GOOD German.If you could bear its running time,you might find yourselves absorbed into it.B+ 4/5",8.0,Anonymous,History
Open to plenty of analysis,"Director(and co-star)Robert DeNiro and writer Eric Roth patch together this dry and chilling story of the CIA,as illustrated through the adult life of a fictionalized son of power and privilege,whose sacrifices become as murky and unsavory as the actual world political situation of which he tries to navigate through.Edward Bell Wilson(Matt Damon,opting to lean this time toward playing a stiff,ambiguous and stoic character for whom his actions spell out MUCH more about him than his words),was all about devotion to something larger than himself. Whether it was his family(particularly his disgraced Wilson-era cabinet father or his separated but very much in mind son),his friends in college,his organization--the legendary ""Skull and Bones""--,his job and--particularly in his own mind--his country. As his job takes him from Post WWII--damaged Europe of the late 1940s through the heightened Cold War tensions of the early 1960s,we see Wilson make his deals,uncover spies,thieves,double agents and discover what kind of evil he's wrangled with on his way to becoming the top man in a burgeoning element of the American rise in Global power:namely,counterintelligence.Damon is about what you'd expect out of the character he's been assigned to limn: an Ivy-league educated,WASPy,pre-baby boomer who is as over-whelmed by the changing world identity as he is knee-deep in the middle of trying to alter and manipulate it. JOhn Turturro is particularly effective and even a little scary as Wilson's chief deputy,a quietly efficient and effective military man who seems to unquestioningly go about doing his job,and solid turns by Oleg Stefan(as Wilson's chief contact and counterpart in the KGB),Billy Crudup(as Wilson's nearly adversarial peer),William Hurt(as the agency mucky-muck who may or may not be on the take),JOe Pesci(as the of Italian-American organized crime,caught pants-down in Castro's nets,Tammy Blanchard(as Wilson's deaf,innocent college sweetheart)and Angelina JOlie(as Wilson's equally blue-blooded wife,who comes to greatly rue the fact that she got swept into her husband's world of quiet deceit). A lot of characters come and go through this world,but as Wilson quietly(And eventually dis-quietingly)goes about his business,they seem to become background to greater goals and missions,sometimes not at all what they seem.As stated earlier,there's plenty of analysis to be applied here,all the way up(or down)to the very title itself. While this movie tends to drag and the technical and chronological elements of the film tend to blur and get fudged a little(the way they age Damon and Jolie in this film is uneven at best,unconvincing at worst),it is still something of a ""must-see"" for people who take ANY interest in world affairs,semi-recent history,intergovernmental agencies and politics(and I would count myself among them). En Toto,an effective,disturbing and intriguing film offering with much to say and muted,intelligent ways of saying it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
This was a well written film,This movie was well written. It was long but you can't expect to cover the history of the CIA in an hour and a half. The twists and turns of the movie are very good examples of what it was like in the OSS and CIA. The fact that certain things were not flat out written on a sign for the audience to read and understand is part of the movie's genius. Not everything in life is supposed to make sense. Not everything in the world means something. Sometimes people can pull meaning out of a inanimate object when that object has no meaning at all. Its just the way life is. I would see this movie again when I get time and I suggest anybody who lives in America should see this movie. America wouldn't be America with men like Edward Wilson.,8.0,Anonymous,History
Too slow. Too long,"Too slow. Too long. And, hence too boring. Fell asleep several times during it. Whole movie just seem to ramble on, and I found it hard to follow. Flashbacks were not very well defined, and Matt Damon seemed to not age, which made it doubly hard to follow the plot. Film doesn't really peak at all. Probably an hour too long. What else has De Niro directed. Didn't even know he directed this one. Was it just self indulgence? Or misguided brilliance! The character of Matt Damon is very wooden. Almost went and rented ""The Bourne"" movies, to see if Matt Damon can actually use his face show emotion.

"Sex, Lies and Reel-To-Reel Tape","A number of the reviews here mention the fact that Bobby DeNiro has stolen a few pages from the Francis Ford Coppola Director's Handbook. Couldn't agree more. And if you're gonna choose a director to emulate, you might as well go straight to the top of the class.The parallels to the ""Godfather"" movies are evident throughout the film, most particularly in the way that DeNiro evokes the periods in question with a rabid attention to detail. Everything just looks and feels right. ""Good Shepherd"" is one of those films that will bear repeated viewings for nuances, and I believe that's probably the nicest thing that one can say about any film.The acting by all concerned parties is award worthy. It's Damon's movie, but expect any number of supporting actors to be recognized as well, including my personal nominee for next ""it-girl"", Tammy Blanchard.DeNiro's direction in ""Bronx Tale"" was solid and focused, but ""Good Shepherd"" is a quantum leap forward. You say you're looking for an ""actor's director""? One might postulate that you're gonna be hard-pressed to top this fella any time soon. Even odds that come award season, the movie and the good Mr. DeNiro walk away with the whole shootin' match.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Love/Hate,"Anyone reading the comments who has not seen this film must feel awe struck by the opposite extremes of reaction created by those reacting to having apparently viewed the same film.

"a good idea, but told in a boring manner","I didn't think this movie was that good. It was rather boring, way too long. Not to mention the main characters don't do a whole lot. Sure, Edward Wilson helps start up the CIA, but this is far from a spy thriller. Jolie isn't given much to do except be a forgotten housewife. There were too many characters, and I got lost as to who was who. Also, with all the time jumping, it just added to the confusion of the film. Who was spying on who? Who were all the guys with Russian accents Edward kept meeting with in DC. I'm still not sure.Edward is faced with defending his countries secrets or giving up his own son. He chooses what a true patriot would do; however, helps protect his son also.FINAL VERDICT: Boring, the nearly 3 hour running time really drags this movie down.",5.0,Anonymous,History
The Best Spy Film Since The Spy Who Came In From The Cold,"Not since 1965's classic The Spy Who Came In From The Cold has a spy film taken on the murky world of Cold War espionage in such a realistic fashion. The Good Shepherd takes the potentially boring story of the founding of the CIA and turns it into one of the compelling dramas you will ever see. Thanks especially to great writing and terrific acting, this film makes history come alive.The film's two leads, Matt Damon (Edward Wilson) and Angelina Jolie (Wilson's wife Clover), have both been involved in more action driven spy thrillers. This film gives them the chance to flex their terrific acting mussels. Damon is an engaging actor and he becomes Edward Wilson. He is both hero and villain throughout the film and one watches as the young idealist becomes a hard cold warrior. He fits into the world of the film so well that at times one could forget you are looking at an actor. Jolie is the emotionally torn wife who, in her words ""lives with a ghost"" and the film is, in my mind at least, at least as much about her journey through the times as Edward's.Behind them is a strong supporting cast who make way too many brief appearances. William Hurt's Philip Allen is the mentor of sorts to Edward and he is not as he seems. The same is true for Arch Cummings, played excellently by Billy Crudup, and the defector played by John Sessions. On top of them are the virtual cameos by Alec Baldwin, Robert De Niro, Timothy Hutton, and Joe Pesci. Each of them tells an important part of the story though and without them the film would not be the same. And then there is Eddie Redmayne, who plays the son of Edward Wilson. His performance is stand-out and I suspect there may be a future for this guy.The writing is a ture masterpiece. While the film is certainly not a documentary (there are numerous factual errors of dates) is does make the past come alive. Many of the scenes and techniques are based on real events and techniques used by the CIA. The history of the CIA's founding and early years from its beginnings in Yale's Skull and Bones through the WWII organization of the OSS and all the way to the disaster at the Bay of Pigs is full of a lot of facts that could have bogged down any film. Yet Eric Roth's script does exactly the opposite. Whiel loaded with facts, the script never loses site of the human drama unfolding in the midst of the events. Not to mention so many excellent pieces of dialouge used in the film including one of my favorite lines:""You're the guys that scare me. You're the people that make big wars.""""No, we make sure the wars are small ones.""The rest of the film's production values are excellent as well. The sets are amazing and the use of real locations helps out immensily as well. The music score is at times haunting and never fails to hit the right emotional cord. Then there is the excellent cinematography by Robert Richardson. The film is a visual masterpiece on its own without either the acting or script to back it. Director Deniro brings power to the screen and even in what might be an otherwise boring moment our attention is rivited to the screen.To be honest I am surprised by the lack of attention given to this film by an of the major awards. The Good Shepherd is the best spy film in more then four decades (the last one being of course 1965's The Spy Who Came In From The Cold) and that is saying something. This is not only a history lesson, it is a study of those who keep us safe and the price they pay for it. If there is anyone who doubts both the power of espionage and the price one pays for it this is a film they must see.Don't miss this film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Like the Cold War.  Nothing happened,"When the CIA discover that someone has been leaking information to the Cubans, it is up to Edward Bell Wilson (Matt Damon) to track the person down and administer some justice covert style. His journey is told as we are invited into Damon's life, how he came to join the CIA, how he met his wife, his first sacrifice etc. An intricate story, class acting and some great directing means that Robert De Niro's latest stint behind the camera has all the right ingredients to make a remarkable movie. Not in this case though. Not a case of too many cooks, more of a case of the wrong amount of ingredients. The story may be intricate but it is far from compelling. Damon may be wonderful but one feels that he may have benefited more from some regular support. Joe Pesci and Alec Baldwin are great in their cameos, however it wouldn't have killed anyone to give them some more screen time. Jolie doesn't do anything wrong, though it's hard to feel sorry for her when you don't really care for her one dimensional bored housewife. Damon's son provides some great support in the third act, as does Michael Gambon in the first, however it's not enough to save a film that is unfortunately very boring. The problem is that this film had so much potential. However it is a prime example that regardless of the star quality a film possesses it will always fail under a poor script.",5.0,Anonymous,History
The rogue shepherd,"I had been thinking about the apparent tragedy of our misguided invasion of Iraq and had at least tentatively concluded that much of the problem was the hubris of our President and certain members of his cabinet: the conviction that American might and force of will can solve the most intractable international crises. I wondered if this prideful arrogance had its origin in elite boarding schools, Yale University, and, yes, a certain secret society that cradled W and other recent political eminences. Then I saw The Good Shepherd, which, of course, with the CIA standing in for the executive branch, reinforces that view. General Sullivan (Robert De Niro) warns us about the arrogance and ignorance of unchecked power, those who come to believe that they have god-like qualities, ""there's no ""the"" preceding god."" Edward Wilson is the stand in for all of us: we're sheep, too often following a rogue shepherd.",9.0,Anonymous,History

While shot in the new century, the film sets a new standard for greatness in my opinion. Nothing, however, is without some faults however. I was amazed when viewing the deleted scenes that there was even one more plot twist that the director considered.

"Coulda, shoulda, woulda stayed home","You will constantly be told 'You have to turn your brain on to watch this movie'. Well, maybe that's true, but I would have found more enjoyment trying to solve a rubiks cube for the first time without instructions than trying to solve this random assortment of clips. I didn't know what to expect when going to this movie, maybe I didn't have my brain turned on. And maybe, based on the reactions of 90% of everyone else in the theater at the end of the movie, I wasn't the only one. The rating of the movie, a 7.2, surely surprises me. Perhaps most of the people rating it are the ones who enjoyed, and 90% of the people who saw it but didn't rate it simply decided to take as much effort rating the film as the creators did in making it.The movie itself is constantly jumping between 1940 and 1961. The switches are often pretty quick, especially in the beginning. Since the characters had no change in appearance between the dates, the audience is forced to keep constant track of what year the events are taking place in so they can tie it all together later. They never can. It also seemed like too many stories and events were trying to be told at once, but the main ones seem so insignificant to the plot(I should say, me saying this is incredible because if I had to write what the plot was, your guess is as good as mine).If you are expecting an action movie, it is not. If you are expecting a mystery, it is not that either. (again, referring to the plot, not the creation of the film itself) You know though, this movie, at least the concept, has such great potential to be great. Had they cut out 2 hours of B.S. and filled it with character and plot developments, I could see myself rating this an 8 or higher. The acting was not bad, and I wouldn't discredit the actors for doing their part. But my, my oh my, this was likely the most exhausting movie I have seen in a long time, if not ever. If that's your cup of tea, then by all means, check it out. But for me, and I assume the majority of viewers, we like to have twists and conclusions we can easily make sense of. If I can't easily make sense of it, that is not my fault.But fact of the matter is, call me an idiot, I can't solve a rubiks cube, and if someone were to hand me one, I'd simply say 'No thanks' because my interest in solving a rubiks cube is slim to none.

Well, my mind felt assaulted all right by having to watch Damon's bored and expressionless face for almost three hours (that felt like, well, three decades at least). And this after I had already suffered through The Departed! I can't believe this guy is seen as an actor! Even a dead body does more acting than Matt Damon! A good story should have, as we all have learned in school, a beginning, a middle part with climax and an ending. The Good Shepherd had nothing! Whenever I believed that a circle was about to be closed and the film would finally come to an end or at least to some point, there was just another circle about to be closed. And another. And so on.

Not Entertaining,"I was worn out after watching this very long movie. The movie had wonderful actors and technically, it was nice. But the plot was so painfully slow and the excitement level was just dreadful. There were almost 2 light moments to offer some relief, but the key word is ""almost."" The movie could have been edited to 90 minutes easily without missing anything other than the boredom. I think that the story line is a great idea and wish that it had moved in less clinical style. The movie was sterile. While the emotions portrayed by Jolie were good, Matt Damon's stoic and almost grimacing style of the character's portrayal were numbing. Damon didn't age in the movie either, which technically made us question the lengthy time-line going from the late 30's into the early 60's. Another strange quick was the very short appearances by some great actors. These short cameos were almost frustrating reminding me of campy movies shot for marketing titillation versus significant actor content. Timothy Hutton's short appearance was wasted as was Joe Pesci's. The hype this movie has commanded is interesting; I don't understand why people flock to see wakes. This movie certainly fill the criteria as an expensive and extremely over-hyped attempt at entertainment. It was not entertaining.",1.0,Anonymous,History
A Disgrace to left out of the Top 250,"It boggles my mind to come to IMDb and see this title get a 6.9/10 when it is far more deserving of inclusion into the Top 250 movie list. It's hard for me to fathom some people's take on this movie, especially those who degrade this film but give an over dramatic and incredibly boring movie such as ""Magnolia"" an 8/10 and rank it toward the middle of the Top 250.The Good Shepherd is awe-inspiring with its sincere presentation while not being at all over the top. The characters are well-developed and acted out extraordinarily, especially Matt Damon as the stoic lead role and Robert De Niro and Alec Baldwin in their minor roles. The story is masterfully told and jumps from the movie's present time to the past, showing the development of the modern day CIA in the United States and how it affects one of its early pioneers. Although I don't know how much of the story is true and I don't want to give away too much of the story, please take my word that The Good Shepherd is an unpretentious and highly underrated film and is far undeserving of its low rank., Though the movie is long, it's far from tedious (as some critics dubbed it) and moves at an excellent pace keeping you interested until its powerful conclusion.At the very least rent the movie, or catch it on a movie channel, and when it's over, come back to IMDb and give the film the ranking it deserves.

On this point we are twice betrayed, and virtually nobody picks up on it. A greater evil was at hand in the production of this film, against the viewing audience, and the population at large.

The time line changes throw you off a bit at the beginning, but after about 20 minutes you get completely drawn in and suddenly everything fits like a glove. Quite often in films switching from one time line to another is badly done with weird visual effects and bad editing, jumping from one bit to another, with The Good Shepard this was done with finesse and complexity that match the films intricate story line so well.It captured a perfect balance for me in the film, the story of the CIA how it all began, along side that was Edward Wilsons character and how he became what he was and the moral and intelligence based decisions he had to make through out the film; not just for his county but also for his family. Mixed into that was suspense, mystery and good measure of hard truths about what has to be done to protect the freedom that most of us take for granted in out countries.The acting was very good through out, De Niro only played small parts in the film but directed it too the same standard as he is an actor. Matt Damon as usual just dropped right into his character as if it was made for him and I was really pleased to see Angelina Jolie doing a serious role which I think she portrayed very well.10 out of 10 for this film.

The screenplay is difficult to follow, but it certainly does justice to the very confusing and fast-paced world of espionage. If you were expecting the Bourne Identity, I apologize on behalf of the screen writing and directorial crew.This film condenses (in its 2+ hour duration) a very accurate portrayal of the conception of U.S. intelligence and counerintelligence in the OSS and, later, CIA. It is fast; it is confusing; and I completely agree with you regarding Redmayne's performance. However, the film is incredibly accurate, and its few dramatic embellishments serve to clarify to us, the laymen, what the actual dynamics and purpose of our intelligence agencies are like.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Long and Boring,"Edward Wilson (Damon) is a career CIA agent who is trying to unravel the mystery of who caused the Bay of Pigs operation in Cuba to fail. The story goes loosely into the beginnings of the CIA as well and some Russian defections.This movie reminded me of The Spy Who Came in From the Cold. That, to me, was long and boring too, but admittedly, a better told story on film. I think for viewing future spy movies we should be equipped with the Green Night Vision Glasses and one of those large hearing discs along with earphones. Too much in this movie was in staged in dark, shadowy areas; and too much of this movie was barely audible due to ""well, you know, we have to talk softly so others can't hear."" The Director didn't let the audience hear too much as we might endanger national security. I gave up rewinding the DVD to determine what was going on at times.The acting was dead-pan all around except for a couple outbursts by Wilson's wife, Margaret (Jolie), and she was totally underutilized. Where is Laura Croft when you need her? This could have used some humor too.I need to explain something. It is my understanding that the Wilson character was based on a real live CIA agent, who actually, was the way Matt Damon played him in the movie. So we can forgive the dead-pan portrayal by Matt Damon as he was doing the right thing. That doesn't forgive the rest of the cast or the director who needed to put some life into this. I mean we can't have Angelina doing an outburst too often.You know, if truth be told, being a Good Shepherd is a long and boring job too.Violence:Yes, Sex: Yes, dark scenes but you know what was going on. Nudity : No, too dark to see anything Language:Yes, there was some, not much",5.0,Anonymous,History
Too Many Ambiguous References Made it Disappointing,"This movie was more of a character study than a spy film in the typical sense--and though the characters and events did bear some resemblance to bits and pieces of accepted versions of historic events--those parallels were uncomfortable and confusing for me.The name chosen for Damon's character, Edward Wilson, was unfortunate in that it brought to mind real-life rogue CIA officer Edwin Wilson, who used his position to amass personal wealth, was probably involved in Iran-contra and alleged CIA drug dealing, was convicted of selling 20 tons of C-4 to Libya in the 1980's, and sentenced to prison, where he remained until 2 years ago.The lines between factual representation and fiction, were too weirdly blurred, and it was never clear who and what the characters and events were trying to represent. I know enough about US Intelligence history, the Bay of Pigs, and the players on the field during that period not to have a lot of problems with the movie.I've seen reviews that draw parallels between Damon's character and James Jesus Angleton, former CIA counterintelligence chief, but I've read enough about Angleton to dismiss those as nonsense. Angleton was highly egotistical, morally flawed, and something of a lunatic--compared to the movie's Edward Wilson, who seemed to be a good man with good motives, who made some mistakes of judgment and may have discovered too late that the sacrifices involved in his chosen profession were too great.In a movie, every character and event should have a purpose. Who was the poetic, Nazi-sympathizing, academic mentor, Michael Gambon character supposed to be? Was it Ernest Hemingway? Ken Kesey? What about the references to the KGB defectors and what was the whole ""Ulysses"" reference about? The CIA didn't usually handle KGB defectors inside the US, the FBI did--which made for drawing uncomfortable parallels to FBI traitor Robert Hanssen. Those were further reinforced by references to the Skull & Bones Society which seemed to hint at Hanssen's membership in the secretive Catholic society, Opus Dei.In summary, if someone could point to the various characters and events and tell me what real-life people and events they were based on, I think I might like the movie better. If anyone can do that for me, please, please do.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Not pleased,"I give this movie a 5, but I should have given it a 4 because only SOME of the acting was great. John Turturro (from Mr. Deeds & Secret Window) was wonderful to watch in this movie, but unfortunately he is not the main character. Don't get me wrong, I think Matt Damon is (usually) a great actor. In fact he was great in this movie as well, but it was just simply boring. His character bored me and even frustrated me at times. I consider myself to be a pretty knowledgeable person, and I have a great appreciation for history, screenplay, and movies that are themed in the 40s - 60s... But this one simply didn't do it for me. Even history buffs gave it bad reviews. I also do not see how this movie is categorized as a drama, because there simply was no drama... Except for the few scenes where Angelina Jolie expresses her distress in their horrible marriage. Drama is suppose to 'move' you or at least stir up a couple of emotions within you, and this movie did not do that.... Rather, it made me yawn more & more as the story progressed. Please listen to the other ""critics"" who gave negative reviews. I cannot say anymore than they can. They hit the nail right on the head & could not have given you a more honest reflection of this film. I wish it had been a better movie, but once again... it was one of those films that gets your hopes up because of the A-list actors that you see in the previews... then turns out to be a disappointing movie. Many of the scenes seemed like they were just thrown in there for no coherent reason other than an excuse for a cameo. The movie was very inconsistent. Viewer Beware!",5.0,Anonymous,History
Spy Film for the Thinking man,"If you are hoping to see Matt Damon shooting bad guys and saving the world, then you are in for the wrong movie. This film is more about the complex nature of espionage; where nothing is what it seems, none of your friends can be trusted, and you are always being watched. There are countless great performances in this film. Matt Damon does an excellent job as Edwards Wilson, a man who while quiet and often emotionless, is so interesting and mysterious.Note this film is very long and is a type of film where you need to be paying attention to the smallest things that are shown and said. A single line can be a huge turning point on the film. The Script in this film is complex and you probably will need to see the film 2 or 3 times to fully understand everything that is said. Robert DeNiro's directing is very good and flows well. The only issue with this film is while rather long, it can be slow moving at parts. Other good films for people who like the espionage era is Spy Game and Three Days of the Condor and for those who like a very intelligent script then try Ronin, The Way of the Gun, and Spartan.This is an excellent movie and one of the best espionage films ever created. If you are looking for a complex, intelligent espionage film, you have found it. But if you are looking for a Bond film with explosions and firefights, then you are in for a very boring movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"Good Film, but not Phenomenal","De Niro gives us an inside look into the CIA. Matt Damon is the star as Edward Wilson. The movie didn't have much character development but he still did bring a moving picture. William Hurt was not spectacular but still did do pretty good. I had expectations going into the film, that this was going to be literally a new ""Godfather"" and would change film history, but it didn't. Pesci has a very small part in which all he does is chat with Damon. I was expecting the comeback for Pesci to be another very moving moment. I would tell you to go into the movie thinking that it will be good not great. I hoped that the Good Shepherd would be an Oscar nominee, maybe winner, but nobody else thinks that. I would have to give this film 8.5/10, and I was not thinking that this film would have as many flaws as it did, yes they were small flaws but I was sure hoping that this would be on the 250, and getting great ratings and so far nothing has happened yet. The acting was good, but not top notch. De Niro just needed to add a few things to the film, and the film would have been better. Angelina Jolie was definitely not cast correctly because 1. she's not any good 2. she overacted in the film. I did still enjoy it, but when you have all this hope and high expectations that I will be phenomenal, I think that De Niro should still do a sequel like he said on Regis and Kelly, but needs to go deeper than he did with the Good Shepherd. De Niro is still a great actor and director but he could of done more.",10.0,Anonymous,History

The 10 years the director spent elaborating this project definitely show.,"The Good Shepherd is, although considerably long, extremely intriguing. The atmosphere generated is of such fine quality that - unlike in most spy stories, you can immediately relate to the main character, Edward Wilson, wonderfully portrayed by Matt Damon, and continue with him on a strange journey at the end of which Wilson is hopelessly entangled in the net of the early CIA.What makes this spy story different from all other spy stories is that there are no spectacular action scenes, no bad guys and good guys, and, what is very rare in the cinema, the director does not transmit a ready-made opinion to the viewer on what he or she is supposed to think of each and every character. The viewer is thought to be capable to form an own concept. What a refreshing novelty! While most of the actors do fine, Matt Damon is brilliant.And I have never heard of Tammy Blanchard before, but she does some great acting here.The Good Shepherd sports some excellent music which is one of the reasons you are hooked on the film from the start. The first 15 minutes are more exciting than a dozen other spy thrillers put together (yes, the James Bonds included, yes, the newest one as well).One of the many reasons The Good Shepherd works so well is that throughout the story a sense of reality and everyday life is kept. Pictures of the main character's working hours are followed up by equally interesting family matters.The only thing that annoyed me was that the characters seemingly did not get any older, although a substantial amount of time passed as the story evolved.It is absolutely a shame that this movie did not get any Oscars.The Good Shepherd is not only an interesting account of the early days of the CIA, but the fascinating story of an unfortunate man who should never have trusted anybody but himself, and the consequences of when he did.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"If you like long movies with lots of flashbacks, then this movie is for you.","How bad can a movie be? At what point should the critic stop ragging a movie? The Good Shepherd inspires such questions. It is a long movie. It is a tedious movie. It is, literally, a sleeper. The acting, the story, the direction, is almost amateurish. The main characters are uninteresting, the dramatic conflict contrived, the plot predictable, and whoever plays Matt Damon's son, well, he is arguably the most annoying presence on the movie screen in years. The only time this movie perks up is in the scenes with Robert Di Niro and also when a man takes a flying leap through a window. But the movie's most annoying qualities are its pomposity, its pretentiousness and its repeated use of flashbacks. Hence, a new warning: Beware of the flashback, it can ruin a movie.Also, this movie contains one of the most flagrant examples of miscasting in recent movie memory. The decision to cast Angelina Jolie as a submissive housewife defies logic and is another reason why this movie is truly remarkable but for all the wrong reasons.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"Great story, good acting, poor film","As a story, this was written well and would've been quite engaging if it was not such a poorly made film. I apologize, but unlike everyone else, just because there has been such a lack of good films lately, people are willing to jump on the bandwagon of any movie that doesn't completely suck. And that is what I feel is happening with this movie (and the Departed, which had great acting, superior direction, but a weak script).This movie is very much unnecessarily drawn out. While some films warrant the long running times, this film does not. It almost feels as if to make it seem like an intelligent, grand-scale film, there was a running time goal. The same story could've been told in a 2 hour film much more engagingly. Long drawn out moments in which there is supposed to be a lot of subtext just seemed dry, and the obvious attempt for a human element during those scenes was simply not felt. At no point did I feel I could sympathize at all with the main character for his ""sacrifices"".So in summary, this movie feels more like a history book acted out rather than an emotionally involving story. And I hate to say it, because while I like Matt Damon, his performance was nothing short of mediocre. I do not blame him, but the script. There wasn't much range in his character to show any acting prowess, this role could've been performed by any half-decent struggling acting student. So I sincerely hope he is not nominated for best actor (even though he will probably be).",5.0,Anonymous,History

"A great cast with terrific actors, but still it falls short. Why? It lasts too long (almost 3 hours!) and Matt Damon (however good an actor) is miscast in the leading role.","When I looked at the cast of this movie I was gobsmacked with awe, because lots and lots of terrific actors star in it. Still it is no good? Why not? It lasts WAY too long, almost clocking 3 hours for good sake. And it is directed by Robert De Niro, who has little to none experience as a director and his shortcomings as a director DO show...The movie looks the part. It's not a bad movie either, but it is definitely not a coherent unity. It's all over the place. Too many characters, too many storylines. And the biggest fault: Matt Damon is miscast in his leading role. I am a big fan of Matt Damon, but he simply is not the right actor for this role. Not bad, simply lacking the correct characteristics / charisma for this particular role.Conclusion: everything about this movie should have been great, but the sum total is mediocre.

Average Shepherd,"This is a movie with potential that never gets rolling. It groans along with little if any development of its characters and unexplained and confusing story lines.Matt Damon's attempt to portray ""Mr. Wilson"" as a controlled, detached, and somewhat tormented CIA Lead Guy may have hit the mark for DeNiro (Director), but is an incredibly difficult character to make any connection with. Angelina Jolie has no real role here and this was not the movie to showcase any range as an actress. Does a CIA-based movie have to be confusing to watch just because it involves the intricacies of the CIA? ""Spy Game"" was also a CIA-based plot movie and moved along much more smoothly.DeNiro literally ""disappears"" during the movie, and Joe Pesci's five minutes is five minutes too long - adding nothing. It was a lazy attempt and probably doesn't deserve as high a rating as I gave it.

Intelligent and deep,"No dead wood in this film, just a great script, great cast and great direction.Damon's portrayal - based on James Jesus Angleton who, essentially, created the CIA from the OSS - was good in this case as he does stony silence better than most. His quiet unflappable manner spoke of still waters running very deep. The only kind of man for that job. John Turturro's lesser role still allowed him the space to work - the MKULTRA torture scene was difficult to pull off and still have the audience retain a skein of sympathy for Turturro's character. He managed it by convincing me that he was doing a difficult job as gently as possible. Was that a tinge of regret in his eyes? Robert de Niro was, as always, good and it didn't hurt that this role is not so far from the many mafiosi/goodfella type roles he has played in the past, only this time his suit was from an Ivy League tailor. Michael Gambon was brilliant as he fought to balance his loyalty with his duty and the secret that made him too vulnerable for it. ""If you want to tie your shoelaces, I'll understand."" Since Wilson didn't, Dr. Fredericks did it for him as a touching mark of respect. Alec Baldwin suited his role in this film and pleasantly surprised me with previously unseen gravitas. Interesting cameo from Keir Dullea, not sure why they bothered as he said perhaps three words. Angelina Jolie did well with her character who was pitiably in the wrong marriage, though Daisy's capriciousness was the reason why.The time-lines were handled well. I tend to dislike choppy flashbacks and out of sequence stuff ever since that tedious Tarantino made it a fashionable gimmick in Pulp Fiction. But here, it works. There's a cleverly subtle washed-out look to the latter day scenes that make the past look more vibrant as only nostalgia can deliver and that helped cue when time-lines switched. It was as though Wilson was becoming disenchanted with the job though, clearly, he was the kind of man who would see it through to the end because he knew it was fundamentally important to his country. Some think the pace was poor but there was a lot of setting up needed to understand how this intricate house of cards came to be. Some think that Damon's character was dull. In a sense that's true; dull because he was so incredibly meticulous which, again, is the lifeblood of the agency. Musclebound thugs and vainglorious have-a-go heroes can be found in any bar in any city on earth. They're the blunt instruments that are precisely what the agency doesn't need except in very rare circumstances where they need a to set a dog to eat a dog.Technically the film was very easy on the eye, great cinematography and atmospheric sets and lighting placed us right beside Wilson as he learnt his trade and moved his chess pieces. This is the kind of deep plotty Gordian knot that should be sipped and savoured like a tall drink.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Cram as much diversity and politics as possible,"Like someone says in the movie about poetry, look behind the words. There are so many issues one has read in the newspaper in the last few years that are displayed in this movie as to make it a joke. There's a water torture, there's gay guy who's murdered, there's a forced marriage, there's domestic spying, there's fraternity initiation that get's crazy, there's a scene where a jilted wife finds out about her cheating husband and in a social group and throws the photos at him, there's some sex, there's a twist at the end, there's nudity, there's an interracial relationship, gee all that's left is someone being thrown from an airplane... hum.This movie lost me when the old gay former professor is beaten to death and one hear's cries and screaming and realistically that would not be the case as it would be done very quietly, maybe some dull sounds like someone pounding a rock. The makeup on Alec Baldwin in his first scene was too much as I guess they were trying to make him look pale and close to death. Matt Damon basically plays the role very much like his Mr. Ripley character, showing very little personality. Angelina Jolie acting is passable, but she's no Meryl Streep or Sally Field.The pace of the movie makes up for Matt Damon's underplaying his role. The switching back and forth over a couple of decades is sometimes dizzying, and Damon's character never seems to age.Of course this movie attacks the ""military industrial business"", but like all left wing based movies does not recognize that this business was to keep the USA one step ahead of the USSR, who kept putting the pressure on, via, Korea, Cuba, Vietnam, Angola, etc.Of course every movie of this caliber depends on stupid, naive people and there's a lot in this one.",3.0,Anonymous,History

"Good Drama, Spy Movie, and Life Examination","What this movie focuses on continually changes and unfolds, but centrally it's about choices; how all of us try to make decisions and go with what will work best. Still, there will be things you didn't do right. It's about regrets, mistakes, weakness, purity, and deception.The acting is all top notch and the direction (by Robert DiNiro,) who clearly has given the players the vibe he wants out of each scene, is excellent. The tone of the film is consistently melancholy and distanced, to convey the heaviness of the pervasive secret world of espionage in which Edward, the main character (Matt Damon) lives. There are a lot of shadows used in this film, a symbol of the hidden and unearthliness of the ""spooks"" who glide through their lives carefully plotting and counter-plotting through wars, and around wars. The time-line of the piece sea-saws between past and present history - which is sometimes difficult to track - but works itself out without much effort on the viewer's part.This film is not for everyone. It's not glossy, sexy, or action-packed. It's a long investment time-wise, but the pacing works. If you are indulgent in allowing the plot to unfold, and are not requiring a film with car chases, then this film offers a story that moves and is not overly cerebral with dialogue that's not sleepy. It's easy enough to follow and complicated enough to seem evolved from real life. This film is well-crafted and employs rich vintage colors to tell an interesting story through characters that are multi-dimensional and worth caring about.

Nice try......,"This film has been praised for its realism and criticized for being boring. Both characteristics are accurately described, but neither is specifically the reason that this film is a failure.'The Good Shepherd' is built out of the reality of spying, if one is liberal about specifics, but what brings it down is that the film not only views the history of the CIA through the prism of one man's life, it tries to CAPTURE the whole of the CIA's official history, and trap it beneath a petty everyman character. With so much officious history stuffed into one banal character, the film becomes a long series of setup pieces, the minor establishing scenes that set the stage for a film's central, and subsidiary dramas. Rather than effective storytelling, we have an official biopic gone bad, with all the tedium and boredom that this implies. Many of the scenes have a peculiar sort of corpse-like realism, with no element specifically and obviously wrong, but with a truncated cast and petty scale giving the lie to the matter.This is a film that tells, not shows, and by trying to tell the story of the whole CIA, it ends up with little story on screen. This is poor film-making. The acting is generally to a high standard, but major characters are miscast, and the protagonist, as one example, does not effectively transition from college student, to disillusioned middle aged functionary.

Great thriller directed by Robert De Niro,"Directed by Robert De Niro, the Good Shepherd is a great character study as well as a thriller. This is great direction by De Niro here. At its heart this is a fictionalized account of the birth and early years of the CIA. While the names have been changed to protect the not-so-innocent, many of the characters have real-life counterparts. The lengthy movie (15 minutes shy of three hours) unspools like a cold war spy novel, with betrayals, double-crosses, triple-crosses, and fluid allegiances. The protagonist isn't the most sympathetic individual to reach the screen, but the vortex of moral and ethical uncertainties in which he becomes caught makes him an intriguing, although not likeable, individual. The length is a drawback (almost 3 hours), but not a big one since the movie earns the majority of its 165-minute running time.

There's nothing better than a film like Memento which leaves me reeling, but ultimately, I figure it all out.The Good Shepherd isn't like that. Who are the men with the guns? Who's passing which notes to whom? What's going on? The film jumps around to various timeframes, and right from the beginning it's unclear just what is happening. Something involving the Bay of Pigs, and betrayal.So despite all the great acting, great scenery, etc. I just found it boring. The opposite of 13 Days, which is a fantastic film about the Cuban Missile Crisis and in which it's impossible to get lost because every scene explains in depth what they're trying to do, why it's important, and where the conflict comes from.These flaws would be enough for a 5 out of 10 rating, but then... who's idea was it to have the protagonist of The Good Shepherd be a silent unemoting person we can't identify with, or hate?

"Good story, good director, good actor - good shepherding","A fictionalised retelling of the chaotic creative forces behind the emergence of the CIA told from the perspective of Edward Wilson alias Mother (Matt Damon) beginning from before the II World War and ending at the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Although all characters are fictional, they are all heavily inspired by actual people, while the attention to detail is striking. That said the main character, a poetry student turned into a secret agent, is mostly presented through a personal tale about dreams, love and life wasted in a tireless, but vivid pursuit of victory for his country and the ideals it carries with it. Or as Wilson states - in attempts to prevent big wars by engaging in small ones. Collateral damage is the loss of personal happiness: friends, family, morality, peace of mind. When Wilson's life closes a full circle the revelation comes that his biggest foe - the Soviet super-spy Ulysses - is actually his truest friend due to a mutual understanding of losses carried due to the line of work they have chosen.Miles away from Bourne territory, ""The Good Shepherd"" takes a realistic turn, much in the manner of ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"", recounting a sombre, but bleak version of secret service. One deeply entrenched in paranoia of enemies hiding behind shadows and ever-growing distrust. This grim reality so strikingly portrayed in Robert de Niro's film never falters, Matt Damon playing a detached and emotionally reclusive person, rarely sharing warmth with anyone (apart from his lost love and only son), who increasingly falls into himself losing the last vestiges of humanity slowly dropping into self-loathing - by the end utterly despising himself for his deeds and life.Nonetheless ""The Good Shepherd"" is a movie of epic scale and ambition, but one that fails to reach the heights, occasionally plodding, but despite almost never having a scene worth cutting (each movement, shot meaningful and expanding the world portrayed). Deposing of conventional gimmicks the movie is strongly character based with strong entries by Robert de Niro, Alec Baldwin, Tammy Blanchard, Billy Crudup, William Hurt, Angelina Jolie and John Turturro. However at almost three hours the somewhat melodramatic undertow coupled with the almost total lack of action or suspense does tend to drag, making it a tough watch in one take. All in all ""The Good Shephered"" requires a good amount of focus, as a thought-provoking period piece worthy of wider acclaim.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Good Shepherd-Tend to this Flock ***,"Robert De Niro directs and co-stars in this memorable film dealing with the birth of the CIA and one member's eventual disillusionment with the top secret organization.Both Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie give career performances in this film. With his thick glasses, Damon is a powerful figure in a restrained performance as a CIA agent who sacrifices his life for working for the famous agency. Jolie has never been better as the neglected wife that he had to marry when he got her in trouble.Detailing the rise of the agency as World War 11 was about to begin, we see with the effective use of flashbacks, the Kennedy debacle at the Bay of Pigs and going back to 1939 as war breaks out in Europe and a covert group is needed and assembled.We have a terrific supporting performance by Michael Gambon, as a supposedly Nazi sympathetic British college professor who is a double agent but is put to death because of his homosexual activities being viewed as a threat.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Too long and uninteresting,"This film ran for almost 3 hours and I'm not entertained one bit. I'm expecting a great film because of the great cast, Robert De Niro as director, and it's premise (spycraft and intelligence service), but I'm not hooked with the story. In fairness, the acting was not bad and the production is excellent, it's really just the story that's not compelling.Confusing at times, it relies on too many flashbacks and the characters doesn't seem to age during the 30 year span of the film. Doomed from the start, the movie has a boring plot. It mostly centers on the life of a CIA head (Matt Damon) who is so stoic the entire time, there's no character development. And I didn't find myself getting interested on what happens to the rest of the characters. No action or drama, everything is bleak.Too long and uninteresting, I didn't expect this from a spy movie.",2.0,Anonymous,History
soul-sucking,"One of the most plodding, boring, soul-sucking and depressing movies I've seen in a long time.Not only does Matt Damon's character never have much to say, but he consistently lets his family down, and I was never really sure why. Though the movie is well-acted, the characters are really never fleshed out enough for you to understand their motivations or even really develop any kind of sympathy for them. A lot of plot points were never sufficiently explained or given any sort of background. I got a couple of the lesser roles confused and was uncertain as to why several characters were even included in the movie.I was sorely disappointed as I had high expectations due to both Robert De Niro and Matt Damon's association with the film. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Roth and DeNiro make 'The Godfather' for WASPS,"Roth and DeNiro produce an excellent 'mood piece' on the formation of the OSS and it's offspring, the CIA. To that point, Navy Intelligence handled most of the chores, as Navies established themselves are the go-to sources and operatives.DeNiro used the decade well that he mulled this one over, and he got most of it right, especially the reserved tones of East Coast involved in early intelligence ops . . . contrasting with their bizarre Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas. Roth and DeNiro show they grasp the sub rosa issues via clues like 'The Whiffenpoof Song' and 'Michael Row the Boat Ashore'. There is much more going on in this film than the standard, car chase, action oriented entertainment. Roth and DeNiro are making some astute and sweeping grokkings of America, both its international relevance and its domestic, ah, non-tranquillity.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Way Too Long,"The Good Shepherd was way too long. You would think with Robert DeNiro directing the movie, maybe it would be good. The first hour was just dragging out without anything happening, though you are wishing so hard for something to happen. Then something finally happened in the second hour but it wasn't enough to keep your interest. The love story with the son and the spy was unnecessary. Even the love story with the main characters is unconvincing. I just don't see how the son ended up working for the CIA, especially as an undercover agent. His acting was just hideous. There are too many questions left unanswered. I would not recommend anyone wasting $11 to see this. If you really want to, wait until it comes out on DVD.",2.0,Anonymous,History
"Somewhat miscast, but fascinating none the less","The Good Sheperd is a massive accomplishment. It's multi layered script incorporates the rise (and rise) of the US intelligence service after WWII. From the early OSS to today's CIA, it tries to shed light on not only the intelligence-counter intelligence game, but also the men and women behind the covert world. The thing that stayed with me after watching this film is that once you enter this world you never leave. And that may sound clichÃ©, it's still unbelievable to me how much the main character is willing to sacrifice in order to keep doing what he thinks he does best.The 'old boys' network is what defined the early days of the OSS and although it's not very explicit in this film, the attentive viewer can get the somewhat elitist way of thinking and acting from these agents/spies. The way of thinking is very important I think, because it defined our recent history.This film is a long time pet-project of DeNiro and I can see why. It has everything in it: suspense, morally challenging, lost love in the 'what if'-category and very good written characters. Top it of with a very good supporting cast and greatness is in it's grasp, but it just falls short of it. I blame the casting of Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie for this.I like Matt Damon in action films. He has the presence for it. Just look at the Bourne-films. But, like Mark Wahlberg, his range is far too narrow to play complicated characters. A remark made in the excellent TV-series Entourage comes to mind: 'You're a movie star, but that does not mean you're a good actor.' Damon should play into his strengths and keep doing action films. Matt Damon is miscast as the silent, somewhat nerdy main character. Damon never finds the right tone of voice, never the right look and never the right rhythm of his character. I am not a fan of Billy Cudrup, but when the two are in the same frame it's a perfect example of an actor totally in sync with his character and one that is not.Just like Alexander, Jolie is also totally miscast in a role that does not suit her. Her greatest strength is her vamp-like attraction with a girlish tenderness (or maybe a hidden vulnerability) that is very, very rare in Hollywood. You have to let her play a role that suits her qualities best and the neglected, stay-at-home mom she plays here is totally unbelievable for me. Her emotional scenes become almost laughable when I think the opposite reaction was intended. I think the role of Laura would have suited her more.Again, I think it's a fantastic film. It's a great accomplishment to make an interesting 2-somewhat hour movie with this much detail and information. The production design, the cinematography, the script and the supporting cast are excellent. For a not so experienced director, DeNiro does a fantastic job because he has made the decision to make the film and not to make 'a Film by Robert DeNiro'. His directing hand is invisible, and this is a hard thing to do when you have all the power. Just take a look at characters in this movie.I give it 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"""  What  do  you  call  a  group  of   retarded Children,  born of   1st  Cousins ? ""","Anyone interested in learning the origins of the infamous C.I.A. this movie would be a good beginning. The film, by and large is a superficial, albeit, a glorified version of the creation of the nation's spy agency. Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is a quiet, but introspective student at prestigious Yale University, when, due to him being white, male and confirmed breeding, is sought out for membership in the secretive, nefarious and primarily bigoted organization called 'Skull and Bones. ' This eventually leads to being further recruited into the pre-cursor of the CIA with the creation of the military's Office of Strategic Services or O.S.S. The secretive agency is established to clandestinely gather information on enemy countries, individuals, liberal groups and thereafter to serve as a covert Counter-Intelligence agency abroad and when necessary, in the U.S. Wilson becomes a dedicated agent who willingly sacrifices his private life, emotional ties and even his own son to achieve specific goals. Though the movie is difficult to follow both story and characters played brilliantly by Alec Baldwin, Billy Crudup, Robert De Niro, Keir Dullea, Michael Gambon and William Hurt attest to it's success.

Poor Casting,"This film has one of the WORST casting jobs I have ever seen! Matt Damon is TOTALLY wrong for the part! Even though he is 36 years old he still looks like he is fresh out of High School. Eddie Redmayne, who plays his son in the film is only 12 years younger than Damon and in the role looks more like his brother than son. It was disconcerting to enjoy the film in the scenes where they were together.In addition Angelina Jolie was also miscast. I kept expecting her to don a 'super hero' costume and fly.When will film makers of today get it that the glamor stars of today DON'T belong in serious films where character is more important than glamor?One more thing........

...and that's good is it?,"3 hours? It felt like 6! Being a huge De Niro and Damon fan, I had no hesitation in departing from my hard earned Â£6.80 and entering the cinema in the assumption I was about to witness a theatrical masterpiece. It started slow but I was sure the pace would pick up as the film progressed. ""Once upon a time in America"" was close to 4 hours in length, yet I loved every minute of it. I didn't mind the pace being slow because I was sure, if it remained slow there will be some kind of twist at the end which would give the audience a little enjoyment...but no. It's still OK, It doesn't matter that the film is slow and there is no twist as long as the breathtaking acting is there!...but no, it really isn't. I can assure you that Matt Damon's' expression/emotion doesn't change throughout the entire movie. This is not his fault, he is a talented actor, maybe the person he's playing is supposed to only hold one emotion but that really is not entertaining to watch.After the 5th hour I decided I'd try and catch a bit of sleep, this is when it really was effective. If you suffer from insomnia, my guaranteed cure is this film. I didn't sleep for long because of the lollipop sticks being thrown at my head but this was only because of my fellow cinema goers disinterest in the film also. I wasn't alone! We all hated it.Save yourself money and do NOT go see this film! If you like this film you are quite literally insane!",1.0,Anonymous,History
Great movie with great message!,"This is one of the most moving movies I've seen recently. I read some of the reviews here and most of those who were disappointed were probably expecting a story about establishment of the CIA. Actually, this is a story about humans. A story about how NOTHING is worth your life, your dignity and your family. Not even your country. Maybe it came out at the wrong time, during Bush's ""patriotism for oil"" campaign, but Bush will go and this movie will stay. I guess it will be more important in a decade or so than it is now, just like Syriana. The strange (and also the great) thing is that the main character is actually not even sad or disappointed in the end, everything that happened is totally normal for him, but the viewers got the message.

A horrible movie going experience,"I go to the movies several times a month and I've always loved sitting in a theatre rather than renting a movie to watch at home. However, I'm beginning to be disappointed in some of Hollywood's most recent efforts. The Good Shepherd is the most recent example. First of all, I can think of few stories that take THREE HOURS to tell. I thought it would never end. I heard lots of disgruntled comments as people left the theatre, and I noticed a lot of people get up during to the movie to go to the restroom or to get a snack.The film is mostly boring conversations between two people. What happened to ""Show, don't tell."" This film was all tell, tell, and tell. Matt Damon, one of my favorite actors, was reduced to being a bloodless, cardboard figure. Who would want to get involved with such a wooden protagonist? And why did Angelina take the part of his wife? It was a one note part. And the young men who played the son - first as a child and then as a 20 something, were creepy. The young kid reminded me of the boy in the remake of The Omen. Why cast pale, nerdy people? I'm 58, so I remember the Bay of Pigs, and My dad taught me the words to ""The Whippenpoof Song"" when I was a little, girl, but this film did NOT hold my interest at all. We would have walked out after an hour, but we already walked out on The History Boys the week before. I was so disappointed in Robert DeNiro. He'd better stick to acting. Directing is not his gift.Do not go and see this film. It's terrible.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"For those who can identify with Wilson, this is cinematic gold","Walking into a showing of the Good Shepherd on its' opening Friday, I was instantly a bit miffed at the ""mainstream-ness"" of the crowd. Sure, the likes of Damon, Jolie, and DeNiro meant a good opening weekend, but I knew exactly what these people were in for. Judging from interviews and reviews I had read before going, I knew that this movie would be severely lacking in the car-chases and shootouts that many people seem to have tacked on as a necessity to any ""spy"" movie. This isn't to say that its unwillingness to show these made it good, far from it, but I at least knew that Deniro was going to try and remain faithful to what it was (probably) like to be one of the founding members of the CIA.The key to this movie, and that which has split audiences and critics alike, is Damon's portrayal of Edward Wilson (drawn from the real life James Angleton). Those who dislike the performance will call the character a boring, dispassionate fellow, while some (like me), think of him as anything but. Damon may be silent throughout much of the movie, but the character he portrays is a calculating, distant, and very clever man who depends on secrecy in order to keep himself out of danger. These qualities were what instantly made me identify with him, and in a way, envy him. Sure nobody wants to be a lifeless drone, but the passion (albeit subdued) that drives this man to sacrifice for the good of his country is admirable.If you feel the same way, then this movie will undoubtedly sweep you up within the first five minutes. Give it a try, one thing thats for sure is that this is without a doubt the most realistic movie about the CIA ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,History

One of the best of 2006,"The history of the CIA by way of one man who ""was there"". This is the story of Edward Wilson (based upon James Jesus Angelton) who joined the intelligence services prior to the second World War and was there at the start of the CIA. This story goes from Wilson's time in college until the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs. This is a long involved story and its easily one of the best films of 2006.I won't try to sum up the film which begins at the Bay of Pigs and then flashes back through Wilson's life. I will say that enjoyment of the film will depend upon how one reacts to Matt Damon as Wilson. Damon is excellent in what is a tough role. Its a tough because Wilson is essentially a cypher, he barely says a word and when it does its usually to give orders or for some piece of business.Indeed when Wilson does open up or show emotion it usually costs him dearly. Wilson's cold icy demeanor is what makes him the perfect spy. Actually just being in the business costs him too much as we witness over the cost of the film.I liked it, with the film drawing me in and wanting to see what happens next. Nit picker that I am the only real problem with the film is the lack of aging of Matt Damon which makes it difficult sometimes to know when we are in Wilson's life since he always looks the same.Definitely worth a look, though I won't guarantee you'll be as rapturous as I am because of the cypher at the center of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"It's a downright despicable dirty and deadly business, but someone's got to do it!","***SPOILERS*** Confusing story about the founding of the CIA through the eyes of one of it's founding fathers head of counter-intelligence Edward Bell Wilson, Matt Damon. Getting everything ready for the big assault on Castro's Cuba the meticulously planned attack goes haywire as some 1,500 Cuban exiles and dozens of American mercenaries are caught flat footed and routed by Castro's army and home militia in the swamps and beaches off the infamous ""Bay of Pigs"".Feeling that their operation, CIA code name Zapata, was compromised by someone higher up in the chain of leadership and it would result in the dismantling of the agency, by an outraged and embarrassed President John F. Kennedy,a piece of information gets delivered to Wilson's home. An envelope containing an audio tape and grainy photo of a couple making out in a hotel room. In that tape and photo is the person, a CIA man, who compromised the ""Bay of Pigs"" assault. Also in photo is the communist spy who delivered that vital information, via the Soviet Union's KGB, to Castro.As Edward Wilson and his team of CIA electronic and film specialists mill over the tape and photo we get a number of flashbacks of his life in the CIA that started back in 1939. We see the 20 year-old Edward as a student at Yale joining the super secretive Skull & Bones Society. Edward was recruited, like many other Bonesmen, by General Bill Sullivan, Robert De Niro,to serve his country in war as well as peacetime as an undercover spy. Edward's social life as a Bonesman is upended when he's gotten drunk at a Skull & Bones party gathering at Deer Island. It's there where he's seduced by a hot to trot Clover Russell, Angelina Jolie, Edwards best friend and fellow bones-man John Russell, Gabriel Macht, horny sister.Edwards who was having an affair with hearing impaired Laura, Tammy Blanchard, had to cut it short when he found out, from her brother John, that Clover was pregnant and was forced into a shotgun wedding. In the end that not only resulted in the birth of his one and only child Edward Jr,Eddie Redmayne, but also his driving Clover, now calling herself Margaret, almost to a nervous breakdown. This all happened some 18 years later when he met, at a play, and rekindled his relationship with Laura.By the film jumping from the ""Bay of Pigs"" fiasco to Edward's past in his rise in the CIA you start to lose your footing getting a feeling of lost time as you can't differentiate between the past and the present. Theresalso the fact that Edward Wilson never seems to change looking like he hasn't aged at all in over 22 years. We get to see a number of double-crosses assassinations and regime changes that Edward was involved in over the years. His biggest boner, from this Bonesman and CIA chief, being his allowing a KBG operative Valentin Mironov, John Session, to get asylum in the US and having him feed the CIA false information in what, the then almost unknown, Fidel Castro was really all about. The US ended up giving Castro military equipment to overthrow the Betista regime in Havana only to have it be replaced with a Soviet satellite just 90 miles off the coast of Key West Florida!We later find out that this KGB agent Mironov, code name Cold, was probably one of two Soviet spies, with the unknown woman in the grimly photo being the other, who tipped off the Cuban Communists about the ""Bay of Pigs"" invasion! When the truth comes out about another KGB agent, Mark Ivanir, also calling himself Mironov who gave himself up to the CIA in order to get asylum. Instead of being debriefed Mironov II was brutally beaten and tortured, by the gleeful and sadistic CIA investigator Ray Brocco ,John Torturro. Mironov II going completely wacko from what he was put through jumps out a ten story window killing himself. It turned that this Mironov was the real deal not the Mironov working with the CIA all these years. In the end this goof-up not only got Edward in hot water with his superiors the President and CIA Director but also his son Edward Jr as well. Edward Jr while taking a bath overheard pop planning the attack with a number of his CIA friends. Edward Jr later ended up spilling what he knew as he was making out with his girlfriend Miriam, Liya Kebede, the woman in both the mysterious tape and photo that Edward Sr received. It turned out that it was Edward Jr who was responsible for the disastrous ""Bay of Pigs"" invasion. The photo, and audio tape, that Edward mysterious got was to have him blackmailed by the KBG into doing it's bidding by selling out his country.Very hard to follow spy film with people popping up and then disappearing so fast that you don't even have time to get their names much less find out what their doing in the movie in the first place. The film has a mindless and unbelievable ending that tries to make everything, that you saw up until them, look good for the very dull and almost asleep Edward Wilson It does that by having him not have to turn in Jr for his stupidity in letting the cat, the assault on Castro's Cuba, out of the bag. Yet at the same time have him break up a secret KGB ring inside the CIA that he, together with that vicious thug Brocco, brainlessly allowed to infiltrate!",5.0,Anonymous,History

Should have been an Oscar contender,"""The Good Shepherd"" is billed as the story of how the CIA began in 1961, but it is really the story of Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) and his involvement in the first covert wing of the CIA.In his third attempt at directing, Robert De Niro captures the nature of the cold hearted spy with such precision that he seems much more comfortable in the details but less interested in keeping the story gripping. Ironically, this is the exact opposite of the main character Edward Wilson, who keeps his eye on the big picture but misses the small moments he should have noticed, such as, his family.Nonetheless, ""The Good Shepherd"" is a great movie that tells us that in a world of lies, cheats and deceits, the one who survives is the one who trusts less, loves less and lives less. Consequently, the main character chooses to stay, and through symbolisms it becomes apparent that Edward Wilson is not able to move on and is trapped and alone in his own world of secrecy. With that, the audience is left with something to reflect on.Matt Damon does an excellent job by tackling the role of Edward Wilson with such coldness and dedication, in an aloof fashion. This is one of the best roles I've seen him perform.A movie that should have been a definite Oscar contender. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History

All-star cast stumbling through winded script,"Robert De Niro got many of his A-list friends to appear in his second movie as a director. But only one stands out from the all-star cast: Alec Baldwin in the part of Sam Murach, a covert recruiter for the intelligence community. He has only half a dozen short scenes, but thanks to his iceberg approach, his performance is by far the most memorable all the same. Nearly everybody else's acting feels clumsy, and the storytelling is spectacularly cumbersome, bringing back long-suppressed memories of Oliver Stone's ""JFK"". In fact, this is worse: 90 minutes into the movie, you don't even know what it's about. Nevertheless, it's a good-looking picture. I particularly enjoyed how the ferry, evacuating Edward's wife from the Skull & Bones retreat, dissolves into the night-time mist, how Murach stands shrouded in tobacco smoke at the recital, and how Wilson Senior's suicide note finally goes up in flames. Having said that, there is also a very unsettling torture scene that might help change the minds of those who think water-boarding is just another interrogation technique.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Here is a broad characterization of the men who make up the C.I.A as told through the eyes of one of its founding members Edward Wilson (as played by Matt Damon, an actor I am gaining more appreciation for since he has shed the dead weight of Ben Afleck). Although a fictional character, he brings an honesty to the part, and really makes this a fascinating man to watch as he matures from his isolated, almost family devoid days as a college student, to his recruitment into the OSS during war time, and his furthering his emotional detachment from all while engaging the Soviet counterparts.",10.0,Anonymous,History

An actor centered movie,"A common mistake actors turned directors make is to do films that focus on the acting, on the performance of the individual actor, rather than the story. This is a long two hours and a half of exceptional acting, but when it ends you end up asking yourself what the hell was that all about. Even if the subject is based on a true character and the approach is realist enough, the film is very hard to watch without getting bored. But it is a very good film, nonetheless.A great thumbs up to Matt Damon, I think he deserves an Oscar for this, even if other actors would have played this role a lot more easily than, I guess, he did. The film itself shows actors to be very old. It spans 22 years or more and the young become old and older actors like Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci look ancient. Can you remember the guy that plays a few scenes as an old Mafia boss playing in Home Alone? Geez, time passes quickly.Anyway, a lot of good actors played in this movie, but that doesn't mean they had roles to match. Angelina Jolie plays the ""got me a husband by getting pregnant"" role, quite well I would say, but she isn't very center stage. Joe Pesci, Robert de Niro, William Hurt, Timothy Hutton, they all played a few scenes in the movie. This is not a one man film, but it is damn close to one.Bottom line: it is worth a watch, but you must be in the mood. Not a popcorn and laughs film.

Unless of course you read lips, or maybe you could get a copy and re-play it over and over again to decipher what's being said. I guess DeNiro knew what was being said. But he read the script. How about sub-titles for the rest of us Bobby. It's a laborious effort about some CIA dweeb whose good at taking orders. He loves America, he says, and I guess he's disillusioned.

"Brilliant, if intensely slow, depiction of the cold, emotionless side of government.","It took me months to get around to watching the Good Shephard, even after I bought the DVD, mostly because of the prohibitive running time, and despite the fact that this is a good, solid, smart production, and I know that films that approach three hours with a cast of this caliber are generally some of the best ones released each year. It's an unflattering portrayal of the underbelly of government, particularly formation and initial troubles of CIA, and all of the betrayal and lack of trust that is inevitably involved.At the moment, I am considering what major to pursue for my Master's degree, and I have toyed with the idea of getting a Master's that will be conducive to a career in the CIA, but every time I see a movie like this it makes me rethink the idea. Maybe I should stick to Jack Ryan movies. But for the record, this is directed by Robert DeNiro, and that is just cool, man. The only other movie that he ever directed was A Bronx Tale, 15 years ago (""Now you's CAN'T leaveÂ…"").The film is overflowing with cryptic, secretive talk, particularly at the beginning, which may be a little confusing for some viewers, at least until you realize that it's that confusing just to show you how deep their security is. No one really seems to talk about what they're really talking about, and they run you around in circles a lot because you are not supposed to understand it all, you just need to understand that they are discussing top secret matters.Matt Damon, in one of his best (and definitely his most subdued) performances yet, plays Edward Wilson, a CIA agent who tragically was born without emotions, and so goes through almost the entire film without showing the slightest bit of feeling, except for a handful of rare moments. Sadly, because much of the story is told like that, the movie is absolutely as dry as a bone, but I also appreciate that it never shoots to be a popcorn thriller. Then we would have had a fifth Ryan film, and this is supposed to be non-fiction.There are several scenes that focus on the mysterious (and suspicious, if you ask me) club Skull and Bones, which supposedly boasts the membership of lots of people holding top positions in government and business, including the US Presidency, which is a little strange to me since it is so clearly just college fraternity. It's a goofy club where guys get drunk and perform bizarre rituals and have secret handshakes and they all stand up in unison when called upon to do so before meals. As adults (and wealthy, educated ones, at that), I would think that this childish nonsense would start to get a little embarrassing. Angelina Jolie's Margaret ""Clover"" Russelll certainly realizes the bone-headedness of it (""Bonesmen first, God secondÂ…""), but her exasperation goes nowhere. Then again, it's an intensely wealthy club with three piece suits (even when they're peeing on the new members, who are wrestling in mud) and a stunning retreat at Deer Island. No word on where all that money comes from. Maybe that's one of their secrets. At least girls are allowed though!At any rate, Wilson takes an assignment from CIA (just CIA, not ""the"" CIA, because, after all, you don't say ""the"" before God, do you?) that involves living in a foreign country for so long that he alienates his wife and his son grows up without him. The film's biggest achievement comes in a portrayal of how history repeats itself, which is presented well enough although also gives the movie an ominous meaning.Sadly, you may find it hard to keep up with the sheer number of brilliantly talented actors who are grossly underused here, as though there were so many people who wanted a part in this movie that they lined up and took whatever was offered, however small. Joe Pesci, one of the most conspicuous, shows up for a single scene and then disappears.Nonetheless, the movie treads dangerous ground in presenting the material that it focuses on, and I appreciate that it has the nerve to talk badly about some of the contradictions of our ""national security"" system (""I don't think either of us wants a REAL war. What would we do for a living then?""). There is also the presentation of a surprisingly interesting analysis of a mysterious short film, which the CIA analyzes with astonishing detail and which will become a crucial plot element later.I think the movie would have been easier to take if it had been shorter by about an hour, if only because I get the feeling that a good part of the reason that it is so long is because there are so many lingering scenes with little happening, something that Kurosawa was brilliant at, but that doesn't work quite as well here. History buffs are sure to appreciate the movie, although may also be put off by any inaccuracies. For the rest of us, if nothing else, you can always keep your eyes peeled for the quick peeks at some great actors who pass by throughout the movieÂ….",8.0,Anonymous,History
Would've Been Better as a Mini-Series,"I had heard in reviews that there was not much action in this study of a man who kept his life a secret. I also read that the tone of this film was akin to ""Smily's People"", a famous mini-series about spying during the cold war. While watching this lengthy history of Ed Wilson and the CIA, I was disappointed how it seemed each setup cutaway before we could really absorb what was going on. Then I realised the problem, this should have been a mini- series. The essential problem was trying to cover such a huge amount of history, but forced to stay focused on our main character. This caused the screenplay to hack off the meat of the material just to be able to follow the single arc of Mr. CIA. At the very least, we should've been given more background to the supporting players. Also, even though it is certainly accurate how his wife was alienated, it made for repetitive and depressing screen time. I think one mistake was casting such a mega-star with so much luggage and such huge lips. It made it impossible for me to buy Angelina Jolie as the wife, it would have been better to cast someone a little less well known.So I have many major complaints about this film, but only that I wish the screenplay was structured to supply more depth into what the heck Wilson was doing, and less into an uninteresting domestic life that goes nowhere. We are shown more than enough to get it. Also, in this day and age of much gripping portraits of the underworld (""Syriana""), this approach of 'less-is-less' film-making is a couple decades out of date.Update 9/6/2012: Showtime is now developing this movie into a series. Thanks for taking my advice!",4.0,Anonymous,History
Under-rated spy flick,"It's a very good film. Matt Damon's performance here is one of his best. Many talented actors are in this picture, but only one is this picture.

Engrossing spy saga despite some flaws,"The good Shepherd is a solidly directed and engrossing spy saga. It recounts the early years of the CIA through the eyes of one man Edward Wilson, played well by Matt Damon. Damon is a bit muted though, and for some odd reason he doesn't age even though the film follows his life for more than twenty years. Angelina Jolie is decent but somewhat miscast. Several incidents in the film appear based on real events and the period recreation is impeccable. Michael Gambon is good in a somewhat poorly explained role. John Turturro is underused. Despite some flaws, the film is well worth watching.Overall 7/10",,Anonymous,History

From the first moments of the film, we are intrigued by our look into one of the secret societies of Ivy League universities, and their influences on American society. Matt Damon's character is strangely static throughout the film...or is it? This is a film of subtlety and innuendo, a film you will have to see at least twice to understand entirely. Angelina Jolie gives us a surprising look into her abilities as an actress. Gone is the determined, focused, independent woman we have seen in so many of her films. Alec Baldwin provides an element of stability in a film where nothing remains the same.

Did not like old times either, something I have difficulty understanding and do not like old cars, buildings, lifestyles. Everything is so deep, dramatic, and negative. As if crime and conspiracy can be felt as a constant noise in the background. Like only few small negative actions which look adventuristic and makes me concerned for a moment, while all the other times I was bored and tired, waiting for movie to finish and stop wasting my time.

Simply a series of disrelated Anecdotes - No plot,"What a disjointed story!!! I was very disappointed in ""The Good Shepherd"". This film is simply a series of anecdotes as Edward recalls his life and involvement in the CIA via a series of disjointed flashbacks. The film has no continuous plot to draw one through.If one is simply looking for disrelated data about the CIA or Mr. Wilson, then this might be just the film. I sat through it and kept hoping that one of these anecdotes would lead to some plot development, but they never did. Each anecdote simply ended with the end of that flashback. Then Wilson comes back to present time before he flashes back to another disrelated anecdote.This might be just fine for someone that simply wants to see disrelated data about the CIA & Mr. Wilson, but it's not very entertaining. Matt Damon & Angelina Jolie do their jobs just fine. They are fine actors and do well here as much as the non-script will allow them. DeNiro appears and gives a fine performance in his short role. Alec Baldwin is less impressive, but also appears in only a minor role. What can you expect since there is no continuity? No PLOT!!!

Movie with a potential to have been great,"To the guy spotting the goofs on this movie's IMDb presentation page: Martina Gedeck, who played Hanna Schiller was not wearing any hearing aids in this movie. The name of the actress wearing hearing aids was Tammy Blanchard (who played Laura.)The movie was really long and hard to watch. On two attempts, were it not for my girlfriend, I was about to leave. De Niro is a great actor, but not a great director. There was not much point in putting all these resounding names in, when some of them only had one or two retorts to say in the whole insurmountably long movie. (Joe Pesci only saying a few words reminds a little of Ocean12, when Bruce Willis says ""Hi, I'm Bruce Willis"".(?) Matt Damon is also so much better in thrillers. He is one of my favorites as far as action movies where he plays the 'heroic' type, but not for the white collar face that you forget once you pass it by. Sure, I am glad to see him trying different sort of things, but would much rather see him running in Berlin than a white-collar guy.",4.0,Anonymous,History
"Good flick, worth the watch, AJ slightly overkill for her part","At first I thought the film was a little slow at times, but it fed into the feeling that spying is a slow, bureaucratic and mundane world where efforts can span years and decades. Without a doubt, a great film in terms of cinematography, settings, score and the overall acting of the cast.My only issue was the casting of Angelina Jolie as the Clover Wilson. Angelina gave a good performance as a lonely, frustrated wife shut out of Edward Wilson's (Matt Damon) life of secrets at the CIA. However, this was undercut somewhat because she just outshines the rest of the women cast in the looks department. At times you are suppose to believe Damon/Jolie are in a loveless marriage and have not found each other sexually attractive in years. Yeah... right.. I am sure that casting Angelina was an excellent business decision. She adds marquee value to the film and probably brought in more fans and revenue. However, a slightly less glamorous skilled actress would have been a more believable casting of the part.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Stodgy spying,"I cannot understand the positive reviews - the writing, acting, direction - all sadly lacking. Oh - and the editing (although the editor was no doubt following the script which jumped back and forth between time periods).
Straight forward - it is not.
With very few exceptions, the acting is sadly lacklustre.
This film purportedly attempts to show the origins of the Central Intelligence Agency. There was a slight movement towards a documentary approach - then the writer goes wildly off-key towards the end. Incredible, unbelievable final act with one character being dispatched 'highly' unrealistically for the sake of fake excitement.
The Bond movies have done a good job of being totally unrealistic - but others have shown that intelligence work can be portrayed in an interesting and exciting fashion.
A movie covering the origins and (within security concerns) operations of the CIA has yet to be made.

One mistake was the use of Angelina Jolie, she is a terrible actress and is very over-rated. both in her acting skills and her supposed good looks. the lead actor Matt Damon is a very capable actor but i felt that since his 'bourne' roles he is more suited to play roles that involve a bit more action.

Fiction that is history,"In skimming through most of these reviews what is missed is that while this script is fiction, it is based on fact. The Damon character is clearly a portrayal of James Jesus Angleton even though his name here, is ""Edward Wilson.""Characters are similarly based on real individuals. Others like the William Sullivan role that DeNiro (the director) himself played was Wild Bill Donovan the real former Medal of Honor winner who started the OSS at the request of FDR.So was it necessary that the viewer have the historical perspective to enjoy this film? No, it's good enough to stand on its own. However it did help to be aware of the enormous factor that the Damon character had on post-WWII history in the person of the very real James Angleton.There has been talk of a sequel and I have a script which centers on the year 1967. It would be political dynamite. I would love to see DeNiro do it but it
would be very hard to get made, believe me.One more thing about the movie. DeNiro made a visually beautiful film. It adds a kind of dream-like quality to the stark realities of the Cold War script.

An amazing film... kudos Deniro,"DeNiro's film does a great job covering Edward Wilson's role in the early history of the CIA. This historical film is both remarkable in its seriousness, unbiased point of view and well written for the screen. The acting is first rate and i thought Damon nailed the role with the right amount of emotion or lack of as he was dealing with a very complicated character. Sure at times it feels a bit long, but that was a given with the way DeNiro approached this project, its not an action film or a comedy, but for the genre, its perfect in my eyes and one of my favorite films.

You must have a paper and pencil to record all the dates and times to remember when things happened.And saying that this film is a thriller..... well, depends of course of the definition of thriller.

A Fantastic Espionage/Spy Flick -- Just Don't Look For James Bond,"It's amazing that this film is so highly regarded, especially since we have Matt Damon as the lead character. Damon isn't known for his exciting acting abilities (with the exception of GOOD WILL HUNTING which I consider his quasi-breakout role). He's established himself as Jason Bourne in the BOURNE IDENTITY franchise, but that doesn't take much acting ability and is almost purely a physical job. His character in the OCEAN'S series just seems to go through the motions. He's had limited success in films like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and THE DEPARTED. I say ""limited"" because it was the other characters and screenplay that brought him recognition more than his own abilities (try imagining Saving Private Ryan without Tom Hanks or The Departed without Leonardo DiCaprio and you'll see what I mean.) So I wasn't drawn to this flick simply because I knew Damon was our main man. But I was wonderfully surprised.Damon was the perfect choice for this role, and that isn't necessarily a compliment. His portrayal of Edward Wilson is flat, ineffectual, and unremarkable, just like the character was supposed to be. Just like many of Damon's previous portrayals. It is this absurd, unemotional character that drives the entire film, and thanks to director/actor Robert DeNiro's relentless pursuit of this movie (it was his pet project for over ten years) we have a gem.Beginning with Robert Kennedy's disastrous Bay of Pigs debacle, the film shows Ed Wilson (Damon) trying to overcome an American/Cuban historical event that many find shameful. The CIA had a leak somewhere that blew the entire assault, and Wilson has to find out who and how. It will take him back to the very beginnings of the CIA, pre-WWII, and then slowly catch up to the1960's.Battling the Cold War with a very worthy Russian opponent, Ed must come to grips with the death of his father (who was an OSS spy in WWI), the loveless relationship with his wife (played by Angelina Jolie), and what he's prepared to do for his son (Eddi Redmayne) when he learns of ignorant betrayal from within.The film really looks at the development of the CIA, how it came to be, what spying is REALLY like (not James Bond-ish), and one man's unwavering support for his country. Dark corners are everywhere, including Ed Wilson's own home. Life and business blur. Separating the man from the mission becomes impossible. A panoply of scenes greets each moment of Ed's life, from the shadowy corners of Post-WWII Berlin to the recesses of his home sanctuary. It's an incredible display with truly gripping photography and a frightening descent into the world of phantom spies.A powerhouse cast graces the screen, with fine performances from such greats as John Turturro (THIRTEEN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ONE THING), Joe Pesci and William Hurt (SYRIANA).Surprisingly THE GOOD SHEPHERD has made it up to one of my all-time favorite spy films. But a warning call must be sound here. This isn't your typical spy flick. It won't be for everyone. But if you like to think about where the CIA came from and how espionage jobs really work, this one will be high on your list, too.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A spy story about the scams perpetrated by the master-manipulator nation on Earth. And the web of lies spun to hide their actions.Funny thing about a shepherd. He tends his flock, protects them from wolves while they graze and fatten. You'd be forgiven thinking they do good alone. But do you know what else a shepherd has to do? He has to lead his lambs to slaughter. He has to pluck them from their mother's teat, screaming and kicking, bleed them out with a gash through their throat, skin and then roast them over an open fire for dinner while he waits for the sheep to make wool.

He is an excellent actor, so I can only assume the director was misguided himself. Wilson is suppose to fall apart through the course of the movie, but shows almost no change. The on-screen titling becomes annoying.

An Intellectual and Somber Spy Movie,"6 January 2007. This underplayed movie is a strong spy drama that captures the ethical, relational, and mental dilemmas facing the dark secrets of espionage over decades. It is commendable that this all-star cast performed with serious and uncharacteristic underperformance that requires the best acting. The somber, slow pacing focused on the twists and turns, the uncertainties, and the pitfalls of the high stakes game. Great acting and solid plot configuration. With the exception of the lack of a completely satisfying character development and fulfilling character interaction within Matt Damon's character's family and the somewhat loose ends of the movie, The Good Shepard is among the best of the year. Eight out of Ten Stars.Updated review. Matt Damon and Angelina Jolie star in this dark dramatic portrayal of one man's transformation as an agent during the formative years of the Central Intelligence Agency up through to the invasion of Cuba in the Bay of Pigs. This is character-driven, cerebral movie is thought-provoking with its underlying reflective nature of the inhumanity of employment, particularly in the field of espionage. This movie also delves into the elitist society of the upper-crust of America, the obligations and conflicts and sacrifices of duty, of marriage, and even love. By the end of The Good Shepard, questions of what is ""good"" and the metaphysical meaning of living one's life have been laid bare.Of the various subgenres, blockbuster action as such Casino Royale (2006) Mission: Impossible (1996) True Lies (1994) or comedy Red (2010) Get Smart (2008) Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997) Spy Kids (2001) Casino Royale (1967) Agent Cody Banks (2003) Spies Like Us (1985) Our Man Flint (1966) Undercover Blues (1993) or sophisticated action State of Play (2009) The Kingdom (2007) Ronin (1998) La Femme Nikita (1990) Billion Dollar Brain (1967) or The Three Days of Condor (1975), The Good Shepard falls into the dramatic category along the likes of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011) Topaz (1969) The Tailor of Panama (2001) Eye of the Needle (1981) The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965) The Ipcress File (1965) The Fourth Protocol (1987) The Russia House (1990). The movie also presents a fascinating use of and difficult but well executed editing of the movie with a lot of flashbacks revealing two parallel time streams as they both chronological unfold showing Matt Damon's growth as a young child who experiences his father's mysterious revelation and a letter that he keeps for himself into an intelligence agent and the sequence of events surrounding the Bay of Pigs and its aftermath in the intelligence community. What makes this movie stand out is its extensive focus on the psychological profile and character development of a single individual, the impact of his job on his relationships that are solidly depicted as much so as in A Man and A Woman (French, 1966), American Beauty (2000) and family dynamic found in The Tree of Life (2011) and his morals as found in Breach (2007) or The Falcon and the Snowman (1985). The Good Shepard presents an even greater existential angst than the personality focused The Wrestler (2008) with an echo of Chinatown (1974) but with even more somber seriousness, though not as emotional shocking or wrenching as William H. Macy's descent in Edmond (2006 - released in 2005) and accompanying Christian Slater in He Was a Quiet Man (2007), or as surrealistic, or fantastic as Anthony Hopkin's Slip Stream (2007). Instead, Matt Damon's character might be more likened to the doctor in The King of Scotland (2006) or the unbalanced, tilted life of Robin William's character in One Hour Photo (2002) or the associated emotive ending of Angela Jolie's character in Changeling (2008) or surprisingly the closest resemblance coming in Gillian Anderson's dramatic and emotionally riveting performance in House of Mirth (2000). At the same time, there is an engaging and somewhat surprising extended investigative, analysis component that rivals or exceeds its more contemporary movies like Spy Game (2001). Matt Damon would get to unwind later in the rather wry comedic intelligence movie The Informant! (2009) playing a employee having to contend with the FBI.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Very boring and drawn out,"The film is definitely not portrayed as it is advertised in trailers. The film has no solid plot; rather it is just a series of boring and uninspiring subplots of the main character played by Matt Damon. All the characters are flat and maintain the same mindset from beginning to end. The film attempts to make you think and delve deeper into the protagonist's purpose; however, the film leaves you confused and restless. You wait for the movie to finally start, to reach its climax, or its pivotal scene. However, you will be disappointed. Also, the film's trailers are misleading. They advertise the film as the movie ""about how the CIA was started"", which sounds like an intriguing and exciting story. Unfortunately, the film actually just traces the life of an intelligent and mysterious operative working within the precursor to the CIA. One positive aspect of the movie is that it is complicated and forces the viewer to think; however, the intrinsic plot does not leave the viewer satisfied.",,Anonymous,History

Damon, Jolie, DeNiro, and Hurt did a very good job.This movie could have been shortened 20 minutes or so. There are several boring scenes that are not needed.

I stayed awake so as not to offend my pal Rebecca who took me to it, and entertained myself by wondering if the film was cleverly thematizing boring emptiness or just being boring and empty without meaning to. Sadly, there were no other signs of cleverness in the film, just ghosts of two decent ideas. One was about the effects of this post-war emptiness at the top of US society -that the deadliness of the US in the Cold War came less from necessary responses to real threats than from our own leaders' emotional exhaustion and intellectual emptiness (the USSR military is described as a sham by one would-be defector our hero Matt Damon has been busy torturing). This idea is like an object in one of the photos the techie spooks analyze that you can infer but never actually see. The second ghost of an idea came from my pal Rebecca, who recalled the film's only good line. Italian mobster Joe Pesci names a few things different US ethnic groups have and then asks the typically silent and inert Damon, ""what do you people have""? ""We have the United States of America,"" Damon replies. ""The rest of you are just visiting."" Rebecca said that this could have been a movie about the CIA as an agent of white supremacy. True, but it was just ghost #2.Some IMDb reviewers have complained about Jolie's performance, among others. I don't think any of the performances are bad as such - Jolie's is technically quite good - but there IS something wrong with the characters and their interactions. The film plays like a group vanity project in which Di Niro and crew put on an extra-long after-dinner skit for their wealthy liberal friends. They know things have gone bad in America, they don't like American foreign policy and all the dirty tricks and killing. But they don't know what went wrong, or why, or what to do about it. They especially don't think that they benefit from any of this killing - that the CIA has been quite handy at giving the U.S., a declining manufacturing and increasingly corrupt power, unfair advantages in the world, advantages that in turn lead to Hollywood and Wall Street's ridiculous wealth. Could part of America's problem be exactly this kind of mental passivity and actual indifference to democracy among the most privileged members of the middle class? Gosh! It raises a question I sometimes blog about on ""Middle-Class Death Trips"" - did we long ago trade in democracy and camaraderie with the rest of the world for the sake of unearned, coerced global privileges? Just like Damon's character, the movie isn't self-aware enough to ask any such question, and the result is really boring, all the big implications gone missing.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Very disappointed........,"I read many of the comments here, and finally had the time to see the movie last evening. The movie has the same tempo as Munich, which also received quite a bit of praise. This movie was similar in dullness and a creeping slow pace, contrived as art. Both are very average movies.Angelina Jolie was very poor.I'd rate for the rental version and save a few bucks.The photography and mood was very good.Too much time is spent on the Skull and Bones society......more than the CIA.Overall the movie tries to cover way too much territory, and ends up scraping the surface of each.The marriage problems, relationship between father and son, and some crucial but poorly conveyed ""spy"" details were extremely weak.",,Anonymous,History
"Excellent, subtle, powerful","I found it a challenge to follow closely, but well worth the attention. De Niro has done a masterful job directing, and every role is perfectly cast. Some may find it slow, but I'd say if you do it's just not your kind of movie. I was riveted to the screen. I read that Matt Damon studied Gene Hackman's performance in The Conversation in preparation for this role. I think it paid off in one of Damon's best performances, and that this film compares favorably with that masterpiece by Coppola. I read another review here that said something like, ""the film is as murky as the agency it depicts"". I'd agree, but I'd call that a plus.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Entertaining, but not really good","This film is timely, given all the media coverage of hidden CIA ""jails"" in other countries, etc, but it was actually not too good.The best part was the great Matt Damon performance --- similar to, but not as fine as, his performance in ""The Incredible Mr. Ripley"". In both films, he plays a man who hides 99 - 100% of who he really is. Very nice.Also well-portrayed was the clubby male world as nasty and competitive. Talk about the joys of putting other people down! Talk about being powerful and privileged, overfed and in love with yourself.BUT Angelina Jolie as the ultra-WASP? Puh-leez. She is just too different looking. As a woman who jumps the Matt Damon character and gets pregnant, and then wonders why her life is so unhappy? Puh-leez.This parody of Yale? Puh-leez. A completely false note. We don't need any more scorn cast on good schools and the world of intellect in this day and age. It is not Yalies that the USA needs to fear.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Finally a decent spy film from mainstream Hollywood.,"It's been a while. I thought the pacing was alright, spycraft is a slow business isn't it? If you're after fantasy ahem I mean action watch Bond or Bourne.This movie pays tribute to Le Carre's work: the succinct dialogue, delivered by a minimalistic Matt Damon. The cinematography is deliberately deceptive: there are moments in the film when you don't know the guy sitting behind is going to stab Wilson, or he is just an extra. Sometimes a look says a thousand words, but which words are truths?I do have one complaint: the female characters are sorely underdeveloped and all walking cliches. Other than that I've enjoyed this film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Waste of time...I'm not sure,"Well, I thought the movie was interesting...it did leaving you guessing but the problem was it never really answered the its on mysteries. It left you sitting there looking at the credits thinking, ""Was that it?"" I kept waiting for the big show to drop, for there to be a conclusion where it all made sense...it doesn't have that. Maybe because the CIA is really a mystery. I did think Matt Damon did a good job, but his acting reminded me of his work in the talented Mr Ripley. Jolie really had a bit part...she may have had 100 words in the whole movie. In fact I wasn't really sure of the point of her character except that she gave birth to his son. I think the main problem in this movie was the plot. You kept waiting for the climax...and you never really got it. I left the theater thinking, was this a waste of time??

Where's the Beef?,"The Good shepherd was almost a good film. It was too one dimensional. The camera never left Matt Damon, who wore the same stupid coat and hat throughout the entire film. This film was suppose to be about the CIA, but the director had cold feet and was inexperienced in giving the viewer a broad look of the daily operations of the agency. The atmosphere was like a story about a police officer who never left his room or only got filmed when he got home. Their needed to be far more destinations in this film to give us a global feel in the CIA combating the the enemies of the US. Almost three hours was wasted in what felt like filming the inside of a box; too much emphasis was placed on star power to carry this film. This film was so boring it hurt. I want my money back.",,Anonymous,History
3 hours too long,"This movie did not end.... I heard a comment on my way out of the movies...""Honey what time is it?""""Quarter to 4, why?""...

I don't know if this was the problem or not and I'm not sure if De Niro has done other movies like this. It was almost like the editor tried so hard to make past and present come to life that they forgot to edit down the movie.I thought the movie had a lot of potential and while it did tell a great story and reveal our history, it did not hold me attention.If you are a super history buff, you may hold this in higher regards but I believe the general public would rather label it as a documentary.Therefore I rate this a 4.",4.0,Anonymous,History
"Too long, too boring","Matt Damon is force-fit into character he doesn't resemble in the least where he overplays the CIA stereotype (though inaccurate portrayal) of a cold, expressionless robot. The movie jumps between decades continually -- confusing rather than reinforcing the story. In the end you get bored with the whole thing and give up trying to understand where the plot is going. It's just plain too long a movie for what they're trying to tell. Robert DeNiro picked the wrong horse to ride on in his bit part. The guy is normally a lead character so I can't imagine him settling for low billing. Alec Baldwin, on the other hand, is rightfully a perennial B-movie star so this is probably a step up for him.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Thank God I Read A Review,"I had reservations about this motion picture when I saw the cast, in which some names read like a roll call of left-wing ideologues on another tirade against the CIA. Then I read a review and I am glad I did not waste my money going to see this apparent travesty. It amazes me these days that the malcontents in tinsel town cannot turn out a decent film. I have to admit, I am more comfortable with the stars of the 1940s/1950s/1960s. I sincerely wish I could find something good to say about the stars of the new millennium but what I do see are basically a group of hopelessly narcissistic children caught up in a world of illusions, seeing themselves as ""pied pipers"" leading us to glory-land! Frankly, I would not follow them pass the front gate. There are some exceptions among the older group whom I admire for their acting ability and sense of propriety. It would appear to me that The Good Shepherd is just another gussied up anti-CIA film.",,Anonymous,History
Slow. Boring,"The story sounds good and full of promise. Somebody in the CIA leaked the Bay of Pigs plans to Castro. I'm in! That should easily fill 90 mintutes. Instead, it's just a series of random flashbacks about Edward. I wish it had stuck to the story. Oh well",4.0,Anonymous,History
"Excellent, but expects a lot from the viewer","This is an incredible movie, but it improves by a wide margin if you already know about the history of the CIA.The first time I watched it I was in high school and didn't really know anything about the murky history of the CIA. So i thought it was good--but i didn't really get it because the film goes somewhat quickly over certain aspects of the cold war intelligence agency. After i learned more about the history of the CIA (i.e. Operations in South America, MK ultra, OSS, the assassination of JFK (???)) this film changed entirely for me. It really becomes an engrossing, sometimes sympathetic, look at the occasionally terrible consequences of covert operations.It also takes care to show the personal cost of these activities on Damon's character, which humanizes the dark history of the CIA in a somewhat upsetting manner. He was an idealist at first, at the end he is...something else entirely.Definitely a must watch for anyone interested in the 20th century american history.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Wasted Opportunity,"What a missed opportunity to educate the world and especially Americans about the founding of the CIA and issues surrounding its operations, or into the psychology of one its early directors, for that matter! Instead we are offered nearly three hours of an inexpressive Wilson who gives us no clues as to what his own struggles are (although we can imagine them from the context), and apart from some details about the Bay of Pigs fiasco, we get only vague references to illegal Latin American CIA involvement and Cold War spying. Syriana did this important educative work much, much better and with much more entertainment value.",3.0,Anonymous,History
waste of time,"This movie was boring and confusing. I kept asking what was going on. It skipped back and forth through eras which made it hard to understand. The acting was good, but didn't help the movie in any way. I decided to see this movie based on the actors, and most of them had very small parts. Matt Damon doesn't seem to age at all, while everyone else does. Nothing is ever really explained. The movie may have been more tolerable if it wasn't 3 hours long. There was absolutely no action. It was all talking and if you don't know your history you wont understand anything. Overall, I was very disappointed. Great movie to watch if you want to ignore it and sleep or get ""fresh"" with a bf/gf.",2.0,Anonymous,History
The wolf in sheep's clothing ...,"A lot of reviewers here are drawing comparisons between The Godfather and this film. What's not pointed out often, if at all, is the closest comparison the lead characters have in common is they are both psychopathic. They both feel themselves to be above the law and both have no compunction about breaking the laws we little people try to live by, right up to and including murder. The film was well done, but I kept hoping at some stage someone would point out the movie's title was one of sheer sarcasm. However we reap what we sow. And what evil deeds justified in shadows then, we're seeing the fruits of now. The worst is that those in government committing these crimes no longer even see good reason to hide them. It left the same sensation as Lord of War did with the arms trade. The sensation of having to live in a world whose leaders have stared into the abyss for so long they now mirror its reflection.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Very boring,This is a staring contest. Someone asks Matt Damon's character and he stares off into space. Too many changes of dates and a very confused story line. This movie is about something but exactly what eludes me.The Whiffenpoofs are seen in some musical presentations but no good show of their talent is to be found here. The old cars look nice. Matt is supposed to age more than twenty years but that doesn't happen at all.This is not an entertaining film in my opinion. Lots of people here did like it. The one very good scene I recommend watching is the parachute scene near the end. How did they do that? My guess is the stunt is what cost the $90 million.,5.0,Anonymous,History
Robert deniro,"I am the biggest Robert Deniro fan on the face of this planet. If you wanna know anything bout deniro, its right here aright, come to poly and ill hook u up wit info. I tried to make myself like this movie sooo much. First of all it is a very slow movie and very very lengthy. I kept waiting for something big to happen to spark up my attention level but nothing happened. I was very disappointed with this film, as I expected something similar to goodfellas, casino, raging bull, although deniro did not direct those he starred in them so at least he would have an idea of where to compare to. Anyways, maybe this was just a bad first movie for deniro and there are better ones to come, or maybe deniro should stick to acting. Whatever the case is, at the end of the day you all know that deniro can act just watch the ""untouchables"" aright, howard beach aright, okay finooks, later",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Damon, De Niro and Friends, in a stylish spy film with a slow narrative.","As the Bible says, the good shepherd knows his sheep and jealously guards them. This is precisely what the CIA is trying to do, and what the protagonist of this film tried to do, despite having completely forgotten about his personal life, which gradually crumbles as time goes on and missions demand more and more of him. Robert De Niro is a remarkable actor, but I didn't know him as a director for the simple fact that he only directed two films (this one and one other). Even so, I recognize his ability. It's not a perfect film, it lacks a sense of rhythm and the editing could have been more ambitious. But I liked what I saw.The script is very good and tells the story of Edward Wilson, a brilliant young man, graduated from the best academies, with a sharp mind, a quiet personality and extraordinarily discreet and silent. Due to all these characteristics, he was recruited for Military Intelligence in the most intense years of World War II, later passing to the CIA, an organization that is in its beginnings and that will be decisive in the following years, during the Cold War. He's good at what he does, he's becoming more and more important within the Secret Service. However, his personal life is different: stuck in a personal code of honor, he abandons his love to marry a woman he doesn't know, but who is pregnant by him. Years later, he assumes great relevance in the failed Bay of Pigs. Being the target of his superiors' suspicions, he goes to the whistleblower who compromised the operation.The film tells an excellent story, but there are points less well executed: the first is the notion of the passage of time: we are not able to understand very well what happens in the 1940s and what happens afterwards, in the 1950s and 1960s. There is a lack of elements that help us to notice these temporal advances and setbacks, and Damon's expressionless face, always equal, doesn't help either, as if the character were incapable of aging. Another problem I felt is the slow pace, with inexplicably long scenes. Too many minutes could have been cut off on the editing table.Matt Damon is a good actor and gets an excellent job in this film, somewhat counterpointing the strong and charismatic action characters that the actor played at that point in his career, as in the ""Bourne"" franchise and in ""The Departed"". Here, he's discreet, reserved and silent, and he can really handle the film practically on his own. The rest of the cast only appears when they need it, but the strength of De Niro and Damon must have been enough to call the cast a huge roster of renowned stars, with firm credits and previous work with one, the other or both actors: Alec Baldwin, Joe Pesci, Michael Gambon, William Hurt, John Sessions, Eddie Redmayne, Oleg Stefan and Tammy Blanchard, just to name a few actors that appear in this film, even if it's only for a couple of good scenes. Everyone is giving their contribution, however modest, always in an honorable way. The one who seems a little out of place is Angelina Jolie. She has more than a couple of good scenes, but seems to be trying her hardest to stand out and get attention. I may be misjudging, but that's what I felt as I watched her work.Technically, it's a contained film, which leaves the narrative and the actors all the space they need to get our attention. There are no flashy effects or devices to distract or keep us entertained when the plot stumbles, because it doesn't. We have a confident cinematography, in which the demanding De Niro showed that he has a sense of framing and knows how to demand the best from the camera. It is a sharp film, with a good balance of colors and light, good depth and contrast. The sets and costumes are very good, but there are few elements that help us to realize the passage of time. There is not much use of visual, special or sound effects, but what was used has quality.",8.0,Anonymous,History
An interminable complex dirge,"I know that this is a well-reviewed movie, but sad to say, I did not like it. It simply tried to cover so many things. There were so many supporting characters (Robert de Niro, Alec Baldwin, Michael Gambon, Joe Pesci, etc) who seem to indistinctively blend into each other. There were too many subplots going on, and they were not shown in sequence. I know I should get used to this film technique by now. However, since the main character Edward Sr. (Matt Damon) did not age physically throughout the movie, it was more confusing. You know that more than 20 years have passed since Damon's son Edward Jr. was shown from his childhood to his wedding day. But when the son was an adult (played by Eddie Redmayne) already, Damon still looked like an elder brother. Angelina Jolie looked hopelessly miscast and uncomfortable as the wife.The film was very slow-paced, it felt like it was never going to end. It just went on and on, jumping from the 40s to the 60s featuring Edward Sr. and various characters in his life. There were only sporadic interesting subplots that catch your attention, but they were few and far between. The only likable character it seems is hearing-impaired girlfriend Laura (played by Tammy Blanchard). There was that very original scene on an airplane with Edward Jr.'s fiancÃ©e. And the interesting CSI-like investigation of a piece of film, done with period technology.But as a whole, for me, this whole movie felt like an interminable complex dirge--very draining to watch and not worth the long 167 minutes of time spent on it.",4.0,Anonymous,History
