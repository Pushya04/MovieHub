Funnier than the reviews,"Bad Teacher is funny in ways it shouldn't be. Cameron Diaz owns the role of Elizabeth as the foul-mouthed, pot smoking, trashy blonde teacher with a twisted outlook on life. Obscenities and bizarre sexual innuendo roll off her tongue perfectly. Justin Timberlake is hilarious and awkward as Scott. His character is complex and....well he's just awkward....there's no other way to describe it. Lucy Punch is the perfect counterpart to both Diaz and Timberlake's characters as Amy Squirrel. Her over-the-top performance is one you will remember. Jason Segel steals every scene he's in as Russell the equally foul mouthed and dirty gym teacher. Phyllis Smith is an adorable and strange addition to the movie as the confused Lynn Davis, bringing her own brand of corkiness to the plot. All in all, the casting of Bad Teacher is flawless and is really where the movie shines. The punchlines are delivered with punch and the characters are decently developed and complex in their own ways.There are some setbacks to Bad Teacher which stop it from being a great comedy. The plot devices used to move the story along are unconvincing and overplayed. Character transformations are equally unconvincing, uninspired, and rushed. Some scenes feel forced for the sake of cheap laughs or shock value. None of it though is shocking enough for this to be an effective method of comedy. Sometimes the characters feel a bit too weird even for the universe of strange the movie sets early on. Jason Segel's Russell is the most interesting character in the movie and yet for some reason is greatly underused. He pops up in pointless scenes simply to interject a laugh and then disappears for long stretches of time.Bad Teacher is a funny movie. The critics have not been so generous with their reviews, but who listens to them anymore anyways? If you are into dark comedies or a raunchy brand of humor, you will find yourself laughing with this one. While the plot devices are forced and some of the humor could have been better with a more subtle approach, overall this is a decent flick to chill out on the couch and laugh with. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Bad Teacher, Average Picture, Good review of the Picture","Just watched it. It's just a timepass movie, watch if you have enough time. We are at a lockdown here, so yeah completely free. It has many funny moments, and a story as well. I went in not expecting one. Turned out to be quite decent. The movie picks up brilliantly and the cast have done great job. The two top teachers are remarkable. Students could have been better had they learn from a great classic movie Kindergarten Cop!

Let's hope they paid the actors more than the writers.....,"Bad Teacher is a great concept that resulted in a style of humor like most of the Adult Swim cartoons you see today: When the jokes hit they hit well, but when they miss, they miss quite badly. The cast was delightful, but could only go so far with the material. As a matter of fact, it was the cast that saved the movie from being a total disaster by providing their comedic chops, their charm, and their good comic timing that you don't see enough of nowadays. Despite all that however, Bad teacher is a shiny apple with a few rotten parts.Elizabeth Hasley (Cameron Diaz) is a foul-mouthed, bitter, and quite nasty teacher that is keeping the job only to pay the bills after her rich fiancée dumps her. Facing debt, aging, and loneliness, Elizabeth starts setting her sights on a boob job and on a new (rich) teacher (Justin Timberlake), whom has also captured the attention of a manipulative rival (Lucy Punch). The script was helmed by two veteran writers of The Office (Gene Stupnitsky, Lee Eisenberg) as they use their non-television ratings boundaries to mix plenty of vulgar and raunchy humor with even some tidbits of cruel humor. Unfortunately, their lack of boundaries led to a mediocre script.This film's biggest falters come in the form of the script. Despite the promise in the premise and the cast involved, the script was convoluted, and didn't have much structure until the second half. As a matter of fact, the film switches up the pace very unexpectedly when the next act approaches. Pretty much almost all the crude and vulgar humor failed to draw laughs, with one notable exception involving one of the odder ""sex"" scenes in recent memory. The movie was a great idea not exactly explored upon, and was full of smaller ideas that were not utilized. Many good smaller characters did not get enough time in the script; most notably the students, the gym teacher (Jason Segal) and the main character's roommate (Erik Stonestreet).Despite the writing being a fickle mess, the cast was superb, from the small roles to the big ones. Cameron Diaz I can honestly say is one of the most underrated talents in Hollywood, because she rarely ever delivers a mediocre or weak performance. She has this aura, this energy that can save the worst of films (See: What Happens in Vegas) and it is no different here. Despite her smoking/drinking/vulgar/manipulative/cynical/cruel/superficial ways, we still secretly root for her to succeed in reaching her goal. Very few actresses can pull off this type of charm.Lucy Punch, despite having a bit of questionable material, delivers as Diaz's rival. Jason Segal could have helped the movie a lot more if he was in it more often, as he delivered the laughs every time he was on-screen with his wit, sarcasm, and I-don't-care attitude. Television staples Phyllis Smith and Erik Stonestreet were hilarious in the far-too-few moments they were on-screen. The movie does indeed have its laughs, but the potential was so much greater considering all the talented actors involved.Jake Kasdan as a director doesn't have much of a resume, but he does have the comedic chops and timing, and he proved this with the underrated Walk Hard. With Bad Teacher, he did not have as much good material to work with but could have still helped the movie if he had tightened the first third of the movie better. There was a lot more unnecessary fluff in the first half of the movie compared to the second half. Smaller plot lines were never resolved, certain jokes literally fell off without a punchline, and certain situations were brought up but never explored. Many concepts were also never explored: especially that of how shallow and shady we all become towards each other in the workforce.Bottom Line: Bad Teacher was a great idea, poorly executed, but relentlessly saved by the energetic cast. This movie could have mixed the dark charm of Bad Santa with the subtle workforce ridiculousness humor of Office Space to become something very, very special. But neither style of humor was dwelled upon deep enough. The first half had its laughs, but was far too convoluted and was salvaged mainly because of the hilarity of Cameron Diaz. The movie definitely picks up later, but by then its too late, the potential was wasted. Either way, you will certainly laugh, you will remain entertained, but will also be bothered by what it could have been.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Meh...It's Good for a Few Laughs,"First Santa, now a middle school teacher. I feel as if we're on the verge of a new trend of bad *insert occupation here*. Bad toll booth operators, bad samurai deli clerkswhere will it end? Anyway, this is the latest from comedy director Jake Kasdan (WALK HARD) and a decently funny movie with some great moments but finds a major problem in its main character. 2011 hasn't been super strong with comedies; there have been some real good ones (BRIDESMAIDS) but most of them have been pretty forgettable (PAUL). This movie is pretty funny but it still ends on the low end of the spectrum. Cameron Diaz is Elizabeth Halsey, a gold-digging narcissist who has somehow made a career of being a middle school teacher. She believes she's found her way out with a rich fiancé to tend to her every need, but it falls apart when he finally realizes she's using him. Elizabeth is forced to return to her teaching job, where she proceeds to care even less than before. She fends off the advances of gym teacher Russell (Jason Segel) and focuses her attention on landing the new substitute teacher, Scott (Justin Timberlake). Elizabeth realizes that the only way she'll snag Scott's attention is a little self-improvement. Not becoming a decent person or anything, just a breast enhancement. From then on, she lies, cheats, and steals her way to the money she'll need for the surgery; and the only one who suffers is the good teacher (Lucy Punch) who just wants Elizabeth to do her job.In A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, young Alex (Malcolm McDowell) robs, rapes, and commits horrible acts of violence but maintains a charismatic personality that allows the audience to root for him. Elizabeth Halsey in BAD TEACHER, does not. The ""protagonist"" in this movie also happens to be the least likable person in the film. As a result, the movie comes off as a little backwards. The character we're supposed to support (Elizabeth) is just a horrible person with absolutely no redeeming qualities presented until the final act of the film. And I mean none. She was a gold-digging fiancé, she's perpetually drunk/high on the job, and she coldly dismisses gym teacher Russell's advances without a glance in favor of stalking the new substitute with the massive bank account. It would almost make more sense if the film focused on Ms. Squirrel (Lucy Punch) living out her dream teaching career when trouble-making Elizabeth comes along and steals her thunder in underhanded ways. Punch should be the protagonist, and Elizabeth the antagonist. But it's not; instead we watch as the film's ""good guy"" punishes the ""bad guy"" for nothing other than doing her job and doing it well. Oh well, whateverit's just a comedy after all. Antiheroes can be fun and it works as long as the film is funny, which it mostly is. The movie is good for some laughs, though it's tough to be anything but distant as you watch everything going down without ever really being drawn into the story.Cameron Diaz really is the best person for this role. Not because she's horribly unlikeable (I assume she's not) but because she's got a decent comedic background in her films and she's still capable of pulling off drop-dead beauty. In BAD TEACHER, she's the teacher we all wished we'd had in middle school. She really drives the point home when she volunteers to work the school's charity car wash so she can pilfer funds. The supporting cast in this movie is what really makes it enjoyable. Jason Segel is always great as a lovable schlub (which pretty much sums up his gym teacher character) and Lucy Punch is hilariously eccentric as Ms. Squirrel. I've also got to give credit to Phyllis Smith as Elizabeth's friend Lynn. She's probably the funniest part of the movie as the soft-spoken conservative friend who wants so badly to be as cool as Elizabeth but can't bring herself to commit to the debauchery. Honestly, the main character may be crap but the movie does have some real funny moments. I just don't know if there's enough to save it from fading out shortly after watching it. If it helps, I find the movie is funnier the less sober you are when watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bad Teacher ?? Maybe. Bad Film? Absolutely,"I know others will disagree with me, but this has got to be in the running for the pick for the Razzies this year. What a pathetic piece of crap. The storyline was boring and the jokes either over-the-top, or, worst, not even close to funny. It never fails to amaze me when really bad ideas not only get to be screenplays, but they actually wind up getting produced. And...Timberlake's character...what was he thinking when he took this role??? Yeah, Diaz is still a hot body and all, but even that couldn't save something so downright dumb. I won't bother with any spoilers; it's not worth the effort. Save your money. This one will simply insult your intelligence. I would give it a minus one if I could.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hot for teacher,"Comedies today keep trying to push the boundaries more and more to stand out. The Hangover movies are a perfect example of this. Much of it started with There's Something About Mary which grossed people out in a humorous way. The star of that movie, Cameron Diaz, shows her funny side once again in Bad Teacher. This one's not as risqué or shocking, but it tries to stand out with its premise - a teacher who treats her students like crap and could care less about educating them. In most movies like The Hangover, guys are doing all of the crude and nasty stuff. So it's a little refreshing to see a woman do it this time around, even if it's more things she says than does. We do get to see her wail on some kids with a dodgeball though. You feel kind of bad for the kids, but they seem to take it in stride. Maybe they're just happy to have a hot teacher, even if she's not doing her job. Let's face it, most kids aren't excited to learn. Here they get to spend most of their time in the classroom watching movies. I know I would've preferred that when I was in class.Diaz plays money-seeking Elizabeth Halsey, a woman who somehow managed to become a teacher while waiting to marry her rich fiancé. She completes a year at her school doing the absolute bare minimum of teaching. But her fiancé dumps her after learning of her gold digging ways and now she finds herself stuck teaching at the school that she was just getting ready to leave for good. Elizabeth quickly learns that a new teacher played by Justin Timberlake comes from a very wealthy family. So she sets her radar on him as her next husband to be. He's the complete opposite of her, but that doesn't matter. He's very polite and rather nerdy. In fact, he's much more like Elizabeth's rival teacher Miss Squirrel. Once he starts getting close with the prissy Miss Squirrel, it becomes a battle of wits between the two women to be with him. But Elizabeth is out to get him for all the wrong reasons of course. While she sleeps through class and just plays movies for her students to watch, she spends the rest of her time trying to impress the wealthy new teacher and win him over. AdvertisementTimberlake, who's proved he can be very funny through all his appearances on Saturday Night Live, isn't really given much to do here. He just plays the clean-cut nerdy guy the best that he can. Jason Segal, who plays a fellow gym teacher, gets more of the laughs. His character sees right through Elizabeth but pursues her anyway. He goes along with everything she does but still makes sure to put her in check too. He's the one person at the school that she's able to relate to a little it seems. Watching the film you'll wonder if Elizabeth will find any sort of redemption and change her ways. You get the sense that Segal's character is the one person who can help her with that. The movie has some funny one-liners and interesting scenes, but I wouldn't say it's laugh-out-loud hilarious or anything. Still, it's a pretty funny premise and Cameron Diaz fits perfectly into the role. It's not a movie you'll remember down the road but it's worth checking out at least.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A parade of unpleasant, unfunny individuals.","I had the misfortune of seeing this movie because my roommate was watching it. Rarely do I find a film where absolutely none of the characters are worthy of empathy or laughter. The dialogue is cruel more than humorous and the plot is composed of various unpleasant people doing unbelievable things. A ""parade of bad"" CAN be funny (see: Always Sunny in Philadelphia, The League) but there has to be some sort of wit and human element. Bad Teacher has neither. I recommend this movie to people who love reality television or those who think being mean is the pinnacle of comedy.

Delightfully Stupid and Raunchy,"I thoroughly enjoyed this comedy which is not romantic but mercenary, vulgar and borders on sex work. I'm exactly the audience this kind of movie was designed for though it's admittedly offensive and low-brow, Bad Teacher is hilarious...like a 90 minute long SNL skit from the good 'ol days.A gold-digging English teacher is dumped by her dorky, wealthy fiance and his mom and must return to her job as the worst middle school teacher that ever lived. Realistically, the character of Elizabeth is reminiscent of a substitute teacher who escorts or is a cam girl at night to make ends meet, but in this flick she's a full-time credentialed teacher so your suspension of disbelief will have to be pretty enormous to even accept the premise, but once you accept that it's an absurdist dark comedy and not a touching dramedy, it gets really good.Perfect employee Amy is every obnoxious public school teacher that ever lived, and probably few college adjunct professors as well. It's implausible to love Elizabeth even if you laugh at her insane plotting to bed a math teacher who was probably a virgin until he was 25, played by a convincingly ""hip youth pastor"" bespectacled Justin Timberlake, but it becomes a lot easier because not hating Amy is utterly impossible.Sick, offensive, ridiculous and predictable, I still give Bad Teacher a 6 because it's super entertaining and fun if you'e in that mood.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why does this movie exist?,"Just watched Bad Teacher. WHO ALLOWED THIS MOVIE TO BE MADE?! I watched it mostly because I really like Jason Segel and sometimes Cameron Diaz isn't terrible. But this movie... I'm not sure why this movie exists.If you're not familiar with this ""film"" I envy you.It stars Diaz as a crappy, disinterested junior high school teacher named Elizabeth. Her only goal in life is to marry a rich guy and spend as much of his money she can. The movie starts out with her leaving her teaching job, after one year, to marry a rich man, he wisely dumps her and she goes back to being a teacher until she can snare replacement wallet. The next school year starts out and she does nothing but show her class, she seems to have only the one class, movies that somehow incorporate school (Lean on Me, Dangerous Minds, etc.). She meets new teacher Scott, played by Justin Timberlake, who happens to have a rich family and decides that what she needs to snare this man, based on a picture of his ex, is bigger boobs. To do this she needs about $10,000. Hard to achieve on a teacher's salary so she volunteers to help with the school's car wash fundraiser and dresses like a slut in order to earn extra ""tips"" from pervy guys. All the while she is being pursued by Russell (Jason Segel), a gym teacher at the same school, whom she ignores because he's just a gym teacher. She also does what she can to appeal to the naive and stupid Scott who is interested in Elizabeth's rival Amy who does whatever she can to expose Diaz as a marijuana-smoking-in-the-parking-lot crappy teacher. Elizabeth learns that she can earn a $5700 bonus if her students get the highest scores in some standardized test. She tries to be a real teacher in order to get her students to pass but when it becomes apparent that this tactic will not produce the results she desires she seduces and drugs and employee at the testing company in order to steal a copy of the test. Her students end up getting the highest scores and she gets her bonus check. Amy discovers what she's done, after almost being poisoned when Elizabeth rubs poison ivy on an apply that Amy eats and Elizabeth steals her boyfriend Scott, and turns her in. Elizabeth blackmails the test company employee and escapes those charges. Amy then uses the drug use as a way to get Elizabeth fired. That backfires as well and Amy takes the rap for the drugs in Elizabeth's desk. Amy is sent to a school full of troubled teens, Elizabeth blows of rich guy Scott and hooks up with Russell. All the while never learning a single lesson. She gets away with all of the horrible things she's done and the good teacher who actually cares about teaching gets punished.Seriously?! This is the message of the movie? Lie, cheat, steal, drug and blackmail people, only be concerned with how much money somebody has, bigger boobs will make you happy, treat kids and your coworkers like crap, smoke pot, poison coworkers, use inappropriate language around kids and just be a bitch. That's what Bad Teacher taught me. This is a horrible movie that shouldn't even exist.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I am not so hot for ""Bad Teacher"", even though it had its periods of laughter!","Buenos Diaz and welcome to my lecture, I mean review, of the Diaz-driven comedy ""Bad Teacher"". OK, I am not going to fire away on ""Bad Teacher"" but I am not going to give it cinematic tenure either. As mentioned, on the starring dais of ""Bad Teacher"" is the applelicious Cameron Diaz, who is not bad here, actually she was pretty good. Diaz stars as Elizabeth Halsey, a Middle School Teacher who craves to get a breast ahead of the golddigger sweepstakes by finding conniving ways to get money, so then she can get a boob job so she can marry rich. Halsey's Vomit and other unethical behaviors (showing movies in class, smoking pot, embezzling school fundraising money, etc) throughout her working school day make her a. see movie title. She catches the eye of Scott Delacorte, a substitute teacher whose parents are immensely wealthy due to their lucrative watch company. Therefore, like clockwork, Elizabeth has her new victim to somehow marry rich in the future. Justin Timberlake was in sync playing the dorky Delacorte, and was hilarious in a school dance scene. Ms. Halsey's rival is fellow teacher Ms. Squirrel solidly portrayed by the up-and-coming Lucy Punch. This Squirrel teeths into Halsey's mischievous ways; and Ms. Squirrel's unorthodox, corny-pun teaching methods might just be as horrific as Ms. Halsey's behaviors. But who am I to criticize corny puns, there are plenty of those already marked in this review. Two other performances that hit the B+ barometer in ""Bad Teacher"" were of John Michael Higgins who plays the dolphin- loving Principal Snur, and Phyllis Smith as Elizabeth's only teacher- friend Ms. Davies. However, the thespian valedictorian of ""Bad Teacher"" is Jason Segel as P.E. Teacher Russell Gettis, whose repeated Gettisburg Address to get into Elizabeth's pants was quite entertaining. Segel is one of the brightest comedic actors of today, and everything he is in gets automatically bumped up a grade. So why don't I put ""Bad Teacher"" in the school of stellar comedies? Due to Director's Jake Kasdan orchestration of ""Bad Teacher"" in the last semester, I mean act of the movie. He was off to a great start with some outstanding opening sequences, but as the film went on it sure could have used some creative composition. Gene Stupnitzky & Lee Eisenberg's screenplay has its sporadic hilarious comedic lines within the dialogue, but needed a script tutor for its redundant narrative. I will pass ""Bad Teacher"" with a C+, mostly due to its drama team of actors. If you were able to read this pun-driven review, thank your preacher, because I bless you for having the courage. *** Average",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
America Continues To Sink,"Another comic ""gem"" to satisfy the cravings of an increasingly stupid viewing audience, ""Bad Teacher"" is accurately titled. Cameron Diaz, who is also a bad actress, is indeed very, very bad in this film. Her character is entirely absent any remotely positive traits. There's nothing to like about her, and yet we are supposed to root for her. A film with a title like this would once have been relegated to the porn industry. Now it's just part of mainstream ""comedy,"" right there alongside other immortal classics like ""Super Bad,"" ""Jack Ass,"" ""Kick Ass,"" etc.Yes, it was awe inspiring to watch dear Cameron fire balls at the heads of little boys. Not little girls, of course- that wouldn't be funny. It's only humorous to watch little boys in pain. Ha Ha. Think of it- the writers are depicting an adult abusing children, and we're laughing at it! Reverse the roles- can you imagine a ""comedy"" where a male teacher abuses little girls, and the audience is amused by it?Several obvious sequels spring to mind here; Bad Student, Bad Principal, Bad Janitor, Bad Cafeteria Lady, etc. The possibilities are endless. The American idiocracy apparently have an unlimited appetite for these mindless, immature ""comedies"" that could all have been written by 12 year old boys. I guess these ""writers"" never run out of ways to portray farting, male asses and men getting hurt (usually by getting hit in the crotch). Thank goodness their ""talent"" was recognized and is being put to such good use.Everyone who had anything to do with this monstrously bad movie should be ashamed of themselves. The messages it sends are horrendous. If ""bad teachers"" start popping up in real life, they should never be held accountable for their actions, no matter how despicable they are. After all, Hollywood has told us that such creatures are hilarious, even lovable. So lighten up, it's all in good fun!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Not BAD. Pretty good, as it happens.","You'd think this sort of humour would be right up my street, and you'd be absolutely correct. The sneering at the well-intentioned, the relentless mocking of the disadvantaged, and the courage to show us sometimes nice guys (or gals) DO finish last is like ambrosia to my ears.However, I can't help but compare and contrast to a similar film by the name of Bad Santa, and not just because of the name. Both movies have alcoholic, drug-addled losers in the main role who are only in their current job for personal satisfaction. They steal, cheat and manipulate every good soul around them to achieve their goal, before finding some sort of minor personal redemption by the end.But unlike the Xmas film, Bad Teacher operates to so many extremes of what it mocks it all becomes a wee bit improbable. No-one for instance, could be as sickly-sweet as Lucy Punch's character in real life... you can tell this is a comic creation all the way, and she plays it too broadly. Same with Justin Timberlake.... they make him so obnoxiously nice in his part, he is never that funny, just plain irritating. And he ditches that persona entirely for a startlingly bad dry-humping scene late on, the less said about the better.Thank Heaven for Cameron Diaz though... She might be damaging children's delicate mental health with her corruptible influence, but at least she's a fleshed out person. All the humorous moments flow through her and her utter disdain for the goody two shoes surrounding her. A school like this, with it's right-on attitude and it's stultifying political correctness would probably be more of a nightmare to attend than a little place I know called Potterspury Lodge.It's just a shame then, that unlike the slightly superior Bad Santa, sometimes it just gets so OTT that it crosses the line between satire and silliness. It's still generally a chucklesome affair, but I just feel like it could have been better. Ah, well... 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bad Teacher (2011),"This is a movie I should probably hate. I say this because Diaz is our protagonist and she is a real bitch. Perhaps it's because I'm a teacher myself and can kind of understand her frustration at times. Still, she uses men for money, doesn't try hard at her job, is a drug user, etc. All attributes that should make me hate her. And yet, I don't. Her character doesn't even learn that many valuable lessons. I suppose it was due to the well constructed world around her. The other characters (minus Segel and Smith) just seem so fake, or happy in that annoying kind of way. They are all smiles and sunshine to the point of naivety. Segel works as the sarcastic guy that realizes how fake his job is, but makes an effort to enjoy it. Most of the humour revolves around Diaz doing things that students shouldn't, but I found it had me giggling a lot. I'm also pleased that it didn't become too preachy. Rather than turning Diaz into a wonderful caring and hardworking teacher, she just kind of learned to be happy with where she was in life.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I think I'll be excused,"Bad Teacher is a hit and miss comedy, with a fair number of laughs, but a fair number of plot holes and questions. Before I even thought about this movie after seeing it, I went and watched Bad Santa for the first time. Both films have a similar premise with the lead character being unpleasant and offensive. But Bad Santa was written with a more style of dark comedy, and let's not forget, with a corrupt childhood and a ""whatever"" attitude, Billy Bob Thornton's character had a perfectly good reason to be ""bad"" and mean. Cameron Diaz has none other than she is just mean-spirited and has chosen to pursue a miserable lifestyle.Elizabeth Halsey is our main character, portrayed by the lovely Cameron Diaz. Elizabeth is a teacher had a normal school, and comes home one day to her fiancée and finds out that his mother has convinced him to call of the wedding. Planning to possibly spend the rest of her life staying at home since her fiancée was rich, Elizabeth must return to the school where she shows her class movies every day while she naps at her desk.Seeing the attractive substitute teacher Scott Delacorte (Timberlake), Elizabeth makes conversation to learn he has just gone through a breakup with a woman with large breasts. Elizabeth decides to under-go a breast enlargement surgery, a costly but rewarding surgery, to be more self-appreciative.The main rival in the film is Amy Squirrel (Punch), another teacher in the building. She believes that Elizabeth is a fraud, scamming the school out of money (to pay for her surgery). There is also a strange attraction between Jason Segel's character as the gym teacher. The movie's biggest fault is it focuses more on Elizabeth's sometimes funny, sometimes not antics instead of building up the attraction it should with Jason Segel's character. When the film ends, we feel that the film itself didn't know how to end and just thought up something out of the blue just to give the film some sort of sun-shiny ending. The end would've been better, if we got more of a relationship between the two.Another problem is that the students are never developed enough. The film has several students that speak to Miss Halsey individually, but it seems it can't make up its mind which one it wants to focus on. We have the brown nose girl and the sensitive kid who writes poetry and is crushing on the girl way out of his league. We get brief scenes with them, but we never see Elizabeth talk to one of the students very much. In Bad Santa, Thornton was always talking to kids and, despite his sour motivation, he was optimistic about the loner he picked up along the way.The backstory isn't big either. If Cameron Diaz is such a miserable hack behind the desk, why did she take up teaching in the first place? How did she become a teacher? Does the principal never come in the classroom to find that Elizabeth is sleeping while the kids watch Scream? While I liked Diaz in There's Something About Mary and other things she has done, in this, she is just barely likable.The jokes are funny. But boy does the writing fail it. When the jokes are funny, they are really funny. When the jokes fail, they fall flat on their face and are cringe inducing. The dry humping scene between Diaz and Timberlake is awkward, and is useless. It doesn't cause any advance in the plot or accomplishment among Diaz's part. It's simply there to have some sort of sex scene in a movie titled Bad Teacher.Bad Teacher is cute, but ultimately not as dirty or as funny as it should be. The relationship between the characters is forced, no one on screen seems to be doing their best, and the screenplay, like I said, can be good but can really bad. A comedy that had potential, also had a really good movie it would be compared to for its lifetime. The result; Santa will live on while the Teacher will need an attitude adjustment.Starring: Cameron Diaz, Jason Segel, and Justin Timberlake. Directed by: Jake Kasdan.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Shallow story but good acting.,"This film is not so much about the story as it is about the comedy. The title itself eludes to the comedy, which can be said to be bad. However this 'bad comedy' is what makes it funny.The story is not that interesting as it does get boring at times but it is not repetitive. The main focus is on Elizabeth and Diaz does a good job acting. You might not think her acting is good, but based on previous movies she has done I would say that this is not the type of character she is used to. Therefore I would say that she did a good job in this film as a badass foul mouth teacher. She delivered her lines convincingly and really fit into her character's shoes well. Punch does a good job of playing the uptight rule- abider, goody two shoes. I don't quite know why but it was either Timberlake himself or his character that really irked me. My friends and I were just fascinated at the possibility that Smith was probably the voice of Sadness in Inside Out (she is!).There is not much to say of this film, except that it mainly plays off Elizabeth's appalling language (especially around children) to produce laughter. There is also quite a few scenes that I find a bit crude or stupid, but that just adds to the type of comedy this film promotes. Additionally, there are some pretty predictable plot lines and endings but all in all, it was not such a terrible experience.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bad Apple,"There is a certain energy in that movie. Especially at the beginning when Cameron Diaz seems invincible she has the time of her life (almost literally). There is a great sequence where she kinda falls down though which sets of the rest of the movie. Unfortunately even though it does make sense for her character, it does loose quite a bit of its pace from that point on.Justin Timberlake is good in playing kind of against character and does not care about what people may think. Jason Segel is almost underused in this one and even Cameron Diaz did not really have that many great moments overall. And for a movie that tries to stay raunchy, it does even fail at combining that with the funny elements. While deliciously evil at times (and good), it also misses the point half of the time. Not really bad, but not that good either (I only watched the cinema release and not the extended cut)",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cute and Funny - Worth it,"I like Diaz, and she shined in this.I had low expectations but it actually was funny. It had a good pace and threw a love story in there too. Even my husband thought it was funny, and he isn't into chick flicks! Unlike some movies where I have to fast forward through slow sections- no such problem here. The writers do a good job of character development with Diaz's part while keeping it light and funny.Don't remember much about the other actors except the other female school teacher - they played off each other very well.Good rental!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bad Teacher - Worse Movie,"What a waste of money and talent... Sometimes Hollywood do it just right in releasing the Cream of the Crap, my goodness grace, who in this world wanted to spend this kind of money in such incredible junk/ if the answer is to see boobs on screen, come on, give me a break! Another thing, I got to believe that the stars in it are there just for the $, because there aren't another reason for such a bad taste of choosing script, actually by calling this one a script, I am not being fair with the writers that really know what they are doing. The Directing worked because of the Hollywood's formula, otherwise, it could be used just a robot saying: ""action"" and ""cut"", or even, ""Ok, let's take a break of five"", or should I say, let's us all take a break of such nonsense movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bad Reviews .... Great Movie !!!,Great film lots of laughs !I know that after reading all these horrible reviews everyone is going to think that this movie sucks... In all reality some viewers seem to have lost track of the fact that the film is rated R. The majority of negative comments are most likely coming from the stereo typical views of those very people who in the film were made to seem ridiculous. A.K.A all the mothers who are still most likely listening to there children's poetry hahaha. Cut the umbilical people and lighten up this is an Adult Comedy Rated R so don't rate the film as if you were expecting to watch Bambi on family night.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Crass, bad and wonderfully wicked!","I was brought down 30 years to a besotted teenager again, as 'hottie' Cameron Diaz becomes every pubescent boy's dream teacher and she's bad. Bad at almost everything, for that matter!Very much like Billy Bob Thornton's ""Bad Santa"", this is an adult post- pub late evening grubby comedy that is boisterously and often raucously funny. Especially when seen in a group of those of similar gender and outlook.Yes, every cliché is explored and exploited and by far the funniest bits are when the pot-smoking, dangerously driving and self-centred egotist Elizabeth Halsey (Diaz) is doing just that. Her out-and-out quest to finance bigger boobs surgery simply to net a wealthier and more financially sustaining husband and the way she bulldozes her way over and through everything and everyone is gloriously OTT and very entertaining.What don't work, though, are the romantic elements, which if anything, detract rather than add to the movie. Bad Teacher only loves herself, let's leave it at that. Justin Timberlake, as the suitor on her radar looks rather stupid and awkward and the gym teacher whose advances she continuously declines, Jason Segel just looks too creepily inadequate for her personality to persuade us that 'that's ever gonna happen'.Brit Lucy Punch is very funny/annoying (depending on personal choice) as another teacher with, shall we say, some very odd personal afflictions as well as teaching ones.There is some very strong language and toilet ""humour"", which I've long realised is an essential part to any US comedy these days (& which I'd rather do without, thankyou!). There are some sexy scenes too - check out the car-wash antics, with Diaz posing those 1970's pin-up poses (spray, lying over the car's bonnet, you know the sort of thing).Bad Teacher could easily slip into 2/10 or 8/10, depending on how you like your humour. Somehow, I feel I should give it 5/10,but I enjoyed it a lot for the most part and thus have gone for between 6.5 and 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The voids of laugher speaks volumes,"Bad Teacher had a strong premise for a comedy, a teacher is really bad and hates her job. It was marketed a raunchy hard-R comedy: sadly it was a film that was lacking, despite the best efforts of the actors.Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) is the bad teacher in question who leaves the profession and forced to return when her fiancé dumps her for her gold digging ways. She returns to John Adams Middle High (JAMS) and sets out to win over Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), a geeky substitute teacher who is the heir to a watch empire. He particularly likes women with big breasts and Elizabeth plans to get a boob job: but needs the money. But Scott himself is attached to Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch), a quirky caring teacher who gets the best results in school. At the same time Elizabeth has a suitor in the form a Gym/P.E. teacher (Jason Seagel). When Elizabeth finds out the prize for the best school results in the Illinois State Test is a big cheque, she sets about to ensure her class is the best.The jokes were just lacking through the film. I was in a cinema that was 75% full and there were a lot of teachers in it and I can say with honesty that there was very little laugher, a few chuckles and no belly laughs. That says a lot about a comedy because the point is to make us laugh. I believe one of two things happened, either, that the film was originally going to be a PG-13 film and the producers thought that the film was more marketable as a R-rated comedy, or the more likely that it was cut much of the swearing out to get a PG-13 rating, and failed. Most of the use of the F word in the red band trailer was cut out from the actual film. They were also plot points, like when Elizabeth offered to tutor her students, goes nowhere. The pace throughout was just very slow and Bad Teacher needed more snap.Acting wise the best performance was Seagel best person the film, having the best lines with his role and the most grounded character in the film. He was simply natural as a gym teacher who just wants to have fun, though he has a dodgy line which makes him sound like a potential rapist. Punch is solid and she is deliberately over the top as a quirky teacher, but she does not have many good lines and Punch has to make the performance as physical as possible. She also gets very screwed over in the film. Diaz does her best but the character is not very well developed and her traits flipped like a switch. Most of the time she is shown as an uncaring person, only interested in herself and only got into teaching for the hours: but at the same time she does help some students and surely she should have cared as some point about teaching. She is also too ruthless, she needed to be a deeper character.I also have to comment about the actual school On Wikipedia it describes JAMS as a school in a poor area: it was certainly not, it was in a very middle class area. I liked how the kids in the school actually looked normal and not in cliques like the jocks, the nerds, the pretty girls, cheerleaders, etc They were mixed. But at the same time it seems like that the teachers only have one class: when I was in school the teachers had to teach classes over many years, if they only taught one class then they would have a very short working week.Overall, a big disappointment.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

"So bad, my daughter and I walked out after 20-25 mins","I can't write a complete review because for the first time in my life I actually got up and walked out of a movie, along with my adult daughter, because it was so bad. The movie was NOTHING like I expected based on the previews. I was expecting risqué, sexy and funny, and instead I got lewd, raunchy, and ANYTHING but funny. The couple slight chuckles I got in the first 20-25 minutes before we walked out, had nothing to do with the lewd, wildly misguided attempts at humor, but rather the subtle things like Cameron Diaz's character avoiding other teachers in the hall that are looking for a shoulder to cry on.I would liken the ATTEMPTS at humor in this movie to something like Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle... but unlike the mostly very funny White Castle movie, Bad Teacher misses the laugh mark by a MILE and then some. It's just simply NOT funny, and it was pretty awkward to watch with my OVER 17 daughter (you DEFINITELY don't want to take your teenage kids to see this). To sum it up, if you liked that disgusting Battle Sh*ts scene from White Castle, then Bad Teacher is YOUR movie, go see it. If you thought that scene was raunchy, lewd, disgusting, and NOT funny (unlike the rest of the movie), then AVOID Bad Teacher at all costs. Or just play it safe and avoid it period, you're not going to miss anything.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Stupid movie really.,"I thought this movie would be funny but it's just another movie that thinks it can be funny by being as raunchy as possible. Not very funny, maybe laughed once. Getting really tired of these movies that are basically trying to get laughs by being vulgar. You know there are other ways to get people to laugh. Cameron Diaz plays the part fine. Although she has done much better and i think she can find better movies to act in. The guy (don't know who he is) was alright, but his part was not very believable. I felt like i kept watching the movie thinking it would get better, well it didn't. It was just kind of bland.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Cameron Diaz is amazing in this ultra scheming seductress role, and all the teacher characters are so well written and done, you know there is a perfect recipe for a very well written comedy that is so outrageous at times , yet really does work at what it is meant to deliver.

Bad Teacher is truly bad,"Cameron Diaz is terrific but here she's wasted in a terribly lazy script that resorts to farting to get a laugh. She has the only redeemable moment, washing a car! But the whole thing moves from lame sketch to lame sketch. The film had a 31 million opening week-end so I fear we'll have a Bad Teacher 2, how sad, really. Justin Timberlake, who has shown the chops of a very good actor, here he just appears. Jason Segel, what I can I say, I don't get him. The filmmakers should study the films of Preston Sturges and attempt a comedy, even with he same premise, but with originality and wit. The title reminded me of ""Bad Santa"" an hoped for something as smartly irreverent but not such luck. Bad Santa was so much better.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Every school has at least one,"RELEASED IN 2011 and directed by Jake Kasdan, ""Bad Teacher"" is a dramedy about a slothful, inept middle school teacher in Illinois (Cameron Diaz) who hates her work, her pupils and her colleagues. She has no choice but to return to teaching after losing her sugar daddy and aspires to the lofty goal of getting breast implants. Lucy Punch plays her winsome rival while Justin Timberlake appears as a wealthy eligible teacher. Jason Segel plays the gym teacher who's interested in her while Phyllis Smith appears as her aged, overweight teacher pal.Do you remember the bad teacher at your school? Every school has at least one, usually more. I found ""Bad Teacher"" amusing from beginning to end and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny. It helps that the characters are all well-defined & cast and that the story is absorbing. The soundtrack features some quality snippets by the likes of Judas Priest (""You've God Another Thing Coming"" & ""The Ripper""), Whitesnake (""Still of the Night"") and Dio (""Rainbow in the Dark"").NOTE: I saw the censored version, not the unrated one, which is likely gross.THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour & 32 minutes and was shot in Southern Cal (Los Angeles & Santa Clarita) with exterior shots done in Illinois (Springfield & Lawndale). WRITERS: Gene Stupnitsky & Lee Eisenberg. ADDITIONAL CAST: John Michael Higgins is on hand as the principle and Thomas Lennon as a school official.GRADE: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Bad, Terrible, Awful Teacher","¨She doesn't give an 'F'¨ I don't know what is worse: Cameron Diaz's character as a teacher, or the movie itself. This is really a very bad movie, terrible. It's supposed to be a comedy, but it really doesn't have many funny moments. Yes there is a couple here and there, but in a 95 minute long movie you expect much more laughs. This raunchy comedy had a whole lot of raunchy, but no comedy whatsoever. I really hated this film, and expected a lot more from Cameron Diaz, Justin Timberlake, and Jason Segel who have done much better movies in the past. I can't blame it on them because the script they were given was really poor, but then I ask myself why would these actors want to be in a movie with a script as bad as this one. This isn't the first time that Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg fail as screenwriters in a comedy. These are the same guys that were responsible for the Year One fiasco starring Jack Black and Michael Cera. Director Jake Kasdan, however, has done far better in the past with funny films like Walk Hard and Orange County. Bad Teacher was a huge misstep for him, and for everyone else who was involved in this project. This could very well be the worse film of the year in my opinion. Cameron Diaz might not give an F, but I definitely will give this film an F for being the disaster it was.Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) is not your typical High School teacher; she's not interested in her students, she smokes pot before class, and she tries to avoid teaching as much as possible. The only reason she became a teacher was because of the long summer vacations. This is her last year at the school anyway because she is getting married to her wealthy boyfriend and can now enjoy life. The only problem is that her mother-in-law points out how she is only interested in his money so he leaves her with no wedding. This means Elizabeth will have to teach yet another year until she can find a wealthy man to marry. She becomes interested in the new substitute teacher who seems to come from a wealthy family, Scott (Justin Timberlake), but he has just broken up with his long term girlfriend and doesn't feel ready for a relationship yet. Elizabeth has a rival: it's another fellow teacher named Amy (Lucy Punch) who seems to get along really well with Scott. Amy also seems to point out Elizabeth's method of teaching and tries to get her more involved with the kids. Russell (Jason Segel) is the gym teacher who has always had a thing for Elizabeth, but she never pays attention to him because he doesn't have any money. Elizabeth is more interested in winning over Scott's affection (and his money) so that she can get away from school as soon as possible. She will do whatever it takes to do this even if it revolves on getting her breasts done in order to get his attention.The movie really doesn't know where to head. At the beginning Cameron Diaz's character is so hateful but later out of nowhere she begins to have a conscious and is nice all of a sudden. On the other hand Lucy Punch's character seems so nice at first, but then turns up being mean. It's like they switched characters so the movie could find a decent ending. These changes in character can't happen all of a sudden without explanation. The movie is full of stereotypes and it completely fails as a comedy. It is too bad because Jason Segel, Cameron Diaz, and Justin Timberlake have proved they have great talent, but none of them are able to stand out and save this movie. Timberlake's character is perhaps the worst of all. I had no idea where the director was trying to go with his character. Diaz is just way too mean to be likable. Segel on the other hand is perhaps the most decent character in the movie but he really has no screen time and it's hard to see how he could fall for someone like Diaz. This is really one of the worst films I've seen all year, and can't remember any funny moments in the movie. I was expecting a lot more from the cast and found the 95 minute movie way too long. It's hard to like a movie when you are supposed to root for a highly unlikeable character such as Elizabeth Halsey. I could care less what happens to her.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Garbage, Waste of time, Save your money","Instead of calling it ""Bad Teacher"", it should have been called ""Diaz and Timberlake - our careers are over"".

Be warned it is not appropriate for teenagers and the ratings industry should be questioned for their thinking.Will never go to another movie starring Diaz. In the show she does drugs and you will need them to ease the pain of having paid to see this garbage.

It truly is a statement of our times~,"Film was directed and produced adequately enough. Script isn't absolutely horrible, I know I wouldn't want to have to try to get humor out of the embarrassing abomination our education system has become but, just the same, it's surprising to me to read so many negative reviews of this movie by such (sincerely) smart, observant, and astute viewers, film fans, and film-goers.The obvious point is to enjoy watching Ms. Diaz; I freely admit I would be riveted watching a black-and-white film of her reading the phone book. She just has that appeal to some of us. One cannot deny her sexual magnetism and charisma in the most generic of gestures and exclamations. She's just a joy to watch. Additionally, I'm sure all of us have a person like her character within our social circle, it's just that they don't usually say the things she says or do the things she says quite so obviously (or perhaps simply within our purview).So, either you get it or you don't: she's pretty, she's sexy, so put her up on the screen to . . . well, do something, anything--who cares?

Not much of a comedy,"Bad Teacher is one of those comedies that terribly misjudges the reverse appeal of its central character.

Bad Teacher Or Bad Movie??,"This movie is now several years old, bad reviews and word of mouth have put me off watching it, despite being a fan of Jason Segel. However it was on TV tonight, and in the absence of anything else to watch, I decided to give it a go.Plot In A Paragraph: Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) is a gold-digging teacher in Chicago, who swears at her students, drinks heavily, smokes marijuana, and shows movies while she sleeps through class.

Diaz gives a good performance and Timberlake sends himself up brilliantly, John Michael Higgins is a lot of fun as Wally Snur, the dolphin obsessed principal.

Look at who the writers are of this movie.  It will tell you the quality.,"Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg are the credited writers of one of the worst comedies ever made: Year One, the movie where Jack Black and Michael Cera played themselves as cave men. Here the same type of mean, non-creative, only mildly entertaining humor is at play because they wrote Bad Teacher.Some may even say that this is a wasted opportunity with this cast. I beg to differ. You mainly have one ACTUALLY funny person in the cast and that's Jason Segel, which happens to provide the movie's only funny moments. All these other actors would never be capable of writing funny jokes in stand-up or in a movie. They are all just actors there to just read what is given in front of them, entrusting that the jokes in the movie are going to be funny. Unfortunately, not even that happens in this film.The humor in ""Bad Teacher"" mainly is about shock value only. The shock value here only comes off as repulsive and definitely not funny. Where is the wit in any of the lines? What are they expecting an adult reaction to be with some of the jokes in this. Someone farted really loudly on the toilet. Reaction that didn't happen: ""HAHAHA."" Or it shows a kid with an erection as Cameron Diaz washes a car. Reaction that didn't happen: ""OMG, did they really just show that? Hilarious.""Overall, I give this a rating of: ""Bad Teacher"". (Some movies just start a whole new rating.)",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wish I had teachers this bad,"Decent watch, unlikely to watch again, and hard to recommend.I'm not the biggest fan of Cameron Diaz or Lucy Punch, but their over dramatic styling (in this movie) contrasting with an (overly) laid back attitude from the gentleman co-stars really works for this passive aggressive teach war.None of it makes a lot of sense, but for an unlikable protagonist, the story does a lot with her doing good, if for the wrong reasons.This brings up a somewhat subtle philosophical debate on morality, but I don't think this movie was necessarily designed for that. If anything, then its questioning personal motivation.I feel I had to try to really hard to find substance in this one, but if you want something where you can turn your brain off, this'll do.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Female teacher needs a new sugar daddy. Will it be the new substitute teacher or the slacker gym teacher?,"Beforehand I found Cameron Diaz as the lead character in a raunchy comedy off putting. I was pleasantly surprised I neither wanted to stab her or myself after seeing this movie. She pulls off the recently dumped, vulgar, Junior High teacher off pretty well.Diaz stars as the titular teacher Elizabeth Halsey. Her fiancé dumps her very early on in an unexpected tone setting scene. She is an educator without a care of education who needs a new man's bank account to rest on. Enter Justin Timberlake as the hot, new substitute teacher with plenty of family money. Timberlake plays the dorky, yet hot teacher very well culminating in his facial expressions in a ""moment of pleasure"".Jason Segel guest stars as the slacker gym teach with intent to hook up with the vulnerable Diaz. Segel albeit funny is under utilized in this smart, well written comedy. Lucy Punch is hilarious as the perky, over the top model teacher also vying for Timberlake's attention.The film is a comedy that should succeed much better than anyone whose ever heard of Cameron Diaz would expect. It comes across very 'Apatowian'. Its smart and just keeps going further down the road of crass, yet enjoyable raunchiness. It also sports the best scene of an exploding bowel movement since Austin Powers.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the worst movies I have ever seen,"I will do my best to fill this review with something other than the line""Worst movie ever"". Cameron Diaz has always managed to convince me that she has a place amongst many top actresses. This movie showed me just how contrived her acting can be. I'm not one to bash people and for al I know she is still op notch but it seemed like throughout this whole movie she was trying too hard to get her character across. Far be it from me to single her out as Timberlake falls in the same category. Perhaps it was the directors fault for pushing the actors over the top but the whole thing came across contrived and feeling forced. I wish I had the ability to take back watching this movie but alas it is done and that time is gone from my life. Please don't watch this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not as bad as I thought it would be!,"First off, I believe a 6 to be a solid rating for a comedy and conveys that the flick is watchable. The pace of the film is pretty steady and makes it's audience curious as to what is gonna happen next. There is some unnecessary lookin' sexual references and scenes that although I don't have any problems with them, they could've been portrayed in a much better and even funnier way. I think one of the main characteristics of a movie is whether it has scenes or dialog that you'll remember a few years from now and this film has got'em. Not many of them though!

"Bad Teacher, good comedy","I saw this in a special presentation in a cinema full of teachers. And judging from their guffaws they seemed to enjoy the movie.Liz is a brassy blonde who, at the end of her thirties, is on the verge of fulfilling her lifetime ambition: marrying a rich simpleton. But then his mum calls of the wedding, and Liz has to return to her reviled breadjob as a middle school teacher. To her never-ending amazement, all her other colleagues -- the middle-aged loner, the hippie, the preppy goody-two-shoed apple-cheeked nightmare -- seem to actually enjoy teaching spotty dropouts. The script does an excellent job of lining up every comedic angle of the dreary hell that is school life and linking it together with a fast-paced storyline. Cameron Diaz is excellent because she isn't afraid to actually look old, spent and wrinkled (but never unfoxy), and Phyllis Smith and Lucy Punch also stand out among the excellent cast. Justin Timberlake -- eye candy for the ladies, in case you wondered. The soppy, romantic, test-audience-compatible ending -- best ignored.This is an enjoyable light-but-dark comedy that everybody who has had anything to do with school life can dig. And I hope that most people here have encountered a school at some part of their lives.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amy Squirrel's rival,"A cheerfully outlandish, crude, and vulgar comedy without pretentions to being anything else. It's not sophisticated humour and certainly no satire on education systems, making it all the more surprizing that so many reviewers have taken it somewhat seriously. Though it does fill an amusing ninety minutes or so if you're in the mood, wondering what outrageous things Cameron Diaz's preposterously inappropriate teacher will say or do next. For a few moments toward the end, it looked as if steps were being taken to redeem the character - only a few steps thankfully. Diaz is enjoyable in the part, but I thought Lucy Punch's wonderfully named Amy Squirrel, Elizabeth's nice, annoying, rival the funniest character and that a bit more could have been made of their feud.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Fair movie about exactly how NOT to teach,"This movie Bad Teacher is not a great movie, but it's fairly enjoyable. Cameron Diaz gives a noteworthy performance but I found the other people gave average performances.This movie is about a woman named Elizabeth Halsey who is forced to take a career in teaching when her sugar-daddy boyfriend (Nat Faxon) dumps her. Elizabeth is an amoral, arrogant, hateful woman who clearly hates teaching. She cusses at her students, drinks heavily, and she smokes- marijuana! The reason why she took the job is because she wants to raise enough money to get a BOOB job! A real woman would not need to get a boob job. Besides Elizabeth, there is the very sweet and VERY annoying Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch), another teacher, and the semi-antagonist who begins to hate Elizabeth when she finds out what she's doing. Amy is a beautiful optimist who enjoys teaching and speaking with her students while Elizabeth hates it. Elizabeth and Amy are complete opposites, which is one the plots of the movie. But deep down, REALLY deep down, Elizabeth does have a good heart but does a lousy job of showing it. Other people on this film include Jason Segel as Russell Gettis, a gym teacher who is smitten with Elizabeth, Justin Timberlake as Scott Delacorte, a substitute teacher whom Elizabeth likes, Phyllis Smith as Lynn Davies, Elizabeth's best friend and assistant, and many more. I really liked Jason Segel in this, just like I did in other movies, especially Knocked Up! He is a very funny man. This is a good movie, but it's definitely not for everyone.This movie, Bad Teacher is not really as funny as it could be, but there are still a few laughs in this. I enjoyed it. I liked Cameron better in The Mask, which is a better movie than this. Enjoy the movie, but just don't expect too much!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
How can something so smutty always feel so safe?,"Let's get one thing out of the way. Bad Teacher is a funny film. Not laugh out loud hilarious, but the jokes land without feeling awkward. Reviews seem overly harsh.But it does occupy this strange area where the bad teacher's behaviour, which would lead to instant dismissal in the real world, always feels harmless.In part this is because Cameron Diaz always brings an element of ""America's Sweetheart"" to her roles. Don't get me wrong, she is very good in this. But she has never convinced as a ""bad girl"". Casting Jason Segel and Justin Timberlake as support shows that there was never any plan to make this a dark comedy.It's not surprising that it slips into a moral tale, because most American comedies do. But if you are looking for truly outrageous behaviour, you're going to be disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not good.,"This was funny in places but horrendous in the outcome, which I will write about so do not read on if you don't want to know. I have generally enjoyed Cameron Diaz's films, and am amazed that she has not had the good sense to give this a miss.The plot has been well-explained, so I won't go into that, suffice it to say that the message of this film is that you can be bone idle, without ethics, cheat (mostly children), be foul-mouthed in front of children, steal test papers for financial gain, blackmail to blacken and discredit a fundamentally genuine and good person who is written as a nerd, and end up on top without consequences, happier, and retaining the money fraudulently obtained. I know it's only a film, but I am the sort of person who does not want to get to the end of a so-called comedy just to find that the message is that crime does pay. And what Cameron's character is written to do is criminal, not just larking about and high-jinks. Where would you find a school that would tolerate a foul-mouthed teacher anyway? Not good.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good comedy, but not without it's faults...","I must say that my hopes were kind of high after seeing the red band trailer for Bad Teacher. In Bad Teacher, we are shown the story of Elisabeth Huksey (Cameron Diaz), who is a teacher in a junior high. She smokes pot, drinks alcohol in class, swears like a sailor and doesn't care about the education of her students (makes them watch movies like ''Scream'' instead). She's just in it for the money. Throughout the film, her goal is to save up as much money as possible in order to pay for her breast implants, which she desires a lot in order to seduce Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), a new substitute teacher, even though Russell Gettis, the gym teacher (played by Jason Segel), has a crush on her. Meanwhile, the state bonus for the best teacher in the state could help Elisabeth get her breast implants, but she will have to tough it out with Amy Squirrel (played by Lucy Punch)...In short, I guess that anyone who read the above synopsis knows where the movie is going. Although the film isn't always predictable, there are many times where it is. In fact, I predicted what the ending would be 35 minutes into the film (well at least part of it, because another part of the ending is totally random). The gags are, for the most part, hit-and-miss: when the gags are funny, they make you laugh, and I mean they make you laugh a lot. But there are times where they miss, and when you can easily hear a little cricket sound throughout the silence of the audience. Elsewhere, Lucy Punch's character was probably meant to be shown as an obnoxious woman, but she got onto my nerves so fast that when her jokes appeared, she just didn't make me laugh so much (although I don't blame Punch for that: Maybe directing???)But my main complaint with this film is that the story really seems to go nowhere. The story focuses on Elisabeth trying to get her implants all along. It never/rarely does anything constructive or creative to elaborate on her situation. There isn't much of a story in there, just a bunch of situations here and there where Elisabeth is in some kind of a pickle. Also in the story, the character of Russell Gettis (pleasant though is, all thanks to Jason Segel) wasn't necessary at all to keep the story going. As far as I can tell, he's pretty much there as a minor tool to make sure the movie keeps going on. And what about the kids? The movie is called Bad Teacher but we rarely see what's become of her students except for two of them. I was expecting something a bit (yes that's a bit of a broad comparison) like School of Rock, where the children do play a role in the story: maybe her kids helping her get the money for her implants would have actually brought the story somewhere.However, as much as I am bashing about it, there are a lot of positive things to say about this movie too. Cameron Diaz as Elisabeth Hulsey was perfect: The role seemed written for her. She shines in this film. Timberlake, Segel, and Punch also shine in their roles due to roles that also seem to be written directly for them, which sort of makes you realize how natural they feel in their characters's shoes. And just like I mentioned before, there is some pretty funny stuff in this film, and when it's funny, you will laugh out loud quite a bit.That being said, this film is far from being a masterpiece. I felt it was lacking pace and that it lacked a real story to interest the viewer. If you're a teen (movie's target audience) and are searching for a raunchy comedy, then maybe you should go see it. But for anyone else, I'd recommend to wait for the DVD release or for it to air on TV. All in all, a disappointing film, but still one that shines in some places thanks to the performances of it's actors and some clever jokes here and there.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
No reason to watch,"Elizabeth Halsey (Diaz) is a bad teacher. She has only two things she is interested in: finding a rich husband and enhancing her breast size.The first third of this movie broadcasts: nudity, foul-mouthed raunchy language, drug use, and in general a deep uncaring for everything appropriate to include her students and their concerns.The next two thirds come in calmer but the language and the uncaring are still with us. There is nothing funny in here. Everything is a scheme to get Ms Halsey what she wants and her ways know no bounds. She is up for everything to get a rich husband and the money to pay for the breast implants. She cons everyone but Amy (Punch) her chief rival, but Amy is no match for this teacher.There is no reason to see this movie. It doesn't serve anyone for anything. This is just another example of Hollywood not knowing what to do anymore. This movie is on the same level as HESHER, and BAD SANTA but not as mean-spirited, but close. Are we starting to see a trend? Perhaps, but let's hope not.The only people you cared for were the ones at the butt of Ms Halsey's foul mouthed barbs.The acting performances were fine -- it is the script that needed work. This could have been funny, but it just comes across as unfunny bathroom humor. There is no salvation to be found in here. At the end of the movie, Ms Halsey behaves the same as she did in the beginning. At least that is the implication I got out of it.Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes. Drug use: Yes.

Bad Teacher = Bad Script,"There have been many memorable acting performances in which teachers are portrayed: Edward J. Olmos as Jaime Escalante in Stand and Deliver; Michelle Pfeiffer as Louanne Johnson in Dangerous Minds; and Robin Williams as John Keating in Dead Poets Society just to name a few. Add Cameron Diaz as Elizabeth Halsey to that list. All four had a strong influence on their students; Escalante, Johnson and Keating were positive influences, whereas Halsey's influence is enough to make one question a school's hiring practice. She's lazy, disinterested in her students, and clearly has one goal in mindto find a rich a man that will take care of her. If that's not influencing your kid on how not to turn out, I don't know what is.The cast of Bad Teacher is terrific, from top to bottom. Cameron Diaz is a riot throughout the movie, whether she's being seductive, devious or a cold hearted bitch. Elizabeth Halsey is someone easy for her colleagues to dislike, but as a viewer I found myself rooting for her. Diaz appears to genuinely enjoy the role she's been cast in. Justin Timberlake looks and acts the part of a geek, which appeared to be the intended result. J.T. is a rising star in film, and with his good looks, charisma and talent is capable of standout performances in anything he does; I can't say that he's very memorable, but he is convincing in the part. I was unfamiliar with Lucy Punch, but thought she really held her own surrounded by a talented and experienced cast. The back and forth between Punch's Amy Squirrel, the 'good teacher', and Diaz's Halsey is extremely entertaining and is what drives the film. Jason Segal isn't in the movie very much, but when on screen he adds additional hilarity in a subdued way. Minor supporting roles played by John Michael Higgins and Phyllis Smith assist in drawing attention to the fun.The closest comparison to Bad Teacher I could think of was Bad Santa. The difference being that I felt Bad Santa was excessive in its use of profanities. There would be cursing when there just wasn't a reason or need for it. In Bad Teacher, the profanity and raunchiness were hysterical, regardless of how over the top. There's one particular scene that comes close, but it's done with purpose to further the story. There are easily going to be people who find this type of movie offensive or excessive. I'm just not one of them. I'm confident that with a weaker cast that Bad Teacher would have just been a bad movie. Thankfully that wasn't the case, and the strength of the film lies in the performers.Oscar worthiness: none Summer movie Grade: C+ Age appropriate: 18+ (not something you want to take your mom to)visit our site at www.twodudereview.com",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

I watched it and had mixed feelings. I mean, it was rather funny, what with the whole 'bad teacher' and all, but they could have made it a lot better. For example, they could have included more aspects of a teacher's life, or more information on their personal life, instead of focusing on one thing the whole time. They could have made it a lot better if they had had more side stores and other dramas, like in all comedy movies (where the main character has a stress buildup, then has a breakdown).Comedy notwithstanding, the film overall was generally good- the actors were fantastic, the effects (if there were any) were flawless and the film was balanced.I would recommend this for a night in, maybe with some friends or family, on 'comedy night' or whatever other people do.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Diaz is a fitting bad girl in this clever albeit completely illogical comedy,"She might have been a rom-com darling for most of her career, but there's no mistaking now that Cameron Diaz is a natural bad girl. Sure, part of it might have to do with survival of the fittest; raunchy R-rated comedies are the new cool kid in class and those who can't play that game will find themselves jobless. But Diaz might have even upped her stock with her performance in ""Bad Teacher,"" a movie that's unapologetically crude if not to the fault of absurdity. Nevertheless, foul-mouthed middle school teacher Elizabeth Halsey makes for an amusing character study (no worries, you can skate by on the cliff notes).Writers Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky have essentially taken the laundry list of what qualities constitute a good teacher and ensured that Elizabeth embodies or does the opposite. To top it off (no pun intended), her motivation throughout the entire film is to raise enough money to afford breast implants, or as her character would be more apt to say, ""a new pair of t***,"" so that she might be able to woo the attractive and wealthy new substitute (Justin Timberlake).Entire films have been built from shallower foundations, but for those bothered by issues of plausibility, ""Bad Teacher"" will be offensive in more ways than the many it already intended. How someone of Elizabeth's nature ever got a teaching position in the first place will be the one question that crosses the mind of every viewer at some point during the film. Once you get past that whole in logic, it becomes easier to appreciate the way ""Bad Teacher"" allows us a chance to imagine what the world's worst teacher would be like.Elizabeth is about to finish her first (and only) year at John Adams Middle School somewhere in Illinois and wed the ""man of her dreams"" only he and his mother are on to the fact that she only wants him for the money. Her plan having failed, she returns to ""JAMS"" as a means of keeping herself (and her poor lifestyle) afloat. Her return reignites the gym teacher's (Jason Segel) advances and a rivalry with her polar opposite, the spunky learning-lover Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch). Other than Diaz, Punch is the only one who seems aware of how absurd the film is and consequently she pushes it further with her delightfully quirky performance.The depths to which both Elizabeth and Amy will stoop to get what they want or ruin the other have no limit. Their schemes are cleverly concocted, though they're along the lines of your typical high jinks. Putting aside that their entire story relies on an unusually large suspension of disbelief, Eisenberg and Stupnitsky show a knack for writing easily digested crowd-pleasers. The array of other supporting characters could be described as either run-of-the-mill or perfectly adequate. Timberlake makes few waves as a socially oblivious dork who as it turns out has a passion for dry-humping and John Michael Higgins delivers exactly what's expected of him: acting like John Michael Higgins. Phyllis Smith brings her ""The Office"" character over to this film with a measure of success, but only those unfamiliar with her will be impressed.The small ounce of a ""good message"" comes with a slight lowering of Elizabeth's superficial expectations after her grand plan unfurls. The natural thought here would be to completely ignore any sort of moral responsibility to end on a warm and fuzzy note considering all previous material dismisses it anyway. Yet some sort of Hollywood obligation must have nagged for awhile. Forget Elizabeth, the fact that Segel's character Russell would want anything to do with her beginning, middle or end of the film says a lot (though quite little) about his character.The R-rated comedy trend continues to thrive with ""Bad Teacher,"" though for better or worse it's hard to say. Calling it a guilty pleasure comedy might be the most apt description, as even those who really enjoy it will admit just where it falls on the preposterous spectrum. Considering many previous Cameron Diaz vehicles have fallen into the guilty pleasure category too, maybe the actress has been in her comfort zone all along.~Steven CVisit my site! moviemusereviews.com",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Lynn is an amazing character, and Justin Timberlake's awkward and wild jean sex scene is memorable. The comedic content is consistent and had me cracking up. The car wash scene and the bathroom sequence were hilarious. The ending has a smart, full-circle element that is well executed.In conclusion, Bad Teacher is a unique and worthwhile addition to the comedy genre that's a must-see. I would score this a 7/10 and strongly recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Labored and lame,"I can't believe I actually managed to get through this movie. It was everything that has been wrong with American comedy and them some. Actors who have previously dealt us some high quality work having their efforts reduced to a sitcom laugh track level just doesn't make sense I can only be directing and editing to blame for this badly timed badly executed and quite possibly badly written mess. It looked recycled and labored from the first few minutes and the following 90 mins was completely consistent with that, painfully so.Movies and comedy in general have moved on so far from this and the actors in this steaming pile have been in some of the better examples of that progress. In the light of that this movie just doesn't make sense. Why doe it even exist?",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cameron Diaz Makes This Movie Work!,"I really have to give all the credit to Ms. Cameron Diaz. For her to be playing a crass, bitter, lazy and cruel middle school teacher whose shallow aim for teaching was to get herself a breast implant and snag a rich man to marry, Cameron still manages to make the character absolutely funny, delightful and actually worth rooting for. I really do not know how she does it, but she manages to do so. She has that certain unique indescribable quality that could make such an unpleasant character appear cute.Cameron may be so much older now from her debut in ""The Mask"" with Jim Carrey, but she still slinked in that car wash scene like the best of them. Her long legs and lithe body still serve her very well in this scene as if she were just half her present age. I thought her comic timing was on point in most of her scenes. This girl is really very funny! I cannot imagine any other actress who can run with this Elizabeth Halsey and make her likable.Being raunchy and naughty, this certainly is not a movie to watch with your parents. Cameron and her ex-lover Justin Timberlake figure in a most unusual and awkward sex scene. Scenes with cuss words, drug use, and hurting children are in liberal supply here. I generally would not like a movie with scenes like this, but thanks to Cameron Diaz and her inexplicable x-factor charm, I found it really funny and generally had a good time watching it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cameron Diaz has only a few years left,"I like Cameron but I think she took this movie because her options are running out. The first review I read gave it 10 stars and said the only people who that won't like this are the cheerleader types because it portrays the ""RAH RAH"" charter in the work place negatively, Well, I'm not that type of person and the movie stunk. In fact the character portrayals were irrelevant because they were over exaggerated, not well thought out and couldn't be taken seriously at any level to be moved or offended. We've seen this movie 1000 times that takes several shocking sound bite scenes using language/behavior that they think is clever and edgy but in reality it's just old. It was poorly written and the only thing they had was Cameron as the headliner to make money. Unfortunately Cameron has only a couple movies at best left which is why she's cashing in when she can. All her movies are blending into the same character like in this movie and its getting old. We'll see!",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
C Bad Teacher,"The summer comedy, Bad Teacher, is filled with jokes – an number of which don't quite work, but when the film works, it gets some big laughs from the audience. Elizabeth Halsey, played by Cameron Diaz, is not a reluctant educator who wakes up to her gifts over the course of the film – she's selfish, stupid, and completely superficial. Her only goal in life is to get a boob job so she can attract a rich, attractive man – and if she needs to ""teach"" to earn the money, so be it.Although I generally don't care for Cameron Diaz, she does a fairly decent job in this role – her comedic timing is excellent, and she doesn't get too absorbed in the paper-thin plot to take the edge off of her character.The script by Gene Stupnitsky & Lee Eisenberg is decent overall, but it didn't have a strong resolution – substantially weakening the movie. Fortunately, the large and talented cast including Lucy Punch, Jason Segel, Phyllis Smith, John Michael Higgins, and Dave ""Gruber"" Allen hold the shaky script together. All of them make the best of the material provided to them and Justin Timberlake delivers a shockingly impressive comedic performance.When everything is taken into account, Bad Teacher has strong acting and some great jokes, but the failed jokes and weak plot make it an average movie. It's entertaining, but not quite worth the ticket price, so it earns a ""C.""",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Bad Teacher (2011) - I Have Such a Terrible Teacher!,"""Bad Teacher"" is one of those movies where the audience just agrees with the movie that their own teacher is a mean, ruthless, antagonizing, and a messed-up (fill in the blanks). Cameron Diaz stars in a new comedy, where she plays an inappropriate teacher who starts crushing for Justin Timberlake as the new substitute teacher, and starts raising money for useless boob jobs. Then she ends up having Jason Segel's gym teacher trying to crush on her, tries being friends with John Michael Higgins as a dolphin-obsessed principal, and tries to avoid the antagonizing advantages of Lucy Punch's across-the-hall teacher. Now, ""Bad Teacher"" may have its moments, but it's quite disappointing. First of all, one of the only things I liked about this movie was Cameron Diaz's surprising performance. She is really charismatic, and her stupidity and sexy looks makes her funny. Also, I'm a total fan of Jason Segel, and I really loved him in this movie. Although there were some funny moments, ""Bad Teacher"" has its negative moments. ""Bad Teacher"" is not really a perfect comedy, because it's not well-written, well-raunchy, and not even well-comedic like ""Bridesmaids"" or ""Horrible Bosses"". Also, Justin Timberlake makes an average performance that any other actor can do, and John Michael Higgins was okay. But Lucy Punch created the most weirdest and stupid performance ever on screen, and I hated her so much in this movie. She is such an annoying role, and I hope she gets a Razzie award nomination. ""Bad Teacher"" may have it's funny moments, and maybe Cameron and Jason delivered hilarious performances, it's not as good as all the other better comedies of the year. ""Bad Teacher"", in my review, ""sometimes hilarious, but nothing special"".",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The word ""bad"" may be in the title, but Bad Teacher is anything but!","It may have the word ""bad"" in its title, but this film is anything but. Within the first few minutes, I was laughing and I practically didn't stop the whole time. As is with some of the great R-rated comedies of the last few years (i.e. The Hangover and Knocked Up), this movie features some of the funniest writing.. making for a very raunchy but hilarious good time! I'm a pretty big fan of Cameron Diaz, anyway, so it's always fun to see her do something she hasn't really done before... and playing the foul-mouthed, junior high teacher Elizabeth Halsey was just a great casting job! While the storyline is a pretty shallow one and you won't find any moral lesson here, it is still just about everything you could wish for in a comedy. It centers around Ms. Halsey whose engagement was just broken off on the terms that she is a ""gold digger."" As she begins to work her charm on the new substitute teacher, though, she finds herself going head-to-head with one of the school's most well-loved teachers, Amy Squirrel.The main cast is rounded out by the hilarious Lucy Punch, Justin Timberlake and Jason Segal, as well as a great supporting cast that includes Phyllis Smith, John Michael Higgins, Eric Stonestreet and Molly Shannon.

A teacher like her would be fired after the first week, but since this is Hollywood, she gets to keep her job. Basically, the whole movie is her sleeping in class, drinking in class, while she schemes too get the rich substitute teacher to fall for her.

Did you ever go to a play where the actors all 'overacted?' This was how Lucy Punch spoke all of her lines. Maybe that was in the script, but I found it annoying (like I find most plays to be). I looked at her biography and she has over 50 credits, of which I have never seen any of (I don't watch TV much). Justin Timberlake fans: Sorry but his character is super Boring.

"She's possibly bad on teaching, but she's very good on many other things!","BAD TEACHER is an enjoyable comedy featuring Cameron Diaz on the main role. It's funny, entertaining and it shows us a ""bad ass"" Cameron Diaz, which is a teacher that does everything except instruct her pupils The plot is quite nice and even a bit uncommon, at least for this type of comedy. The jokes are very good, especially some of them which are very subtle but effective. One thing that I did appreciate - and it's not very common in this type of movies - is that the main character ELIZABETH (played by Cameron Diaz) didn't get punished by her ""dirty schemes"". In fact the end surprised me a little bit because her personality and her behavior didn't change as much as I had imagined when the movie started. And that is good because it didn't feel clichéd. Overall I think BAD TEACHER is a refreshing comedy that deserves a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Crude... but I like it,"'Bad Teacher' sets the bar low and clears it with ease.The film's unalloyed tastelessness is its best quality. Diaz bludgeons the viewer with vulgarity and coarseness, and I admired the way she tears into her role. She has no redeeming qualities, yet I rooted for her. If you can surrender and allow yourself to be dragged into the muck, it's an enjoyable ride.The jokes come fast. Not all are funny, but enough of them score to keep things moving. The supporting performances are superb. There are many experienced comedic actors here adding funny bits with great timing. Timberlake had the weakest written part, but even he ripped off a few zingers. I probably got the biggest chuckles from the bits in the unrated version that were cut out of the theatrical cut. They were truly crude. I'm not proud of it, but there it is. Such is the charm of this one if you go for that sort of thing.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dreadful film,"If the idea was to make a film of the same ilk as Bad Santa then I'm afraid everyone involved with this dross missed the mark completely.The worse scenes were the putative car wash scene which tried to borrow from the famous Cool Hand Luke car wash scene but was neither sexy nor funny and the really sad dry humping scene between Miss Diaz and Mr Timberlake.When I watched it there was not one single laugh from the audience. At best it raised just a couple of sniggers.Horrid, unsympathetic characters and a truly dull story line that will make you wish you spent your time and money elsewhere if like me you go to see it.However, my 16 year old daughter believes I'm wide of the mark and enjoyed it enough to rate it a 5/10.She is wrong.

A great Cameron Diaz vehicle,"The comic set-up of a slacker in an important profession is getting some legs lately with Bad Teacher, Bad Judge, Bad Santa, and Brooklyn Nine Nine (which is essentially ""Bad Cop"") and why shouldn't it? TV, film and real-life are all inundated with people who take their jobs too seriously, so this is a refreshing charms.The film comes in a phase in Cameron Diaz's career where she was no longer America's hot it girl (her ""advanced"" age is even referenced in Diaz's other 2011 film ""The Green Hornet) and could have fun indulging in her comic persona which generally has a bit of a bite to it. The film can be read as a commentary on Diaz actively rebelling the shorter expiration date for hot film actresses by trying in vain to raise the money for a boob job and attempting to con real life ex-boyfriend Justin Timberlake (who likely will not run out of roles 20 years from now) into marrying him. Back when Diaz was known for her supermodel looks and screen presence, her comic gifts were taken for granted which is why this has been such an interesting phase in her career.As for the film itself, while the premise is risqué, the film is in the mold of a classic comedy. It uses the medium well (something movies have to do more and more in this age of TV comedy) by filling up its two hours with nicely outstretched character arcs and big scenes (i.e. the car wash, the field trip). Lucy Punch, Phyllis Smith, John Michael Higgins and the endearing Jason Segel shine strong in supporting parts as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not great but watchable,"Bad Teacher is definitely not a great movie, not even a great comedy, but the haters seem to miss the fact that the standout fact here is that Diaz can hold her own in the crass comedy culture.

"There might be something about Mary, there's nothing about Elizabeth","Cameron Diaz Should think about firing her agent after starring in this insipid little film as Liz Halsey, a superficial sad sack of a teacher who's more interested in getting a boob job and finding a rich husband than actually doing her job. Actually It could've been funny based on that premise but sadly that's far from the case here. I can't recall laughing once, which confused me for a second as director Jake Kasdan has had a lot of great credits to his name in the past, but than I realized that both writers for this swill were involved in the ""year One"" travesty and It all clicked into place.

I even love her as a bad girl,"Cameron Diaz is my favorite actress and I think the most beautiful one I have ever seen. I have been smitten with her ever since I saw Charlie's Angels. She has played different roles, and always excelled, but I don't think I've ever seen her play a bad girl before. I assume that she had a ball making this film because she really gets to play one here! I remember my favorite high school teacher was Mrs. Martin, whom I'd English with, in one of her classes we read Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird. In the film, Diaz has her students read it as well and I thought my dear former teacher would have had a conniption if she could have seen the character she plays. Elizabeth Halsey is the teach from hell. There is literally nothing redeeming about her. She is foul-mouthed, an alcoholic and druggie, selfish, shallow, vain and is concerned more with her bosoms then in inspiring her students (all they do in her class is watch movies). Even when she changes and starts really teaching them, its only for a selfish reason. However, our girl Cameron still makes this a movie worth watching. You don't root for her character but she still makes this film even if she puts the ""anti"" in anti-heroine. I guess Cameron could play the devil himself and I would still pay the price of admission so maybe I'm biased. I did want to mention another scene stealing performance in the movie. A young English actress with the wonderful name Lucy Punch steals the show as ""Mrs. Squirrel"". Even with as bad a teacher as this, I still give this movie an ""A"".",,Anonymous,Romance
Highly Predictable!,"The story of the film itself is not new and lacks any originality but the way characters were presented has made matters worse. There are a whole bunch of movies like this and one movie comes in my mind for now. Easy A, a movie like this filled with similar elements but had sensible way to show everything. Here the story suffers from overpowering a particular individual and in this case Cameron Diaz character. The place and the people around her are shown as if they are living under some burden and indirectly Cameron looked to be dominating all the time. The ending was particularly unimpressive where we see a lot happening suddenly. After seeing the ending I am genuinely confused about the motto of the film regarding good and bad. Performance wise Cameron performed OK and not astonishingly, but a big letdown was from the supporting cast owing to their wooden dialogs. The story itself was highly predictable. I could not sympathize with the central character at any point of time.VERDICT: 'Don't bother.'",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

She clearly hates her body with an all consuming passion, seeing it as an obstacle to getting what she wants out of life. She is constantly dissociating by use of drugs and alcohol, and vents her feelings of frustration by bullying and neglecting her students and showing aggression towards colleagues. She struggles from feelings of jealousy and inadequacy and even steals from the school. While she is desperate to change something in her life, she has not examined the root cause of her issues and is not effective in her approach.

If I had to summarize it, I would guess that a bunch of immature, perverted guys got together, figured out how to blackmail a few good actors and put together a raunchy, tasteless, low life film. Which I would have saved my money to get my eyebrows waxed...would have been a less painful experience.

Poison Apple.,"Raunchy, disgusting, and stomach-churning mess has teacher Cameron Diaz doing seemingly anything and everything to be the worst teacher in the history of mankind in a junior high school. She is a superficial air-head who dreams of making just enough money for breast enhancement so she can get substitute teacher Justin Timberlake to notice her and ultimately marry him. It seems Timberlake's family has a fortune based on owning one of the world's most famous wristwatch companies (yawn). The antagonist here is fellow instructor Lucy Punch who seems more suited to a kindergarten class than a junior high school with sickening antics which seem to belittle and annoy everyone in sight. Also along for the ride is crude gym teacher Jason Segel who is not much of a better employee than Diaz and seems to have a crush on her. I guess it is true that birds of a feather will always flock together. ""Bad Teacher"" starts off fairly enough, but the routine drops off the cliff quickly.

Badness is missing.,"I've always considered Cameron Diaz a good actress, even sometimes making average movies or accepting weak roles that never required much of her capabilities. Even though, she sporadicly make movies with quite interesting roles like: My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), Being John Malkovich (1999), Any Given Sunday (1999), Gangs Of New York (2002), The Box (2009), among others. Even in Charlie's Angels (2000) and in CA: Full Throttle (2003) she gives very funny moments.Bad Teacher seemed to be the movie she was waiting to be able to use all her powering beauty and strong presence together with a heavy dark humor, since she already had experience characters with some dark sides but they were never entirely bad as the bad teacher seemed to be.Well, the teacher is bad, but not heavily and totally bad, and a lot of badness is missing. She's just a bitter woman that lives an unhappy life with no money and no big tits. She isn't intelligent enough to be a teacher, but is enough to be placed as one. Some kind disappointing for those ones who expected not a very interesting plot or something like that, but at least a character that could use and abuse all the meanings of what is to be bitchy and mean. But the concept of the word may be different for the writers and also the development of the movie is quite poor. If being bad means smoking pot and sleeping during classes, pff... please, I've met worse. Maybe writers should have watched some Bette Davis classics as inspirations about what the meaning ""bad"" means between humans, like Of Human Bondage (1934), The Letter (1940) or The Little Foxes (1941), just as a start.But anyway, Cameron is getting better with the age, her timing is really great, and she seems to be just having fun in this one. Lucy Punch, as Amy Squirrel, is incredibly funny and talented, and for those ones who are not familiar to her I always recommend Being Julia (2004), maybe her first major role. Justin Timberlake does his part well and also the rest of the cast, helping to save the movie from the drowning. But in the end is all about Cameron. Even the movie being weak, with a tedious plot and not even a memorable scene or great sequence, Bad Teacher is watchable just because of her presence.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

In the course of doing so, she embezzles cash from a school fund-raiser, lures an exam-board worker to his office with the promise of sex before drugging him and stealing the latest test sheets, and frames a hard-working and honest co-worker for the possession of drugs (after stealing her boyfriend). By the end of the film, Diaz's character is still as morally reprehensible as ever, having learnt nothing about the value of teaching (except for the monetary rewards that comes with results), which makes the whole sorry mess a totally pointless exercise. The moral of the movie seems to be 'do whatever the hell you want, no matter how it affects those around you'. What a lovely sentiment!Jake Kasdan, director of the recent Jumanji movies, fails to raise many laughs, working from a puerile and vulgar script that is more embarrassing than it is funny. Diaz is there, of course, to flaunt her body, which she does a lot, and she is still in cracking shape for someone knocking on the door of 40; however, time has been less forgiving on her face, which prevents her from being the complete sexy package that she is supposed to be in this film. To sum up: zero life lessons learnt, cringeworthy comedy, and a star who looks good in daisy dukes, but whose shelf life as a sex symbol is clearly coming to an end.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Some good laughs, but HORRIBLE plot","I did not check the spoiler box because if you can't figure out what happens, you stopped paying attention.Its not right that the good wholesome 'antagonist' is painted as a lunatic, while the immoral 'hero' comes out unscathed and with what she (even if she didn't know it (even if we knew it)).The plot overall was weak... she wanted to get fake breasts, but needed $5000 or so. So she went to a lot of trouble, a ridiculous amount of trouble to do so. So far as to make an attempt at doing her job of teaching kids, so they could pass the state test, and she would win coincidentally $5700 for having the most kids pass.So although the plot is horrible, there were quite a few one liners. They don't make up for the bad plot though.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not the Funniest Comedy of 2011 but It Works,"Gold-digger Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) is forced back into the teaching position she despises after being dumped by her rich boyfriend. Instead of instructing the students and nurturing their young minds, she shows them movies like Lean On Me and Dangerous Minds while sneaking in sips of booze and cat napping at her desk. She hones in on Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), a handsome substitute teacher who belongs to a family of considerable wealth but, to her dismay, he falls for the star teacher, Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch). Intent on snagging herself another sugar daddy, she starts saving money for breast implants but her efforts to afford the $10,000 price tag aren't enough.After she learns the teacher whose class receives the highest state test scores is awarded a $5,700 bonus check, she starts making her students apply themselves but her aggressive teaching style yields nothing but bellyaching and malcontent. Determined to win the money, she poses as an investigative journalist following up on claims that the state exams discriminate against blacks and minorities, allowing her an the opportunity to steal the test questions from Carl Halabi (Thomas Lennon). The hostile rivalry between Elizabeth and Amy turns into full- scale war after Elizabeth's students scores are, not only the highest in the entire county but, enough to unseat Amy's three year victory.There are plenty of rotten pranks and downright nasty schemes that go on throughout the film, along with drinking and drugs, lots of swearing, an awkward dry-humping scene, and a pair of surgically enhanced breasts that will have men's eyes popping right out of their sockets. The humor is hit-and-miss but when it succeeds, it's shamefully funny. It's no comedic gem but it does satisfy a guilty pleasure to see Diaz play a greedy, thoughtless, conniving bitch. In Hollywood years, she's 'old' but, damn, she is looking better than ever and I give her props for flaunting what she's got in Bad Teacher.I loved Lucy Punch as Amy Squirrel. Who is this woman who nailed the role of a well-intentioned but batshit crazy teacher so perfectly? She captured all of Amy's neurotic tendencies, exasperating competitiveness, nervous tics, and the smarmy smile that I kept hoping Elizabeth would knock right off of her face. Thumbs up to Jason Segel as Russell, the school gym teacher pining for Elizabeth, John Michael Higgins as the overwhelmed Principal Snur, and Phyllis Smith as reserved, mousy Lynn. The only person I didn't get was Justin Timberlake's character - he was just plain weird and dull.This was a mediocre comedy saved by its cast. There is a lot that doesn't make sense and you basically have to toss your morals to the wayside. Don't get too analytical. This movie is not an attack on the fine men and women who sacrifice salary for their passion to teach. It's a short-sighted, bawdy summertime flick that wants to tickle your funny bone, even if it doesn't always succeed.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bad Teacher,"What to say about Bad Teacher? Rude, crude, immoral, politically incorrect, tacky...and outrageously fun.Go in with the expectation of a few laughs and some dirty jokes, and you'll be fine. Try to look for anything else, you're in trouble. This is one of those movies to watch, laugh over, then pretty much forget afterward.That's not to say that Cameron Diaz doesn't absolutely knock her role as the titular bad teacher Elizabeth Halsey (who needs to return to a teaching job after being dumped by her fiance so she can make money for some, ahem, work) right out of the park, because she does - absolutely brilliant from start to finish. And quite easy on the eye, too.The rest of the cast is good, especially Jason Sudekis and Justin Timberlake feature heavily.Like so many of these gross-out comedies, Bad Teachers manages to be a little sweet and sentimental as well.Good fun.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just laugh - do not ask for a plot,"Bad Teacher is the perfect role for Cameron Diaz and she executes it splendidly. Jason Segel is a favourite of mine and he does ok, although you can see that he really wishes that he did not have to hold back, that he is not the center of attention in this one. Justin Timberlake is, as always, Justin Timberlake. He must be the only person that actually managed to cross the threshold from music to movies. Lucy Punch is great. The other actors are also doing a good job (sorry for not having the time to name you all)!BUT the best performance goes to. Phyllis Smith who really holds the entire movie together with her small comments.Anyhow, this movie is fun. It is not thoughtful. It is not politically correct.

'BAD TEACHER' is an OK movie.,"'BAD TEACHER': Three Stars (Out of Five)Cameron Diaz stars in this raunchy dark satire, continuing the popular trend of female powered vulgar R rated comedies. She plays an uninspired and useless Chicago junior high teacher who treats her students like annoying stepping stones to her dream life. The movie is obviously a jab at tenure but is mostly just a light hearted dark comedy rather than any kind of political commentary. Jake Kasdan directed the film and Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg wrote it. It's not the best example of it's genre but it could have been a lot worse, definitely not a bad way to spend your time.Diaz plays Elizabeth Halsey, a teacher with no passion for teaching who drinks a lot, gets stoned a lot and swears a lot (in front of her students). She's always planned on marrying rich and leaving the working life behind and as the movie opens she's all set to do that. Then her fiancé's mother catches on to her scheming ways and talks her son in to calling off the wedding. Halsey despairingly returns to work and sets her eyes on a new rich sub (Justin Timberlake) but realizes in order to impress him she's going to need a boob job. So she plots one despicable scam after another ripping her school off of money in order to pay for the expensive operation. She faces competition from a fellow teacher (brilliantly portrayed by Lucy Punch) and also has to deal with the unwanted affection of the gym teacher (Jason Segel).The movie is most importantly funny, it might not have any huge laughs but the jokes for the most part work. Thanks in large part to a nearly flawless cast. Punch is the scene stealer but Diaz holds her own, Segel is convincingly cool and witty and Timberlake is adequate (at least he's been sticking to roles he can pull off lately). There's also nice supporting turns from John Michael Higgins and Phyllis Smith (from TV's 'THE OFFICE'). Kasdan's directing is fitting to the material and I can see why the screenplay attracted the cast it did. It's got heart here and there but the lead character is definitely too unlikeable to ever really care about and what she gets away with in the film is kind of sickening. It is a dark comedy but it would have been nice to have someone to root for (besides Segel, who's part is way too small).Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXu8bs0LI9A",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Targeted to young teenage boys,"My girlfriend dragged me to this piece of garbage. It is rumored that Hollywood has been focusing on the teen audience for the past decade or so. Or more accurately, the ""Beavis and Butthead"" teen audience. This movie supports that theory. The movie is about a hot looking woman with a pot mouth, who spends 90 minutes apparently trying to shock her parents with her bad language and crude jokes. Nobody was laughing. This movie, if you can call it that, will not appeal to adults or middle-class teens either.

Cameron And Her Boob Job,"Bad Teacher is a comedy about one who is precisely that and the title role is played by Cameron Diaz. She thinks she's through with teaching, but a bad breakup convinces her that she needs a little frontal enhancement to get the man of her dreams. But cosmetic surgery doesn't come cheap so it's back to work and at a teacher's salary it won't be easy. Remember her insurance won't cover it.Diaz is the kind of teacher that you don't learn much from, but does give those junior high school boys a lot of wet and sleepless nights. But when she finds out that a $5700.00 bonus will come with a class that has the best scholastic achievement, it provides a powerful motive for her to actually teach and cut a few corners.In the meantime Diaz has to deal with fellow teachers Justin Timberlake and Jason Segal who both thinks her measurements are just fine as they are. She also has to watch for Lucy Punch who plays a popular teacher looking to nail her in a scandal. Punch has some of the best moments in this film, she apparently modeled her character on the happy homemaker character Betty White created on the Mary Tyler Moore Show back in the day. Jillian Armenante best known for being on the Judging Amy Show a few years back plays Diaz's confidante among the teachers.Bad Teacher was an interesting idea for a film that didn't quite make it. It has some good moments, but I never could develop a rooting interest as to whether Cameron gets her money for that boob enhancement. In fact males of junior high school and high school age will like Bad Teacher, but I think it will fall flat among adults.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Average Grade,"Bad teacher is not a bad movie; it's just like most teachers we've known—average—just surviving. And so, Cameron Diaz's Elizabeth Halsey has one goal: to find a man to take care of her, a difficult task in a middle school where the richest teacher turns out to be too weird to take seriously. The gym teacher: too poor.On the way to her survival, she takes drugs, seduces, steals, and cheats—just generally a bad teacher who nonetheless gets asked back. Not a totally unusual situation for those of us who have been around education for a while and seen a rogue teacher or two or three. Or those of us who enjoyed Billy Bob Thornton's Bad Santa, in which his ""bad"" becomes the litmus test. Bad Teacher is a weak cousin for its lack of bite and Billy Bob's charming maliciousness.What's interesting about Elizabeth is that she's not very likable; she's just a hard case doing her wicked best. In fact, she has enough moxie to make her more interesting than just about any other colleague, administrators included. The antics she pulls like smoking pot in her car or giving a boy student her bra are indefensible and would lead to most teachers' dismissal, but for the purposes of fiction and comedy, she gets a kind of audience tenure.Then, too, if I had a teacher who looked like that, I might have learned something, anything, just to keep her around. What we finally learn is that looks count and good guys finish last. Lessons learned.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Bad Apple - A Bit Fruity, but Good","Cameron Diaz plays an aging teacher who tries to spice up her life with drugs and alcohol. Then she meets a rich man who breaks up with her. Then she wants to get a 10,000 dollar boob job. I know lots of teachers like her.They all make the same dumb mistakes, but this is the movies, so Diaz gets away with her mistakes. Diaz does a really good job of playing a ditz, but in real life she is actually very intelligent. I didn't buy some of the language used with middle school students, but I guess I am not with the times. There are a LOT of teachers who use the movie method of teaching, by the way.The antagonist in the film is a ditzy redhead who is a bit over the top, and Justin Timberlake was funny in a few scenes, but miscast.

Some of the classroom sequences are quite funny, and the movie holds up pretty well as a romantic comedy.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Shockingly Bad,"I have become somewhat of a Cameran Diaz fan lately so I decided to give this film a try. (The extensive marketing didn't hurt either.) I was shocked at how bad it was.Something is incongruent and off about this movie. The script is hit and miss, as is the acting. It's just...awkward. There were so many awkward silences in the theater I attended, so many moments that you knew the writers wanted you to laugh, but it just.wasn't.funny. In fact, some of the more offensive parts sneak up on you and you're just left dumbfounded, like ""Did they really mean to put that in the movie?"" See the periodic race references. They are a major miss, borderline racist and all the way offensive.Anyway, I'm surprised Timberlake agreed to play this nothing role, after getting so much acclaim for other roles. Diaz has the soft talent to carry a film like this, but she missed the mark too. Lucy Punch is okay but many of the awkward joke moments come from her character.I don't know.

A poorly written farce,"I couldn't for the life of me figure out why Cameron Diaz's makeup was so overdone; pancake, pancake and more pancake. (I thought possibly that they were trying to make her look younger since she seems to be too old for the part, by covering over facial lines.) More important for my low rating is that 'Bad Teacher' is a poorly written farce and at times, is excruciating to watch when it subjects some of the supporting characters to humiliation to get a laugh. More lines now to meet the ridiculous 10 line minimum: There is a scene in the gym where the plain looking, highly overweight teacher 'friend' of Elizabeth (Diaz) shows up.

"Bad teacher, indifferent movie","'Bad Teacher' is a film that sounds as if it should be fun: Cameron Diaz plays someone meeting this description, a young woman with no real desire to teach. But the result is very disappointing. Firstly, with typical Hollywood sexism, her professional indifference comes from an expectation of securing a rich man to look after her. But more importantly, not a lot happens in the film. We don't see extraordinary displays of bad teaching or bad behaviour; there isn't even that hoary old chestnut, the redemption story. Instead, another (not particularly sympathetic) teacher tries to expose Diaz, and fails, and that's about it. It's neither realistic nor entertaining, while Diaz, to be frank, looks a little odd, her approaching middle age hidden behind a peculiar face-mask - she neither seems young or old, but a rather curious twenty-going on-forty. There's surely the potential for a rich black comedy in the basic idea; but sadly, this isn't it.",,Anonymous,Romance
Cameron Diaz fits perfectly into the role,"Diaz plays money-seeking Elizabeth Halsey, a woman who somehow managed to become a teacher while waiting to marry her rich fiancé. She completes a year at her school doing the absolute bare minimum of teaching. But her fiancé dumps her after learning of her gold digging ways and now she finds herself stuck teaching at the school that she was just getting ready to leave for good. Elizabeth quickly learns that a new teacher played by Justin Timberlake comes from a very wealthy family. So she sets her radar on him as her next husband to be. He's the complete opposite of her, but that doesn't matter. He's very polite and rather nerdy. In fact, he's much more like Elizabeth's rival teacher Miss Squirrel. Once he starts getting close with the prissy Miss Squirrel, it becomes a battle of wits between the two women to be with him. But Elizabeth is out to get him for all the wrong reasons of course. While she sleeps through class and just plays movies for her students to watch, she spends the rest of her time trying to impress the wealthy new teacher and win him over. AdvertisementTimberlake, who's proved he can be very funny through all his appearances on Saturday Night Live, isn't really given much to do here. He just plays the clean-cut nerdy guy the best that he can. Jason Segal, who plays a fellow gym teacher, gets more of the laughs. His character sees right through Elizabeth but pursues her anyway. He goes along with everything she does but still makes sure to put her in check too. He's the one person at the school that she's able to relate to a little it seems. Watching the film you'll wonder if Elizabeth will find any sort of redemption and change her ways. You get the sense that Segal's character is the one person who can help her with that. The movie has some funny one-liners and interesting scenes, but I wouldn't say it's laugh-out-loud hilarious or anything. Still, it's a pretty funny premise and Cameron Diaz fits perfectly into the role. It's not a movie you'll remember down the road but it's worth checking out at least.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Bad teacher; The experience of an empty bottle,"A comedy centered around a foul-mouthed, junior high teacher who, after being dumped by her sugar daddy, begins to woo a colleague -- a move that pits her against a well-loved teacher. (IMDb) The story has been structured weakly. The main character is a teacher (Elizabeth\ Cameron Diaz), that uses marijuana, cheats in the exams, lies, and extorts steals. The first description above has written in IMDb that makes this movie like an challenge against the rules in society. But question is; this movie can be in this field? My question strongly is NO. We face with a character that has no psychological integrity. Character hasn't been defined properly. Seems the teacher supposed to be a positive person but truth is she is not and has no right to harm others but she does. She is teacher in a school that nobody cares what's going on. Also parents don't consider the value of education for their children. Despite these kinds of behaviors, she is a hero in this movie. She is a teacher who cares about students, and also she cares about the school. Writer for being sure this movies has no way to survive, plans this character like an idiot. All of the characters are stupid except Elizabeth that she can do everything but nobody can arrest her. She lives in a city full of idiots. All of the characters (except her) are passive. Actually seems this movie has just one character and writers (Gene Stupnisky & Lee Eisenberg), just added others too show that somebody else are living in this town but they have nothing to do to push forward the story. Jake Kasdan (October 28, 1974) also has used all his efforts to make sure that film will have weaknesses much more than script. These are included the play of casts, decoupage, editing and etc., which are reason that film doesn't proceed. Inert and motionless characteristic of the movie has overshadowed on the entire film.

Or a normal, slacker person.The word play and various satirical remarks on society and education various habits of teenagers are pretty funny. What gets me most about this is that the laugh factor doesn't go away at all. It's a cult classic I think for anyone who teaches or is in higher education as a living to laugh off what so few people actually do.The thing is movie ratings exist for a reason, if people have issues with drug use and vulgarity you don't have to watch it, this movie had a set audience and has a lot of redeeming moments despite the cynicism in the film.

"Very funny, but feels a little rushed","I went in to see Bad Teacher with fairly high expectations. The trailers were really good and I hoped the film would live up to them. Mostly, I'd say it did, although it was't quite what I'd expected.Before I explain what I didn't like about the film, I'll start with what I did. Some of it is very funny and it's far better than some other recent comedies, such as The Dilemma, which has to be the worst comedy I've seen this year. Jason Segel was good in his role even though he doesn't have a whole lot of screen time.Unfortunately, there were several scenes and lines that seemed out of place and some of the film felt kinda dis-jointed. The plot was pretty thin and the first half of movie was more like watching a series of loosely-linked scenes rather than a proper film.That said, it's still pretty funny and I'd recommend it if you liked similar movies, but you're probably just best waiting for the DVD unless you really want to see the film, then go to the cinema.I give Bad Teacher 8/10; I know it's being pretty generous considering what I've said about the film, although I'd much rather watch this again than the likes of The Dilemma or Hall Pass.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Shouldn't it be 'Terrible Teacher' ?,"For a movie of this caliber, I had expected more. Sadly, this movie was not all it could have been.The storyline in itself is good enough, there is a hint of comedy, romance and drama in it. But the whole part about a teacher getting away with just showing movies every day to the students is so lame and not believable at all. Plus, as a comedy there weren't all that many funny scenes throughout the movie.They did have a great cast list assembled for this movie, and although Cameron Diaz (playing Elizabeth Halsey) is the headliner on the poster/movie cover, it was definitely Lucy Punch (Amy Squirrel) who carried the movie with her performance and character. Jason Segel (playing Russell Gettis) was also good. Personalyl I am not fond of musicians turned actors, so I was not keen on Justin Timberlake (playing Scott Delacorte) in this movie. Another great person in the movie was Thomas Lennon (playing Carl Halabi), his character was nice.Having seen the movie, I can honestly say that it is a movie that I will not be making a return trip to, it just didn't rock my world in any possible way.

And I don't regret it.,"And I don't regret it.Towards the very beginning it did feel like it was trying a bit too hard, but when it found its feet it got quite a few laughs out of me. And despite there only being about 10 or so of us in the cinema, I heard quite a bit of laughter coming from them too. But to me, some of the humour was very hit and miss. The scene with the teachers in the men's toilets didn't get even a grin out of me, it felt very forced. But it seemed to crack the others up, so I guess it's down to your kind of humour.Anyway, the movie isn't hilarious. But it is definitely watch-able with quite a few laugh out loud moments. Don't expect a ground breaking comedy because that just isn't what it is. But it was an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half.The performances were fine. None were strikingly bad. Cameron Diaz was fine and pulled off the whole 'bad teacher' thing, Jason Segel was perfect, Justin Timberlake was surprisingly good. And kudos to Phyllis Smith as well.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Insult to Teachers, Students and just about Everybody","I was a fan of Cameron Diaz until I saw this movie. If Diaz and other actors in this movie can't see why this movie is an insult to hard working teachers, students and parents alike, then there is really no point in repeating what was already said many times by other reviewers.Perhaps if Diaz and others in this movie had children of their own, maybe they will realize that there is really nothing funny about making a mockery of your children's education and the education system that is miserably failing millions of children in this country.Shame on you.

Have you ever had a boss or co-worker yell ""WOOHOO"" and you wanted to vomit? Do your colleagues always ask you to have lunch, yet all you want is some time to yourself? Do you constantly see people at work, who enjoy their job waaaaay too much?

Awful message,The message of this film seems to be that bulling is cool and bullies are cool. Everyone associated with this film should feel deeply ashamed of themselves. However bullies like to be told that their disgusting behaviour is justified so I'm sure many will love it.I must write ten lines but have nothing more to say. If it had ended with the main character apologising for ruining the life of many innocent people in her pursuit of bigger breasts then maybe it wouldn't have been too bad. Don't get me wrong I like having horrible main characters as long as they get their comeuppance (e.g. Sunny in Philadelphia is brilliant despite the completely amoral main characters).,,Anonymous,Romance
Unoriginal,"She's a teacher and she's bad? Genius! How'd you come up with that? Give that man, or rather those men, gold stars. Yes, it took two men to write this script. And the result? I almost feel stupid typing it.Cameron Diaz is Elizabeth Halsey. An aspiring trophy wife whose hopes are dashed when her spineless fiancée calls off their wedding at the urging of his mother and financial advisors. So she returns tail between her legs, to teaching middle school. A job she took because she believed it required little effort and offered a summer vacation. And, almost immediately, she discovers a teacher from a wealthy family trying to find his classroom. She makes her intentions very clear, though Scott, the teacher (played by Justin Timberlake) doesn't catch on. And soon her efforts appear in vain when Scott (Timberlake) encounters the ridiculously named Amy Squirrel (played by Lucy Punch) whose hokey goodhearted nature ranges from annoying to nauseating. In addition, Diaz's character maintains a friendship with the gym teacher (Jason Segel) based in shared apathy and sarcasm.Is it funny? It has its moments, but overall the comparisons made between this and Bad Santa are accurate. Bad Santa being the role Billy Bob Thornton liked so much that he played it several times in ""different"" movies as characters with different names. This facsimile, on the other hand, is tame by comparison in addition to being largely dependent on the looks of its 38 year-old star who really should've passed this sort of thing. Lowest common denominator drivel.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very uninspired and boring movie,"You can see why Cameron Diaz would choose a film, and a role, like the one she plays in 'Bad Teacher'. You'd think she was expecting the kind of reception Billy Bob Thornton got from 'Bad Santa'; or Charlize Theron in 'Young Adult'. Crass and unlikeable character. One-liners aplenty. And general comedy goodness.A shame, then, that 'Bad Teacher' isn't general comedy goodness. It's actually really boring. To sum up, money-hungry Elizabeth (Diaz) wants a boob job to impressive new substitute teacher Scott (a really funny Justin Timberlake). Cue attempts to blackmail, embezzle and other unoriginal things to get the money. Inevitably, the tart gets a heart.And it's all very uninteresting, really. Diaz puts her all into the role. I think she's great in it. Similarly, there are good turns from Timberlake, Jason Segel and a really excellent Lucy Punch. But the problem is that they are good actors in an uninspired and bad film. The writing is mainly boring; the story is constantly boring; and you're left at the end feeling, well, bored. I did anyway.It's a disappointing film, because a lot of talent is being sorely wasted. With a better script, this could have rivalled the near-perfect 'Bad Santa'. As it stands, this rivals the likes of 'Four Christmasses'. And that's a bad thing, for the record.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

I am surprised that Hangover 2 scored higher on here. This movie is way better and is the funniest comedy I have seen in years.The movie should offend many people.

Unredeeming,"17 April 2015. If one can stand an un-redeeming, mostly unlikeable character than perhaps this movie may be tolerable. Unfortunately, Cameron Diaz's character is so selfish, egoistic, conniving that unless you are either a narcissist or antisocial psychopath it's unlikely that you will like this movie. Most people would be better off watching Jack Black in The School of Rock (2003). Almost the whole movie shows Cameron as a lazy, disinterested teacher who only cares about getting in the pants of anyone who can help her find a sugar daddy. Only rarely do we see her care about someone else and its pretty juvenile. So unless one has a temperament of an immature teenage adolescent, this movie isn't for you.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bad Teacher,"Overall, the movie was okay. It was fine to watch once, but I don't need to see it again. I'm not a Justin Timberlake hater or anything, but he is just not a good actor...not in this type of role. I think he tries to hard to be funny, and he comes off cheesy and over-the-top. ""Funny"" doesn't come naturally to him, and to be truly funny, it has to seem effortless. For him, it is hard to watch. Cameron Diaz embodied her character and played the role well. Jason Segal was amazing as always. They should have played up his role a bit more and tuned down Justin Timberlake (or cast someone else to play the role). To summarize, the movie was decent, but it was nothing special.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
A humourless film that wanders around pointlessly throughout it's runtime.,"Every once in a while I feel like watching a movie that has been made purely for the intention of fun. Not every film has to be Oscar worthy or a magnum opus; as long as they manage to entertain the viewer, it's perfectly fine. So I decided to watch 'Bad Teacher' to have a good time, but I was thoroughly disappointed. After watching the film I looked up the credits to see if Cameron Diaz was the producer of this film, because the movie allowed her a lot of selfish indulgence. What was this movie? What did I just watch? It is said that often times the truth comes out in the form of fiction, but I genuinely hope that this movie was purely fictional and had nothing to do with real life at all.Normally we are supposed to root for the good guys and the good girls, who despite all difficulties come out triumphantly at the end. In this movie, there is a terrible selfish woman, who has no redeeming qualities, has no remorse for anything wrong done by her but ends up as a winner by the end of the film, defeating another woman, who was actually doing some good work! How am I supposed to like this movie? Even if you somehow manage to ignore the absurdity of the plot, with the hope of having a good laugh while watching it, well you are in for some disappointment because this movie doesn't even do that. For a movie that's labelled as a comedy, unfortunately has very little of it. I was hoping to have a good time and entertain myself, but I didn't laugh even once while watching this film.How did a woman like Elizabeth Halsey get a Teaching job? How did she even become a graduate? What kind of brief was given to the writers for this film? A heartless, selfish and extremely shallow woman who just wants to get rich by doing nothing, develops some softness in her heart at some point but then goes back to being an atrocious person, and ultimately emerges a winner by the end of it? I was hoping to see a character arc of Elizabeth, but there was none of it. Throughout the film I was supporting the other teacher, Amy Squirrel, played by the beautiful Lucy Punch, who was actually making an effort to do her job, but shockingly the movie decided to make a villain out of her! I liked the character of Russel played by Jason Segel, and genuinely believed that he would bring about a complete transformation in Elizabeth, played by Cameron Diaz, at some point of time, but the screenplay had other plans and decided to take a zig zag route to nowhere. Cameron Diaz did well as a 'Bad Teacher' in this film, but I just couldn't love her character or the movie. It's unfortunate to see this gorgeous actress associating herself with a pointless movie like this.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Could get your blood pumping. Mainly through violent outbursts.,"The synopsis for Bad Teacher is as thus. A shallow, hot sociopath teacher is going to do whatever she can in order to afford a life changing boob job.The movie is really about two other things though.An attempt at crude jokes as Diaz competes with another teacher for Timberlake's affections.And eye candy.In regards to the former point, it fails heavily for many reasons.Firstly, the jokes aren't funny.Secondly, the characters are so annoying in this movie you want to punch every one of them in the face whenever they open their mouths.Thirdly, this hate stems from the characters being so nauseatingly unrealistic. Some may suggest they are meant to be annoying. But there is a vast difference between annoying and having a personality that the Dalai Lama would be driven to kill over.Fourthly, now because these characters are so unrealistic it means the story jumps around without making a lot of sense. While it doesn't take an average I.Q to keep up with the story, it's still blatantly obvious that scenes explaining events were ripped out to try to keep the movie flowing.The biggest failure on all these behalves is that the movie is not funny, the characters suck and no matter how much they cut the movie up, it's still around an hour to long.Now in regards to the sex appeal of this movie, I can't help.See, to me, since free and explicitly messed up internet porn became readily available of sexy women, who are also 20 years younger then Cameron Diaz, I have not gotten remotely excited at the idea of sitting through an hour and a half of bad jokes to see an attractive middle aged woman strut around in revealing clothing.Or a set of random boobs.But that's just me.Call me simple, or cheap, but when the only block between me and 1000 videos of XXX sexy teacher fantasies complete with corny one-liners and hard core scenes is a simple search engine, I fail to understand the 'pulling power' of a terrible movie with a hot woman who doesn't get naked.But each to their own. Cause this movie is still freakin terrible.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bad Teacher Is Predictable but Not Bad,"I'm not going to lie; my first thought after seeing the trailer for this movie was, ""Oh great another movie about a provocative teacher that is addicted to drugs, drinking, money, and sex."" My judgment was mostly correct for this movie, but I am happy to say that there was a little more plot and surprise to this movie then I expected.As one has seen time and time again in the trailers, Bad Teacher centers on the very attractive Ms. Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) a middle school teacher who has no interest or skill in teaching who is bent on leaving her school after just one year of working. However, after her rich fiancé breaks off the engagement for her money seeking ways, Elizabeth finds herself back in the trenches of the JAMS staff. The cheap laughs begin to pour in from the first day of school as Halsey has the class watch movies about amazing, honest, and inspirational teachers providing that humorous irony. However, the laughs are also provided by various other characters such as Ms. Squirrel (Lucy Punch) providing that quirky, ridiculous, and energetic one liners and Lynn (Phyllis Smith) who brings that innocent and ignorant comedy to the table.Halsey's immature, drunken slanders, and cliché one liners intimidate the kids in the movie, but seem to charm Russell Gettis (Jason Segel) the lowly gym teacher with a heart of gold. Gettis, and most of the audience during the show, found Halsey's constant jokes to be hilarious, fun, and rather entertaining. Although I found it funny at first, I grew tired of the same comedy and words being thrown at me over and over again, never really deviating from alcohol and drugs. When Mr. Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), arrives the floodgates for sex and boob jokes opens up and is introduced to the audience. Although Timberlake may have performed a fantastic role in The Social Network, his character has been greatly diminished to a naïve, impressionable, boob obsessed nerd who provides a little bit of comedy, but really nothing special. Instead Delacorte acts more as a tool used to spur jokes from Squirrel and Halsey, typically centered on rivalry for the watch heir's heart.Despite the flood of vulgar comedy, I did laugh at some other comedic styles found in this film. In particular I enjoyed Segel's comedy as the dialog was well written and perfectly timed, though a few of his lines matched the same style as Diaz's character. I enjoyed his interactions with the kids, in particular the sports argument with one of his students. The comedy styles of Diaz were okay for me, but nothing really new of what we have seen in the past. Diaz still brings that don't mess with me/don't care attitude that grew stale with her constant repetitions. However, her sarcasm, devious nature, and her delusional view of herself were entertaining at most times. Lucy Punch played her part well as the annoying, chipper, and over achieving teacher, but I did grow tired of her as well. Many times I think the dialog was written to make her too air headed or attempting to be too funny, which annoyed me more than anything. However I must admit her Al-Gebra terrorist line was very hysterical for me and cleaver.Perhaps the most entertaining comedy for me though was a combination of Lynn and Kirk, Halsey's roommate. Lynn in particular relieved the audience from Diaz/Segel's comedy by saying some of the most innocent lines ever. Other times, she would take forever to make a decision and her reactions to the consequences were hilarious. Kirk on the other hand provided that dumb and ignorant comedy that made me think of Joey or Chandler from F.R.I.E.N.D.S. I was in tears from some of his lines and although he was only in a few scenes, he somehow managed to steal the show for me and make him the highlight of the movie.The last thing I wish to mention is the large amount of predictability in this movie. Many times I could see the jokes coming or see the direction the thin plot was heading, which made the movie less enjoyable for me. Most of the shenanigans the cast pulled were not the most original and even the changes in character could be seen thirty minutes before they happened. However, I am happy to say that the ending to the movie did catch me off guard and I applaud the film crew for the twist in the movie, though I will not reveal it to you.Overall Bad Teacher is not that Bad, it's just definitely not original. The comedy is slapstick, beat you over the head comedy, the acting is lots of fun, and it's a movie with a good fast pace that keeps it interesting. Throw in some great comedic timing, a little comedic diversity, and of course that classic car wash scene from the trailer and you get a fun Friday night movie. The bottom line is I give this movie somewhere between a 6.5-7.0 and highly recommend it for NetFlix/Red Box. My only advice for those who wish to see it in the theaters is to get there before the trailers start, because I found a lot more laughs in the trailers than I did in the movie.Until next time my friends, enjoy!",,Anonymous,Romance

Lessons is life,"Bad Teacher is a wannabe amoral tale about Cameron Diaz playing a selfish character.The Bad Teacher of the film who puts less than minimum effort, does not care about her students and is looking to marry a rich guy.However when she gets dumped she returns to teaching to earn enough money to enlarge her boobs and get another rich guy to marry.Of course despite Diaz doing her best we cannot care about such a character and end up sorry for her pupils who have to watch endless films on television during lessons.Justin Timberlake turns up as a shallow nerd who is descended from a rich family but his character is just pointless.Lucy Punch is the nemesis and provides spirited resistance to the bad teacher and be the foil but you know she will get beaten to the punch by the end of the film.Jason Segel has a small role as a laconic gym teacher. The schoolchildren are the usual mix of geeks and cool kids but the film is a one note idea.A few laughs, some sexy scenes such as Diaz washing cars save this from being a bad film.

Bad Movie,"Let me begin by saying that the producers must be hanged for approving such a film. Although it is built as a comedy, I saw no justification of that. At least the parodies try to make you laugh and occasionally succeed in doing so, but I do not think they made an honest attempt to make anyone laugh.There is nothing new in the film and the story, if at all there is any, is not given a chance to come out. There was only one character in this film, that of Cameron Diaz and she swung like a pendulum, never giving an identity to the character.The most disappointing factor was that, it seemed like the production team was unsure as to what kind of comedy they wanted to pursue in the film, it is still unclear if they meant it to be a blue comedy or black comedy.The acting was not convincing either. Nobody seemed interested in the film and it seemed obvious that all they wanted was to get the cheque and scoot.

I think the most annoying factor of this mediocre film was that the terrible humour even made Jason Segel seem unfunny, and that just isn't right in my opinion as he's usually amazing in films working with better writers & directors such as Judd Apatow.This is film is only really worth watching if you literally have nothing else to watch.

Bad Teacher: Simply Misunderstood and Judged,"Let me start by saying that this is the First time I ever write a review – let me repeat: my first review ever! What has led me to write a review on Bad Teacher is very simple. I love it, love it, and love it some more. What's not to love about it? Before I delve into the characters allow me to say this much. The audience have judged the film, forgetting the sheer hard truth: it is a movie folks, nothing more nothing less. It has been made for pure entertainment – and of course it is Rated R.You are not supposed to show children the movie with the objective of teaching them the morals of education, educators, students and everything in-between. I have read most reviews and the feeling I gathered was that people are upset of how Bad Teacher depicts how ""being a lazy, unethical teacher"" well appears cool and trendy. And as if the movie makers were sanctioning some ""bad behavior"" from teachers. Well on that standard, we would have to write bad reviews about many, many, and many other movies. Such as the movies that glorify murder, or bank robberies and so on. There are countless movies out there that make murder and torture OK. I'm sure there's many. But what does come to my mind now is ""Entrapment"" where Catherine Zeta Jones & Sean Connery organize and succeed at robbing major banks, jewels and well whatever. Eventually Jones gets away from stealing from the World Bank in Indonesia during the millennium, like 7billion dollars or more. What about Stallone in Rambo, Cruise in Mission Impossible, Gibson, in lethal weapon? Don't all these movies grant excuses for the murder of people? The list goes on..The bottom line is, Bad Teacher is funny, entertaining and above all it has heart. Yes indeed, Diaz shows a lot of heart for her students and helps one particular student who is in desperate need. He is mocked by his fellow students for behaving like a dork, yes the way she helps him is somewhat dishonest but don't they say that the end justifies the means? Diaz does a superb job in my opinion. Let's not forget Timberlake, who is so into character that you in fact forget that this is the very cool Timberlake.People, please, I must have seen this film at least ten times and I'm ready to watch it 100 more times, enjoy it, and enjoy it for what it is. Be entertained, it's a film, not a book that is supposed be on your children's curricula in year 10.Of course we are all different and have different tastes – I personally don't enjoy horror and western films. So I can understand and respect opinions that are not in sync. We are all different and like different things. I am saying though, Bad Teacher has been judged for its negative connotations about being a bad teacher. It's a film, it's not real.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
sometimes being bad can be good,"Bad Teacher was this overly hyped event promising humor on par with 'The Hangover' and largely was unable to live up to such expectation. However, Diaz plays the part of a money grubbing and social climbing malcontent spot-on and really saves this film. It's her goofiness from 'something about marry' meets the self-centered character types she's played in other roles. The humor is crass at times, almost too much (like bridesmaids) but the level of it in her character is absolutely hysterical. She is consistently a bad teacher and the lessons learned by her actions are interesting - in short, sometimes being bad can be good. Despite the mistakes, it's unmistakable that this movie is hilarious. This movie is not perfect by any means but it delivers some serious comedy at the expense of political correctness and a morally ambiguous messages. If you ""get it"", you will set that Bad Teacher is an honest look at a bad person, with lessons more subtle and in some ways more real. Some may liken this movie to Bad Santa.

Why spoil a decent career?,"I leave a 2, because something can always be worse, but not much worse than this movie.

This film has no redeeming quality and the ending is cliché. How unfortunate. To top it off what Justin Timberlake brought the film was limp and poorly sung. Why would Cameron Diaz do this to her career. Who is writing this material and how can they be allowed to put this stuff through the pipeline in Hollywood. I'm not sure if irresponsible is even the correct word for such a poorly conceived movie. It isn't as if the actors involved had not made movies before, but it seems like this was a bad auditioning pilot for them. Seriously, stop making movies to grab some coin.

As a result, I could not connect at all. The gym teacher, Russell, was the only likable character in the entire film. He did not have enough camera time. I eventually had to just give up on the film altogether and went to bed. No, went to my computer first, to post in several various venues about how disappointing this movie was.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
One Of My Favorite Comedies Ever!,"The talented Cameron Diaz is at her best in this brisk comedy about a ""bad"" teacher who does all the wrong things and triumphs in the end. Despite her questionable methods, she has a gift for guiding students through middle school and life in general. Wonderful performances from Jason Segal, Lucy Punch, Justin Timberlake, and the supporting players. The situations are far-fetched but make sense in their context. Sure it's a little gross, but nothing major. I highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"shallow, poor","Shallow, poor movie about an uncaring lazy teacher.
But Cameron Diaz is good.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bad Movie,"None of these characters are likable. Not all movies have to contain likable characters, but cookie cutter Hollywood comedies do. Diaz's character is not likable even after the mandatory change for the better moment. Jason Segel's character is vaguely likable, but shallow. Phyllis Smith's character is lifter almost completely straight out of The Office. I wouldn't mind seeing her play someone who isn't bland and generic.The humour: Profanity seems to have replaced humour for most of the movie. The funny parts are all in the trailer. To be honest the trailer was funnier. Jason Segel's character Russell is probably the funniest and I attribute that to his delivery. He breaks up the stupidity. Timberlake not being able to sing has a subtlety to it that's quite good. His O face seems to be the funniest thing he actually did though.The story: The plot is interesting. Sort of like anti-Dangerous minds(which was hinted at some point). The thing is it's formulaic, which makes it boring and predictable. And what's with all the drugs everywhere? Seriously! Weed is fine I guess, up to a point. It's contrary to the main character's behaviour, but I guess she drinks and takes pills as well. A generic happy ending wraps this boring piece of mindless tripe up.Nothing else is really worth mentioning. Avoid this movie if you're looking for something actually funny or entertaining!",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"For a film about education, this is really the dumbest thing you'll ever see","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningCameron Diaz stars as Liz Halsey, the worst teacher in the world, who sets the worst example to her students you can imagine. When she's dumped by her sugar daddy, she finds her self forced to return to her job, where she casts eyes on hot new teacher Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) but faces competition from butter-wouldn't-melt fellow teacher Lucy (Amy Squirrel.) After learning the teachers will receive performance related bonuses, she smartens her act up a bit and starts to become a more approachable human being, while never losing her balsy attitude.After a barrage of bad reviews at the cinema, I finally caught Bad Teacher on it's DVD release and was pretty unsurprised at it's negative feedback. While the 'bad' idea worked well in recent efforts (Bad Santa) the concept here just fails to materialize and is just dumb. And, most killingly of all, not funny. It's unbelievable someone as stupid and irresponsible as Halsey would even be a teacher in the first place, and from this small acorn the whole forest crumbles. By the end, this flimsy concept has been stretched to breaking point and, after just a few minor laughs, it's shattered you to pieces. *",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
An entertaining time,"Bad Teacher has grown to be more of my favorite irreverent comedies and one of my favorite Cameron Diaz performances. You can tell she's having a blast playing a very very laid back, drug-addicted, alcoholic teacher who doesn't give a **** about being a good teacher, because her only goal is to marry someone who is loaded (like Justin Timberlake's character) and to achieve this she saves up for a boob job. This foundational scenario and the rest of the plot getting there is hilarious. The supporting cast is great too. I'm not a fan of Jason Segel, however he and Diaz have decent chemistry, same with the tongue-in-cheek chemistry with Timberlake.RECOMMENDED comedy if you like irreverent, dry humor comedies and this film goes to show that Diaz still got the finesse to pull off effortless comedic timing.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Totally shallow and vapid,While the movie is far from boring it's basically nothing more then fluff. Very few of the characters are believable in their roles in the movie and most of the actors didn't have that much chemistry together. Hard to root for Cameron Diaz's character when she has no redeemable values whatsoever.Diaz's character makes no effort to teach the entire movie but suddenly she finds out that the teacher whose students score the highest on a state test gets a big bonus and she out of nowhere learns how to teach.It seems like the producers of this movie just liked the movie Bad Santa and decided to make the same movie just with a teacher in the place of Santa.This is most definitely a step in the wrong direction career wise for Cameron Diaz. She should fire her agent for signing onto this project.,4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bad teacher not so bad!,"Bad Teacher is a mediocre adult comedy. The cast is able to play off of each other well. The movie is definitely entertaining and has no morals. Cameron Diaz slips into this character with ease in spite of the weak character development.I cant say the movie is funny as hell, but there are moments which will make your belly hurt, laughing. There is not really a lot of logic in this movie, the director has handled every scene with a touch of comedy and most of it is predictable.No surprises, no extraordinary acting, nothing to really carry with you from this movie. Its a good time pass and you wont really recollect any scenes and laugh once the movie is over. Doesn't give you a head ache or makes you really enjoy the movie.Overall a good effort, but could have been much better. Watch it on DVD, not worth going to the cinemas.",,Anonymous,Romance

The rock songs in the movie is the only one worth watching, however, why don't you just buy the CDs of Judas Priest or White Snake?? Removing the rock songs in the film, you can find that the original sound score is empty, just like the content of the movie.If you want to enjoy the joy of laughing, skip this one, because you wouldn't find laughter in this movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Bad? Terrible, pathetic, RIDICULOUS!","Bad teacher received a number of scathing reviews and yet my friends persuaded me that it was a good one time watch. After watching the movie, clearly, they were not my friends.The movie goes from bad to worse and continues in free fall throughout the one hour and 32 minutes of its duration (which by my count, is far too much). I have NEVER seen such a ridiculous plot being made into a movie, hats off to Jake Kasdan for the courage, and the audacity to make this.Without going into spoilers, the movie boasts of one terrible, pathetic (read: bitch) protagonist who has to make a fresh start as a middle school teacher, and then does everything wrong to earn a potload of money. One ridiculous attempt after another, the movie tries every trick in the book that a teacher might use to make money, and clumsily glues them all together. All the while, the good teachers try to befriend her, and she keeps on taking advantage of them.Worst of all, the movie portrays the nice in such a negative life, that it is actually a serious concern, if the trend is carried on. Wake up Hollywood, we don't like good people being ripped off! And lo and behold, the bad teacher suddenly turns good (Really? I was shocked! What an unpredictable plot twist). Would it kill you to at least give ONE reason behind this miraculous transformation.Cameron Diaz tries her best to portray the cold bitch, with success, but with such a terrible plot, it's hard to applaud. The co-stars do have their moments (if only far apart). The music and cinematography was dull, the editing botched at best and the visuals - glum (if not for a few shots like the car wash and a portion of the trip)Here's to an hour and half of my life that i am never getting back, though I tried my best to redeem my warning others about it.Tip: If you hate someone, there's no better revenge than making them sit through this movie",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

A little bit of funny, awkward situations, wrong messages to the teens who are going to watch it, same old same. And at some point Lucy Punch appears in the movie, and you just forget what the plot is about, you just wanna stop the film and initiate new story where she has the leading role. I was amazed, i want to see the movie again and just jump to the parts where Lucy is on.Justin Timberlake is on that movie as well. I don't see why do producers keep having Justin on movies. Is he their assurance that their movie will be heard? I am not saying that he is bad in acting, i am just saying that he is plain.

Surreal bad cinema,"It is said that for humor to work, it must contain an element of truth. I work at a school similar to the one in the film, and it's obvious the writers never spent time in a secondary school as anything other than mediocre students. They know nothing of teacher characters or how they interact with students or each other, unless they think the scandalous headlines of child abuse and drug usage are the norm. Perhpaps that is what the writers were thinking while hoping everyone else was on the same soiled page.I found myself questioning why I found this film to be so unfunny and offensive while I quite enjoy raunchy comedic exercises like Get Him to the Greek and Celebrity Roasts. First, the latter don't involve children. Second, there is actual truth-wrapped-in-humor, not insulting the intelligence and often catching the viewer by surprise. This film was more than predictable; if you can't write a screenplay without depending so heavily on profanity, sexual situations, and drug use, then you can't write a screenplay.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

The strange thing is that that the star of the film does not have any funny lines at all. The best jokes go to Jason Segal , Phyllis Smith and Lucy Punch and you have to wonder why Cameron Diaz took this part or even if she read the script.Justin Timberlake continues to impress as an actor and he is really good as the wealthy geek that Elizabeth is chasing but it's still not enough to make this film work on any level.At times it's extremely silly and the people who made this film must have been hoping it's audience were idiots to buy into the premise.Bad Teacher = Bad Experience",,Anonymous,Romance

Now if a director is new to making a film which contains a lot of vulgarity in it may i suggest calling up the king himself Judd Apatow and getting some suggestions on how it's done. One thing i will say for movies that promise loads of laughs and that don't deliver at least they have an entertaining script along with a storyline as to keep us watching in one way or another.,4.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Not the funniest movie, but funny enough","Bad teacher gave the audience exactly what encased in the title of the movie, a bad teacher and nothing more. This movie wasn't bad in the means of comedy or acting, but what kills this movies attempt in becoming a great comedy is the terrible screen writers that could have done a better job with the story. For me not being a fan of Cameron Diaz acting I have to say she has done a great job at the role presented towards her and makes this movie worth watching. Her acting has never been something that has been identified as great, but in this film her acting shines brightly and enjoyable to watch. She displayed the worst kind of teacher I have ever viewed on screen and in real life and did it so well and was very convincing that she was that uncontrollable. I was shocked in the first few minutes of the film witnessing her character because having seen many of her movies over the years I have never seen her act this way. It put me in the state of mind of when she played her role in The Sweetest Thing. It was great to watch her curse at kids, stab teachers in the back and becoming real sexual in a way towards the male cast. She nails the character to the T, but not even her great acting in this movie could save it from still being fairly bad. Other then her and some of the cast having funny moments the script and plot turns dry. The movie starts off going one direction, turns towards another route and takes a u turn towards a critic and audience disliking. This movie is not a terrible film to watch, but is one of the worst movies in Diaz film career. This movie lacks in the many categories that it presents through out the running time. The comedy is the only thing that makes this movie bearable to watch. The director did a good job of making the audience sort of believe what was talking place during the film. The actors did the best they could do with the script that they were given and were fun to watch. As I said before Diaz was great at her role and Lucy Punch, Justin Timberlake, and Jason Segel were enjoyable to watch and gave this movie have some depth in viewing teachers in a different light. With all their effort that they put in the movie still doesn't pass the test. This movie shows the audience that a poor story can ruin a film no matter on whats taking place during the movie. Bad Teacher is funny at times, but I give this movie an A for effort and a C- for execution.",,Anonymous,Romance

Bad teacher had its moments,"So this ""hilarious yet filthy comedy"" isn't perfect but it had it's moments and did give me some chuckles with its raunchy humour, probably because I think this is how I would behave if I were a teacher. Cameron Diaz as ""Elizabeth"" is described as a ""Booze-swilling, pot-smoking, hard-swearing seventh-grade teacher"" and she's kinda awesome. Her body is also just slamming here and she totally gave me a girl crush with that car wash scene.Timberlake on the other hand is not so good as the handsome and rich substitute teacher that she fights her prudish colleague for the affections of. It may just have been that his character was such a wimp but to me he wasn't worth fighting over. A decent dark comedy though. 06.13",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

The only thing it's lacking is characterization, if Cameron Diaz character had more characterization then movie would have been brilliant. Cameron Diaz is truly amazing as Bad Teacher, this role is truly for her and she proved yet again that she is one of the best female lead comedians around. Justin Timberlake provided the perfect freshness and weirdness. FYI watching real life Xz Justin Timberlake Dry Humping Cameron Diaz was really Awkward. I don't remember watching dry humping in movies like Ever and then between JT and Cam, never imagined that! Jason Segel didn't get much scope but Lucy Punch was hilarious.

"Bad Teacher Not That bad, But Bad","I went into watching ""Bad Teacher"" thinking I would hate it. I did not hate it, so it gets a gold star thanks to my low expectations! Cameron Diaz is perfect for the role, she is a good comedic actress. The rest of the cast was adequate, some a little too slapstick at times.A lot of what Cameron Diaz says in the movie is profane and should make a lot of people laugh. I personally laughed twice, the laugh ratio will be different person to person, for example: a person I watched it with was pushed to tears by the car wash scene. The laughs are there, whether or not they find you is up to your own sense of humor. You may want to dumb it down a bit.As a movie though, it lacks a good story. It is a funny simple plot basis, funny concept, but the execution is wonky. I never felt like the character had any kind of arc, which would be fine, except she starts making decisions and the ending acts like she actually did have an arc. Everything that happens plot-wise is predictable, you're not going to really be thrown any surprises, but loosen up and just veg out and you might find the same two laughs that I did.",,Anonymous,Romance

Her screen presence is so strong that she dominates every scene in the movie. Mr. Timberlake is one of the great straight men. His mere presence in a scene generates laughs. Jason Segel has funny moments too. The story is zany, goofy and upbeat. It's a farce, a romp, and a laugh-producing machine.

Eye full for the men!,"It's almost quite obvious that Cameron Diaz is hitting 40. An actress who had me at the word go since I was a young l lad in the ever so famous ""The Mask"" to me was always sssmmoking! Sadly I have to come with terms that the once super-hot Hollywood princess is showing faint signs of aging in her new release ""Bad Teacher"". This is my first reaction when I saw her, however let me not discourage you readers; she still has it in her! She has it a lot! Some may even love her like this! With her 10/10 screen presence and also with the mixture of her diverse talent and bad girl attitude justice is rightly served to Elizabeth Halsey. Alongside her, Jason Segal (I just love his talent) & John Micheal Higgins were the show stealers in this fast paced summer comedy release. The 2 boys bring it up a notch from the average, and keep on trying to bring laughter at us and deliver at every possible time. Justin Timberlake on the other hand, tries something new (he has never done a role in this degree), where he has to underplay a lot of the times, in fact the script is as such that he has to always underplay a lot and maybe this gets to him a bit, and I personally felt this is a directorial flaw rather than Justin's. Phyllis Smith was a sweetheart and a lady with a lot of talent; I sincerely hope she gets explored more in the future as I feel there is a lot of bottled up talent within her. Lucy Punch, I loved to hate her and so will you. A healthy and wise blend in talent within the cast.Director Jake Kasdan;considerably a newbie in my terms to my mental hard drive on movie trivia fairs averagely. I am going to and fro and trying to find the reason why the movie didn't take off as expected with such a noteworthy cast, Also to mention ""Orange County"" by director Jake Kasdan was wildly entertaining. On a personal level I feel it's the writers that should take the hit, however on a professional approach I feel it should be evenly laid across as a directorial and writing drawback. I am certain when Columbia Pictures picked up this script they saw massive potential and I am also sure there has been many re writes on several levels since it was picked up on a pre- production stage. Furthermore I am certain at the point the script was read it did sound more hilarious than it is post production. For a comedy Rated R there is always high expectations from the audience. I am no high rolling million dollars' worth producer, however I am serious lover of the art of entertainment and sometimes one should always think that we the viewers are the reason they the producers are in business!Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) a stunningly good looking teacher who loves the green bills is dumped by her ever so rich fiancé. Having to come back to school to actually WORK for her bread is not something Elizabeth is comfortable with. Work becomes more fun when she runs into the new sub Scott Delacortte (Justin Timberlake) who has no shortage with his supply of green dollar bills. Trying to get back her lost rich life, Elizabeth tries to win Scott over by trying to show him that she too can have a big heart just like his ex!

It was a surprise to see that one of the screenwriters shares a name with me (he also wrote for the US version of ""The Office"").Basically, it's the sort of movie that you watch if you want nothing except to get entertained.

"""Bad Teacher"" wasn't bad enough","""Bad Teacher"" kinda threw me for a loop. As comedies go, it truly wasn't that bad. I got a few laughs out of it, but really nothing more. And there's the problem, I needed more.The film seemed to want to exist in a similar realm as that of the far superior film, ""Bridesmaids"", but it simply isn't good enough. There are a few problems holding it back, the first of which is the absence of the big laugh. There isn't a single moment in this film that pushed the audience over the edge. The movie didn't go far enough, primarily in two key areas, the film wasn't crass enough, and it didn't have enough heart.First problem is with the casting of Cameron Diaz. I'm sure she's a lovely women and it seems as if she's having the time of her life being insulting and rude, but perhaps that's the problem. Underneath all the insults and the drug use, is still America's sweetheart, acting like a middle schooler, who thinks all it takes to act grown up is to drop a few f-bombs.It's not that Diaz isn't funny, she is, for the most part. It's just that her jokes(whether they were written or she improvised) lacked a punch that a more experienced comedic actress could've provided. Granted the shock value of seeing Cameron Diaz in such a role would have been lost, but perhaps the final product would have been more satisfying.But also lost is a depth of character usually found in these kind of films. Since ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" audiences have been expecting a dose of heart with their crude humor, and while an attempt is made at redemption for the main character in this film, her intentions are so vain, and her actions so selfish, that in the end the character arc falls flat, and by the end of the film I just didn't feel like rooting for anyone.So is ""Bad Teacher"" a successful comedy? Did it make me laugh? Yes, but this film just barely reaches average, which makes it a huge disappointment. I wanted to like ""Bad Teacher"", I'm a sucker for Judd Apatow films, and the countless copycats that have emulated that formula ever since ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" came out. But ""Bad Teacher"" didn't go far enough, and that has to be the biggest disappointment of all.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Pretty Good ""Bad Teacher""","""Bad Teacher"" is pretty good. In fact it is funny. The story by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg could have been more idiosyncratic, and less tangential. What they created has a certain style and flow. Amazingly, along with Director Jake Kasdan they ultimately make Cameron Diaz's totally unlikable Elizabeth humorously transform. No small feat. Cameron Diaz soars fearlessly as ""The Bad Teacher"" with graceful comedic timing. ""Bad Teacher"" surprisingly works, because she plays the character straight up, and her epiphany is deserved.In ""Bad Teacher"" Diaz plays Elizabeth Halsey at JAMS—a middle school in Chicago. Diaz looks vibrant and stunningly fit. Her Halsey is a vapid gold digger biding her time until she marries her rich fiancé. This unravels when her fiancé's mother punctuates that Elizabeth only loves him for his money. Consequently, Elizabeth is forced to return to her job after summer break. As fate would have it, Scott Delecorte (brilliantly nerdy Justin Timberlake, also Diaz's former flame) is the new substitute teacher. Scott is the heir to the Delecorte Family watch fortune. Elizabeth finds her rival in fellow teacher Amy Squirrel (dangerously perky Lucy Punch). Intense Amy is alarmingly upbeat, and seems to have suffered a previous meltdown. Scott's apparent physical attraction to his former girlfriend, prompts Elizabeth to get surgical breast enhancement. There is a hysterical scene with Diaz trying out a patient's boob job.However, the procedure runs about $10,000—even with affordable financing. At the same time, Elizabeth squashes the charms of regular poor guy gym teacher Russell (laid back funny Jason Segal). How does one choose to become a gym teacher anyway? After an embarrassingly cheesy school car wash/ wet t-shirt contest gag with Diaz in cutoff shorts and soaking wet, she realizes the solution to her boob job fund. The teacher at JAMS with the highest average standardized test scores gets a $5700 bonus. So instead of showing videos in class, being either doped out or recovering from a hangover, Elizabeth becomes drill sergeant English teacher. There is a hysterical scene when she slams basketballs off student's heads for incorrect answers. Or when she is totally frustrated by the inept practice test results, she screams that is why the Japanese students beat their asses—however, in less delicate euphemism. Then the story takes a weirder turn even for itself.At the predictable arc during a field trip gone nearly awry, Elizabeth has a conversation with geeky Garrett (sweet hearted Matthew J. Evans), who springs nonlinear when he is rejected by the love of his life too cool for school Chase (good Kathryn Newton). Diaz tells him that Chase will never like him, because he is not cool. She was Chase once, and likely still is. Garrett points out that the kid Chase likes is stupid. Her Elizabeth admits, ""He's a moron."" Elizabeth tells Garrett that he is sensitive, and for now cool rules. His time will come in college. Diaz is brilliantly funny and insightful. Russell (Segal) wryly says, ""That's a nice thing you did for him."" There is cute punch line; however, Diaz and Segal level out the often crass context, with a reassuring yet unsentimental human touch. Even at our most self centric, we will protect those put upon.The universe has a way of balancing out in ""Bad Teacher"". ""Bad Teacher"" is not perfect. It is funny and worth your patience. Diaz, Punch, Segal, and Timberlake play together hilariously well. Cameron's boldness really makes it work. ""Bad Teacher"" is really pretty good, all things considered.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not funny enough to cover its flaws,"(27%) Any movie that gets made with a script that clearly needs more than a few complete re-writes is never going to get a pass grade, not from me anyway. The plot is quite frankly utterly broken. We have a teacher who really despises her job, so why did she become one in the first place? You need to train/study to become a teacher and pass exams, things in which the lead character would clearly have no desire to go through. And if she has lost all passion for her work then why doesn't she just quit? What is keeping her in this job she hates so much? The plot in itself doesn't work either as the lead wants a boob job to attract the attentions of a nerdy, goody-goody Justin Timberlake (a man that quite clearly does not have a big boob preference, or at least never mentions it, so why is it even required?) who has fallen for the main rival of the movie (a very annoying Lucy Punch) but the fact is that they are both at least compatible with each other rather than Diaz's character who takes most of the movie to realise that he's clearly not the right man for her. What is it with comedies staring Cameron Diaz (""What happens in Vegas"" springs to mind) that have such dire, poorly constructed plot-lines? The movie is just about entertaining enough to be just about watchable, but its poor script kills this turkey from the off.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

OK it does have a message but that's not the point of a comedy).My son's a high school teacher and I watched it with him to see just how ""offensive to teachers"" it is. Our communal conclusion?

Really Hoped For More From A Solid Concept,"There's some good jokes in Bad Teacher. It's well-acted, and has solid comedic timing and delivery. And overall, it's a pretty good concept. But the number one thing that sunk this film for me was the main character. Diaz's Elizabeth is entirely unlikable.Now this is of course just my opinion on the matter. But Elizabeth is just a pretty rotten character, with little in the way of redeeming qualities. Which is fine to start the film. But the idea is that you round the characters out as the movie goes on, and you make the intended protagonists likeable, relatable characters. And I just didn't see that here. Sure, at the very end it's implied that she's ""changed"", but it just felt tacked on for the ending. Nothing during the movie made me like the character at all.As an *It's Always Sunny...* fan, I don't quite understand why a detestable character just ruins the film for me. Maybe it's because on IASIP, those rotten characters most often get their comeuppance. But they don't in Bad Teacher. In fact, the rival teacher Amy was absolutely right about everything she said about Elizabeth. Yet she was made out to be the villain, and the one who always gets punked. I have no desire to root for that.It's like watching a film take on The Simpsons episode ""Homer's Enemy"", but without the charm, sharp commentary, and self-awareness that made that episode work. Had the film just been a lot funnier, maybe I could have forgiven the screenplay. Bad Teacher has its moments, but it's just not that funny.Good concept, but mediocre execution.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Lots of Cringe,"Oh, wow, this one is really all over the place. I liked the theme of a teacher who absolutly doesn't care and is extremely shallow, but the movie fell a little short of delivering it. Don't get me wrong it's still funny and has its sexy moments, but it could have been much better.The first question I have that's not answered in this movie about the Character Elizabeth - How did Elizabeth (Cameron Diaz) get to this spot in her life? Is she a real teacher? How long has she been a teacher? Did she used to be a good teacher before and has declined or has she always been this bad at it? - There are way to many questions unanswered in this film as they fail to give a back story. Following the story they did give, Elizabeth's character was a little all over the place. She was ""sexy"" and ""bad"" and yet in a PG way. If we're making an R rated comedy then let's go all out with it. She didn't feel sly or naughty enough, for example Jennifer Aniston more then succeeded with this type of role in Horrible Bosses. Cameron needed to bring up the intensity of it or the writers needed to tweak the script. As the film goes on we get to see a glimpse at Elizabeth being a ""real"" teacher, but then quickly slides back from it. Where is the character growth? There is some, but its very subtle. When I watched this I kept expecting ""more"" either get down and dirty and go all out or improve the character to great extremes, instead the film was consistent with a character that made you shake your head in disapproval. I understand that Elizabeth was a very shallow person, but the writer should have showed us glimpses of the ""real"" her, a little depth with who she really is and what she really wants in life. If she has a heart to party and live on the edge then why didn't the writer put in scenes to show that. Is her goal really only money and ""things""? If she's a shopaholic why didn't the writer bring that out more with spending issues? Instead the writer gave us a sense that this woman is just plain lazy with no desire to work, but also wants to sit at home alone in a corner smoking up? Boring.Jason Segal was widely under used in this film. Every time he came on camera you could feel the chemistry between him and Cameron. His performance felt natural and smooth, and it made me want to see more of him. Justin Timberlakes's performance was cringe worthy. The script and lines for him was terrible. As a rich man who is sensitive and has a love for children - why on earth did the writers make him into a seven year old child, in a mans body? He was over the top gullible and dumb. It felt like Elizabeth was trying to take advantage of a child - cringe.Its still funny in places and I like the variety of actors. But it definitely has its issues.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not Nearly As Bad As It Thinks,"Bad Teacher (2011)** 1/2 (out of 4)After being dumped by her sugar daddy, teacher Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) returns to work where instead of helping her students she just tries to get through the day getting high and doing various other bad things. She gets a crush on a co-worker (Justin Timberlake) who she knows how a lot of money but she thinks in order to get him she must get larger breasts. Her plan of being rich takes a turn for the worse when the guy falls for her rival (Lucy Punch). BAD TEACHER is far from being a bad movie but at the same time outside of a couple big jokes the overall feel of the movie is rather disappointing. I think there's some good moments here and there but not nearly enough to make this comedy work. I think the biggest problem is with the screenplay itself. Yes, the idea of having a drug taking, cussing, worthless teacher is something that could have been very funny but sadly the screenwriters seemed to forget that you need something more than just cheap little scenes that really aren't all that funny. I'm sure most people will remember when they're young and certain students would think they were funny simply because they said a bad word. There wasn't any punchline and not even a real joke but instead it was just a simple cuss word. As you grew older you realized that there wasn't any really talented or funny about simply saying a bad word but this film doesn't seem to realize that. The majority of the jokes here simply feature Diaz saying something raunchy and that's simply not funny enough or ""bad"" enough to make the film. The weird thing is that this movie was sold for being ""bad"" yet the material here isn't very shocking when compared to other raunchy comedies of today. I'm sure had this been released in the 80s that some of the material might have been more shocking but in 2011 there's just nothing over-the-top here. Another problem with the film is that the rivalry between the two teachers isn't very interesting and especially because of the ""other"" teacher being so annoying. With all of that said, there's no question that Diaz is pretty good in her role as is Timberlake and Jason Segel in his part. The three certainly give it there all and manage a few nice laughs here and there. Some of the film's best moments are when it's not trying to be ""bad"" by dirty language and this includes a scene where Diaz helps a student who has just been embarrassed by admitting his love for a popular girl. BAD TEACHER is at best mild entertainment but at the same time you can't help but wish the screenwriters had been more creative and come up with something better than just profanity and smoking pot.",,Anonymous,Romance

Very Funny and Effortless Watching,"I was surprised to see how low the user score was for this flick.Honestly its one of my personal favourites, watched dozens of times, even now years later I return whenever I'm knackered and want a laugh with some wholesome vibes; and no concentration needed to watch.Sure its plenty of cheese with childish and fairly basic humour. However the overarching story, actors performance and almost 'caricature' like characters lead to an easy and entertaining watch.In my opinion it lands pretty consistent laughs and amusing moments, landed excellently by Cameron Diaz, Lucy Punch, Jason Seagel and most of the other cast. Mixed in is a basic romance/character redemption plot arch which ties the movie perfectly into the 'easy to watch category' . Many moments in the movie sound cringey if described, however when watching I never really feel that cringe, just juvenile and charming comedy fluff.If you're looking for a 'high quality' comedy with intelligent developed humour then you wont find that here.If however you just want a light easy-watching laugh with zero effort required to follow things; perfect movie for the job.8/10 imo.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good - Would Watch It Again Sometime,"As I have said in other reviews (see Knight and Day), there is something special about Cameron Diaz. Look into her eyes in a close-up...She is not just gorgeous, she is interesting. And she carries this off again in this enjoyable movie. This time, she is not the good girl, or the good guy's gal pal, she is BAD. She throws herself at anyone with money; she keeps her job as a teacher only because her sugar daddy dumps her right before their wedding. She smokes, she drinks, she does just about anything except f--k. She lives with a totally clueless room mate who thinks she is a nurse. Her initial idea of teaching is to show educational movies... all the time.Her goal is to get a boob job (as if she really needs one) to attract ""someone who will take care of her."" Justin Timberlake plays the role of the guy who is as clueless as he is rich, and her target. Lucy Punch is the goodie-two-shoes rival. And Jason Segal is the waiting-in-the-wings would-be boy friend. The actors all play their roles with skill and precision.This comedy should remind just about everyone of their school days and the one (and only) babe teacher who was the object of their lust, obsession, and infatuation. If so, then the somewhat stereotyped comedy will seem a little funnier, a little more enjoyable, and like a film you will want to watch again.Diaz makes much of her great body, acting ability, and a complicated personality to make this a flick you will enjoy, and enjoy again.",,Anonymous,Romance

I didn't expect much from the trailers so I was pleasantly surprised when I reached the end of the movie.This film is about a teacher with really bad manners who is desperate for a breast job.

She still looks hot but we can see she's getting older. Jason Segel as always is good and heartwarming in his role. I loved Lucy Punch as the rival teacher. I didn't care much for Justin Timberlake. I thought his character was stupid and did not belong in the movie.Overall, this is a funny movie even if it tries to break barriers. It relies on the charisma of the actors to succeed which it mostly does. I loved the car wash scene because I thought it was kind of sexy. Easily the scene in the movie.

Bad Teacher (good fun),"Okay, I'll admit I'm a bit fan of Cameron Diaz (please don't ask why), so you must appreciate that this review is heavily biased.Comedies are fun, only many aren't funny.

"A good ""Rotten Apple""","There will be those who watch Jake Kasdan's ""Bad Teacher"" and automatically think back to the cult classic Billy Bob Thornton-starring, Terry Zwigoff-directed comedy ""Bad Santa"" (2003) and think that the two movies are somewhat similar: Both pictures center around a drug-abusing, alcohol-swilling ""protagonist"" who doesn't give an ""F"" about anything but abusing drugs and swilling alcohol, yet somehow by the end of the story is forced to change their ways... just a little bit.""Bad Teacher"" is a rotten apple of a dark comedy about a Bad Teacher, Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz), whose gold-digging ways are exposed by her fiancé at the beginning of the movie and left with little recourse, she is forced to return to her much-hated job as a middle school teacher at John Adams Middle School (JAMS). On her first day back, she makes the acquaintance of the geeky new substitute teacher Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), who also happens to be heir to a watch fortune; he also happens to like women with big boobs. So taking advantage of this fact to get him to become her new sugar daddy and concocting a scheme to get a $5700 bonus for getting the highest standardized test grades, she'll then use the money she earns from that to get breast implants. And she must also fend off the romantic advances of pot-smoking gym teacher Russell Gettis (Jason Segel) and a caring goody-good rival named Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch).This is not a bad film. Some thought ""Bad Santa"" would scare people because little kids would go into it thinking it was a new Christmas movie about Santa Claus (and we all know how well that turned out). Some of the humor is very dark and very crude (and sometimes forced), but I welcome it as a change to the usual run-of-the-mill ""light comedy"" being pushed upon us week after week. I laughed at many of the jokes here, and maybe some people have difficulty finding this sort of dark, crude humor funny. Some of the sub-plots involving a bullied unpopular kid and his crush on a pretty classmate are fairly underwhelming.On a more positive note, some of the characters are pretty colorful. Diaz is still looking great (I have to fake it here because I just can't get into blondes), but she relishes her role as a Bad Teacher with pill-popping, pot-smoking, alcohol-swilling pizazz. She shows up to work hung-over, and spends her nights hanging out at bars trying to hook up with any rich guy willing to take a chance with a gold-digging middle school teacher. I think it's a welcome change from her usual light-hearted comedic fare. In a nutshell, she gives the film's best performance.Surprisingly, Justin Timberlake, I think, continues to grow as a performer, especially after his well-received roles in past movies such as ""Alpha Dog"" (2006), and ""The Social Network"" (2010). While his work is not ""great"" here, it is at least showing that he is indeed capable of giving solid performances if given the right material. Phyllis Smith is also hilarious as their slightly neurotic fellow co-worker Lynn Davies. Segel probably gives the film's most grounded and realistic performance as the gym teacher who is only concerned with simply having fun, even though by his own admission he doesn't have a whole lot to have fun with.""Bad Teacher"" is a rotten apple that gets a ""B+"" for effort.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Bad Teacher, Bad Idea","Cameron Diaz basically plays the same character in every role she takes on. For me, the only time that role paid dividends was in 'Vanilla Sky', when she played the psycho sex partner to Tom Cruise. With 'Bad Teacher',it's now clear that that role is playing a little thin. Maybe she's just not being offered any good roles, but taking on this one surely won't increase such offers.The movie only avoided a one star rating because of a few one-liners and a couple of sight gags. Plot, well, there really isn't anything to make the viewer stay to the end of the film. What you have here is basically a series of sight gags, 90% sexual in character, which are loosely strung together. There is no character development and you really don't care what happens to anyone in the end.The supporting cast doesn't live up to that billing. They seem to be doing their own unrelated stand-up comic routines. Justin Timberlake should fire whoever told him to take a role in this movie. As a career move, it was a disaster.In short, find something better to do with your time. Bad Teacher is no laughing matter.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Pure filth, I love it","I think there are two main elements that keep this movie from having a decent rating. Firstly, it's incredibly silly. In my opinion the style totally suits the outlandish story, but occasionally even I needed a break from all the...well, basically from the Amy character. Lucy Punch plays her perfectly, she's so unbearable cheerful that you really can't wait for bad things to happen to her. If that sounds disturbing, well it's just the effect that the movie has on you. Because that was going to be my ""secondly"". It's a disturbing ride, you're forced to side with a character with no morals or conscience because it's just so entertaining to wonder what she's going to do next. If you don't mind either of these things, you'll find that there are a lot of laughs in this one. Particularly Justin Timberlake is fantastic in this (no, seriously), he's not the centre of attention but he should be damn it. His nonsensical ""I hate slavery"" speech is probably the highlight of the movie, though there's a lot of competition. ""Bad Teacher"" is one of those typical movies that get slammed upon release, but very slowly find a cult following afterwards (and rightfully so).",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is an enjoyable light-but-dark comedy,"Liz is a brassy blonde who, at the end of her thirties, is on the verge of fulfilling her lifetime ambition: marrying a rich simpleton. But then his mum calls of the wedding, and Liz has to return to her reviled breadjob as a middle school teacher. To her never-ending amazement, all her other colleagues -- the middle-aged loner, the hippie, the preppy goody-two-shoed apple-cheeked nightmare -- seem to actually enjoy teaching spotty dropouts. The script does an excellent job of lining up every comedic angle of the dreary hell that is school life and linking it together with a fast-paced storyline. Cameron Diaz is excellent because she isn't afraid to actually look old, spent and wrinkled (but never unfoxy), and Phyllis Smith and Lucy Punch also stand out among the excellent cast. Justin Timberlake -- eye candy for the ladies, in case you wondered. The soppy, romantic, test-audience-compatible ending -- best ignored.This is an enjoyable light-but-dark comedy that everybody who has had anything to do with school life can dig. And I hope that most people here have encountered a school at some part of their lives.",,Anonymous,Romance
One of My Favorites,"Bad Teacher is incredible. It's about the slacker teacher who just wants to marry rich. Isn't that everyone's dream?Cameron Diaz plays the teacher, who breaks up with her rich boyfriend. She later learns that life is more about love than money. And so on and so forth.I really like Diaz. I think she's a wonderful actress, and the roles she picks are a little off key. She's not the most attractive, but she doesn't quite fit into conventional roles. She easily could, but she doesn't. It's really interesting to see.This movie is a favorite of mine because of the way the main character carries herself and her life. I always have respect for the slacker. It's an actually hard lifestyle to keep up with. So many obstacles come your way from doing nothing. Diaz seems to take it in stride. I respect that.8 stars (probably deserves like 5 or 6)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bad Teacher Is A Bad Movie,"Trust me, there are no redeeming qualities about the character that Dameron Diaz plays in Bad Teacher, nor in the movie, for that matter. What I wonder is, who actually looks at a screenplay for something so empty, so worthless as this movie and says, ""Oh yeah, this is something I want to put time and money into producing."" Surely not anyone with the ability to judge good from bad, entertaining from non. There are movies I've enjoyed, that have characters in them you simply want to slap, they are so despicable. But in those films, there is a reason for them being so unlikable. Not so in this effort. This main character is simply a waste of time as a human being. Has Diaz's career sunk so far down that the thought of accepting just any role that comes along is fine with her? Why else would she associate herself with this garbage? Money? Frankly, there isn't enough money offered that would allow me to want my name and face associated with this movie. A great big zero as far as entertainment. Save your time and your money for something worthwhile. This movie isn't it.",,Anonymous,Romance

Definitely not what you would expect,"While Cameron Diaz never quite struck me as an Oscar Award Winner, this has to be the all time low of her performance as an actress. The truth is that her name still manages to sell and the movie made a more than reasonable amount of money, but for the viewer looking for a full and great movie experience, this is something they can skip.The plot is really shallow and the movie is basically made to make money and I think it is pretty safe to say that it has nothing to do with art. Justin Timberlake might have stepped up a notch with ""Friends with Benefits"", but this is beneath even him.The characters are really poor in what concerns the artistic impression, so don't expect this movie to be nominated for an Oscar anytime soon. If you are looking to kill some time in the afternoon, then yes watch this movie, but if you want to see a great movie and truly enjoy it, it's probably in your best interest to skip this one.Would I watch it again?

Downright boring.,"Let me squash any comparisons this atrocious comedy might evoke with its namesake Bad Santa right now. Where Billy Bob Thornton's un-PC Santa also gained sympathy, Cameron Diaz's ignominious teacher is a nasty piece of work with no redeeming features. Where Lauren Graham added naturalism to the love interest role, Justin Timberlake's geeky man-child is forced and cringe-worthy. Most importantly though, where Bad Santa was funny, Bad Teacher is downright boring and devoid of anything even remotely resembling humour. The always likable Jason Segal's valiant attempt at injecting energy as the sarcastic gym teacher is the only thing saving this languid picture from one star.",,Anonymous,Romance
One of the more underrated comedies of the year.,"""Your jeans feel so good against my jeans.""I had heard some pretty mixed things about Bad Teacher so I decided to wait and give it a rental instead of watching it at the theater, but it turns out I was a bit over-cautious. This is a pretty funny movie, and the best Cameron Diaz role since There's Something About Mary.Diaz plays Elizabeth, a shallow, materialistic, rude, manipulative teacher at a middle school whose only real current goal in life is to buy a pair of fake boobs and land a rich husband to take care of her the rest of her life. A young, rich substitute teacher ignites a rivalry between Elizabeth and another teacher, while at the same time Elizabeth does anything and everything in order to procure the $10,000 she needs to get her ""essential procedure"".Bad Teacher isn't really the kind of comedy that has a lot of laugh-out-loud moments (except one particularly funny scene involving dry-humping), and it's full of characters that have very few redeeming qualities. But I found it amusing throughout, its mean-spiritedness set it apart from a lot of the other comedies I've seen this year, and Diaz really did do a great job as the foul-mouthed, totally selfish main character. I liked it.",,Anonymous,Romance
One of the Most Eloquent Narratives the Language of Film Has Ever Related,"Diabolical teacher Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz), an abrasive, rude and exceptionally vindictive woman is on a mission: get wasted, go through the motions of teaching middle school, get wasted, earn enough for new implants, get wasted, marry a rich dude who will take care of her, get wasted, destroy a perky rival Ms.Squirrel (Lucy Punch) and of course get wasted.The public postulate on teachers is that they are underpaid, overworked and generally under-appreciated members of society on a collective mission very nearly looked upon as a charitable donation of time. That is a postulate not reflected in this movie.Miss Halsey is presented as an exception to the reality - a composite of every parent's nightmare, one who by her very nature defines solipsism and provides an example so poor that Mussolini's teaching record looks exemplary by comparison. She wouldn't last the morning in a real school even as a sub.The key thing to note about this film is the inverse moral scale. None of the people depicted are particularly virtuous though several are faking it. If you have kids in middle public school you might be a little disturbed by a film like this. Perhaps enough to consider home-schooling.Think of Youtube videos where you see teachers going ballistic over kids cellphones (Anyone knows kids shouldn't have cellphones in class) ringing or stories about women who have sex with their students and you'll get an idea of the worst case scenario they are tapping into here.There is always that fear in the back of the minds of parents about what educators are doing. Where this might be helpful is giving us a sense of the wrong kind of teacher.Like a film that is, say a comedy about health-care this production mines an institution in crisis - in this case the education system - for comedy. There are a lot of comically subversive films out there but few actually invent new ways to be offensive the way this one does.",,Anonymous,Romance
Maybe the best comedy film of the summer,"First off I want to say that I am impressed with Justin Timberlake. He is one of my favourite singers, so before 2010 I would have never regarded him as something else other than that. But I see he is getting into film more and more. After minor roles he had a breakthrough performance in The Social Network in which he played one of the main roles. This year he started off with this movie and I can't wait to see Friends with Benefits and In Time. In this film I think he nailed his role. I can't even say how much I liked his performance in this film. I think he might have a bright future in this line of business.The concept of the film is silly, but I liked it. The movie was cute and funny, it was adorable. For this type of film I think you do not need that much of an experienced director but talented screenwriters that can offer us a funny and imaginative script. That is exactly what Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky gave us. I also liked the performance Cameron Diaz offered us. At first I was holding off on my opinion concerning her performance because she is actually one of the actresses I dislike. But bottom line her performance was pleasing. Who am I kidding? She was actually great in this movie. So with a cast that didn't look that strong to me, all of the main roles were interpreted in a good way, including those of Lucy Punch as Amy Squirrel and Jason Segel as Russell Gettis, the other two main roles I didn't mention.For me this is one of the best comedy films of the summer.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bad Teacher,"8/10 - funny movie from the always charming Cameron Diaz that isn't perfect at every turn, but when it works, it really works.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bad Teacher,"2011 has been an above-average year for female-driven comedy, with recent films like ""Bridesmaids"", and ""What's Your Number"", proving to be the good and the bad. Today, we have ""Bad Teacher"", a Cameron Diaz film that falls somewhere in the middle of that spectrum.It follows Elizabeth Halsey, a morally corrupt middle-school English teacher, whose plans to quit her day job, to be a kept woman, were derailed. She's not necessarily a bad person, in my eyes, but she really shouldn't be teaching. She drinks, smokes weed, and puts on movies for her class, on the first day of school. She plays films for her class about good teachers, like ""Dead Poets Society"" and ""Freedom Writers"", while she pours airplane bottles of vodka into her coffee mug, ignoring her students completely.All of this is very funny to me, because this part of the movie is pretty well-conceived. Cameron Diaz gave a great performance, and proved herself to have above-average comic timing. She isn't to blame for where ""Bad Teacher"" went wrong. It leaves this viewer underwhelmed, at a film that should have been a lot funnier. However, it isn't necessarily a bad movie either. It's just never as funny as it should be.Written by ""The Office"" alums Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky, the film slightly resembles a long episode of ""The Office"" - something that has a brilliant concept, and the fully capable actors, however, it never really comes together in the end. However, there are a lot of reasons why this movie did work.One being that it makes pretty good use of the time that it's given. It runs about 90 minutes, on the dot, and it feels full and decently conceived. One big reason is Cameron Diaz, proving herself not to be just a pretty face, but something of a cunning comedienne. She plays one of the most detestable characters that American cinema has recently seen, however, the audience can't help but root for her.However, when the movie approaches moments of golden politically incorrect humor every so often, it's not what it should have been. A standard has been set for R-rated comedy films in the past few years, by films like ""Knocked Up"", ""The Hangover"" and ""Bridesmaids"", showing that there's a new point-of-no-return for comedy. This involves raunchy humor, yet it proves every so often, that new comedic punchlines and ideas haven't run dry.However, ""Bad Teacher"" shows us nothing we haven't seen before, recycling jokes from other (and better) movies. From a lame school car- wash scene, to a borderline degrading subplot about a boob job, there isn't enough good to outweigh the bad. As I said, it has its moments, but there aren't enough of those moments to make this a great film.Grade: B-",,Anonymous,Romance
Very funny movie!,"A movie that is simply very funny, I'm surprised at the many people who hated it. There were plenty of laugh out loud moments, and the outrageous behavior of the Cameron Diaz character was done is a clever enough way that it wasn't crude, everything that is done is motivated by the situation. It's been suggested by some that reaction to it is generational, but I'm 77 years old and I thought it was great humor.Maybe some people are sensitive to using the public school environment as the basis for humor, that it's in poor taste, but given the state of the U.S. educational system it's hardly a sacred institution.The whole cast is excellent, comedy isn't ever easy but characters are created that are effective without being overdone, which is the common and fatal flaw of most comedy. You expect good performances from Jason Segel, Phyllis Smith, and Justin Timberlake, and Lucy Punch pulls off the role of Diaz's ditsy competitor very nicely, but for the movie to work Cameron Diaz has to do a comedy role convincingly and without exaggeration, and she does a great job.I kept waiting for it to fall apart somewhere along the way, but it didn't at all, another thing that's not easy to do with a plot like this. It's got some originality, and is outrageous for effect, but it works, it's just plain funny.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Does for education what ""Bad Santa"" did for Christmas","This, I guess, is supposed to be in the vein of ""Bad Santa"", but it doesn't quite push the envelope far enough. However, it is very effective comedy and the filmmakers keep things moving. Later on, however, the movie loses a little steam, because the story about the love triangle between Diaz and Punch is mostly flat. I would have liked to see less of this, and a lot more in the classroom, or at least involving the students more. When the nature of the title character is exposed, the movie does get interesting again. I just wish the film were more consistent with the interesting stuff. The film also contains an unnecessary bathroom joke (which occurs at the end of the scene).**1/2 out of ****",,Anonymous,Romance
Waste of time,"I just finished watching this so called movie, as far as I am concerned it was a total waste of time and money. What has happened to Hollywood?

And what's up with a teacher giving a child a bra? Everyone knows that will land you in trouble with a lot of people. A good idea ended up a disaster.

Good for some laughs,"I read the reviews for this, and was instantly turned off. However, it was my girlfriend's turn to pick the movie, and she picked Bad Teacher. I wasn't looking forward to the movie after the reviews I read. The theater was quite empty, too. First of all, I agree that there will be no prize for a brilliantly written script. The morals were absolutely horrible, and no one still in grade school should be allowed to watch this movie. It is for adults, and adults who understand that this movie does not depict actual teachers. In fact, a vast majority of teachers are closer to the goody-goody teacher, Miss Squirrel (who annoyed the h&!! out of me by the end of the movie) The real problem with our public school system is with the lack of support at home regarding discipline and backing up the teachers from the parents (but I digress). There may not have been laugh after laugh in this movie, but the funny parts were really funny. I laughed out loud quite a lot. Much more than I thought I would. The gym teacher was my favorite character/actor, by far. Diaz did very well with what she was given. I found myself rooting for this shallow, poor excuse for a human being. I think only Diaz could make me do that. yeah, the moral of the story was horrible and it painted teachers in a bad light. But it was funny, and it isn't meant for people who still need morals to be taught to them. So, while I don't suggest it as your first pick, there's no reason to dread seeing Bad Teacher. I don't know why it is so funny to hear gorgeous blonds and little kids swear, but it is.... and it doesn't hurt to look at Diaz for a couple hours. (thank you, car wash scene!)",,Anonymous,Romance

A Nutshell Review: Bad Teacher,"Cameron Diaz burst onto the scene with her memorable role as the gangster's moll in The Mask, and from then on it's no turning back as her filmography grew by playing the quintessential ditzy blonde countless of times to perfection. In Bad Teacher comes the opportunity to play a foul mouthed, bad attitude, gold digging man-eater who's constantly on the prowl for man and money to fulfill her desire of... enhancing her boobs. Tis the season to venture out of your comfort zone, like what Jennifer Aniston did with her role in Horrible Bosses, and now it's Cameron Diaz's turn in this film by Jake Kasdan.So Diaz plays middle school teacher Elizabeth Halsey, who thought she could finally escape a life of mediocrity having hooked up with a rich man, only for that impending marriage to be broken up, and her life come crashing back down to reality again, rejoining the school she can't seem to leave, and then setting up a new goal in life - getting boob implants because of her belief that the bigger the boobs, the richer the man she's able to attract. In between she's the teacher you'd love to have, not only looking good, but possessing just a one track educational plan - screening videos in class everyday so that she can sleep off her hangover. Comedy comes in the form of watching how this teacher is anything but a role model, swearing, embezzling and abusing drugs being her daily routine, in front of and behind her kids in school.Unfortunately as a friend commented, the trailer for this film was miles better than the movie, and he's correct. Whoever did the trailer for the film inserted all the best bits in a typically logical order, only for the film to reveal that it's episodic in nature and scenes somehow felt they were pieced together quite forcefully, where the flow doesn't feel natural especially when it's supposed to take place in middle school over a period of a school year (for instance it's suddenly a winter break), but the school kids themselves are largely invisible here save for 2 kids for Elizabeth to show how naughty and nice she can be. There's a perplexing overemphasis on Elizbaeth's boob ambition which brings on the laughs of course, but little else, and a number of subplots and characters that come, go and got themselves forgotten.There's the infatuation with Justin Timberlake's relief Math teacher Scott Delacorte who comes with a pedigree family name and bank account, which sets up the subplot of a three way romantic battle between Elizabeth and the resident teacher she loathes, Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch), who is hell bent on exposing Elizabeth for the bad teacher she is. Nothing fancy here except rolling your eyes at Amy's exasperated antics, much like Coyote and Road Runner where you'd just know whatever stunt Amy tries to pull, she's never going to get the better of Elizabeth because it's just written in the stars of film plotting. Jason Segel plays gym teacher Russell Gettis whose scenes seemed to have a huge chunk of development dropped from the film, relegating him to back up plan status especially when there's a need for something to insert into the finale.The scene stealer in the show happened to be Justin Timberlake, who played his immature teacher to perfection, scoring probably one of funniest (and strangest) scenes in the entire film that have to be seen to be believed. He's on a roll in recent times since his outing in The Social Network, and his filmography bursting this year with two more upcoming films (in Singapore) with Friends with Benefits, and In Time. Cameron Diaz tried hard to break out of her ditzy blonde roles with the mean streak inherited from her character Elizabeth, but try as hard as you may, it still isn't wild enough to totally break the typecast Diaz is known for.Ultimately Bad Teacher isn't bad but it still fell short in delivering where it mattered - the laughs - lacking the distinction it could have gotten if it had found a smoother narrative flow, and not let its trailer set expectations up for a fall.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Not that funny, but worthwhile.","Why would this film be worthwhile? well, for one, Cameron diaz is still hotter than fire at age 38 (and a great actress) and she fills the role of a gold digging woman perfectly. throughout the first half of the movie you wanna punch her for being like that.So Cameron diaz plays Elizabeth Halsey, a sexy schoolteacher first, but a sleazy gold digger second. When her Blueblooded Sugar daddy is forced by his mother to dump her, she is left living with some guy on craigslist, and working a bare minimum as a school teacher. to make herself feel better she wants to get fake boobs, but doesn't have the money for them like when she had a sugar daddy. so she uses all her manipulative powers to raise the money for them.Also, I can relate to one of the characters. Garrett, who always wore that Gymnastics hoodie to class all the time. That was me in 6th, 7th grade. I just really felt like walking up to that poor kid and telling him to dress different. if he really wanted Chase to like him, he might have worn different shirts in the future.but I think what miss diaz did for him was more awesome than anything. just watch the film and you'll see why.7/10",,Anonymous,Romance
"Bad Teacher was a great idea, poorly executed","Jake Kasdan as a director doesn't have much of a resume, but he does have the comedic chops and timing, and he proved this with the underrated Walk Hard. With Bad Teacher, he did not have as much good material to work with but could have still helped the movie if he had tightened the first third of the movie better. There was a lot more unnecessary fluff in the first half of the movie compared to the second half. Smaller plot lines were never resolved, certain jokes literally fell off without a punchline, and certain situations were brought up but never explored. Many concepts were also never explored: especially that of how shallow and shady we all become towards each other in the workforce.Bottom Line: Bad Teacher was a great idea, poorly executed, but relentlessly saved by the energetic cast. This movie could have mixed the dark charm of Bad Santa with the subtle workforce ridiculousness humor of Office Space to become something very, very special. But neither style of humor was dwelled upon deep enough. The first half had its laughs, but was far too convoluted and was salvaged mainly because of the hilarity of Cameron Diaz. The movie definitely picks up later, but by then its too late, the potential was wasted. Either way, you will certainly laugh, you will remain entertained, but will also be bothered by what it could have been.",,Anonymous,Romance
Everything this movie does right can be done better,"** out of (****)""Bad Teacher"" is politically incorrect, exuded a few giggles out of me, and left me with a better impression on Diaz. That's about as much as I can say for this film. The problem with Diaz's latest film isn't that it's bad or not well done because those would be harsh statements, it's just not as good as it could've been. I will say though that that dry humping scene was just awkward, not erotic in any sense of the word, and left me hanging.""Bad Teacher"" revolves around the namesake character role who has to teach for a leaving after getting dumped by her ex. Along the way, she gets more indulged in her teaching when she finds out that the class with the highest scores gets a bonus.The question I'm sure everyone wants to hear is how funny the movie is. And to answer, it was funnier than I expected but just not as much as I would've liked. It seems like the film always resorts to foul humor, which is okay, but always being titillating and pushing the envelope gets tiresome.How's Cameron? She's okay. Although, I have to admit I wasn't very fond of her but this movie made me start to like her more. She seems like a fit actress (not just literally but metaphorically speaking).And lastly, how does this film stack up to other raunchy R-rated comedies of the year? Well for one, it's slightly better than ""No Strings Attached"", but nowhere near as great as ""Bridesmaids"". I'm curious to see how ""Friends With Benefits"" stacks up.All in all, I had a fun time with ""Bad Teacher"". It had its moments and entertained for most of the time, but I felt it could've been more than what it was. Let's just hope more R-rated comedies raise to their fullest potential.",,Anonymous,Romance
A rowdy good time,"I'm glad I'm not a critic and didn't read any reviews before I watched this movie because I just enjoyed it for what it is - A fun and silly comedy. I loved this movie and although I know it's not an Academy Award nominee, nor would it ever be, I thought it was a lot of fun and I really enjoyed it for what it was.Cameron Diaz is smoking hot and pulls off a very funny performance. Watch the unrated version for added dirtiness.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Smaller plot lines were never resolved,","his film's biggest falters come in the form of the script. Despite the promise in the premise and the cast involved, the script was convoluted, and didn't have much structure until the second half. As a matter of fact, the film switches up the pace very unexpectedly when the next act approaches. Pretty much almost all the crude and vulgar humor failed to draw laughs, with one notable exception involving one of the odder ""sex"" scenes in recent memory. The movie was a great idea not exactly explored upon, and was full of smaller ideas that were not utilized. Many good smaller characters did not get enough time in the script; most notably the students, the gym teacher (Jason Segal) and the main character's roommate (Erik Stonestreet).Despite the writing being a fickle mess, the cast was superb, from the small roles to the big ones. Cameron Diaz I can honestly say is one of the most underrated talents in Hollywood, because she rarely ever delivers a mediocre or weak performance. She has this aura, this energy that can save the worst of films (See: What Happens in Vegas) and it is no different here. Despite her smoking/drinking/vulgar/manipulative/cynical/cruel/superficial ways, we still secretly root for her to succeed in reaching her goal. Very few actresses can pull off this type of charm.Lucy Punch, despite having a bit of questionable material, delivers as Diaz's rival. Jason Segal could have helped the movie a lot more if he was in it more often, as he delivered the laughs every time he was on- screen with his wit, sarcasm, and I-don't-care attitude. Television staples Phyllis Smith and Erik Stonestreet were hilarious in the far- too-few moments they were on-screen. The movie does indeed have its laughs, but the potential was so much greater considering all the talented actors involved.Jake Kasdan as a director doesn't have much of a resume, but he does have the comedic chops and timing, and he proved this with the underrated Walk Hard. With Bad Teacher, he did not have as much good material to work with but could have still helped the movie if he had tightened the first third of the movie better. There was a lot more unnecessary fluff in the first half of the movie compared to the second half. Smaller plot lines were never resolved, certain jokes literally fell off without a punchline, and certain situations were brought up but never explored. Many concepts were also never explored: especially that of how shallow and shady we all become towards each other in the workforce.",,Anonymous,Romance
