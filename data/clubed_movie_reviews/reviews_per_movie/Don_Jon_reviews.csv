Anti-romantic Comedy,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Jon, a confident, promiscuous, foul-mouthed, obsessive-compulsive, Catholic New Jersey boy. Though he is able to sleep with any woman he likes, which is how his friend's gave him the name Don Jon, he is unable to find the same level of satisfaction he attains through his addiction to online pornography. After meeting Barbara, played by Scarlett Johansson, Jon falls in-love and struggles to choose between her and his addiction.Where a typical Hollywood romance would end, Don Jon just gets started. This is not a romantic comedy, this is a character-study within an anti-romantic comedy with great performances by an excellent cast in perfectly written roles. Tony Danza and Glenne Headly, as Jon's parents, provide some of the film's biggest laughs while Julianne Moore's character gives the story genuine heart. Joseph Gordon-Levitt proves to be just as talented behind-the-camera as he is in-front of it.Don Jon does more in one small, 90-minute film than most 2 hour big films have ever accomplished. There is much to learn about relationships in this little tale yet it's never preachy and it keeps the laughs coming. This isn't the kind of film couples will feel comfortable or even want to see but it's the film they need to see. It's sincere and honest truth, no fluff.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers a Stinging Critique of Modern Relationships,"Don Jon was very well-received in its regional premiere at the Paramount Theatre during Austin's SXSW Film Festival. The film was written, directed and starred Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He did a really fine job for his writing and directorial debut, but he may have been trying to do too much. The acting by Gordon-Levitt, Scarlett Johansson, Julianne Moore, Tony Danza, Glenne Headly, and Brie Larson is quite good. I think it is Gordon-Levitt's script that leaves something to be desired. His character Jon is a very successful ladies' man who is also heavily addicted to masturbating to internet porn – numerous times daily. Many people will find the film to be quite funny and enjoyable. However, the graphic use of porn will not be to everybody's taste and may be off-putting to viewers – particularly female viewers. I'm also wondering whether the extensive use of porn will lead to the MPAA giving it the kiss-of-death NC-17 rather than an R rating.JGL's script is well-intentioned and he is trying to make the point that many people become so self-absorbed that they lose the ability to interact with others on a human level. Jon is deadened to real romance by his reliance on porn. His girlfriend has an overly romanticized view of relationships based on watching too many romantic movies. They are both so self-absorbed and selfish that they can't really build a real relationship. Still, it was often difficult to figure out what JGL's point was and in many ways became clearer listening to him during the Q&A after the film. JGL is attempting to raise profound issues about human relationships in the modern era, but he hasn't quite figured out how to do that as a writer and director. I expect that he is going to become as fine a director and writer as he already is an actor. He has a fine future ahead of him.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's not just about porn.,"'Don Jon (2013)' isn't just a movie about porn (though, porn and porn addiction do play a large role in the plot). Instead, it's a surprisingly nuanced, emotionally mature and, even, touching affair that aims to break down the artificiality of on-screen romances. It draws a parallel between the unrealistic emotional expectations one may have if they watch too many romantic comedies and the unrealistic sexual expectations one may have if they watch too much pornography. It's actually quite clever in its own sort of way. It's also relatively realistic and reaches an unexpectedly small yet significant conclusion that seemingly couldn't be any further from its starting point. That's because the protagonist is a self-absorbed, sexist womaniser more concerned with his own, greasy hairline than the actual personalities of any of the women he 'scores' nightly. Since we're in his headspace from the very first frame, the actual film can almost be just as grating. However, it isn't long before you realise what it's doing and that its heart is firmly in the right place. Not only does it have interesting and important messaging, it aims for an audience that this sort of film doesn't usually reach. It's typically an enjoyable, unembarrassed experience. It may not look it, but it's unmistakably a film about love. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Solid, hard to define indie satire which will make some very uncomfortable - EXCELLENT first directorial effort!","Defining what kind of film this is had to be the hardest part of getting DON JON made, but ultimately it was worth it! It isn't really a ""guy"" film even though *technically* it tries to look at sex from a guy's perspective. It may actually best be called a ""chick"" flick, but one they would see alone rather than with a date. At the screening I saw, ALL the raucous laughter was coming from very obviously female voices - falling out of their chairs laughing over what they viewed as stereotypical male behavior - and even as the supposed ""10"" played by Scarlett Johansson reveals herself to be the kind of demanding (insert the word for a female canine here) who a very stupid - make that excessively immature - straight boy (like the one played with supreme élan by author/director Gordon-Levitt) would make a fool of himself over!The film heavily satirizes stereotypical straight New Jersey Catholics - the easily offended of which should probably stay away along with anyone who expects a slick date night romantic comedy that doesn't require them to THINK - but it IS a beautifully structured and polished first directorial effort and very funny in its way. Man or woman though, it is not your usual DATE film to see with the opposite sex. The litmus scene for the film was probably when Johansson (Barbara) confronts Gordon-Levitt (Jon) over watching porn! Foolishly trying to evoke simple reason, he (accurately) tells her that ""EVERY guy watches porn - and that anyone who says he doesn't is lying."" The theatre got absolutely quiet there for a moment in any section where dates were sitting, as each side wondered what the other was thinking. What YOU may think in that scene will determine a lot about how you view and react to the film. You may enjoy it regardless of what you think of that (for the film) core issue, but you sure won't want to see it with anyone who you can't comfortably talk about it with.The ""home"" scenes with Jon's family and Barbara's are probably excess baggage, but they give the central characters broad context (the broadest performance in a very stylized film is probably Tony Danza's performance as Jon's father) - and set up the one totally human moment in the film when Jon's silent sister defines what a good sibling should be when she finally has a line! Ultimately, there is one unexpected, rational woman (Julianne Moore giving a remarkable imitation of Susan Sarandon!) who Jon meets in the night class Barbara insists he take who not only ""gets"" him but broadens his horizons for the kind of growth any central character in a good film must have.Don't expect a pat happy ending or a cheap thought-free throw away comedy (and DON'T make it first date material with someone you don't know yet!), and the open minded will have a wonderful time. My take-away image is really of a few years ago at the first Broadway preview of a Tony winning musical called AVENUE Q. Just before it started, a student of mine at the university where I teach came over to introduce his mother who was seeing the show too, sitting in front of each other all the way over at the side. Midway through the show there was a very funny, very outrageous musical number called ""You Can Be As Loud As You Want"" (When You're making Love). I glanced over to see how my student and his mother were taking it and, as you can imagine, my student, sitting in front of his mother, was sinking onto the floor with embarrassment. What he *couldn't see* was his mother rocking with laughter both at the insouciance of the number and her son's embarrassment! I think my mother (who, as far as I know, probably doesn't approve of pornography) or my minister would be howling with laughter at DON JON too - but they probably wouldn't want anyone they knew to see them doing so.Recommended - but with noted reservations.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I like it,"I like this film. Not ignoring its sins . seeing it as a honest, precise work of a good actor, interesting director, illustration of a simple and touching story, using taboo themes in inspired manner, offering realistic portrait of family, addiction, love and loneliness and self definition. Gordon - Levitt gives a beautiful demonstration of exploration of near reality in its sensitive and basic aspects in wise and convincing manner. This is the best thing in this case. And, of course, the splendid job of actors , especially Tony Danza and Scarlett Johanson and surprising embroidery of character from Julianne Moore.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Sex, love and pornography.","As if Joseph Gordon-Levitt couldn't get any better. The former child star has turned into quite the up-and-coming young actor as he's worked to re-brand himself as something more than that kid from 3rd Rock From the Sun. Over the years, he's starred in such films as Brick, The Dark Knight Rises and Looper, and has proved to be the type of actor whom everyone loves - and who actually deserves that love. However, his most impressive performance to date might just be the one he gave behind the camera with Don Jon.The film marks Levitt's first time writing and directing a feature- length film, and it makes one hell of an impression, especially because he tackles the lead role as well. Don Jon is one of those movies that has plenty of laughs and a few heartfelt moments, and it's certainly entertaining. But it also touches on a few interesting social issues. I think I'll just go ahead and say it, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives away a few trade secrets, much to the horror of men everywhere: Don Jon touches on that dreadfully embarrassing fact that every guy is terrified will come out. What secret is that? Well, it's probably best to put it in the words of the protagonist, Jon, himself: ""Every guy looks at porn, every day.""Well, that last part might be a bit of an exaggeration, but Don Jon does bring up the point that pornography has become so readily available through the internet and even television that it's just simply within arm's reach at every single second of every single day, and every guy now and then reaches out to take a handful. However, society still treats it as something shameful and embarrassing, rather than a fact of life.Don Jon doesn't treat the use of pornography as something that should destroy relationships or cause significant others to fly off the handle in fits of jealousy. In fact, the movie seems to indicate, it's a habit that's probably pretty healthy. That isn't to say that Jon has a healthy habit, as he's reduced to having to look at pornography constantly throughout the day, even after sex, but you know, that's an extreme example.Then again, maybe it isn't. Maybe the film offers a bit of a warning about how a little pornography is perfectly normal, but a lot can create a monster. Too much porn can make it so that it's nearly impossible to connect with someone else on a meaningful level. After all, watching too much sex can create expectations that are as unrealistic as the ones the romantic comedies create.What really impressed me about Don Jon, though, are the performances that Levitt pulls out of his co-stars. I've honestly never seen Scarlett Johansson give a better performance than she did as Jon's trashy New Jersey girlfriend, Barbra. She's absolutely despicable as she slowly begin to reveal her true intentions and tries to paint Jon as the bad guy when she discovers his addiction. On top of that, Tony Danza gives a side-splitting performance as Jon's hot-headed father who gets into dick-measuring contest with his son every Sunday night (figurative, people, come on).However, the most impressive of them all is Levitt himself, who has repeatedly proved that he is one hell of an actor and one who has earned my trust as a moviegoer. The role is something so far from what I would have ever pictured him portraying, but he pulls it off beautifully as he plays the scumbag good-guy stereotype.Now for the hard part. I really enjoyed Don Jon. It strikes as a solid balance between art and entertainment, it's filled with lots of laughs and it touches on a sensitive topic in a way that doesn't seem preachy. The ending is a little weak, but everything up until that is golden. However, I'm not sure if it's what one would call a date movie, since it will probably lead to inquisitive stares during a quiet car ride home afterward. And honestly, that's really too bad. For the people that are willing to embrace the fact that everyone looks at porn, this movie is well worth the price of admission. However, I'm not sure if most of its value comes from the first viewing. It's no Shame, but there's really no shame in that.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An important message about addiction,"With the ever-prevalent rise and availability of internet porn, more and more men are experiencing erectile dysfunction, relationship dysfunction, and the consequences of addiction far worse and far younger than ever before. Don Jon confronts the realities of porn addiction on the young male mind. While it does not delve into the more severe side effects of porn addiction (like PIED), it does have an important message to convey and does it quite well.Joseph Gordon Levitt plays Don Jon (and directs), a deplorable man living in New Jersey. Don Jon has the cringeworthy qualities of modern day pick-up artists: he is unchaste, disrespectful of the women he watches and meets in real life, and views sex as a wholly selfish endeavor (expects oral, does not like to give it). His friend group refers to women as numbers (she's an 8), ""things"" (using words like ""it""), or disrespectful nicknames (""ponytail""). When Jon meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), he falls in love with what he calls ""the most beautiful 'thing' I've ever seen."" Barbara expects more of her men: she expects to be wooed, doesn't sleep with him right away, and flips out when she catches him watching porn. Barbara herself is not without her flaws; most of all, she is certainly naive, expecting a selfish dude-bro like Jon to respect monogamy being one mind-boggling assumption she makes.Don Jon explores more than just porn addiction; it also explores nature v. Nurture. Jon himself claims his addiction is normal for men (obviously believing it to be in his nature), but we see glimpses of his home life (where his father continuously disrespects women in front of his wife) and friend circle (where his friends are incapable of treating women like people rather than objects to be conquered). Don Jon also hints at Barbara being conditioned to want the ""perfect"" relationship based on her obsession with romance movies, which few men (but in particular someone like Jon) could hope to compete with. When Esther (Julianne Moore) character comes into the focus of the story, the movie's once unlikable protagonist finally begins to see hope. Esther is arguably the most important character of all, helping Jon to realize his porn addiction is the main source of his poor sexual performance, and helping him mature from a porn-sick little boy into a man with some amount of promise.While Don Jon covers a lot of territory and themes that most movies wouldn't dare touch, it doesn't quite make any daring or definitive conclusions. It also manages to be triggering to the same audience it is trying to reach. I am a former porn addict myself, and there are enough flashes of what appears to be actual porn in the film that could threaten the sobriety of any current or former addict. Be warned! Otherwise, Don Jon is a fairly good drama (I would not call it romantic or a comedy by any stretch of the imagination given its serious and bleak themes) about the addiction that is the least spoken about in modern society, and I recommend it to current addicts or the victims of addicts.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
'Don Jon' Puts Jersey Spin on Romantic Comedies,"New Jersey guy Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) only cares about a few things in his life: his family, friends, church, and porn. After many one-night-stands, he finally decides to settle down with a ""dime"" named Barbara (Scarlett Johansson). But not even this relationship can compare to the happiness Jon has when alone with his pornography. When he realizes his porn may be too influential on him, he begins to change his lifestyle and beliefs with help from an older woman (Julianne Moore).Stories of sex addiction aren't new, having been dealt with most recently in 2011's Shame, but Don Jon feels different. Jon loves porn; he says it many times in voice-over and is consistently shown getting up in the middle of the night to go watch porn after just having sex in real life. He doesn't see it as an addiction, saying ""It's porn. It's not heroin,"" as his excuse. To show the media influence on sex, the film opens by crosscutting many sexualized commercials, film scenes, and television clips over the credits, while actual pornography clips are spliced throughout. But unlike Shame, which treats this topic in an intense, dramatic way, Jon keeps it light, funny, and tries to show how easy it is for someone to unknowingly fall into this addiction in today's sex- obsessed culture.The film also tackles an exploration of today's relationships. Barbara's own ""porn"" is romantic Hollywood films that Jon hates. These films have influenced Barbara's ideas on dating (she yells at him to stop cleaning his apartment because it's not sexy) and enforced her beliefs that typical gender roles are the only means to a happy relationship. This film speaks truths about ideas young people may have about dating in today's culture, and while spinning these topics in a mostly comedic light, it is still interesting to consider how much media pertains to our understanding of the world.Don Jon succeeds in most areas, and one large part is due to its cast. Tony Danza is really funny as Jon's father and Scarlett Johansson (and her hilarious Jersey accent) steals every scene she in. The film offers up a good amount of laughs, and the purposeful repetitive narrative works in showing Jon's changing lifestyle. Most of the film is so upbeat and fast that the last twenty minutes may feel like its dragging, but it can be considered necessary due to Jon's slowed-down new lifestyle.The fact that this is the first film by writer-director Gordon-Levitt is extremely impressive. Don Jon flies at a mostly fast pace, has a fun cast, and gives a great commentary on sex, relationships, and addiction.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great directorial debut from JGL,"I saw this at a pre-screening for SXSW and I was really impressed. Joseph Gordon-Levitt really holds his own as a writer/director, and it was nice to see him in a role I hadn't really considered him ""right"" for. Scarlett Johansen and Julianne Moore are both wonderful as well. Basically, you should see this if you get the chance. It's funny, charming, different, and tells a great story that ends up going in a direction I hadn't anticipated.This movie basically tells the story of a young guido (Gordon-Levitt) who has a porn addiction and ends up in a relationship with Scarlett Johansen's character. One thing leads to another, blah blah blah.... you'll see when you see it. I don't want to give too much away.Anyway, yeah! Really good movie, great directorial debut, and a well told story. I'd recommend this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A 10 for the message if nothing else...,"(Somewhat Spoiler-y) I've dated an older woman, and in a lot of ways she tried to tell me the same things Esther tells Jon. In fact I remember a few distinctly similar interactions, so on that level the movie really spoke to me.I imagine one could say the movie relies on some clichés, just enough to satisfy the romance/comedy genre, but it uses them in very unique ways to tell a story that at least seems a little more real. Sort of like 500 Days (of Summer) on steroids. No pun intended. In fact it may be even safe to say that Don Jon is the next chapter in the 500 Days saga, albeit with a different character. Perhaps one made cynical by the events of JGL last romance comedy outing.Don Jon has graduated beyond puppy love, certainly, and onto full blown adult fun. But the movie is very biting, and sort of tears apart his self-serving agenda.A lot of people seem to be caught up in the ""porn"" aspect of the movie, but honestly the ""porn"" is a metaphor, no more important to the gym-tan-laundry-sexualized commercials.There are only two real female characters in the film: Esther, and Jon's quiet-except-for-one-powerful-line sister. The sister in fact almost makes the movie, as they use her small character to incredible effect.The movie does a nice job of tricking the audience into rooting for Jon and Barbara, of course it's all a ploy. They even set up Esther as a sort of antagonist. She is enticing yet feels all wrong for Jon. Older, sort of run down, maybe a bit of a predator of weak men, the movie isn't very clear about her at the start. She runs completely counter to the stereotypes of women as set up by the film. She is far from perfect, but Moore makes her believably beautiful. I truly doubt many other actresses could've sold this role in the way she did. While her age played right into the character she probably was right for the character for mostly other reasons.I don't think the movie is overall that outstanding. Many of the jokes fall flat, and some of it is tedious. In fact the vast majority of it could be considered filler, but the end is so incredible it does a great job of tying all these scenes together in a way that makes perfect sense and delivers a powerful message. Without completely ruining it the end embraces the typical cliché, but flips it on it's head. What results is a very mature version of what audiences have come to expect from these types of movies. The same, but also very different.I would expect JGL will have continued success as a Director and actor.The guy truly gets it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good first big filmmaking effort from JGL,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt is bringing his best Jersey Shore impersonation. He's writing, directing, and staring in his first big filmmaking effort. Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) loves only a few things. He cares about his workouts, his cleaning, his car, his family, his church, his boys, chicks, and his porn. Then he meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson) at the club. On a scale from 1 to 10, she's a dime. She loves rom-coms, and she wants to completely change him. She hates him watching porn and gets him to go to night school. At school, nosy Esther (Julianne Moore) keeps bothering him.There is a lot to commend on JGL's first big effort. He allows his actors to do their thing. Scarlett Johansson does a good Jersey princess. Tony Danza is amazing as the big macho father. JGL really never lets his mask slip. Julianne Moore brings the deepest character in the whole movie. The movie has its dark moments. Its subject matter is edgy. The funny moments are slightly humorous. It's a dark comedy but just not that funny. If there is an emotional truth, it hits it with a hammer. The movie really gets interesting with the Esther character. JGL did some good work here. The style looks sharp. The script probably needs a few more well written jokes. I look forward to his next directing project.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dull and Boring,"Let me preface by saying that I am in no way turned off by vulgarity in any form. The fact that this film was filled with curse words and pornographic clips did not affect me in any way. This movie was simply brutal and not funny.I lasted through 45 minutes of it until I had enough and left the movie theater. Not once during this film did I even chuckle. The humor in this movie boils down to: recycled ""bro"" jokes, rehashed ""guido""/""Jersey Shore"" humor, and audio/visual vulgarity.Had this movie been the least bit funny, I would have lasted throughout the whole thing. This movie is not ""brilliant"", and completely fails to be funny in any way, shape, or form. I appreciate films for being done well from technical aspects (It was part of my major at college), but this movie was simply not funny and was entirely too repetitive.If you want to stare at Scarlet Johansson or see boobs, just stay at home and look at porn by yourself.

"Solid directorial debut by the most likable American actor of his generation, Joseph Gordon-Levitt","""Don Jon"" (formerly known as ""Don Jon's Addiction"") is the feature directorial debut of the talented and ridiculously charismatic Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He also wrote the script and plays the title character, a young man from New Jersey who's developed: a) an unhealthy addiction to porn; and b) such unrealistic expectations about sex and love (and sex) that not even a ""10"" like Barbara (a hilarious Scarlett Johansson, in what is easily her best work since ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"") can satisfy him in real life.""Don Jon"" reminded me of a great, half-forgotten French film: Bertrand Blier's ""Too Beautiful for You"" (1989). In that film, a wealthy car dealer (Gerard Depardieu) who has everything – including a beautiful wife (Carole Bouquet) – falls for his plain, slightly overweight secretary (Josiane Balasko). ""Don Jon"" is also like Blier's film in the sense that Jon finds his ""10,"" yet he's still unsatisfied. Both films are very different in tone, aesthetics, and geography, but they delicately touch in the realm of our own emotional misconceptions and immaturity. We live in a world where our ever-growing concern about self-image, and the belief that we must abide by unattainable beauty standards in order to find a decent match, have grown so out-of-hand that all we ever do is find obstacles to getting to know anyone who doesn't meet our own ridiculous requirements. We are always waiting for the illusory perfection. Levitt sharply illustrates this issue by way of porn addiction; it might be crude for some, but he manages not to fall into excessive vulgarity or toilet humor.Also featuring the always wonderful Julianne Moore in an important role, plus Glenne Headly (I've missed her on the big screen), Tony Danza, and Brie Larson as Jon's parents and sister, respectively; ""Don Jon"" is worth the visit. Here's hoping for more JGL directorial efforts!",,Anonymous,Romance
Hilarious and fearless!,"I am a Joseph Gordon Levitt die-hard fan now. It's hard to believe that someone so young is this talented. He wrote the script, directs the movie, stars in it, and does a fantastic job at all of those. This movie was absolutely hilarious! I have not laughed this hard since The Hangover. Don Jon portrays the effect of media in normal romantic life.One character is addicted to porn while the other is hopelessly expecting her life to be one of her adored romantic films. This movie delights in mocking regular romantic comedies and their worn-out recipe. There is even a sad version of one starring Channing Tatum and Anne Hathaway within the film.This film was realistic and fearless, humorous to the point of drink-spitting, originally well executed and very well cast. Audiences will be surprisingly pleased and eagerly awaiting more from JGL as a writer/director/actor combo.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Distinct idea, pleasant performances, realistic ending","Movies dealing with lust, masturbation, casual sex, etc. are not for everyone, and they must be candid or with twisted approach, otherwise they are just rude and embarrassing. In my opinion, Joseph Gordon-Levitt (director + screenwriter + leading male) has found this angle, and the result is a realistic movie depicting modern comprehension of sex and love among the younger generation, boosted by Internet and club atmosphere. Even family ties or church are often unable to hinder this...All the three leading performances are sophisticated: apart from Gordon-Levitt as Jon ""Don Jon"" Martello, Jr., Scarlett Johansson as Barbara Sugarman and especially Julianne Moore as Esther provide brave but still nice performances. The other are also okay, however, most uninviting Don Jon's pals, apparently brought along for diversification of ethnicities.""Only"" 7 points from me as I find some other recent movies with the presence of Gordon-Levitt more interesting (e.g. 50/50, Hesher, 500 Days of Summer).

Bad plot+Bad accents+Bad acting=we walked out.,"I don't know anyone besides 13 year old boys that would give this movie anything over one star. It was horrible. Basically, it was clips of porn intertwined with a very basic, simple story of a guy and his porn addiction. The characters have ""jersey"" accents that kind of hop in and out of their lingo and jargon making it obvious that they are trying too hard. Don't get me wrong, I like all of the actress/actors in this film. I'm blaming this one on the writing. The plot could be summed up in one sentence or about 5 minutes. I think that's why so many porn clips were added in-to make it longer and seem cutting-edge. The only thing cutting edge about this film is how much porn was shown and it was only rated R. We were expecting to see a film that pushed boundaries but was interesting...not so much. Lame.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A powerful insight into the modern day mans psyche towards women and relationships,"The first half hour of this film makes you feel quite uncomfortable, I saw a pre-screening with my girlfriend and It made me feel a little tense as I wasn't able to gauge how she was perceiving what she was watching.There are a lot of sexually orientated scenes, cut scenes from porn movies, scenes of our protagonist Jon getting off with a hell of a lot of women. Scarlett Johansson's arrival doesn't slow any of this down, despite her being cast in the archetypical female role. That being the girl Jon is going to give up his wicked ways for. I won't spoil how this ultimately pans out. Around this point the humour kicks in and I must say there are quite a few laugh out loud scenes. Jon's relationship with his family in particular and just his strange character in general provide a good comedic vibe.This film will not be for everybody. Those faint hearted souls who wont be able to stand anything more offensive than the solitary use of the F word, well you guys should certainly pass this by. Overall the F word is used in excess of 120 times in this picture for starters. For me, as the film plays out the sexual cut scenes begin to have more substance. They start to mean more than just the showing of perverse acts, I believe what JGL was trying to show was an insight into how modern day men perceive women and relationships. How expectations are raised by pornography and advertising to create an image that will never be fulfilled in normal life.In some ways the film ends a bit of a damp squib, despite being an enjoyable ride there is somehow a lack of conviction in the ending. Our 'hero' does see the error of his ways, but it could have been done more convincingly in my opinion. All in all though this is a solid directorial debut from JGL, there seems to be a real pace about the film from beginning to end. The way the dialogue is delivered and the temperament of the characters keeps things running steady and keeps you hooked.Definite recommendation from me.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Total waste of time,"I am not usually a movie critic, I am the person who enjoys almost any film and manages to find the good in whatever im watching and can usually enjoy movies others do not. In regards to this movie I did not and feel it was a total waste of time.Summary, ( Possible Spoiler Alert )The entire movie was about an individual who was a supposed ladies man and would make it his mission to go home with a different women every week in order to have a one night stand. One night stand after one night stand the main character is never satisfied so of course turns to porn in order to get himself off. Eventually he gets into a destructive relationship while pursuing sex with someone and finds he is still unsatisfied and looks for the purity that he finds from porn in a sexual partner. He gradually explores himself as well as some interesting people along the way and changes for the better.The End""Critique""I thought the movie was crap, I wanted to walk out of the theatre and thats never happened before. First off the display of porn is so over exaggerated to be borderline ridiculous. The accents in the movie were nerve grating and made my ears bleed and were so terribly done people in New jersey should be offended. The Main actor in the movie was alright and Tony was epic in his performance but every other person portrayed in the movie were rank amateurs and it was really hard to believe anything.So in total I think this sums it up best, Stupidest movie I've ever seen to the point where it was the only movie I ever wanted to walk out of the theatre.

One of the Most Confident Films You'll Ever See,"Don Jon (2013)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Joseph Gordon-Levitt wrote, director and stars as Jon, a twenty-something man who loves women but what he loves even more is watching porn. He meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson) who demands that he gives it up for her. DON JON isn't the greatest film ever made but I will say that I don't recall ever watching a movie that was so confident. Confidence is something most people lack and even most brass movies lack it but DON JON certainly isn't afraid to say what it wants to and stick by it. Having a romantic comedy that says watching porn is better than being with women and then tells you why that's the case is something incredibly rare. What's even rarer is that this type of subject is usually just played for cheap laughs but here there's a complete story wrapped around it that asks a lot of questions, gives a lot of answers and as I said, is 100% confident about itself. The confidence just really jumps off the screen unlike any movie I've ever seen and that's where the original aspect of this film comes. There have been countless movies that downplay women but this one here just does so in such a fresh and original way that you can't help but enjoy it. It also is very smart about guys, their mentality on sex and various other issues. Gordon-Levitt does a wonderful job all around but especially in the acting department. As the writer he certainly knows this character very well but it still takes a very strong performance to get that to the screen and the actor does a fabulous job. Johansson also turns in her greatest work outside of a Woody Allen picture and Tony Danza is very memorable in his supporting bit as is Glenne Headly and Julianne Moore. The screenplay is certainly dirty and covers a lot of topics but the film never crosses the offensive line. The main reason it doesn't cross the line is that it remains smart no matter what it's saying and how dirty it's being said. DON JON is certainly a refreshing film that should get one excited thinking that Gordon-Levitt could turn into someone to keep your eye on not just as an actor but as a writer and director.",,Anonymous,Romance
"It's content will alienate people, and the story lacks cohesiveness, but Don Jon is pure, poignant social satire","Halfway through Don Jon, the point of its madness all hit me; this is the Easy Rider (1969) of Generation Y. To explain, Don Jon is pure social satire. Joseph Gordon ""The Situation"" Levitt's directing debut is a mirror into what our generation is. Not what's wrong or right with it, just a mirror. And like the reflection in said proverbial mirror, you either like what you see, or don't.Jon, nicknamed ""The Don"" due to his skill of always picking up at least 8's every night, meets and subsequently falls in love with the girl of his dreams. He then must come to terms with his routine-infested little life, the superfluous B.S. that comes with having a relationship these days and, oh right, his porn addiction. I suppose it goes without saying that there is gratuitous explicit dialogue and pornographic clips intertwined into the story.Don Jon is visually exceptional and expediently acted. It's editing is off the Richter scale and its comedy is as tongue-in-cheek as it gets. Don Jon pings and fizzes with energy and feels positively alive. For that, Don Jon gets two stars. And one bonus star for being truly original, both in its seismic delivery and its tenacity.There's a clear sense that Don Jon has been honed for people that love film, in that it's singular purpose is to inspire thought and discussion. It's message is 100% subjective. Unfortunately, and perhaps in and effort to highlight its point as a satire, Don Jon has a story with all the cohesion and structure of balsa wood. There is no background, buildup, climax, or falling action. Don Jon fails on the premise of basic storytelling. And that is unforgivable.Make no mistake, this movie WILL be looked upon years from now as a concealed insight to our psyche. I know this may sound excessive, given this movie's La-De-La approach, but look past what's on the surface. And you'll be looking at us. You may just not know it yet.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
JGL's debut feature is one to remember!,"Don Jon was one of the movies I'd been looking forward to this year. The reasons, obvious: Its written and directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the previews were good and Scarlett Johansson looked insanely hot in it. Don Jon deals with porn addiction and in essence, I felt, it largely a movie for the masculine crowd. Take it or leave it. But that's not to say the feminine mass can't enjoy it, for starters it stars JGL.Jon Martello, played by JGL himself, is a pornography addict and its his quirks, awkward moments and the addiction that makes the movie. Don Jon has a lot of little things that adheres to your viewing pleasure. And no it's not the titillating scenes that I'm taking about. It's the little things that makes a good movie, scenes that bring a smile on your face, a chuckle every now and then. The subject matter of porn could have easily slid into being crude but thanks to JGL's skilled direction, its never crossed the offensive line and instead it took a lighter and a more stylish path. JGL's direction instills comedy and immense awkwardness in Don Jon. And unlike Steve McQueen's Shame it steers clear of drama and serious notes up until its final act.JGL packs an infinite charm and confidence here. It felt like he's finally broken out of his boyish molds. Well we did get a sample in Killshot's Richie Nix but here he just puts it all upfront with his convincing Italian accent and all. Scarlett Johansson was just as brilliant and again not coz she's hot. Well she is, but the way she talked, the way she delivered her lines, its impeccable acting prowess. Her accent, which initially put me off, came with her character and she did a grand job. Its one of her finest roles ever, outside Woody Allen movies.The supporting cast was splendid as well. I wondered what Brie Larson had been doing playing Jon's texting-obsessed sister who barely had anything to do or say and there were times when I felt her character was just there for the sake of it, under developedbut towards the final act it changed, in an instant! Tony Danza, despite his limited screen time, shared an immaculate chemistry with JGL.The movie is what I'd call slick, at least the first two acts. The visuals had a lot of editing done to, that added to the visual flair. And add to that an awesome soundtrack, Don Jon becomes a stellar treat. Who wouldn't shake their heads to Marky Mark And The Funky Bunch's Good Vibrations?Don Jon ain't without its flaws though. I couldn't buy into the events that redeems him towards the end. The scope of the story could have much more but I guess keeping it short worked best. Julianne Moore's character could have had a bit more back story. I just didn't get what her catch was. Now lets talk about the steamy scenes, yes there are plenty but nothing to be delirious or appalled about; it just blends well with narrative.Ultimately Don Jon is a refreshing movie owing everything to its sumptuous performances, stellar cast, stunning visuals, music and was terrific for a directorial debut. It makes me wanna see more of JGL's film-making skills",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Detached,"Joseph Gordon Levitt proves he can act and direct at the same time. Bringing Tony Danza back (in a different more extreme Dad role than most know him from) was a great move too. But the movie is all about JGL performance. In front and behind the camera, choosing how to cut a movie together that some might call pornography (though it isn't, it's a movie about addiction).Sex addiction is something that people take very lightly, making fun of it most of the time. But it can be more serious than that. And Don Jon proves that in a very comical way. Where Michael Fassbender went on and played it like a drama (equally good at least in ""Shame""), this movie is lighter in tone most of the time. Still having drama to sit through, but the comic moments, make this an easier film to watch. If you don't mind the sexual theme it has, you will get a powerful movie about the Downfalls of addiction",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely Terrible,"In the past 10 years, I've probably seen more than 200 movies at theaters. This is the first movie that I've ever walked out on. 45 minutes in, I couldn't handle the torture anymore. This is the most unfunny piece of garbage I've ever seen. Although, I did get a good chuckle when about 50% of the audience had left before the halfway mark.It's hard to meet the minimum post-length requirement for this movie, because there isn't much to say about it.I didn't find anything clever. Nor did I find them funny. I did think some of the set designs looked okay. This film is a huge waste of time, don't bother wasting your money on this garbage. Just avoid this. It's not even worth a rental.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A solid comedy with a surprising amount of heart,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt has knocked it out of the park with this directorial debut. Don Jon is funny, touching, raunchy and is definitely worth the price of admission. The film explores the relationship between a porn addicted ladies man and a woman that thinks he can change him for the better. Don Jon's strengths are not only in it's unique story, but in the performances. Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives an award worthy performance as the titular character, playing him not just as a Jersey Shore wannabe with shallow interests, but someone that is more than what they seem. He brings heart and charm to a character who is, in any traditional sort of sense, unlikable. Scarlett Johanssen is truly remarkable as Barbara, a beautiful and mouthy woman who looks to change Don Jon for the better in hopes that she will ride off in the sunset with him. The supporting cast, which includes the likes of Tony Danza and Julianne Moore, keep the film interesting even when the Jon and Barbara story line begins to wear a bit thin towards the third act.The biggest surprise of this film, is the cynical take on Hollywood romantic comedies. Don Jon is a film that does not follow the Hollywood archetypal romantic comedy formula, instead, it relishes in making the genre a joke, including a mock film starring Channing Tatum. Gordon- Levitt establishes his cynical nature in the trailer of the film but that is nothing compared to the fun this film has with the genre clichés.This is a film that will catch a lot of people by surprise, it is funny, heartfelt and very intriguing. The best way to describe this film is a funny and more audience friendly version of the brilliant 2011 Steve McQueen film, Shame. It will make you laugh, it will make you cringe but most of all, it won't make you feel that bad about spending the twelve dollar ticket.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Original, Outright, Worth Watching","***SPOILER ALERT***The movie is original and unique in a lot of ways that unfold later on that takes it from going mediocre in the middle of the movie, to Good in the end. It opens up grabbing your attention, realizing this guy just doesn't like porn like the next dude and merely holds consistently to it... but he takes it more seriously than any other facet of life. It's not just an addiction, but a lifestyle. Despite his fantasy-level accomplishments as a single guy, having sex with bombshells every week that an Average Joe has only had once, maybe twice in his life in college, his seriously-taken experience with porn is still the most satisfying prize in life.He explains and justifies This in the movie well, but in another very important element, he does not. Which may have been done on purpose to leave it up to the viewer, thinking about it afterward.It doesn't fully quench your thirst at the end, but it does bring a surprising wake-up call that may be more hidden to others: Barbara Sugarman, the bombshell that any guy would be lucky to have, has her own problem. In fact, her problem, though not an addiction, causes pain/issues on others directly. Her issue is that she wants a guy to follow her and what she does, not by taste, but by Expectation.Barbara's fantasy world is wrapped up in Romcoms, which is just as unrealistic (if not more-so) than an enthralling porn clip... but also followed through in expectations that things Are supposed to be one-sided between guy and girl, where the guy should be lucky to have the woman and conform to what she wants and where things go. Again, not as a taste, but a ""Uhh, yeah, duh,"" much like a guy's position on merely watching porn now and again. But her problem is worse than a person (guy or girl) merely watching porn, although it's on the same level as someone with Jon's massive lifestyle addiction to it.But in the end, Jon grows up, and she doesn't, in their last 5 minute talk. I think the writing could have been better with the older woman Esther he engages with. The movie didn't get in-depth with his character bonding with her... it just seemed rushed and an ""Oh, by the way, with Esther, yeah, I found myself even though it's not a Relationship-relationship..."". That's what leaves the thirst unquenched, but at the same time, you're still left reasonably satisfied due to it being a thought-provoking movie about controversial things outside the ""norm"".",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Horrible Movie,"I know I am a minority on here. I REALLY went into this movie wanting to laugh. Not 1 chuckle out of me. It was a 1.5 hour snooze fest. Thankfully, Scarlett Johansson is SMOKING hot and at least gave me something to look at. I was not offended by any of the graphic content, the movie simply sucked. I am actually shocked that Scarlett and Julianne Moore signed on for this trash of a script. I have been a fan of Julianne Moore since I saw her on Boogie Nights and she still looks great. The tag team of Johansson and Moore couldn't save it. This is the worst movie I have seen in the past 5 years. I believe the people giving it high reviews are high. Whew, 10 lines finally. I could have done it in 1 line!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's OK but the story is resolved deceptively,"The standards are too low nowadays to properly rate a movie, any movie. I give it a 6 but its real rating should be a 4, at best.It is watchable. The script takes off well. The acting has sufficient charisma. It is engaging enough overall.But the story becomes deranged as the development of the main characters turns them into caricatures. It should be the other way around. Instead of depth, we get flatness. The secondary characters, however, are written rather well comparatively speaking.The red flag is that the premise of the story is eventually shown to be irrelevant. The resolution takes the film on a tangent. This makes no sense. We are forced to believe that the concerns of the main character, the problems that drive him all along and entirely determine his life up to that point, disappear rather than are resolved. This is a cheat that torpedoes the true potential of the plot.",,Anonymous,Romance
'There's only a few things I really care about in life. My body. My pad. My family. My church. My boys. My girls. My porn.',"Joseph Gordon-Levitt keeps testing his boundaries as an artist and that is to be applauded. The strength of his performances in the past few films grows steadily and now he branches out in to writing, directing, and starring in a film that is truly his own. Is it a great film? No, but it is an inventive one - and that is a breath of fresh air in the current Marvel Comics shoot-'em-bang-bang-explode obsession. The fact that it deals with the current focus on sex-rated themes may be off putting to many, but that the theme is solely that speaks loudly for a young writer/director to register a parody of our current shaky quasi-relationship fad.There is not a lot of story so the more brief the synopsis the better: A New Jersey guy, Jon Martello (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) dedicated to his family, friends, and church, develops unrealistic expectations from watching porn and works to find happiness and intimacy with his potential true love. Though he has many sexual liaisons those episodes do not fully satisfy him the way onanism in front of a porn video does. He hits on a tacky, gum-chewing, perfect 10 Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson) but that continued dance has its problems. Finally he meets a very strange older woman Esther (Julianne Moore) who puts a bit of meaning into sexual expression and Jon's life changes - maybe.Gordon-Levitt manages to pull together a fine cast (Tony Danza and Glenne Headly as his parents, Rob Brown and Jeremy Luke as his buddies, et al) and keeps the flavor of the accents and the characters very New Jersey. His writing for Jon's weekly confessions in church is hilarious and in general the dialogue is snappy. Gordon-Levitt spent as much time at the gym as he did creating this film and his very buff body is a showpiece! Everyone who sees this film should realize it deserves an R leaning toward X rating, but then most programs on television do these days, so everyone is used to the porn glut. Nice to see an actor take risks like this.Grady Harp",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Don Jon,"I actually give this movie a 7.5. This was a good movie. I am one of JGL's fan girls and think he is the cutest dumpling ever so I see most movies with him in it. I hoped to love this movie but ended up just solidly liking it. The acting is excellent, the story is good and it was funny. The ending was a little bit of a surprise to me but I liked it.Reading some reviews I can see some people are confused and didn't get it. The movie doesn't condone watching porn all the time, on the contrary it is a lesson about how porn and romantic comedies and the media in general give girls and guys certain ideas about relationships that are untrue. If you think the movie trumpets sleaze then you didn't understand the movie. It was original, charming and I was pleased with it. I certainly hope that JGL continues to write and direct and of course show that cute face of his in many more movies to come.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Fun, sexy but also poignant","A good looking young man, just like many others with a harmless addiction: porn. Is it really that harmless? When virtual reality feels so pleasurable, why bother with real persons?The success of this movie lies on the fact that it provides for an effective thesis on the subject, whilst keeping the film, fun, sexy and real.Don Jon does not realise his struggle until it is pointed out to him that he has an issue that needs addressing. When he misses out on a relationship with a 'real' girl he really likes, the elephant in the room comes out. In a situation like this, people need not rejection but support and our main character receives it from a most unlikely source.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Don Jon,"Don Jon, was a film that I had to be a little patient with. What first started as a vulgar, raucous and teen oriented film having little more than jokes involving perverseness and sexual humour and was something that I figured I had wasted my money on, turned out to completely surprise me and ended up as one of my favourite films of this year. Yes, the film does have a lot of sexual humour and content in it, but it has some reason to, seeing as the film is dealing with addiction to pornography. And what may have seemed immature and like teenage humour for the first little bit of the film, soon went away and it became one of the most insightful and intelligent films of the year. I have heard the comparisons to this film from 2011's Steve McQueen directed film, Shame which is also about sexual addiction. Unfortunately, I have not seen Shame yet. I missed it at theatres and every time I go to the library to rent it, it is out, so for obvious reasons I can not compare the two of them. Don Jon, did have a lot to say both about young men and women, sex and relationships. It's the kind of film you would almost want younger teens to see in order to learn something and perhaps plan their own lives and future relationships a little more differently. Here the internet pornography sites serve as a form of escape for this main character and while he likes being around women, he can not connect with them in the same way as he feels he can with things he sees on the computer. This further complicates things for himself because what we see on the internet and in magazines often times are things that are made to look perfect, beautiful and however you want to put it, but other than just looking at it, there is no real connection, or relationship to it. It is hollow and empty and void of any emotional connection or feelings to another person. Perhaps that is why this character can not relate to real women. Everything up to now has been completely empty and void of any feeling, or connection and in his mind if he doesn't have to attach himself in any way to a real woman, he wonders what the point of that is. Throughout the course of the film, our lead character, Jon, meets two very different women, who will both change his outlook and outcome of his way of handling relationships and finding truer meaning to both himself and others as well. The film while crude and a little graphic at times, is far more into psychological and character study than one may think and it is one of the most insightful and accurate looks at young, or basically any type of relationships that I have seen in a long time. Jon, is with one woman who seems to be his dream woman, but right from the start we do not really like her, or at least I didn't. She herself had an unrealistic view of relationships that was more about status symbols and image than about real love for one another as well. The other woman we meet knows more about relationships and more about Jon himself than he may want to admit, or care for her to know, but there is a whole different type of connection and intimacy level there. The film shows that so often young men treat women as sexual objects and fantasies and actually how we can be so demeaning and almost sexist towards them. At the same time, this selfish attitude hurts other people and ourselves because we can not truly ever find anything that is real if we continue on this way because everything has to be perfect, or just like it is on movies, magazines, or the internet and it gives us a false distortion of reality, relationships and other people. The film is the first film written and directed by actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt whose acting has impressed me over the years, especially in films like Gregg Araki's Mysterious Skin. Now he shows that he can not only act, but write and direct as well. The film has moments of laugh out loud humour, but it also has a tender and emotional side to it as well. It examines these people and what is really behind them and the hurts, or the things they have been through and it is honest both about men, women and relationships in general. As the film ended, I could totally understand the way the film ended and why Levitt, decided to do it in that way. It felt realistic for his character, but at the same time also connected to beauty and happiness. I enjoyed the screenplay and direction immensely as well as the performances were all quite good as well. I liked the quick jump cut editing and the film's use of music in certain scenes, I felt worked really well also. I know some viewers will be turned off by the material and subject matter, but it really is a film worth seeing if you are in a relationship, or even if you are not and this is a film that definitely has something to say. I look forward to future writing and directing projects for Levitt, and as it stands Don Jon, is one of 2013's best and maybe most misunderstood films as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very shallow script,"Just watched it. The idea of movie is OK, porn is not what to espect in real life etc. but the script and the characters are extremely shallow and stupid. Including the family of the main actor in the movie. The only character that shows some kind of a more in-depth is Julian Moores character but she is only present in 15min of the whole movie. The friends of a dude are idiots too. To sumarize, the author took more of a statement ""porn is not what to expect in real life"" than an idea and it could be shown in 10min. The main characters, friends and family have an IQ of 90, even if its trying to be caricatured it is bad. I know people in real life that resembles the stupidity of main character and his girlfriend, but everything in this movie is so shallow and superficial. I have seen movies with score lower than 6 that are better than this 7.2 crap, and I give it a 4, but acctualy I give it 1 to lower the far overrated 7.2 score.On directing and camera I have absolutely no remarks, Levitt obviously learned a lot from directors of movies and series he was in before. But script and profiling of characters, total fail.Also the movie characters reminded me on movie Idiocracy http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387808/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2 which is kinda what the world is becoming more and more every day, just look at the scores of this movie...",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent movie with a very realistic view of todays society,"Usually when watching movies, even new ones, you can feel that even though they send an interesting message and make you think, often their context is already outdated.Not so Don Jon, the problems here seem more actual than ever in our generation. Media and commercials are giving people ideas how their life should be and in consequence how their partner should be.Of course, this differs according to gender just like this movie shows - girls, growing up with Disney movies and romantic comedies, are taught that they need to find the perfect boy with a good salary, the wish for a family, and of course so romantic that he basically can fulfill her every wish without her even telling. Boys, on the other hand, are conditioned by the omnipresence of pornography, starting with naked women in commercials and music videos up to internet porn that creates exact expectations on how their girlfriends should look like and how they need to perform for them in order to get pleasure.Needless to say, this ""one-sidedness"" on both sides creates a contrast that makes many relationships struggle just like we can see it in this movie - Barbara, the young, gorgeous woman played by Scarlett Johansson, sets all her demands on her boyfriend clear on the beginning, while Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who could have every girl he wanted does not even get the satisfaction he needs from this ""perfect girl"" alone.All in all, this movie is a very good psychological analysis of today's society. Although it might contain content some people might view as offensive and you shouldn't probably be watching it with your family or small children, it gives a lot to think about.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

This is not to mention that at the end, the end was abrupt and there was like 5 seconds of the cinema thinking if there is something else before the credits appeared. I gave it a 1 to bring down the ratings from 7.2, if just by honest evaluation, it at most gets a 4 from me, definitely not even a 5.

Brilliantly acted and written!,"Don Jon surprised me, certainly. I'm a fan of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but I doubted his directing abilities. He knows how to carry a film as an actor, for sure, but it was really down to whether he could pace this film well, and make this almost bizarre concept work. I can say for certainty, he almost nails it on the chest!Don Jon(JGL) is a man who develops unrealistic expectations for both relationships and sex, having watched an abundance of porn for most of his life. When he meets ""the one"", Barbara Sugarman(Scarlett Johansson), he is surprised to find that both have expectations that surely can't be met, and they embark on a relationship which opens his eyes to what being with someone really means.Don Jon is superbly acted. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, as expected, is wonderful. He brings personality and energy to his character, and makes him into a relatable, likable guy. Johansson is fantastic as well. Her New Jersey accent is perfect, and she knows how to really grind an audience's gears. The rest of the ensemble is fantastic. Julianne Moore and Tony Danza both give wonderful performances in their roles, which adds to the film.I have a problem with JGL's directing abilities, unfortunately. He knows how to make a shot work, get his actors to perform, and set a scene up well, but I think he tries to make everything look a little too stylistic. It's like he had the perfect picture, with all the right colours, but he just added a little too much, to make it feel somewhat cluttered. His direction is certainly not bad, it's just a little misled.The writing here is quite brilliant. Every character has a purpose, a certain personality to them. Most of the characters feel real, with the exception of Scarlett Johansson's character. I felt she was almost comical, a little too over the top. Apart from her character, the writing really succeeds here. You support Don Jon in his endeavors, you understand his motivations for the things he does. All in all, it's a great screenplay JGL has developed, and for the most part, it translates to the big screen damn well!Don Jon is certainly energetic, fun and full of heart. In my opinion, it's partially a social commentary, showing the expectations that both men and women both have nowadays, which only adds to my love of the film. It certainly has it's faults, but for a first time director like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, it can only get better! I can't wait for his next project, because I'm sure this experience has given him a lot of pointers for next time. This is an easy watch, and one I'd certainly recommend.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Wholesome, with a message that is truer now than when it came out","Don Jon actually made me wish Joseph Gordon-Levitt wrote and directed more movies. I laughed out loud, cringed, and enjoyed the romance. Mostly I was entertained throughout the film and pleasantly surprised with the wholesome messages. We all know porn addiction is unhealthy, but Don Jon's portrayal of the subtler effects it can have on your mind and body, similar to a drug, are this movie's greatest strength.The only problem I had with Don Jon is by the end, I felt like it didn't quite reach its potential. For instance, the dated Guido stereotypes made this film worse because it comes across like it wasn't confident enough in its premise to fully deliver something meaningful. It was trying too hard to be lighthearted comedy instead. Meanwhile, Scarlett Johansson did her best as a love interest, but her character lacked depth, making it a little too easy for Julianne Moore to steal the show. Brie Larson is also completely wasted in her role. Perhaps Don Jon's greatest sin, however, is how it makes too light out of the consequences of porn addiction on men's lives and the seriously harmful effects that objectification has on women and girls.In conclusion, if you're reading this review you should definitely watch the movie. Don Jon is worth your time, but it will make you wish something similar or better was made today. Now that an entire generation of young men have grown up having access to Internet pornography, the need is greater than ever for more honest and healthy portrayals of sexual relationships on-screen. So maybe a remake isn't out of the question? One can only hope.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A sex comedy done right,"Funny film. A sex comedy done right.The first 10-15 minutes, aside from the slick editing, had me worried - I was expecting the worst.

Scarlett Johansson is good as Barbara, while Julianne Moore and Tony Danza support astutely. Brie Larson's character is utterly pointless, but in a way that's actually quite chucklesome - which I assume is the intention.The editing and camera work in this took my notice as well, both help keep the pacing going as it never feels like it's stalling at any point.

Years later, I wanted to re-watch this movie to find out if it would revoke the same feelings in me as did back then.As a rom-com lover I went in not expecting much, since I had seen the trailer of this movie. As a woman, I didn't feel very sympathetic to the main character in the beginning of the film. However the way he's written, the acting and directing leaves you curious to what might happen. It helps that feels very realistic. You get to know him better and before I knew it, I began to root for him.By the end, I was completely moved. His transformation as a character warmed my heart.

I've been there before but I, like Jon, realized it was OK to say goodbye to the club scene when I found happiness elsewhere & the few friends that respected my decision were the ONLY ones that mattered.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
a Jersey dime,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's been a few months since I saw a screening, and I'm a bit surprised it's getting a wide release. On one hand, it's the directorial debut of the very talented and popular Joseph Gordon-Levitt. On the other hand, the subject matter is not exactly mainstream ... he plays a compulsive type who is addicted to online porn.There is a lot to like here. It's a front line observation of some things going on in society right now. Technology has quickly sucked away much of our face to face social interaction. Jon (JGL) has a compulsive personality. He is obsessed with cleaning his apartment, showing off his muscle car, perfecting his body at the gym, continuing his string of one-night stands with hot girls, and last but not least ... online porn. He sees nothing wrong with his addiction but readily admits his real life conquests don't meet his standards - no matter how pretty or personable they might be. Still, he goes through the motions of dance club pursuits to keep up his image with his buddies.Even when he heads home for dinner with his family, communication is a mess. His sister (the great Brie Larson) never puts down her phone. His parents (Glenne Hedley and Tony Danza) are bombastic and emotional. When Jon meets a ""dime"" (translated to a perfect 10 ... why didn't Blake Edwards think of that?), his mother talks only of grandkids and his dad congratulates him on ""a nice piece of ___"" (you get the point).See, this ""dime"" is Barbara, played by Scarlett Johansson. She has the look Jon so values and since he has no concept of how a relationship works, she easily manipulates him to transition into her ideal man (rom-com movies, college courses, etc). In a very telling scene, Barbara and Jon take in a Rom-Com spoof ""based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks"" and starring Anne Hathaway and Channing Tatum. Barbara's perfect man is a fictionalized knight in shining armor, while Jon's perfect woman is the latest porn star. Though the issues are identical, neither sees their own flaws ... only that of the other.The story takes a dramatic turn when Jon meets Esther (Julianne Moore) in a somewhat embarrassing incident (for him). The budding relationship between the older mentor and her student of life could have made a much more interesting movie and she guides him down a path of self-discovery.JGL, Scarlett and Ms. Moore are all very good in their roles, as is the entire supporting cast (Danza especially humorous as the perfectly cast dad). Although there are some very humorous scenes and lines in the film, I found it somewhat dis-spiriting due to the observations it makes on the young adult generation. The final act seemed a bit too clean for real life, but that doesn't take away from what is really a nice first outing for Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a filmmaker. Stay tuned as I expect even better from him in the future.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Modern Day Influences,"Don Jon is Joseph Gordon-Levitt's directorial debut, and it's quite interesting to see what kind of vision he could bring to cinema since he's always been a promising actor. The story he takes seems like something that may define to this generation by portraying how modern media distorts society's view to sex and love, and studies a somehow complex man who thinks he's living in a perfect life. The execution is noticeably crafty, the director has shown a snappy and energetic style that smartly comprehends to the story's themes. Don Jon is not revolutionary, but it is a witty tale that seems really sincere to its own message.Jon's life mostly runs like a loop cycle. It's mainly about addiction, but what we actually observe is how difficult for him to get away from his comfort zone. Here's the trick: first off, Jon is not so much of a decent person, despite of his reputation. He's a typical playboy, he's a hypocrite, he uses religion as a tool for excuses, and doesn't quite respect a lot of people. When some of his routine breaks, that indicates that he somewhat changes as a different person. However, the real goal we should look forward is his overcome to his porn addiction. Though basically, Jon is not the only one who has a problem. Barbara may be into romance, but her interpretation to love is shallow, since she's only sees that in chick flicks. Beyond Jon's life is sort of a social satire about everyone's influences through modern media. Other than watching unreality videos, there are some people at the background who are also absorbed too much by technology. Example is Jon's sister who hardly interacts with her family because of her ridiculous text messaging addiction. These depictions are supposed to make them look terrible and the film is aware of that, but the ironies of these people are treated as a joke. In the end, it's acceptable to be amused with it.Honestly (skip to the next paragraph if you're not from my country), the version I saw is not the same one that most have seen. The significant part of the film is to explore Jon's relationship to pornography, but the local distributor wants to release the movie widely and many theaters here can't tolerate the R-18 rating, so they frustratingly removed most of the scenes that involve porno clips and deemed into a smaller rating, thus the porn addiction side becomes a fill in the blanks subplot. This is quite of a stupid decision from the distributor, it's not that its eroticism is really that important, but everyone needs to see how weird the character's obsession to these adult videos to get into the film's big picture. So my current (7/10) rating is probably just an assumption for a while that may change soon as I see the regular US version of the film. End of local censorship complains.As a director, Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers a brisk pace through his storytelling. His style mostly relies on editing and it brings a unique flavor to the film. It's not hard to see that he also have learned something from Rian Johnson's Looper, especially the parts when it explores the main character's personal life. Overall, it's all impressive. And as an actor, the role is not supposed to be too likable, but his natural charms are inevitable. He displays them which makes the character even more worth rooting for. The rest of the cast also have the same charms that Gordon-Levitt brings.Don Jon doesn't go too subtle in the end, but seriously I don't really know. Just like what I said, the movie I saw was a cynically sanitized version of Don Jon, thus I definitely missed plenty of parts beneath its subtext. But what I can presume is the film might have contrasted between gratuitous pleasures and genuine relationships, and probably showed which of their benefits is better. If there's anything else that I can see in this film, then that is its cleverly told satire towards mainstream influences from the internet, romantic film clichés, or any forms of media, which made the majority of current relationships vapid. The film can be strangely engaging, though still not groundbreaking, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt proves that he is competent to the job and it would be nice for him to tell more stories as fascinating as this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Worth Watching,"While not a masterpiece, Don Jon does offer funny moments and cleverly crafted scenes. It is also, for the most part, well-acted and directed. Most importantly, it is relevant. It takes us into the life of a young man whose perception of sex and relationships is tainted by all-too-accessible internet porn. While some of the philosophy of the film is a bit flawed, Don Jon offers interesting food for thought and is an entertaining watch. The way Jon ""keeps score"" with penances he receives during confession is kind of brilliant.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays his part perfectly. Tony Danza's performance is decent but vastly overrated. Scarlett Johanssen turns in another solid performance, but she does definitely overact in this one. Julianne Moore excels in bigger-than-life roles (maybe her brilliant performance in The End of the Affair has spoiled me forever), but her acting doesn't have the same sparkle when she plays everyday Jane roles like Esther in Don Jon. The truth is, the role of Esther is more of a convenient plot device, so it's not totally Moore's fault.Brie Larson, who plays Jon's sister Monica, is probably my favorite up-and-coming actor. Though she has hardly lines in this film, the ones she does have count for a lot. Monica's face is buried in a cell phone throughout most of the movie, but she doesn't miss a thing. What she tells Jon is surprisingly insightful. Overall, I would give Don Jon a 7.5, but since I can't, I give it a 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sex crazed early twenties guy can't get it together.,"Plot less, dysfunctional lead drawn to porn Not at all meaningful, Not even saved by comedy. There was no plot. There is a dysfunctional family , cursing father, sister who does not speak until the end where she was excellent, and an Italian mother wanting to marry off a son because she wanted grandchildren. Son, the lead, was only interested in the bar scene,playing around, watching porn so he could satisfy himself, used unacceptable language, having sex any way at all, normal positions not preferred. He was not at all interested in commitment. Female leads were figure exploited. Would not at all recommend, bored out of my mind, stayed & played computer games because husband was waiting for a plot to evolve.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Great cast and humor, a cheap ending with too many loose ends","I just saw this film at TIFF and found it to be very enjoyable.Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Scarlett Johansson lit up the screen and projected a very humorous representation of New Jersey dating and life. Scarlett's hand movements and gum chewing were a little over the top but I will give it a pass based on the genre of the film, I mean hey, comedy is in exaggeration of the truth right?Joseph Gordon-Levitt also pulled a nasty trick on me by including Tony Danza. I have a soft spot for Danza and found his character in this film to be a perfect looking glass into Don Jon's future if he followed his current path.Julianne Moore's character was funny and added depth, during the film her character reveals some dark events in her history without providing much detail. The story of her past became an interesting point that was never explored or fleshed out, and leads to my one dislike in the film: the ending.This is one of those endings where you can picture people sitting in a room scratching their heads, not sure what to do, so they just stop the film and show the title. The lesson in the end was not what I was hoping, but perhaps I was just looking for validation for the Don Jon I see in myself.Go see this movie with someone who loves to laugh.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ever Been to New Jersey?,"I just watched the first 40 minutes of this movie, and I had to shut it off. The acting is good. In fact, I especially like all of the leads - always have. But the story is stupid and obnoxious. And there are issues. Serious issues. For one, it's extremely crass. There's almost enough porn to qualify as a porn movie. But that's not what bothered me. What I HATED about this movie was its complete detachment from reality when it comes to New Jersey, where the film is set. Joseph-Gordon Levitt's character Johnny is a self-obsessed guido jackass, and his friends are all the same. Everyone in the movie uses the same fake Brooklyn accent that ignorant Hollywood types think is the way New Jerseyans sound. Maybe they should listen to Meryl Streep, Jack Nicholson, Ray Liotta, Peter Dinklage, Kevin Spacey, Jason Biggs or Zach Braff. These are all well-known people who live in Hollywood and speak with an ACTUAL New Jersey accent. I don't think anyone involved with this movie has ever been to New Jersey. It seems as though the entire research effort for this film involved watching a few episodes of ""Jersey Shore."" For those who think reality shows are real, please note that Snookie and her friends are NOT from New Jersey, and that show is by far the least popular program at the real Jersey Shore. And one more thing, Mr Levitt: if you're going to do the Catholic confession scene in a movie (especially if you're going to do it over and over again) it might be a good idea to find out how it really works and looks. Among other things, you missed the fact that Catholics do not call it ""The Lord's Prayer."" For your penance, please say 20 ""Our Father's"" and stay the hell out of New Jersey! P.S. It wasn't funny, either - not even a little.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Keep in mind that although this movie deals with important issues in an insightful way, it's still a movie about porn addiction.","We've known for a long time that Joseph Gordon-Levitt can act. But now, with his debut on the other side of the camera in the film Don Jon, he proves he has some serious chops as a director and writer as well.In today's cinematic world, when you hear a movie is about porn addiction, it's easy to assume it will involve a lot of gratuitous sex scenes strung together with a flimsy plot line. And although some porn does — understandably — make it into the movie, it's accompanied by dynamic writing, clever societal observations, and intriguing characters. At its base, Don Jon is about a man, played by Gordon- Levitt, who has created unrealistic expectations of how sex and relationships ""should"" be due to his addiction to porn. But instead of just stopping there, the film introduces Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), who, unbeknownst to her, is dealing with her own unrealistic expectations that have been imposed on her from a lifetime of watching romantic movies. She wants her partner to be a ""real man"" — a guy who will be the epitome of a manly man and do everything for the woman in his life. Ultimately, as we all recognize on some level, life isn't like the movies — pornographic or otherwise — so what happens to people when they want their lives and their relationships to be so much different than reality has to offer? This is the intriguing question Gordon- Levitt's film poses in a thought-provoking but not hit-you-over-the- head-with-it kind of way.Keep in mind that although this movie deals with important issues in an insightful way, it's still a movie about porn addiction. So although you won't see any full frontal shots, there are a fair amount of pornographic clips and sex scenes in the mix. Given the amount of nudity and sexuality in everything from billboard ads to HBO shows these days, the clips in Don Jon probably won't shock the average adult viewer. But if you're planning a movie date with your sweet, traditional grandmother, maybe catch another flick and check out Don Jon with friends.Between sex scenes in what seems likes every movie or TV show and the romanticized ways people seem to be selling everything — from cars to perfume — it's no wonder we can get caught in a loop of thinking about nothing but sex and romance. And more importantly, thinking about it in unrealistic ways. If you're looking for a film that's clever and funny but offers a little something extra in terms of worldly observations, Don Jon is definitely worth checking out.http://juliekinnear.com/blogs/don-jon",,Anonymous,Romance
Guidos and Guidettes in Love,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt has turned into one of the best and most interesting of Hollywood's young talents. He has a knack for picking good projects, and consistently takes on interesting roles, not content to glide by on his looks and charm like so many pretty boy actors.So it did not surprise me that ""Don Jon,"" his debut as director (he also wrote and stars), is not a typical romantic comedy. Though billed as a movie about a sex addict, the film isn't about addiction so much as it's about the inability of people to form meaningful relationships with others because of preconceived notions (most of them completely unrealistic) about what those relationships should be. One would think based on previews that Gordon-Levitt's character, a guido with slicked back hair and an Internet porn obsession, meets his match when he falls for a hot dame (played by Scarlett Johansson) and must become a better man in order to earn the right to be loved by her. But that's not what happens, and one of the things I liked best about the movie is that Johansson proves to be the film's villain (as much as a movie like this has a villain), and that her expectations about relationships are just as distorted as his, just in different ways.""Don Jon"" isn't a terrific movie. It feels more like an early draft than a fully fleshed out final product, with conflicts being resolved too quickly and patly, characters coming to realizations too easily. It was too hard for me to lose myself in the movie and forget that I was watching actors play parts, a sure sign for me that something about the film I'm watching isn't totally working. I felt this the most when watching the scenes between Gordon-Levitt and Julianne Moore, who plays an older and wiser woman who becomes Don's mentor in sex and love. Moore is a lovely actress and I always want to like her, but something about her character in this just didn't ring true for me, though a revelation about her character late in the movie gives it one of its nicest and most touching moments.So not a great film, but certainly one worth checking out as a rental, and good enough to make me look forward to what Joseph Gordon-Levitt the filmmaker is going to do next.The film also stars Tony Danza as Don's foul-mouthed father, and Alison Brie as his sister, who has exactly one line of dialogue but somehow manages to be one of the most memorable things about the movie.Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Confident and edgy comedy,"It's amazing to see the confidence ooze from Joesph Gordon Levitt and it's hugely impressive that he wrote, directed and starred in the lead role of this edgy comedy. He has recently proved himself worthy of serious roles. This movie is like the antithesis to your stereo-typically mushy female targeted rom com. It's original, it's got great performances and it addresses sex and dating from a male perspective in the 21st century. Beneath the humour there is a genuine message about sex in society in our time. Easily and readily available and dehuminising - the porn industry has changed perspectives about sex - but is it affecting people to the point where it can warp their reality - and indeed impact their real human relationships? Does it help lead to sex addiction? The movie certainly raises a few points to ponder on. This movie is also funny, confident and unapologetic. I thought Tony Danza was great - and the family home scenes were probably one of my favourite parts to watch and certainly among the most genuine of moments. Scarlett Johansson was mesmerising. I did feel that it dipped towards the end and lost something - but on the whole worthy of watching and enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great debut for JGL,"This movie is flawed. If it went just 10 minutes longer, I would be bored of it. I think it was right at the border from being great and awful. It never crossed that line though and I enjoyed it overall. I agree with the commentary on addiction and our pop culture's bad influences. Anyone who says this movie is about porn addiction is mistaken because it goes deeper than just that. I also really liked how JGL gets you to really like Sugarman in the beginning like Don Jon until you slowly realize the relationship was never good in the first place. I'd recommend this movie but I wouldn't watch it again. It had TONS of charm but not enough actual laugh-out-loud humor for me to stick around too long.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Blunt and Honest, One of it's Kind","""Every man everywhere watches porn everyday."" That's certainly what men believe that truly struggle with porn. For them, it's hard NOT to believe. I would certainly believe that basically all men struggle with this in someway, for sure.When I say that this movie was blunt, it certainly is. It shows basically exactly what goes through men's heads when they look at porn and to be honest, they hit it exactly on the mark. That is something that should be praised about this film: it is honest to the core. I was really amazed at that. They really put you in the head of Jon and if there is someone out there that doesn't understand exactly what men go through, well, this film will tell you, that's for sure. I'm serious.The message in this film goes out to both men and women, basically helping women realize that pornography is an addiction that men REALLY struggle to control. For men, the film makes it very clear that pornography ruins relationships, it takes away intimacy and loyalty in your thoughts to your spouse (I'm sure most that struggle realize this already). It is a distraction from things that are most important. Women will learn in this film that shutting men off simply because they have had or currently struggle with a porn addiction is actually very selfish, just like men who do not at all attempt to overcome their porn addiction is very selfish. Both aspects are extremely one-sided and, based on how you look at it, are equally harmful to a relationship. Women that show no sympathy and don't attempt to help are in the wrong, and men that believe that porn is an OK side-addiction are in the wrong as well.I would recommend this movie to women that want to understand why men struggle more than I would to men. It still gets those hormones rolling for men and, honestly, if you are trying to already clear your mind of pornographic thoughts, this movie won't help too much. For women, however, you will get an EXTREMELY clear picture of pornography, and basically see it at its extreme. You will see why men turn to it when they go through a break-up, why it still occurs despite having consistent sex with a wonderful partner, how it consumes a man's inner thoughts, and why they go to such far lengths to hide it. You have to have a mature mind, though, and not let yourself get too curious and carried away. Women have been addicted to porn before, too.I'm glad they made this film, but I would never watch it again. Being a guy and obviously struggling with this addiction myself from time to time, it won't help ME to overcome it. The girls are obviously sexy and the quick flashes to porn videos are erotic and purposefully trying to turn men on. I would hope that men that watch this film do not watch it for the purpose of getting off, as well. The film doesn't deserve that kind of reaction.Now, for me personally, I would love to watch a film that showed an actually loving father and husband who is struggling with this addiction and how the family works through it (rather than just a single guy that has the addiction really bad). I believe that much of our society specifically struggles with this exact issue and it really can hurt not only one's spouse, but children as well. Perhaps this film might inspire a modern film like that. Regardless, this film deserves tons of credit. It is extremely eye opening, especially to people that don't really understand why this can be such and addiction and a go- to.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Problematic – 3 Types of Reviews,"I put the reviews of Don Jon into 3 categories which, paraphrased are 1) ""The film is shallow and sleazy and I hate it""; 2) ""The film is shallow and sleazy and that's great because it's telling it like it is – it's an accurate ""slice of life"" story and I love it""; 3) ""The first 95% of the film is shallow and sleazy, but at the very end, it rejects the sleaze for something better and I like it.""#3 is what Gordon-Levitt (writer & director) was aiming for. However, that approach has been the standard out of Hollywood for decades and it fails. For the reviewers in categories in 1 & 3 above, they already recognize the shallowness and sleaze of that lifestyle. For reviewers in 2 above, by far the largest group, they view the 95% about shallowness and sleaze and that just reinforces their view that that's the way life is.What's needed is a romance movie that has heart and soul and beauty throughout – before the 1960s that was common especially in the '30s & '40s. But beginning in the '60s a downward spiral for ""romance"" movies started with each year being worse – each year the difference between Hollywood romance and porn shrunk with many describing most such fare as soft porn and many producers admitting they were aiming to produce soft porn as the best way to make money. Maybe that's why LaLaLand, which was a throwback to an earlier era, was so well received, but even it seemed like a pale shadow of Demy's films which in turn were a pale shadow of the romance films (and life) of the '30s & '40s.Gordon-Levitt is a very good actor. Regarding technique, he can write and is a good director. However, he doesn't seem to have anything to write about. Maybe shallowness and sleaze is all he's experienced, first or even second hand. His efforts have no heart or soul or depth. Modern action adventure movies are well done, but modern movies about the relationship between a man and a woman too often are just soft porn.The formula was wrong but to make it work, the audience should at the very least have been rooting for Jon to go with Esther (Julianne Moore) because of her inner beauty and heart, etc. – I knew in advance that's how it should go, but felt nothing except that she was annoying – not Julianne's fault – it was 100% the fault of the empty script. Jon only rises a few levels, out of about 50, from the shallowness and sleaze at the end as that's as high as Gordon-Levitt's vision can see. I don't think the new movie writer generation is capable of improving so the only solution seems to be to watch films from a different era.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Wait for DVD Release, then Watch on Mute","I saw this last night, and learned sadly that Joseph Gordon-Levitt is not a writer. The trailers more than suggest that this will be an in-your-face movie about a guy with a porn addiction, and in that sense it does not disappoint. But if JGL bothered to go a little deeper (no pun) and tried to actually flesh out his characters instead of making them little more than cardboard cutouts and eye candy, this might've been watchable. It wasn't. I stayed in my seat because I had already paid the full price, but there were so many cringe-worthy moments that I was embarrassed for JGL and everyone who said yes to this movie. The dialogue was so trite and unbelievable--NO ONE TALKS LIKE THAT! Scarlett Johansson's character doesn't seem to have any dignity, as she just goes along with ""Don"" in whatever he wants to do. Julianne Moore was great, but she seems to have just been tacked on as a device to make Don seem like less of a jerk. Anyway, this just goes to show how far money will get you, because there is no way this would have been green-lit without JGL. It seems he needed an excuse to make out with Scar-Jo and Moore, and hey, who can blame him? But please, for our sake, make something with substance before releasing it to the world. I do hope he gets better if he chooses to keep writing/directing, because I'm a big fan of his acting.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Charming, Well Written and Acted","Saw this not too long ago. It was really unexpectedly charming and well written. Joseph Gorden Levitt did a great job balancing all the hats of writer, director, and star. Probably not what he would be normally cast as but when you see him play it you would assume he'd be exactly who they should cast. Not many people can pull off porn addiction with such charm. I have to say I am not a fan of Scarlett Johansson. I just don't find her appealing but I could look past her for the most part because the role seemed more like her natural state LOL. Julianne Moore always does a fine job. If you get the chance it's definitely worth a watch. I am sure this is the beginning of Joseph Gordon Levitt's writing career.",,Anonymous,Romance

Cheesy, overused story. It degraded women to the point where it was just disgusting to watch (I am a male, by the way (not that it should matter)). It revolved around sex and pornography way too much. I think it's pretty bad, but for some reason I didn't really mind watching it. A few underdeveloped problems and not enough character development. I give this a 5 (maybe a 6 because I'm feeling generous). The selected audience are clearly males, but I feel as if it was directed towards teenage males (which once again, I am) who don't have a full sense of how sexual or romantic relationships work.

Don Jon tackles a taboo subject and utilises it to create a witty subtle comedy.,"This is Joseph Gordon-Levitt's baby. Directed, written, produced and starring the man himself. Technically he shows flair and promise, but the film itself lacks quite a few essentials. A promiscuous young man loves his life, where he follows the same routine every day: sleep, workout, party and have sex. In between these pivotal aspects, he finds time to watch pornography...to a point where he becomes addicted to it. Unusual subject to portray, especially for a directorial debut. It certainly is a statement! Combining pornography with relationships in order to create a comedy kind of works actually. There are moments where I did laugh, particularly as Jon repeats church confessions every week (where his sins progressively get worse). Gordon-Levitt's direction was extremely competent, I especially loved his quirky traits. Quick cuts of pornography to show his character's constant thinking of it, the repetition of certain scenes to highlight his routine and focussing on certain body parts of women to portray his infatuation with sex. The latter however, I do find incredibly distasteful. Objectifying women for the majority of the runtime was superficial. It was constant. I just didn't warm to it at all. Although, showcasing Johansson was a wise choice, both their acting and chemistry was well demonstrated. For a film that was over 90 minutes long, it really didn't go anywhere. The pace was incredibly slow. So whilst I find Don Jon to be a competent comedy with technical panache, it wasn't a subject that I was particularly fond of and found certain elements to be distasteful.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Entertaining enough but without a hint of subtlety or edge.,"Porn stars, be flattered. You've inspired Joseph Gordon-Levitt to write, direct and star in his first feature film to talk about how much he likes you. I used to like Levitt a few years ago when he appeared in (500) Days Of Summer and Inception, but as he's slowly turned himself into a brand that his film career hasn't justified yet, it's come with a bulking ego. I was excited for Don Jon at first, but the film and Levitt have become much less endearing. I still like what he does sometimes, Looper was one of the best films of the year. But Don Jon is a satire that tries far too hard. The caricature performances and clichéd side-characters may be deliberate, but without a straight man in sight it ends up feeling juvenile and only occasionally funny. With their forced struts, exaggerated accents, matching tank-tops and chains, they talk as if Levitt desperately wants to be in a Scorsese movie, which the flashy camera-work and editing certainly try to match. Unfortunately, the way the, albeit valid, social commentary is on the surface and in the dialogue completely negates its effect.Sure, he has a good point on the relationship between men and porn, women and rom-coms, but it's kind of stating the obvious. Despite attempts to repair one side, it doesn't elaborate on this argument or come to a thesis, it just merely brings it up. The main problem is that it's difficult to believe its main plot. With a character like Don Jon, it needs a real crisis for us to believe that he needs a real relationship. Instead the film shifts in the direction it needs to go in a contrived way. I quite like where it ends up where Don finds salvation, it certainly wasn't predictable, but there's times when the perspective of women matches this overly macho representation on men and it teeters uncomfortable lines of misogyny. However, despite overdone lighting and photography, its saving grace is its keen-edged editing which really cuts through the problem with the script where it overuses repetition without showing enough growth each time. It's mildly entertaining, somewhat interesting, but sadly without a hint of subtlety or edge. Perhaps I'm still a little bitter that Levitt gave Brie Larson literally nothing to do.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Sometimes crude and vulgar, but always for a reason","Don Jon is not what I would have expected Joseph Gordon-Levitt's directorial debut to be like. It tells the tale of a man deeply addicted to pornographic movies. So much so that even a million dollar babe like Scarlett Johansson can't fully satisfy his needs for sexual release. Sound vulgar and abrasive? It is, from time to time, but it's also a cutting social satire, a really good character study and a funny comedy, all wrapped into a delightful package of uncomfortableness.The best part of Don Jon are its main actors. Gordon-Levitt absolutely shines in the leading role. He captures it all. The cockiness, the charm, the uncertainty, the naiveness, the lust, the strength of character, the ideals, the idiocy. Jon feels like a real human. A strange one to be sure, but he has so many layers that you cannot help but feel like he's real. Like you could meet a dude like this at the gym or outside a nightclub.Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore also do credible job in portraying the two women in his life. They're polar opposites in many respects, but you can see what pulls him to them. And once again, they're both larger than life as well as real enough to please the human in us.Don Jon is not for those overly sensitive about social sensibilities. Its main themes are sex, porn, addictions, falseness of outward appearances and the masks we put on to fool both others as well as ourselves. It doesn't apologize for what it is, it doesn't shy away from anything. But if you can manage it, it's one of the funniest and most poignant social commentaries you've likely seen in a long time.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
There are some very funny scenes in this one but it has a lot of heart and that is the reason to watch.,"""It's not that I can't stop I just figure why should I...it's not like I'm cheating on her."" Jon (Gordon-Levitt) has a fun group of friends and is passionate about a few things. One of which is porn. Because of this obsession he is unable to have a healthy relationship with anyone. When he meets Barbara (Johansson) he thinks he found the perfect girl. Little by little he begins to wonder if he will ever feel about a woman the way he feels about his porn. First off I will have to say that this is not for everyone. If you offend easy then avoid this. Also the first five minutes are the raunchiest in terms of dialog so if you can make it past that you should be OK. As far as the movie goes I did enjoy it but the thing about this movie is the abundance of sex and porn will distract from the true meaning of the movie. The movie isn't necessarily about addiction but more about watching a man trying to connect with a human in a way he never has before. There are some very funny scenes in this one but it does have a lot of heart and that is the reason to watch. Acting is great but all of this won't be given a fair chance because of the in your face porn aspect. That is a shame.

Actor. Writer. Director. Splendid. ♦ 86%,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a wonderful actor and his performance has always been par excellence for me. With Don Jon, he not only has considered himself as an all-rounder but also made himself a talented stalwart in the cinema industry.Don't get my appraisals so hyperbole, because: The film starts with a bang (pun unintended)! The beat music, the visual effects and the prologue as to what to expect from the guy in front of us is simply one good opening. Then, the story kicks in and the screenplay reminded me of Edgar Wright and his Cornetto trilogy. It was lovely to see the frames actually change so swiftly giving out the impression on a wider scale. The idea reaches the audience successfully. The boldness & honesty in the first part of the film makes it realistic & teenagers/adults can so highly relate to the ""masturbation factor."" You bet! Dialogs are very good. Pure work by the art, light & sound department.Then we have the performances. JGL is terrific, no doubt and his peculiar air in this would definitely make the girls drool. Then we have Scarlett Johansson who is sexy as always and acts well, too. Jullianne Moore is fine. I loved JGL's on-screen family. All of them were funny & lively & looked so real. The story is written with emotions and they kick in the second half as it gradually maneuvers into a rigid conclusion. Many reality bites have been spoken loudly in this comic romance where attention to details is one thing why direction looks good. Cinematography is good, so is the soundtrack & music. Editing could've been better.BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended! It speaks volumes about sex, masturbation & love. Let the boldness not affect you.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

An Agreeably Offbeat Directorial Debut,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt has worked as one of Hollywood's most talented young actors for years now, so it's a relief that his writing-directing debut, ""Don Jon"", is not a vanity project but a tender, funny romantic comedy stimulatingly unconventional. Not playing himself like Woody Allen always did in his best movies, Gordon-Levitt swaps his public easygoing appeal with the greasiness of a New Joisey guido with an addiction to porn. Such a male lead would normally be reprehensible, but Gordon-Levitt, as it turns out, is a writer who pens with a great deal of heart, turning his titular Don John into an anti-Prince Charming sympathetic instead of crude.In ""Don Jon"", he is Jon Martello, a 20-ish player who only cares about, as he puts it, his body, his pad, his ride, his family, his church, his boys, his girls, and his porn. He sounds like the perfect candidate for a ""Jersey Shore"" reboot, but Jon is much more than some hulking no-brain ready to annoy the hell out of Snooki Polizzi — as a porn addict, he, despite having one-night-stands like it's his job, is unable to make an emotional, let alone physical, connection with a woman. He figures porn is better: he can lose himself in the distanced vulgarity.When out with friends one night, he spots Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson), a shapely blonde who instantaneously has him wrapped around her finger. She doesn't want to be another one of his single night flings — she wants to court, to put off sex in favor of dates, to meet each other's families, to get to know one another. Not because she's been burned before, but because she, like Jon, has an addiction: romantic comedies. She wants to be a real life Sandra Bullock, finding love in the most unexpected of places. Normally, Jon would be put off by such silliness — but Barbara is much too irresistible to let down. Problem is, his addiction is still riding strong, hindering any kind of growth in the relationship; and when he meets Esther (Julianne Moore), a damaged middle-aged woman who seems to understand him better than anyone else, things begin to get out of hand.For being such a short movie (a mere 85 minutes), ""Don Jon"" feels vast, having a lot to say and packing in quite a bit of obligatory rom-com charm. But unlike most rom-coms that rely too heavily on that rom-com charm, Gordon-Levitt digs deeper, analyzing the nature of addiction and how it can affect nearly every aspect of one's life, whether it be through a romantic relationship or a familial one. He's subtle about it, never becoming a preachy artist standing on a soapbox warning about the dangers of porn. ""Don Jon"" is so far beyond the other additions to the genre because it makes a good case to try to understand a character; even the secondary players seem rounded, not cutout (a risk considering the over-the-top NEW JOISEY flightiness of the majority of 'em).Gordon-Levitt gives an expectedly monumental performance, returning back to earth whenever he threatens to tread into Joey Tribbiani 2.0 territory, but the real stars of the film are the women, particularly Johansson and Moore. Johansson rarely gets the opportunity to let her comedic chops shine, but in ""Don Jon"" she goes all out, humorously embodying the blonde, gum-chewing, manicured, monotone Jersey girl with just enough credibility to win us over. Moore, as Jon's second love interest, is unrefined and sexy, playing a woman old enough to raise eyebrows but pushing doubts out of our judgmental windows through reasonable affinity.""Don Jon"" is a satisfying project for a major talent — Gordon-Levitt has proved himself in his acting for years, and here we finally get to witness him directing and writing like it's no big deal: it seems natural, proper. Now that we've seen what he can do with the rom-com, it's only inevitable to want to see what he does next. This is a small movie, a diamond in the rough: one can only wonder what will happen if he does something bigger.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

watchable though sure to be off-putting to some,"A unique hybrid of romance, comedy, social commentary, and character study with actor/writer/director Joseph Gordon-Levitt in peak form as the titular character, a suave Jersey stud who can pull ""dimes"" at the drop of a hat, but prefers to indulge himself in the salacious world of internet pornography. He reaches a crossroads when he meets two vastly different women who dramatically alter his once routine life. With graphic subject matter and explicit dialogue this is definitely not for the faint of heart, but it's laser sharp in its observations, the characters make sense, the acting is strong, and the laughs are abundant. Lead actors Gordon-Levitt, Johansson, and Moore are all completely believable, but the film's resolution is just a bit too hasty and a bit too pat to keep it from scoring a home run. Still, it's an ambitious and impressive showing from a novice film director. **½",,Anonymous,Romance

There's a lot to like about Joseph Gordon-Levitt's feature debut as Writer/Director and as starring actor.,"(This review is based on an advanced screening at the Revere Hotel in Boston, Massachusetts.)Let's get this out of the way right from the start: if you will be offended by a movie with lots of F-bombs and/or one that's about a guy from Jersey who's addicted to porn—or more specifically, masturbating to porn —then Don Jon isn't for you. That said, there's a lot to like about Joseph Gordon-Levitt's feature debut as Writer/Director and as starring actor.Don Jon doesn't waste any time letting us know what it's about. There's nothing subtle in an opening that shows Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character, Jon Martello, masturbating to porn. His matter-of-fact voice-over explains precisely what he likes about getting off to porn and why he prefers the women on the screen to actual warm-bodied women in his bed. His friends call him 'Don', though, because he manages to score 'dimes'—meaning a '10'—whenever they go out.Enter Scarlett Johansson (for whom Gordon-Levitt wrote the role) as Barbara, a 10 in any movie, but especially in this one. It's a jolt initially to hear her accent—which some argue sounds more like one from Staten Island—but if you're not from New Jersey, you won't have a problem with it. Barbara is the game changer for Jon, perfect in every way, except for one minor problem: she's not happy about the porn.Julianne Moore and Tony Danza round out a stellar cast that includes cameos from Channing Tatum, Anne Hathaway, and Cuba Gooding, Jr. Danza plays Jon's dad in a performance reminiscent of (and just as strong as) Robert De Niro's fatherly role in Silver Linings Playbook. Moore plays a middle-aged student in a night class with Jon. She provides an older woman foil for Jon's girlfriend/porn issues—someone other than his buddies and family to heckle and care for him. Moore gives a layered performance, ably demonstrating the disappearing effect of age when hanging out with students half her age, gracefully revealing that there is much more under the tender shell of her character Esther than Jon can possibly imagine. donjon1 Gordon-Levitt's screenplay is solid and well structured, built around themes like the fact that Jon Martello is a devout Catholic. With welcome regularity, we see Jon back on the pew with his family, followed by a weekly rendezvous in the confessional in which he itemizes his sexual transgressions to the priest on the other side—the number of times he had sex out of wedlock, how many times he masturbated to porn, etc. The next scene invariably shows him in the gym working out to the prescribed number of Hail Marys and Our Fathers (and we get to peek at just how buff Gordon-Levitt has been keeping himself). The laughs get louder every time the screenplay whips around to this place keeper, and we fall into pace with Jon and his routine as we get to know him.Gordon-Levitt takes what should be a ridiculous premise for a movie and through strong writing and directing outputs a sincere plot. Though full of the American Pie-style humor requisite for a story about masturbation, Don Jon more importantly takes its characters (and us) somewhere—and it's not where you think. In the wasteland of cookie- cutter movie plots, Don Jon's story is a breath of fresh air—one that makes us laugh, makes us think, makes us cringe, and makes us come out wanting more from Joseph Gordon-Levitt.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Don Jon"" tried to have fun with the serious problem of sex addiction, but does it very poorly.","In the same month (September 2013), American movie fans may have noticed the release of two movies about sex addiction. Although it's good to call attention to this very real problem, one of those two movies did it much better than the other. ""Thanks for Sharing"" takes the subject seriously and has a good story with appealing characters. And then there's ""Don Jon"" (R, 1:30).This film is written and directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who also stars. Jon is a man who cannot get enough sex. He has issues and, as the kids say, he needs tissues for his issues (literally). He brings to bed an endless parade of beautiful women, but still looks at pornography - constantly - even when his latest conquest is sleeping in his bed. He doesn't see a problem with this. He further shows his character's contradictions both as he swears at other drivers while he's rushing to church and as he makes completely insincere confessions in said building.Jon continues unapologetically on this path until he meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), who he's convinced is a ""10"", but who refuses to be his latest one night stand. Jon and Barbara are adorable together, but their constant sexual play and public displays of affection eventually make us feel like voyeurs and border on the disgusting - a word that describes many aspects of this movie. Barbara begins to change Jon's behavior and just might be the one to change his priorities. Or maybe it'll be Esther (Julianne Moore), Jon's college classmate. Or maybe Jon won't change at all.As we wait to see whether Jon accepts that he has a problem and remedy his approach to life and love, we're subjected to Jon and his friends' gross disrespect of women, Jon's obnoxious and dysfunctional family (headed by a very loud, foul-mouthed Tony Danza) along with characters' actions and reactions that don't make sense and are just plain dumb. Helping the audience (especially sex addicts in the audience) see that pornography can never substitute for true intimacy (and can even inhibit it) is a worthy goal, but, in this case, the destination does not justify the journey.So, to sum up, we have a dumb script, disgusting displays, dysfunction and disrespect. Hmm. That's a lot of Ds in my review of ""Don Jon"". I guess one more won't hurt. This movie's grade also starts with a ""D"".",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not so convincing,"When I saw this movie I had not read anything about it before. Normally I read and watch the trailer before, I would let this movie be a surprise to me. But as soon as it started to play in the cinema the audience started to shout out with their joy at the women showing skin. Obviously this movie in it self wants to say something about society but its totally failing with it (media is toxic to the way we view sex etc.). But honestly that is just what has made the people to go and see this movie, because there is a lot of sex and stereotypes in it (and because there are famous actors in it). To not talk about the punch out lines in the movie that where as far away from clever and quite obvious, I wanted to leave the cinema... Unfortunately I saw it with friends so if I had left it would had been weird I suppose (so if I hypothetically would have seen it alone I would have left the cinema). People are laughing with the movie because they do the same thing as the roles: jerk off to porn, give scales on hotness, look at their smart phones a lot etc. This was to me very obvious as I sat in the cinema. As I said; it is sad that Joseph Gordon-Levitt had tried to point how we objectify sex and gender but that is totally what the movie is doing in it self, its contradicting!To me this is a movie you see if you are not interested in movies and and if you don't want to see if anything with a deep context, to see some babes that you can objectify and if you feel like you like to judge people fast. I am my self very found of things in movies such as the camera angels, scripts, casting and the directing but in this movie it all where really bad. And because of the the bad camera angels, the bad script and the bad casting the acting failed as well. This is not because the acting in it self was bad but because it was not convincing to me in any way.The good effect that it had on me was though that it made me feel really sick about the adds that I saw in the shopping windows after that I had left the cinema. Because of the way that people react to the media in this mimetic way.

Lose yourself,"I came across Don Jon while searching for something to watch and the preview looked funny. Previews lie. All the pieces in this film work, but only as pieces. The story is simplistic, the New Jersey tough man act is fake, and the only redeeming quality to the film is Brie Larson staring at her phone the whole movie. The movie doesn't do an adequate job of resolving the conflict nor are the majority of characters, including Don Jon himself, fully fleshed out. What you get is a movie that is about sex, lots and lots of sex but lacks substance. Other low budget movies that focus on characters do a much better job,including Before Sunrise and Clerks, at developing a compelling storyline and dialogue.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
It is about a modern day's way of cheating,"I was thinking the first century of the third millennium where the meaning of cinemas is rewrote. There's been lots of chances we can see and one of those were the beginning of adult-comedies. Recently 'Ted' made lots of waves among movie goers. So here comes the another one from the actor of '50/50' who also debuted as director. Making first is always challenging one, not many had tasted success but he handled very nicely his crew as well the co stars. It was a nice script based on today's world and the path the youngsters moving.The story centers around a character Jon who lives by his own principles. He does everything like every other guy like watching porn and masturbating. One day he meets his girl and begin to give his full commitment to it. Sometime he has to break his rules to obtain from opposite, so the remaining portions explains how far he would go and sacrifice his life for a girl.Definitely it tells the unexpected truth to the older guys who are troubling to understand present technology that affecting people in a strange way. I was talking about online porns and this movie deals about the same theme. The trouble maker in a serious relationship, we can call it a new way of cheating. I believe this movie is not for everyone, if you are okay with adult theme as a comedy then it will be fine. I can call it a rare movie about online porn video addiction.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Would Have Worked Better As A 30-minute Film,"Don Jon is not a terrible film, it's just not a particularly good one. Similar to an SNL sketch that goes on too long, the story and the characters are far too thin and uninteresting to warrant a 90-minute treatment.Joseph Gordon Levitt (who wrote and directed) does a fine acting job and gives a solid impersonation of a shallow, ignorant, aggressive, sex-obsessed, porn-addicted 20-something Jersey boy. But he is sorely miscast. Anyone having spent any time with real-life Jersey boys of this type (or even watched them on TV), will have a very hard time accepting the cuddly and slight JGL in this role.Straining credibility even further, we're forced to accept that JGL's slick character can pull any gorgeous girl from the local dance club, in minutes, and bring her home for sex (this apparently happens every weekend.) But real sex is not nearly as fulfilling to him as watching porn. He can't ""lose himself."" The premise of the film (and where it will go) is recognized about 15 minutes into the story, but there is nothing deep or interesting enough about any of the characters or plot to merit us wanting to invest in the journey any further.Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore also give great performances, but again, they can't overcome the script's lack of depth.In terms of tone and style, it's a bit like watching a well-done, if very unfocused, student film. It's not quite funny enough to work as a pure comedy, and not nearly weighty enough to work as a drama. Visually, it's not particularly attractive or consistent. Unmotivated camera movements occur during the few scenes that actually warrant it being still, giving us no help in connecting to the characters in those moments.I respect JGL greatly for getting this film done, an it will be interesting to see how he develops, but for now, he is clearly a much more talented actor than a writer or director.My advice. If you want to see a great film about a young, ignorant Italian-American's journey to evolve into a more substantive human being, put Saturday Night Fever in your queue. Not only is a great film, based on a superb script, shot during one of the best eras of American filmmaking, but you'll get to see some amazing dance sequences.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Love, Lies, Internet Porn and the Ne zoning of Age Film You Didn't Know You Needed","As a fan of Gordon-Levitt, Johansson, Moore as well as others in this cast, I was pleased to check out this film. I don't really know if I expected a Rom Com, a dopey comedy, or some artsy elite thing. As Gordon-Levitt's directorial debut, it perhaps could have taken any of those well trodden paths. But instead, much to my happy surprise, this film was none of those things. From script to screen, shot by shot, this was a much needed fresh of cinematic air.As comedies go, it hit every beat. As characters go, the work had been put in to subtly establish and make plain the people in this world. The twist away from the tried and true but trite and tired came without a warning a proved the ultimate ""truth"" of something new and fresh could still come so organically.

A man addicted to adult films.,"""Don Jon"" is one of the most down to earth films I have ever seen. It always avoids being around the bush and usually describes the mind of men in certain situations, Joseph Gordon-Levvit is excellent at portraying the role of just an average Jo, and he excellent at making the dialogue extremely realistic, some may not like this though. A positive is it has great pacing but loses it towards the end and kinda gets weird in a way.Another thing to mention is the film is quite repetitive, but this is OK because it is done in a really funny way, which shows a lot of promise.This is a brilliant debut for Joseph and he'll only get better.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
JGL can also direct!,"""For these, and all the sins in my life, I am sorry.""I found Don Jon to be a solid feature debut from Joseph Gordon Levitt as a director who also starred in and wrote the original screenplay for this raunchy romantic comedy. He's a very talented actor, but here he gets to prove his skills as a director and a writer as well. This isn't your typical rom-com and it will probably make you feel uncomfortable from the start because it is not a family film. The writing may have some flaws and at times you may feel like JGL is hammering his message way too much, but I thought he was going for a similar style that Scorsese went for in The Wolf of Wall Street in which several excesses were repeated over and over again to make a point. I found it rather funny that despite how much the message was hammered many people still didn't get the point of the film which was much more than pointing out that pornography is a dangerous addiction that affects relationships. Yes, that is one of the messages behind this film which shows hoy pornography can affect intimacy in a relationship by turning sex into something unilateral. It's about what I can receive from a relationship instead of losing oneself in the other and actually experimenting what love really means. But the film explores much more than pointing out the dangers of pornography addiction. It also is about how disconnected we've become as a society. JGL's character is disconnected due to his addiction, his girlfriend believes love is all about the other person giving up everything for her (which is something she's learned from the rom-coms she eats up almost on a daily basis), which also turns her into someone who is looking for love in a unilateral form, his father is obsessed with sports and if his son isn't interested he doesn't consider him to be a real man, his mother is desperate for him to find a girl so she can be a grandmother, and his sister is completely disconnected and spends almost the entire film speechless on her cellphone. But despite how dysfunctional everyone is in this family, somehow the only person that really sees that Jon's relationship isn't a solid one is his sister who notices what everyone else doesn't see about Jon's girlfriends. By doing this I felt that JGL was pointing out that even that person that seems more disconnected than the rest of society might surprise us. We tend to see the problems in others, but we rarely look at our own defects. Don Jon may hammer its message, but it is not just about Jon's addiction with pornography, there is much more to it.The story centers on - and is narrated by - Jon (Joseph Gordon Levitt), better known to his friends as Don Jon for his ability to conquer women. In his voice over narration he tells us that the only things he cares about in life are his body, his pad, his ride, his car, his family which includes his father Jon Sr. (Tony Danza), his mother Angela (Glenne Neadly) and his sister Monica (Brie Larson), his church, his boys Bobby (Rob Brown) and Danny (Jeremy Luke), his girls, and his porn. He spends a great deal of his time on these things, he visits his family frequently, he works out in the gym daily, he spends time at the club with his boys looking for women and rating them on the 10 point scale, he goes to church every week and confesses his sins to the priest, and most of all he watches porn and loses himself in it. He confesses that he enjoys it even more than actual sex, but he has evidently developed unrealistic expectations from it. One night at the club, he meets Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson) and completely falls in love with her, but he continues to struggle finding true intimacy with her and building a strong relationship. Along the way he meets a fellow student named Esther (Julianne Moore) who sort of opens his eyes about love and relationships.Despite the fact that Shame explored a similar theme recently, it's a subject we rarely see in films. Don Jon is a real exploration of modern relationships and how they've been affected from the way media and films sell sex everywhere. We are bombarded with sexual images in the media all the time creating one sided expectations about love and sex and the film opens by presenting several of these images sort of setting the tone for the rest of the movie. JGL plays a very different role from what we are used to seeing him in and he also worked out a lot for it. HIs character follows a certain routine in life, and the film makes sure it repeats this to get the point across. There are a lot of interesting points this film raises and it really is a comedy with a strong message about how disconnected we've become. The performances in this film were all solid.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the Best of the Year,"I attended a screening last night of Don Jon, starring, written, and directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and was very glad I got the chance to. I was curious about 2 things going into the movie. One, was to see how Gordon-Levitt would do as both a director and writer. Acting I wasn't concerned with because he's one of the best out there today. Well, for his first time out, he nailed it. The story was great and one of the most original I've seen in a long time. Could possibly be the best movie I've seen all year. Number two, I was curious how Tony Danza would be, as it was odd picturing him being in a rated R movie, and trust me, he didn't disappoint. You'll hear him say many things you never heard on Who's the Boss. But he was great all around. There were moments when he reminded me of my dad.But I was kind of blown away by the movie. I was hoping to laugh and I really didn't see it being a typical romantic comedy by any means, and believe me, anyone expecting that will be highly disappointed, sorry ladies. This movie is definitely from a guy's prospective and JGL isn't the sweet, golden boy type character by any means. His character has a lot of layers and that's one of the reasons the movie is as good as it is. Its not your typical R rated comedy either. It falls in between comedy and drama, but mostly, it is just a character study of a man with addiction issues, which lead to relationship issues, and so on and so forth. Its just done in a way where the movie doesn't come off as heavy or preachy and is fun to watch. It just tells the character of Jon's story and I think there are parts that almost every guy can relate to in one way or another, which provides a lot of the laughs. I'm sure some of the websites Jon uses will be familiar to some as well, wink, wink.And aside from JGL and Danza, the rest of the cast is great too. Scarlett was looking as good as ever and was spot on in her role. Julianne Moore was used wisely and gave another solid performance, almost reminiscent of her role in Boogie Nights. One of my favorites was Brie Larson. She doesn't get much screen time but pay attention to her because it pays off in the end.I'm a huge fan of this film and can't wait to see what Gordon-Levitt can do in the future. I give it a 9 out of 10 and is a must watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Vulgar and Offensive,"I would say this is one of the worst movies I have seen in a while. It is so vulgar, offensive and obscene I felt uncomfortable the entire time I was there. This movie lacks a plot until the last 20 minutes. Until that point it's just smut, swearing and womanizing. I gave it a 3 rather a zero simply because I have seen Drowning Mona and that is what I base a 0 upon. I did giggle a few times but mainly to break the awkward tension in the theater. If this is what New Jersey is about, I am thrilled to live nowhere the coast. I hope Joseph Gordon Levitt rethinks his approach at comedy in his future endeavors. Do not waste your time with this flop.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"good, but i've seen better","Although i like Joseph Gordon-Levitt as an actor, i don't really know what to think of this movie. When i first heard of it, i was excited to watch it but it just didn't seem to satisfy me. I did enjoy watching it, therefore i vote 6 out of 10. There are several reasons why i watched it anyway. Like i said i like the actor, and Scarlett is a pretty good actress herself, i've seen a lot of her movies too. It felt to me like there was missing something, i always had the feeling that there was more to come, more excitement and perhaps even a plot twist. I guess the storyline was what made the movie this basic. I wish i cold rate it better but it just wasn't that good.Joseph will have to do a bit better and step up his game to be what he showed me before, like when he acted in his other movies.Still a great fan of yours though, that's why i'm rating this with a 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Boring and repetitive,"This film tells the story of a young man who is addicted to porn. He meets a girl and tries to settle into s meaningful relationship.The trailer of ""Don Jon""looks very cool, but unfortunately the film is not. The plot is so repetitive that my friends and I lost interested half way already. It's always the same scene and the same facial expression. It's always Jon having an orgasmic face and Barbara having a plastic face, acting very urban hip hop style. I thought the film would be edgy and sexy, but it's not. It turned out to be so boring. How many times do we have to watch Joseph Gordon Levitt watching porn or do gym? Or watch the same confession? It's really boring, and the low budget really showed.

Beautiful - truth about partnership and egoism,"I just watched Don Jon, written and directed by the Don himself Joseph Gordon-Levitt.He has done an astonishing work here I must say; me myself being a man born in the midst 80's.The movie centers around Don, a young man whose interests in life are the same as for many young men out there - himself, his friends, his car, one night stands and of course - Porn.The reason I feel I had to write this review is not because I thought it was a Superb movie, it does though have in it a great value of truth to offer - as written in the headline - about relations between men and women, and egoism.I'm gonna try to keep it short here, this is a film you should just watch, if you haven't already seen it stop reading Now and just watch it. But please continue anyway because I've got a point in this review!I have read some bad reviews about this movie, some good. Fine this movie involves some breasts and moans, it involves a bunch of player- like guys etc..But have in mind that Mr Gordon Levitt a clever man, also is his film..The egoism within each of us is our biggest and single most dangerous enemy.To buy your friends a beer, of to buy them a nice purse, that is not altruism (wich is the opposite of egoism).This film can teach you a tiny bit of what ego-loss is about, once you take the step and let some of your ego go away, a whole new world will open.Watch: Don Jon; and then, if you have any questions, just write me an e-mail.

Promising,"Don Jon is in some way the comic version of Shame. The script tackles the subject of sex/porno addiction obviously in a lighter perspective than Steve McQueen's movie, trough two New Jersey guidos, Jon and Barbara.Joseph Gordon-Levitt described with a lot of humour what is the sexuality and the way of consuming it nowadays for some men (and women). He particularly paid attention to the form of his first feature which varies depending on the three distinct acts composing the film. The editing is sharp and based on repeating — maybe a bit too much by the way — shots to show the character's evolution, and the soundtrack perfectly fits with those three parts.Despite everything, the movie isn't exempt from flaws, it takes an unfortunate corny turn as soon as Julianne Moore's character Esther is (badly) introduced, and the ending is a bit too conventional and a bit too abrupt.Nevertheless, for his first movie as writer and director, Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a pretty good job.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Interesting examination of dating in the modern age.,"The talented actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes a creditable writing & directing debut with this stylish, amusing, and sexually frank character study. Gordon-Levitt himself plays the character in question, a young New Jersey man ""in the service industry"" with a fairly short list of what matters to him in life. He has a real knack for being able to score with any hot woman he desires, but at the same time he has a hopeless addiction to Internet pornography. He can't go a day without checking out numerous sites. Then he meets a beauty, Barbara Sugarman (the delectable Scarlett Johansson), with whom he might be able to maintain an actual relationship. But he just can't give up his daily habit.This extremely well shot film attempts to take a hard look at how todays' people have hangups that prevent them from having fulfilling relationships. As we are shown, both Jon and Barbara have idealized notions: he finds Internet porn preferable to real life sex, and she's been raised on scores of romantic movies, so they've been conditioned to concentrate on fantasy rather than reality. Gordon-Levitt cannily makes references to the way that sex is sold in order to appeal to consumers, which is all part of the problem. What doesn't help is when people get too wrapped up in themselves, and cannot make connections to other flesh & blood human beings.There's of course lots of raunchy imagery, and quite a bit of colourful language, so this won't be for all tastes, but Gordon-Levitt is using it all in service of the plot.He's charming and engaging in the lead, and Johansson is similarly appealing. Julianne Moore has a delightful presence as the older woman Jon encounters in night school; it's with her that he's finally able to display some real candor. Tony Danza and Glenne Headly are fine as Jons' parents, and Rob Brown and Jeremy Luke have their moments as his friends.Thankfully, the script refrains from ever becoming TOO predictable.Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Don Julio,"Don Jon is a romantic comedy and as such there are a few things you more or less have to take with a grain of salt. At least to some degree it will be generic and formulaic.In this case Don is a stereotypical alpha male, whose interests are going to the gym, his car, church and picking up girls for one night stands. And of course porn. He decides one night stands aren't equaling his porn induced fantasies and decides to get into a relationship with a girl. Instantly he becomes the polar opposite of who he was, he goes to romantic movies he hates because she likes them, he doesn't push her to have sex, goes back to school because she likes it etc. That all happens in the intro to the movie so ill leave the almost spoilers there.Essentially he has one classic unhealthy lifestyle, trades it for what he thinks hes supposed to look for, but its disingenuous and just as unhealthy.There's a significant amount of religious context, at first it makes sense because the character has never questioned his lifestyle. But as he metamorphosis's from alpha male jerk to sensitive boyfriend and then his ultimate personification, he starts to question the things in his life. He almost half questions his belief in Christianity, but doesn't really follow through. Maybe they ran out of time. Anyway as with all romantic comedies he eventually sees the error of his ways and finds happiness.This film does 2 things differently. One it focuses on Pornography, which i like because its a huge part of adult life which often studios are too timid to want to tackle, and the other is it added in a sort of middle man between unhealthy lifestyle and healthy resolution. Im not entirely sure the added state of unhealthiness was necessary but who am i to judge. On the pornography note i was fairly happy throughout the majority of the film, even though factors in his personal life seek to annihilate his practice of watching pornography at various times he defends it as natural and a part of pretty much every adult males life, all of which are true. Then he goes and, as we more or less always knew he would, ditches watching it altogether which kind of sends the message that it was abhorrent. In that sense the film took a man abusing something in an unhealthy way and basically made it taboo, which is equally fallacious.Not sure how the average viewer would watch this. The majority of romantic comedy watchers are likely to be women who might not like the frank portrayal of human sexuality and the contemporary reliance on porn for basically all men, but on the other hand i'm not too certain many men will appreciate the formulaic and ultimately obvious ending.I will say on a positive note, it was extremely satisfying seeing Gordon-Levitt acting macho, protruding his chest constantly and flexing his arms superfluously. He reminded me, i'm sure intentionally, a great deal of Jersey Shores Mike ""the situation"".",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not a bad movie but not for me,"For starters, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's fine as you might expect but I was most surprised by Scarlett Johansson. She's not an actress I've ever been overly-impressed with but here she shows some range and is pretty good. I also enjoyed Tony Danza and Glenne Headly as his parents. The film starts out like a sort of romantic comedy but turns into something less pleasant and more artsy. Once Julianne Moore enters the picture, things go downhill. I quickly realized what was about to happen with the story and, not being a big fan of Moore's, my interest level dropped significantly. I liked the chemistry and banter between Levitt and Johansson early on. I didn't like the Levitt/Moore chemistry. She looks like his grandmother so that was off-putting to me. Yes, I realize that's shallow and will upset some people but that's how I feel. I didn't find their scenes romantic or sexy at all. The funny bits are sparse and what it's trying to say is not as profound as it seems to believe. I appreciate Joseph Gordon-Levitt's talent. He's a very likable actor and he directs this very well. He could have a big future ahead of him as a director. My criticisms of the movie are solely from an entertainment perspective, which is subjective obviously. I'm not a pompous indie film fan. Maybe if I was I would love it more. It's just not my cup of tea.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

A fantastic first-step for director Joseph Gordon-Levitt,"Sing-a-long – ""It's such a – good vibration It's such a – sweeeet sensation."" Marky-Mark's Good Vibration serves as a very apt soundtrack to Joseph Gordon-Levitt's directorial debut Don Jon, as the dramedy immerses itself within the art of adult entertainment If you're not quite with me, never mind.Levitt pops his director cherry and for his first time behind the camera, he delivers a bravely honest depiction of male sexuality, as his character Jon takes a bazooka to the erotic taboo: porn. Nicknamed Don Jon by his meathead mates for his ability to woo the women, our New Jersey lothario is a porn-junkie who prefers ""beating it"" to the real thing. ""Unlike porn, real pussy can kill you"", says the Don, and with justification like that, who can argue?Although it favours a cartoonish superficiality over the refinement and sophistication of Shame, McQueen's movie of similar narrative sort, it totally works as entertainment anyway.Just when the confession-goer believes that no woman can fulfil his carnal desires in the same way that porn can, enter Barbara Sugarman, a Scarlett Johansson gone ghetto as she chumps of chewing-gum and sports the slick street vibe. On a scale of one-to-ten, our blonde bombshell scores a ""dime"" and Don Jon is convinced she is the answer to his prayers. Finally, our masturbation-addict begins a serious relationship with something other than his computer.Joseph Gordon Levitt takes a confident first step on the road to what looks to be an equally illustrious career behind the camera.

Several years ago a movie came out that had in the leading roles two absolute ""A"" list stars; it was a WW II spy thriller that was getting rave revues. Because of my finances at the time, I didn't go to see it when it first came out...I waited until it came to the one dollar theater around the corner from where I lived. It was SO bad that, not only did I walk out, but I demanded my dollar back, and the next day, wrote a letter to the production company telling them what an insult to humanity that piece of crap was. What's my point ? you ask...Well, I answer, that stinkburger was leaps and bounds better than the little gem that prompted me to write this...an absolute pile of trash entitled ""Don Jon"".

Until he meets the blonde bombshell Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson in her most charismatic role in years), who captures Jon's undying attention and slowly wraps him around her finger - making him take up a business course, fighting his small idiosyncrasies and - worst of all - obliging him to resign from pornhub...The star of the movie excels as the straight-forward Jersey Italian, unaware of his weakness, living in denial, yet too simplistic to remold himself. The denouement, when it comes, seems however largely out of character, as Jon gains depth, complexity and self-awareness far beyond anything suggested earlier in the movie. Such a revelatory change happens plot-wise, but seems overly forced, lacking a structural backbone which can not be explained by the impact of his affair with classmate Esther (Julianne Moore).Nonetheless, ""Don Jon"" is an extremely enjoyable affair, especially for its target group - men at large - uncovering some unspoken truths about masculinity. At times Joseph Gordon-Levitt's script reveals some true wit and foresight, with the last scene of Jon in a confessional a true mantelpiece of the movie, delivering a wickedly accurate commentary on the institution of confession. Slightly uneven, ""Don Jon"" does also mostly capture the man's point of view on the subject matter, albeit (possibly purposefully) omitting the female perspective so widely approached in rom-coms. Thankfully the comedy does so, while omitting crude sexual humour in a porn-focused movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers an admirable debut, especially with some of the manly banter and in the construction of several scenes. With time and experience (and a more subtly developed script) he may yet become competition for Ben Affleck as the most talented next-generation actor-director in America.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
the people that write this film is vulgar and offensive?,"just goes to show how much of a chance EVERYone has to write an opinion on this site. to me, THEY are offensive. offensively dense to have missed much of the point. it's ALways amazed me. people's programed reaction to 'cursing'. which is usually a word synonymous with words that describe the same thing or event. except that THOSE words are 'acceptable'. i'd like to put you all in a room and rid the world of such stupidity, truth be told. i don't think the movie was about porn/sex addiction, either... i think we watched someone 'grow up' through some non judgmental questioning of methods and exploration of new possibilities. new programing, if you will...now for those of you that found him vulgar...could you be more specific, please? by which definition? here. i'll give you four to choose from...adjective: of or associated with the great masses of peopleadjective: being or characteristic of or appropriate to everyday languageadjective: lacking refinement or cultivation or tasteif you chose any of the first 3, i'm thinking you're a narcissistic, racist intellectual. thinking YOUR 'sense of order' is more 'correct' than those you look down your knows(sic) at.adjective: conspicuously and tastelessly indecent Example: ""A vulgar gesture"" like the looks you get from those untouchables on the other side of whatever window/counter they work on when they get to misuse their authority...so pleeeeeeeeeeease save me from your prefab moralizing senselessness. and see the whole movie... now you may return to your magazines, TV shows, commercials and movies to help you figure out what new thoughts to have, clothes to wear and things to think hip. and btw, while this movie seemed to be a 'major accomplishment' to many that praised the movie(and there WERE praiseworthy performances), the writing seemed to fill in with form/style(repetitiveness) what it didn't have to offer past adolescent tries on first pair of adult dancing shoes... on the other hand(no spoiler intended with those last 4 words. this is a pun some of you might get), i can very well see how many teeners turning the emotional corner into adulthood might love this film through identification. maybe even justify their beliefs that all the machismo was just some beer commercial that peer pressure validates way past its expiration date...",,Anonymous,Romance
"Interesting, but uninspired.","Don is a young man who lives like the prototypical New Jersey guido. His life revolves around porn, trying to score with women, working out, and having dinner with the family, roughly in that order. His lifestyle is designed to please himself, with the possible exception of spending time with the family and going to church, which is also a familial obligation.He measures success in life by easily quantifiable measures: how much weight can you lift? how many (quantifiably desirable) women can you bed? how many acts of contrition does the priest proscribe?Played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jon is a simple man. He meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), a simple but stunning woman, and decides he has fallen in love. In the course of that relationship, he meets Esther (Julianne Moore), an older, more complex woman, who introduces him to some foreign ideas about relationships and sex. Don learns a few things in the process.The acting in this film is excellent. The story is interesting, but uninspired. Because the story is about some ""shallow"" people, there is little passion in ""Don Jon"". The sexual content will undoubtedly annoy some viewers.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Original and unusually romantic!,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt's directorial debut in a feature ""Don Jon"" definitely takes the cake as one of the years best romantic comedies. Funny and definitely original, ""Don Jon"" had more to it than just its suggested theme about a porn-addicted gym head and stood out with its premise that Jon had found his ""perfect"" girl but was still unfulfilled. The film really illustrated the other side of sex and love and proved that unrealistic expectations about the two can prove to be detrimental to a relationship built on superficial standards. Although there were some parts that were overly stereotypical in regards to people in New Jersey and female foreplay, for the most part it was a good film. Gordon-Levitt's film was well received and with good reason; the modern take on relationships was a breath of fresh air amongst the typical sappy romantic movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great effort by the first time director! 6/10,"Review: When this movie starts off, I thought that it was going to be about a guy who is addicted to online porn and falls in love with a girl in a club, but it's very cleverly written by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and you can't help but get caught up in his weird lifestyle. It's a deep drama which has some interesting characters and a original script. For a young person, he has directed a very adult movie which deals with things that people are obsessed with in this day and age and how they can warp your mind. There is a lot of porn throughout the movie so if your not into that type of thing, this movie is definitely not for you, but there is a hidden message behind the whole story of Don Jon which a lot of people can relate to. Enjoyable!Round-Up: I really didn't know what to expect from this film because I haven't really heard that much about it, but after watching it, I can honestly say that I did end up getting caught up with all of the characters personals issues. I'm glad that the film made a profit because it was a great achievement by the first time director, and he had a original style of directing which was refreshing. In all, it's definitely worth a watch and I hope that Joseph Gordon-Levitt directs another movie.Budget: $6million Worldwide Gross: $30.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there comedy/dramas about a guy whose addicted to online porn and struggles to find love. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
JGL obsession validated,"Joseph Gordon Levitt isn't just a dreamy actor anymore, he is officially a cinematographic artist. I am thoroughly impressed with his directorial and screen writing talents. He did an astounding job considering it was the first feature film he has ever directed. Although the idea of making a movie about a sex addict is a little risk-ay, JGL worked it into something really special. Don Jon isn't just another love story or addiction drama, it is about a man who isn't capable of getting ""lost"" in another person, a man who has trouble sexually connecting with women. This film was visually very striking and beautifully executed. Hats off to Thomas Kloss for his wonderful cinematography. Overall I definitely felt some 'good vibrations' and will not be able to get JGL's multiple sex faces off my brain for some time. -absolutely not suitable for children",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Could Have Been Better:,"I LOVE Joseph Gordon Levitt, and this movie was a sad start to him directing his own films. This could have been done SO much better. First off, as previously stated, the accents were awful. Listening to Scarlett Johansson trying to pass off her voice as being from New Jersey made me want to cry. Second off, it is unbelievably repetitive, to the point of almost being confusing.I didn't see this movie in theaters, I was lucky enough to catch it on Netflix. That being said, if I had made the choice to see it in theaters, I wouldn't by any means have demanded my money back or walked out. It wasn't THAT terrible.Honestly, the movie has a message that just doesn't come across well because you're so busy being irritated by the little things. When you watch it, look for the message. That's all I can say. That, and I hope that when JGL directs movies in the future, it is done better than this one.Not terrible; but incredibly disappointing given the potential of all of the individuals involved with this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Poor,"I went to watch this film with a high expectation of it being a hilarious comedy. I was mistaken. The film is very mixed; I couldn't tell whether to laugh and some points or to take them serious. To me it had a very mixed genre.The story wasn't great and the ending seemed to be rushed. You didn't get the chance to form any sort of feelings towards the characters (other than Jon) and I just think it was really really poor.Jon was a great character but I just think much more could have been made of it! I always checked IMDb ratings before I watch ANY film. 6+ and I'll give it a chance. As this film is rated 7.2 you can see why I'm so disappointed.Only twice at the cinema has a film finished and I've said ""Well, that was sh*t"". The first was for, understandably, 'The Bounty Hunter'. Don Jon has now been added to that short list.BUT ... boobs.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Vidiot Reviews,"Don JonTo never get caught browsing porn on the Internet again, simply condition your body to become aroused by auto-part websites.However, the addict in this drama prefers websites with fake headlights.Despite getting plenty of female attention, Don Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) continually revisits the effortless orifice of Internet pornography.Even after landing the perfect ten (Scarlett Johansson), he still satisfies himself via visual stimuli.It's not until Jon meets the bereft, and more mature, Esther (Julianne Moore) that he learns to loose himself in the sexual experience.An astute commentary on modern male masturbator habits, this directorial debut from the film's writer, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, shows great potential.The dialogue is sharp yet sincere, the characters are developed and relatable, and its message is a meaningful one for today's stunted man.Incidentally, when they put something other than porn on the Internet, men will stop looking at porn on the Internet.

Bad Acting and Directing,"I wanted to see Joseph Gorden- Levitt's movie Don Jon, because I saw him in 'Mysterious Skin' directed by Gregg Araki. Joseph was good when he was young. He really knew how to act and he would put emotions in the character which would make you cry. But I was totally disappointed at Joseph in this character in Don Jon. He forgot how to act. He thought that he could really play a New Yorker and Italian plus Joseph, comedy is really hard. You are not a comedy actor. Why would you choose to write and direct and then you wanted to be a lead actor in it too. There was no real plot in the film and actors were just superficial and there was nothing natural about them. There was vulgar sex like every 10 minutes as if that was the way to keep audience engaged. Scarlett Johansson was struggling to produce New Yorker accent and I don't really care about her acting anyways. I don't know who wanted to put money into this film. Ryan Kavanaugh kept putting money into bad films that's why he is bankrupt.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

The devil is in the details....and a sad stereotype.,"SPOILERS I really wanted to like this movie, I like Joseph Gordon-Levitt as an actor, but before he writes anymore movies, he's got to read some literature and stop watching reality TV shows. Here's a hint--reality shows are not about reality, they're meant to shock you and make you laugh. Or just shock.Where to begin? The ""jersey shore"" stereotype of of an Italian guy who likes to party and go to church? Confession every week and the only thing he confesses to is self gratification and sleeping out of wedlock, for which he receives ""penance"" of 10 Our Fathers and Hail Marys? REALLY? What time period is this set in? There are no more ""confession booths""! Penance stopped being like that for over twenty or thirty years that I am aware of. It's more like ""do something kind for someone"" or volunteer. More practical if you know what I mean. Even if I was OK with the stereotype, it's a stereotype of Essex County, NJ (think Sopranos). And, Gandolfini needed an accent coach because he's from Bergen County and, we just don't speak that way. And none of them had that even remotely right, none of them. I wanted to like this movie, I really did. But the stereotypes are just so over the top. A religious Italian guy who has sex indiscriminately, rates girls on looks with his friends, watches porn after he has sex with a random girl, a loud father who constantly watches football (uh, no...not in MY family) the Italian mother who only wants the best for her son and grandchildren (yeah, OK), and the sister constantly on her cell phone, even at the dinner table (not in any Italian family I know, at least in NJ). The stereotype older woman (and I mean OLD, over 20 years older) who somehow understands him and teaches him what TRUE love is. I can allow the beautiful manipulative girlfriend who wants a ""real man"" whatever that's supposed to mean, but you just can't take ONE college course in any school in NJ. There is a minimum number of credits for being a part time student, and there are all the many fees involved that would not make it practical to take one course even if you could.Mr. Gordon-Levitt would have better served himself if he wrote about a stereotype he did actually know, maybe a California type is so wrapped up in himself. I guess the think is, this stereotype could have been ""living in LA"" instead of NJ.So, I guess the only people who enjoyed this movie were guys who masturbate to porn on their computers and think it is normal. And they enjoyed the ti-tty shots.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Really Bad,"The only thing saving grace for this movie was the cast. Other than that, A movie about someone with a porn addiction just doesn't cut it for me. Half the movie was about a man ""keeping in touch with himself"" if you know what I mean. They should have focused more on the relationship with the older woman and how much it changed him rather than the younger one. I think I would have enjoyed that much more. The acting was fine, the plot fell flat. You still didn't feel sorry for him at the end which was very disappointing. The stereotypical Jersey/Staten Island family was a bit too much, also didn't get the sister on her cell phone the whole movie and only spoke once, kind of a useless role, but I guess she made her money. I was expecting a lot more for this movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is a movie that most every guy can relate to,"Even though it seemed a bit like a chick flick from the previews, this movie was made for bachelors across America. Practically every guy I know (including myself) can relate to what Levitt presented here; and as proof of the potency of this film, I am on IMDb instead of going to a porn site, even after witnessing so many fine ladies on the big screen.Not only does Levitt provide a lot of insight that most of us already know (and usually ignore), his ability to capture the modern male's dilemma in American culture throughout the movie is therapeutic and reminds all us guys who go bar hopping that what matters most is between the ears. Now, as for Don Jon's incredible success ratio, that seems a bit far-fetched...but then again, since this seems like Levitt just getting a portion of his life off his chest and onto the big screen, I can see why he's successful with one-night-stands 95% of the time--being a celebrity and all.If you are a single guy between 20 and 40, you should strongly consider watching this film. It will reaffirm that you are not alone, that it is not a healthy lifestyle, and that it takes some risk and real courage to change.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fantastic first outing as a directorial powerhouse,"Don Jon Martello, the epitome of a modern day Don Juan, is the marvelous brainchild of one of America's up and coming great actors, Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Given this is his first venture into the field of directing this should not deter anyone from seeing this movie. There is more heart and emotion in this movie than any big budget Hollywood gush fest could bring forth in a 100 million dollar budget. The realism and examination of human emotion and interaction in relationships is effortlessly presented by JGL. He critiques the expectations of beauty and love brought forth by two generations of individuals veiled with an air of coarse and hilarious dialogue. This movie seeks to do what Shame did for sex addiction 2 years before and unlike Shame, Don Jon wishes to deal with the subject in a more accessible and less depressing manner. In doing so we as viewers are given a delicious and entertaining introduction of the stigma that is porn addiction. But to focus on the actual acting the actors appear to be very comfortable and genuine with the portrayal of their characters. JGL effortlessly evinces the meathead and sex obsessed persona of Jon Martello. Scarlett Johansson just exudes sexuality and her spot on Jersey accent actually had me cringing from laughter during the movie. The helpless romantic mother (Glenne Headly), the detached and sexually obsessed father (Tony Danza), and the almost Greek tragedian and taciturn character of Monica Martello (Brie Larson) helps to round out this extremely idiosyncratic American family.Finally with the woman who teaches the meaning to Jon of what making love is all about, the sexy, sassy Esther (Julianne Moore). This movie had me entertained from beginning to slightly too cheesy end but nonetheless I recommend this movie to all modern film lovers.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Inauspicious directing and writing debut for JGL,"An inauspicious directing and writing debut for Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Dull plot, clumsy direction. The whole movie feels like it was a school project.Character development is superficial, at best. (Though they were fairly superficial characters. Movie could have been called ""Neanderthal mating habits""...)Some parts of the plot make no sense at all. The romance between Gordon-Levitt's character and Julianne Moore's character seemed incredibly contrived and implausible.Performances are fine. JGL does a good impersonation of a New Jersey native, and Scarlett Johansson does a good stuck-up princess routine, while looking good doing it. Julianne Moore is irritating, but that's mostly due to the script.Joseph Gordon-Levitt can only get better from here, directing- and writing-wise.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
A journey into a man's psyche,"Ever since '3rd Rock from the Sun"", Joseph Gordon-Levitt has been proving himself as a serious actor, and this time he's proved himself to be a serious writer and director too. 'Don Jon' is probably one the most sincere and unpretentiously great films I have seen in a while.I expected to see a romantic comedy with a slight twist, but what 'Don Jon' ended up to be was a real character study of a contemporary young adult male of today, riding through different genres with ease and ending with a real moral of the story (which is kind of a rarity these days). What started out as a self indulgent mild-shock-flick on the verge of porn (during the first ten minutes or so, I really thought I'd hate the rest of the film), soon turned romantic comedy, then drama and ended up as an accurate and a very colorful portrait of a young man today sorting out his issues.Though it may seem sexist and over the top, I honestly found myself in a lot of situations JGL displays in 'Don Jon', and I believe many men will. For such an unpretentious feature, it made me think about myself more than most other films recently, and that certainly can't be a bad thing.It might not be the best film ever (it may not even be the best film of the year, for that matters), but I can honestly say I really loved it. Kudos to JGL. I'm eagerly waiting for the next one.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Pass the Popcorn review,"Don Jon is young actor's Joseph Gordon-Levitt's feature debut as a director and a writer. I always admired Gordon-Levitt as an actor (in addition to writing and directing Don Jon, he also plays the title role) and I was eager to see how he would handle the director's/writer's chair. And I must say, Gordon-Levitt didn't disappoint: Don Jon is a rather sweet and entertaining movie that deals with the sensitive subject of pornography – a subject you'll won't see frequently tackled in mainstream movies. I wouldn't go as far as to call Don Jon a revolutionary movie, but it definitely is a fresh movie that deserves to be watched.The movie is about Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), called The Don because of his success with the ladies, who enjoys several things in his life – his friends, his family, training in the gym, going to church and, of course, the ladies. Bust most of all, Jon likes pornography, he even explains how he prefers porn to real sex; he watches it daily and is, what you might call, a porn addict. One night, at a club, he meets the beautiful Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), whom he describes as a 'dime', and soon starts a relationship with. The problem with Barbara is that she dislikes men who watch porn. Jon has no choice but to simultaneously maintain his relationship and his porn watching habits, because he doesn't want to give up either.The thing I like the most about Don Jon is how it deals with ""taboos"" in a genuine, intelligent way – and because of that it somewhat reminds me of Kevin Smith's 1997 classic Chasing Amy. Like it or not, porn plays a role in almost every man's life and will – sooner or later – be the topic of a discussion in a relationship. Don Jon deals with this topic in a very mature way. It shows that too much porn can cause the developing of unrealistic expectations in a young man, as well as other things (like romantic movies) which, if consumed in excessive amounts, can lead to unrealistic expectations. The movie deals with this topic in a very subtle and appealing way, and it may be considered a relationship study. However, due to the nature of its topic, the movie is written exclusively from a man's perspective, and it might not be as entertaining for the female audience as it is for the male audience.Overall, it seems to me that Joseph Gordon-Levitt was able to achieve the hat-trick of movie making with Don Jon. His screenplay is fresh and intriguing, his acting is top-notch and even his directing style is interesting and captivating. The rest of the cast – especially the female leads Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore – are charming as ever, and Tony Danza is great as the, arguably, funniest character in the movie – Jon's dad, also called Jon. In spite of not being a full blown comedy, Don Jon is a movie that will definitely put a smile on your face. With directing and writing Don Jon, Joseph Gordon-Levitt showed he is not just a talented actor, and I can't wait for him to direct more movies.Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Don Jon - Porn addict want to go offline - 5.8,"Don Jon tells a story of young man in his twenties who cares about only 3 things: his house, his body and his porn collection.As the movie opens, the character 'Don Jon' played by Joseph-Gordon Levitt gets introduced as an arrogant & self-absorbed narcissist.He's good with women, but treats them carelessly and to his own satisfaction. His porn addiction has gotten to the point that even after having sex, he needs to log on and watch adult movies in order to feel satisfied.This behavior reaches a climax when character Barbara played by Scarlett Johansson gets introduced.He finds himself confronted with real human emotions and wants to create a meaningful relationship for the very first time in his existence.

Great cast and editing; though I wasn't not into the whole jersey shore feel of it, but overall it's good and when you really get into the movie u can overlook that.

An excellent social commentary on today's relationships....,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt has already proved he's one of the most talented actors in Hollywood right now. With Don Jon, he's setting out to prove he's just as good at writing and directing, with this being his directorial debut. By choosing to make a movie about porn addiction, he picked a pretty risky subject to centre his first film on but he pulls it off perfectly, giving us a vision of what will hopefully be an outstanding directorial career for JGL.Don Jon features an incredibly original story written by JGL, that has a lot more to it than is alluded to in the trailers. It's more than your average rom-com; it's intelligently written and has some great social commentary on relationships in today's society. The characters are extremely well developed, and a lot of them took unexpected turns. In fact, the whole last third of the movie took a very unexpected turn, because although the trailers show a lot of the major events of the first part of the movie, none of this last third is shown so it completely comes up out of nowhere. I'm sure there are many people who won't like this surprise but I thought it was great, and something that many movies today wouldn't dare to do. Even though the trailers show a lot, it still feels fresh and unique whilst watching, which is really a testament to JGL's great skill. If I had to pick a negative, it would be that the film seems to end very abruptly. I was really enjoying it, wondering where it would go next but then it was suddenly over. I don't think it was necessarily a bad place to end, it was just very unexpected.The acting is outstanding, it's a shame that this years Oscar race is already so crowded because there are some award-worthy performances here that probably won't get recognition. JGL hits it out of the park as he always does, never failing to impress. I was very surprised by Scarlett Johansson, in the past I've always thought she was just good, but in Don Jon she's excellent. Another noteworthy mention is Brie Larson, who has about three lines of dialogue in the whole film but still impressed me, she does a great job just using facial expressions and is often very funny.I've already said how JGL does an excellent job writing and acting, but that would mean nothing if he wasn't able to get the directing right. That's not the case though, as he does a phenomenal job directing. The soundtrack is great, the editing is incredibly sharp and there's some great cinematography. If JGL continues to direct like this (and let's hope he does) then we're in for a treat.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A rare and hilarious, multi-layered insight of the world of the little man","Well, well, that was quite the surprise! Everything else being said by other reviewers, I'd like to add that it made me realize how rare movies like this are. That is, about the little man. The dumb man. Not the hero, not the intellectual, not the sociopath, not the victim of injustice or any other, you know, *interesting* type. Nothing glamorous, just a regular dumb-ass dude. Italian from Jersey, too. The leads are extremely good, Scarlett Johansson kills it in the part of the uber-stupid and annoying hot chick. The dad was brilliant, too. Beautifully shot, masterfully edited, great pace and structure, the constant cycling of elements beautifully reflects the routine of Jon's painfully ordinary life devoid of anything but satisfying the most basic animal needs.All the imaginable clichés, all at once and way overdone - fantastic and hilarious! Way better than the trailer would make you think, a skilfully crafted piece of merciless, if light, social satire. Unfortunately, I believe that aspect of the film is being neglected by the audience in favor of the more attention-grabbing element of the porn-addiction, which (in my humble personal opinion) is not at all the leading motif.Addendum: reading some of the negative reviews posted here made me shiver and remember why I opted to live in the much more liberal EU. I believe Americans have gone waaay too far in the way of obsessively trying to be politically correct. Oh yes, and religious and proper and tidy and non-smoking and all that, too. Not a ""date movie""? What on Earth is a ""date movie""? Offensive and vulgar?! Improper language? I found it as innocent and heart-warming as a little white bunny.

Is It Better Than Porn?,"It seems like the most popular thing to do these days for actors is to make their own directorial debuts. It's never been such a trend until now (probably) when actors saw that Ben Affleck has garnered quite a bit of success as a filmmaker. Everyone from James Franco to Cate Blanchett to Ryan Gosling- I find it a little annoying, but hey, that's just my opinion. Anyways, atop numerous directorial debuts, this one belongs to a young man named Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Don Jon explores the issue that is porn addiction, and believe it or not, people, it actually exists just like sex addiction. We follow a guido-like character named (Don) Jon (played by JGL) who usually has his way of women. He lives through a strict work-out schedule, balancing it with his daily porn and a night out at the club to pick out the next skank. This casually patterns his life until he unexpectedly meets a ""dime"" (perfect/""10"" woman), Barbara who's played by none other than Scarlett Johansson.Now, right from the get-go, a film with as edgy of a plot is bound to stir controversy, and so, it's no surprise that there's been a noticeable backlash against the film by- most likely- conservative critics. I'm assuming not everyone's comfortable with viewing a man enjoying masturbation or countless clips of pornography, but I guess it's not that easy to keep an open mind either. Contrary to what those shallow individuals claim, I loved the film, especially since it satirizes romantic comedies and incredibly narrow-minded gals and men, which overtly inhabit our society in its present state. The film essentially and cleverly points out how closed-minded people really act these days. Frankly, I consider women with impossibly high standards in the looks department much sluttier and repulsive than the ones who ""do it"" with a wide range of folk. The film explores such truly meaningful and relevant themes; people simply possess too high of standards nowadays, and it's this desire for what we perceive as pure perfection in a significant other.A considerable amount of females habitually watch romantic comedies, and thus, leave the movie theater with this dreamy hope that someday they'll find a Channing Tatum. On the opposite side of the spectrum, lots of males consistently view porn because they lack that kind of excitement in their sex lives. After enjoying aggressive penetration (please don't mind the graphic language) in their pornographic material, they wholly expect a similar outcome for their upcoming night, but they're constantly disappointed. So, both genders ridiculously grab onto these unrealistic expectations in the end. Just dial it back on the over-reliance on physical looks (that's what I call a real slut/whore in my dictionary) and just get to know a human being- talk to them and balance out your preferences for god's sake. These similar issues can be witnessed in Jon's and Barbara's relationship as both cling on to their own expectations for one another and proceed through a bumpy road.Moving on from a major element of the film, the feature also benefits from terrific editing as it rhythmically cuts through an abundance of porn clips which coincide with Jon's daily schedule and progressing story, and it's this bouncing back between various activities and material at a fast pace that makes Don Jon that much more appealing. In addition, the film certainly has its fair share of exceptional performances from Joseph Gordon-Levitt (his character, himself, is fascinatingly complex and something different), Tony Danza (playing his father whom I believe gives one of the best supporting performances of the year in its sheer authenticity), Scarlett Johansson (sporting a convincing New Jersey accent), and Julianne Moore (who contributes a dramatic tone to the film's later half). On top of that, the script/dialogue feels utterly genuine where you're strongly entertained and immersed in these realistic conversations that Woody Allen's films became popular for.And with that, here I'll have to digress with this strange issue critics develop towards films with occasional tonal shifts. How, in any way, does a shift in tone conflict with quality? Yes, I understand if a silly, over-the-top comedy becomes a grim and touching drama, but if a satirical comedy (in case you didn't know, it's not really as funny as a dumb, simple comedy because of the underlying- usually unfortunate- reality behind it) becomes a heart-felt drama and finally forms a sense of seriousness and misfortune, it's not that big of a deal! Every (good) comedy eventually reaches that point in its plot where the themes begin to pour out more clearly, and that's what happens in Don Jon's last half. Don't get me wrong; the film is uproariously hilarious, but it gets serious and matter-of-fact right when it needs to. Life's not all fun and games- believe it or not- and intelligent films usually carry more depth than elementary sexual and crude humor (not referring to Don Jon's style of humor).Albeit a slightly abrupt and inconclusive ending, you suddenly start to realize perhaps that's the whole point. Life doesn't have a definitive climax to it unless you call death a climax. It's great for a moviegoer to have the kind of standpoint where you believe you're entering a specific period of an individual's life- it's only that part and nothing else. It's like the camera just decided that this was the most interesting segment of their life and decided to peak in during that span and then called it quits at the right moment. Furthermore, I absolutely recommend Don Jon to those who take film seriously as an art form, not as a basic medium to only lie back and experience some dumb fun with. So far, we're off to an amazing start for this fall.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
One word...boring!

Unrealistic Expectations,"As you watch or re-watch this movie, ask yourself or list the unrealistic expectations that each of the characters present. Does Don Jon even have any, or are all the unrealistic expectations those forced upon him by everyone else? Maybe his problem is that he has no expectations of his own and he doesn't attempt to force his ""rules of the correct way to live"" on anyone else (other than when he's driving). I saw him as being generally feckless and extremely pliant; if this is correct, an examination of how the central theme of this movie got so conflated should ensue.""Under a torrent of unrealistic expectations from everyone but his priest, his sister, his classmate, and a friend, Don Jon attempts to find happiness on his own terms without pretext or presumption but is unable to escape his predicament because he puts his own happiness above the things that society defines as happiness.""Society has many ""relationship rules"" (human interaction generally and romantically specifically) and many are just wrong.Another good list to make, or drinking game to play, would be to identify each of these rules and if they really need to be followed without exception; and why.It was Einstein who said that insanity is unexamined repetition and here we have a case where not only are the ""games that people play"" left unexamined, but the context itself is wrong-headed!I'd love to list the rules that I Spotted but that's definitely a Spoiler now that I've given the milk and the context away for free but it's nothing a swiffer sweeper couldn't Clean-up.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The film's target audience is male teenagers ONLY,"This was one of the most boring films I've ever seen. It just describes, but in a very simplified and superficial way, things you already know about sex and relationships. It can be a good lesson for any little boy who just discovered masturbation and porn. Not that there aren't any grown-up men who behave exactly like the guy at the movie. But I don't think this movie would touch them either, because, as I mentioned before, the film is really boring and ""touches"" the subject superficially. There is not even one surprise in this movie. I would have stopped watching it almost from the start, but I was really hoping that there would be something interesting in the end (given that I really like Joseph Gordon- Levitt, Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore), so I watched it until the end.

Two extra stars for Johansson,"Don Jon is promising in the start. Jon is a good representative of 30+, single, white collar, metropolitan males. The discussion of internet porn is presented pretty straightforward. But this the premise fails as nothing worth watching happens in the movie. (One extra star for this beginning)With no twist (even no finale) at all, a story-not-developing with a very predictable ending is just a waste of time to watch.

Revolting,"I'm going to start with the aspect of this movie we all recognize but never talk about - the stereotype of the ""Jewish-American princess"" (JAP). Scarlett's character of Barbara Sugarman is the personification of every JAP joke, from her conservative sexual preferences to her controlling nature to her upwardly mobile ambitions. Yet despite that and having been given a Jewish- sounding name, which Jon's father even comments on, she is never specifically acknowledged as Jewish in the script. I don't have a problem with portraying stereotypes as long as it's done honestly, but here I think it was a case of doing it while stopping short of admitting it. Sorry, screenwriters, you can't have your PC and eat it too.Having said that, my assessment of this movie is simply ""revolting."" How can we like a movie centered on a shallow man's overtly portrayed masturbation addiction? Its one saving grace is the always brilliant Julianne Moore's role as the breath of fresh air in this polluted story. I'm really amazed that Scarlett, who has always chosen her roles wisely in the past and now has her pick of them, would have agreed to do this one. It isn't as if she needed yet another Hot Chick role in her resume.And the Catholic Church connection did nothing but make Jon's character more disgusting.

Great start...,"The acting and direction were excellent. Not surprised by that though with Joseph Gorden-Levitt and the rest of the cast. I was really looking forward to watching it and initially it was all that I expected and hoped for. But then this film that started off as an insightful and realistic portrayal of men and their views/ perceptions of, and interactions with, sex went off the rails and became a train-wreck. Unfortunately it suddenly and disappointingly spiraled into an unrealistic and pointless ""see...men really ARE sensitive!"" 'chick flick'. Men only care about their egos and how things effect their egos. Sex impacts their egos and so they care about sex. How to get it, get more of it, and how other men will perceive them for how much they are getting and with who. Everything else is pointless. The end of this film attempted to portray the reality as men are really all about emotions when everyone knows they are not. Pity.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
REAL Life,"So I am reasonably intelligent, well educated, have refined taste, ""worldly"" kind of guy etc. and thus theoretical I should not like this movie, perhaps. Just the opposite! (Although I must admit to really liking Scarlett Johansson no matter where she appears).Every moment, every frame of this movie is SO believable in a ""stylized/hollywood production kind of a way"". I can totally relate to all of it. When I really dig a movie I watch it for the 2nd/3rd/4th time just to see how it's made. And I am now watching it for the 2nd time. It captures I think a large %age of how the population truly works. And I think they did an excellent job of it in it's production... from the script to the acting to the editing and so on.Theoretically this is not a good review compared to others I have seen here that go in depth in a very analytic way. But other than saying that the movie is good at capturing a ""slice of life"" that many guys at least can identify with/relate to, I think you should watch it as a movie that captures what our present day North American mentality and culture is all about. NOT that I believe it is all healthy and good, but it is what it is (our American culture/way of life I mean).WARS have been started over women; men do amazingly crazy dangerous things because they are infatuated by women.

Fun Lead Performances and a Surprisingly Honest Look at an Uncomfortable Subject,"I had seen Don Jon as a rental years ago when it came out but I decided recently to revisit it, it wasn't a HUGE deal when it came out but it was a rom-com that tried to buck the formula a little. Don-Jon wasn't wholly dramatic but it was a ""real"" love story and a movie that put on a rom-com disguise when it was a character piece underneath. Upon rewatching Don Jon, the first thing that struck me was how short the runtime is. It barely reaches an hour and a half with the credits and while I could have watched it for longer, there's something to be said for not lingering or overstaying your welcome. It also feels lean, there isn't much filler or scenes included to pad the runtime. I wouldn't say this is an Oscar calibre directing job but I did leave impressed with the work Gordon-Levitt did as a director. I'm surprised that he didn't get more opportunities or tackle more projects because he does have talent working behind the camera as opposed to just working in front of it.I don't know if I would call Gordon-Levitt and his team ""courageous"" but I do like the fact that he's tackling an addiction story that doesn't often receive media attention or is often hidden behind closed doors on dimly lit computer screens. Make no mistake, porn addiction is a real issue and its not addressed because it can go unnoticed and it has a real slippery slope. I think that porn can be used in a healthy manner and with it becoming more mainstream, it has allowed some people to be more open about their sexuality and feel more comfortable in their own skin. But there's a big difference between a casual user and an addict, Don Jon is definitely in the latter category. Despite his addiction being ""less-serious"" than something like opioids, the movie does present it in an honest way that makes you suitably uncomfortable. Don Jon rationalizes that he's not an ""addict"", he can stop at anytime and he just loves the fantasy that comes with porn as opposed to real sex. While I do think Barbara's reaction to his dirty secret is pretty close-minded, Don obviously needs to re-evaluate and meeting Esther provides the needed perspective change. So, while the movie contains some uncomfortable material, it's needed to show really going on in Don's life and I credit Gordon-Levitt for presenting it to us in a realistic way without being tasteless or gross about it.I've always liked Joseph as an actor and I've always wondered why he didn't follow in the footsteps of leading man types like Ryan Gosling/Bradley Cooper. He's good in this, his character isn't immensely likeable (more on that later) and he plays into that. I sympathized with Jon even though sometimes I was confused why, he's always out for himself first and he isn't above doing some questionable things to get what he wants. Gordon-Levitt seems aware of Jon's rougher edges (he should by the way, he wrote and directed as well) and he plays him in a way that shows his selfishness but he's ignorant of the bigger picture or the larger consequences. He's not the brightest bulb and when he falls for Barbara so hard, he's on her leash and is along for the ride whether he likes it or not. I also like Scarlett Johannson in this, she's the prototype for this kind of character physically and although she could be considered the antagonist, Scarlett doesn't make her vicious or evil. Barbara has already determined where her life is headed (very much into a fantasy realm, just a different one from Jon's) and she knows how to play Jon like a fiddle. Scarlett's performance fleshes her out and makes her an actual character as opposed to just a stereotype manipulative girlfriend. Julianne Moore gets the most interesting character and she's game to play into the initial awkwardness of Esther and Jon's relationship. She rounds out the main cast well and through her chemistry with Joseph, you understand how their growing bond could be enticing to Jon despite his predilections. Tony Danza and Glenne Headly are both fun as Jon's parents. They tiptoe around being stereotypes but their portrayals hit close to home, you've seen marriages that function like this more than a few times. I'd also like to credit Rob Brown for his work as Bobby, despite how surface-level his character seems, he gets a couple of nice moments working with Levitt.I don't have many notes on Don Jon that aren't positive, just a couple of quibbles. Although I liked Jon as a character, he just escapes being a ""bro"" stereotype. He almost hits all the crappy characteristics of this character type and his friends don't get that added level of dimension so they fall into that trap. The movie has to do extra work to make them decent and while Don Jon gets the job done that way, it makes Jon easy to dismiss to less patient viewers. I would also add that while the movie wants to be ""real"" it doesn't hit the 100% real level. I don't want to dock it too much because there's a concerted effort to make a more grounded rom-com which does succeed. But some aspects of Jon's character don't age as gracefully as you would hope. But watching a movie almost 10 years later, you're going to run into that problem almost every time.Even though the appeal may not translate across the board, watching this again, I'm surprised Don Jon didn't go over bigger. It's a pretty progressive movie for the genre despite a few flaws and with a likeable cast and some insightful moments, it's a rare breed of rom-com. It settles in somewhere between an 8-9 for me but I'll stick with an 8. As long as some sexuality in a movie doesn't bother you, Don Jon is still a good movie with some unique angles on a couple of relatable problems that aren't often brought into the public eye.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Miscast,"The topic of porn addiction might be worth exploring in a movie. And certainly writers should be able to generate a few laughs out of it .Oddly the laughs are very few here except those lame ones at the expense of Catholics and Italians (undershirts at dinner really ?). The real problem here is casting .Bluntly Gordon-Levitt is an excellent actor but really doesn't have the drop dead ""look"" to play the super babe magnet of the movie lead. His exchanging glances with the best looking women in the bar and then running to bed with them is pretty much a fairy tale. This is easily explained of course by the director - writer choosing himself for the lead. Then it gets a little worse when about half the movie seems dedicated to loving closeups of the directors favorite actor. A self indulgent waste.

Not worth your time,I felt compelled to review this because it was so bad. Simply put it is quite crude. I was very disappointed because I love the two stars. The story is a shallow look at a guy who is addicted to porn and his revelation when he meets someone he connects with to form a more sensual aspect to his porn. It is about a junior high school level. I almost stopped watching 20 min in because of how crude it was. Do we really need to see snippets of porn to express this guys problem? Did we need such a tragic female to somehow pull hi out of his addiction? No subtlety here.

"This ""rom-com-drama"" fell flat for me despite the gorgeous performers","Let me start this review by saying that I love Julianne Moore, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Scarlett Johansen. As such, I was really looking forward to it, and perhaps that expectation contributed to my ultimate disappointment.Everyone looks gorgeous in this film (special praise for Tony Danza, a 65-year-old with a much younger man's physique: well done!), but apart from that, there isn't much to recommend it. If it's a comedy, we must have missed all the jokes because it just wasn't funny. The ""late '80s North Jersey guido"" stereotypes are all trotted out in quick succession, whereafter viewers are beaten over the head with them. The accents! The muscle cars! The tight clothing! The product-heavy hairstyles! The gratuitous shouting and swearing! The mother who endures it all for the unconditional love of her son! If there were an adaptation for the stage, I bet we'd have been sprayed with Drakkar Noir to complete the feeling.Other points: * The always delightful Julianne Moore is under-used here. * The exploration of a character's addiction to porn is at best a side show.

Middlebrow pap that imbeciles will love,"""Don Jon"" is a dim, irritating procession of clichés marshaled in service of middlebrow assertions and self-serving conclusions. This is a film that states the obvious, ad infinitum, and is quite satisfied with itself for doing so. Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore are lovely, in fine form, and play their parts well. But what maddens here is the script, which never once succeeds in keeping itself from relishing in stating worn-out thoughts everyone has had, and then gloating on how it has whelped what to any sentient, thinking viewer is mere stultification. For some people, the world makes more sense when rendered in cliché, but for a film where masturbation instead of intercourse is a theme, the main masturbators in question are the filmmakers, who never have any sentient, cognitive, contemplative intercourse with viewers.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Unafraid and believable,"Despite one of the most awkward movie openings I've ever been witness to, Jo Levitt's Don Jon hits. It hits hard. With nothing held back, Levitt makes his directorial debut a deeper than realized and very realistic dramatic comedy. The romance is raw and current, not laced with bullshit anecdotes of what love is, and the comedy is natural and situational. Jon Martello, the lead character (also played by Levitt) is a conceded, underemployed womanizer. We watch as he fumbles to decipher relationships amidst the distraction of deceptive devices such as pornography and Romantic Comedy films. The writing (also done by Levitt) very skillfully crafts a cast of authentic characters that aren't exactly bright, or even likable. The film is composed of a few scenes that repeat at different stages of Jon's life during the time of his relationship with Barbara (played by Scarlett Johansson). The scenes are representative of the things he ""really cares about in life"" and how those things change as he wises up on relationships. If a Jersey bartender who works out more than works and is—let's be honest—kind of a douchebag can figure out a little bit about how to love it gives the rest of us some hope.

HK Auteur Review - Don Jon,"Don Jon marks as the debut film of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who is the writer, director and star of the film. What's most praiseworthy about JGL's direction is how he puts the audience into the world view of his lead character Don Jon. It makes a good cinematic explanation of how Don Jon prefers pornography over bedding real women, a character trait that can easily be viewed as unlikeable or disgusting if mishandled. We never really venture outside his world, but yet Don Jon's views seem logical enough to keep the audience invested in what happens to him.Directing duties aside, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's ability to transform himself amazes me. Having seen him in Inception, (500) Days of Summer and The Dark Knight Rises have familiarized me with the sound of his real voice, but I was still astounded by Don Jon's macho New Jersey-accented voice. I was carefully listening to Don Jon's dialogue and couldn't detect any hints of Gordon-Levitt's real voice underneath. It is artfully consistent and was the core element that sold me on the Don Jon character.Scarlett Johansson has been said to be a wooden actress in the past. I think this was probably one of her better performances. This character felt like a real person to me. I have met and dated girls like Barbara. Furthermore, the allure of Scarlett Johansson is cinematically ramped up to eleven. She hasn't been filmed to this level of sexiness since Match Point. For fans of the Black Widow, I'd even argue that this tops that. This is probably more to the credit of the direction. We feel Don Jon's hunger for her. And like Don Jon, she too mesmerized me. And not just cause of her looks. She seemed like the ideal girlfriend at first and couldn't really see her character flaws till late in the film. When I realized her character flaws, I was surprised I didn't see them before. That was a very compelling moment for me in the theater. Honestly, Johansson's character distracted me so much, I would need a second viewing to tell you anything about the Julianne Moore character.Seeing Tony Danza as Don Jon's father Jon Sr. takes me back to my childhood. He was the only man on TV who can make my dad cackle like a fiend in the English language. Danza's presence adds warmth and makes for a convincing father. Brie Larson gets to do a Silent Bob type gag that is quite amusing.The film's brutally truthful display about the realities of men and women as a source for comedy, while handled tastefully with charm by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, hits a little too close to home. I have had discussions like this with a girlfriend similar to the Scarlett Johansson character. It accurately captures why it's hard for men to explain the joys of pornography to the opposite sex. As Louis C.K. once put it, men just need to release so they don't go out and murder somebody. That's really it, but it's not a pleasing satisfying statement to convince a girlfriend with. I'd argue that any girl that needs an explanation wouldn't be convinced anyways because they probably have double standards. The film seems to take the same stance. All that said, the film managed to end on a poignant tender note.In the end, Don Jon is somewhat of an odd animal. I wouldn't personally recommend it as a date movie with your girlfriend, for the very fact that it might just open the awkward discussion of ""How much pornography do you watch?"" with your girlfriend. I still think people should see it as it is a competent debut film.So on a more politically neutral note, I'd say guys would have more fun with it watching it with their guy friends and likewise with girls and their girlfriends. It's probably better to be charmed by it separately than leaving the theater together primed for an awkward argument.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The lack of human bonding,"I do not know much about the technicalities of film making, but I know a lot about what makes humans become what they are and I am often amazed about the insight writers and film makers display through excellent films like Don Jon. The lack of physical bonding between parents and their children younger than twelve, have tragic consequences for those children as adults. Don Jon exposes an example of such consequences: a deep feeling of isolation and an inability to belong to someone.It poses the question: What is a home?

Time and money lost,"A movie for teenage boys who think with their hands. No plot, no sense. One of the worst things I've ever seen. Awful is little. The movie has no beginning, middle or end, Nothing but a heap of rubbish and pornography, simply a bullshit! Looks like one of those fantastic stories, aliens, monsters and ghosts to see how sex is still a huge taboo that generation. But one of the biggest taboo of our society. And what is most frightening is to see that this taboo is not decreasing, but increasing increasingly. I can only believe that actors have taken part in this film for friendship, because the story is bad it hurts, and it's a waste of talent on the scene. Unfortunately the movie is weak, and the end, what's that? Pass away!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A Great Directorial Debut for Joseph Gordon Levitt,","Don Jon is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a brilliant comedic cast that can also be dramatic at times.This film is the directorial debut of Joseph Gordon Levitt,he did a great job and I hope that he makes more movies in the future,it had a lot of heart which I really didn't expect because of its storyline but it was surprisingly sweet as well as very funny.Other cast members such as Scarlett Johansson,Julianne Moore and Tony Danza did a great job,none of them play characters that are anything like what they've done previously.Unique and very funny,Don Jon is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy or romance.A man with an obsession with pornography tries to get over it as he begins a relationship with a woman he feels he really loves.Best Performance: Joseph Gordon Levitt Worst Performance: Jeremy Luke",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a talented man,"This movie deals with a bunch of issues which will more likely than not ring true with guys in their 20s on more than one occasion.JGL has made the movie light-hearted enough to make it entertaining throughout, but not at the expense of the underlying emotional themes or the commendable growth of Jon; which many will be able to relate to, and hopefully, learn from.From the initially egocentric Jon, to the needy and confused Barbara, all the way to the overbearing parents and comical clubbing scenes with mates, this movie hits the right note from scene to scene.After seeing this, I will have my ears firmly perked up in future for projects which involve JGL so heavily, as this fine film does.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointing,"My wife and I went to see Don Jon based on the fact that we both like him as an actor and the premise seemed interesting. I do believe this is a film where the premise failed to live up to expectations. At times I felt like I was watching the same movie about 10 times. Guy picks up girl at a club, sleeps with her, finishes himself off with porn numerous times per week, go to church, is absolved of his sins, and repeats. I suppose that was one of the main purposes of the film, so show a man who is unable to separate what he sees in pornography and what his expectations are of a real relationship. It was just poorly done, and giving this a 4/10 is based on my elation that Tony Danza found work as the title character's foul mouthed father and Scarlett Johansson looking like a knockout for the duration of the flick. I would not suggest checking this one out. Disappointment abound. Hopefully Joseph Gordon-Levitt's next project will be an improvement.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Clever movie that doesn't seems to be it at all at the beginning,"First sorry for my English, it's not my mother language...If he wouldn't show all that porn, we wouldn't get the importance that it takes in his life !

He did everything very fast, driving, eating, his relationships... like he was missing something in his life, but he was just repeating the same routine everyday that makes him feel like he has a normal life !While his friends were approving his way of being and his family and girlfriend always tried to change him in the way they want him to be, someone came and asked him if he is happy with his life... gave him time to discover himself...I like the scene that he is confessing at the church and realize that this is not helping him to move forward and decide to apologize to the concerned person than to the preacher...His life moved on when he begin knowing himself, his fears, his mistakes and accepted them...This movie is not only about porn or immature guys...

"Testing social commentary, but downright hilarious!","Been looking forward to this one. I couldn't put it in any genre other than 'romantic comedy', but its the first movie of that genre I have enjoyed. The subtle commentary on the insanity of 'princess'-type women I thought was hilarious (at one point she tells him to stop talking about cleaning products in the shop, as it isn't 'sexy') and the obsessive nature of the main character (mainly porn) is already amusing which in turn creates many amusing situations that aren't the norm for this sort of movie.It doesn't travel how you think it will, it doesn't end like any other typical romcom, it is intelligent, well-written and acted... plus it is hilarious! This is a very well-rounded movie.On the other side of the pool, I thought there was way too much sex. I get that the movie was largely a commentary on modern women and relationships in modern society, so this was the focus, but c'mon! Considering the main characters attitude to these types of films and his affection for porn, all this suggestive sex seems a tad hypocritical. It is like a concession to the box-office - something for the women? Couples..?Regardless, considering the tone and the ideals of this film are so clear-cut, I can't imagine couples seeing this film and coming out agreeing on all points!! I'd love to hear some of those conversations!!As a single 27-year-old though I found most of this flick hysterical and most of John's comments/interactions throughout are a spot-on depiction of what relationships are really like in this modern society.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Don Jon,"Don Jon, which was written and directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is an acerbic romantic comedy that asks what would happen if two people with completely unrealistic expectations of the opposite sex happened to be in a relationship. Jon, played by Levitt, is someone who lives his life without asking questions, only indulges in what he knows and likes, especially an addiction to internet porn. Oppositely, Scarlett Johansson's Barbara is a girl whose idea of a real man and true love is what she sees in the most saccharine of Hollywood movies. Traits handed down from their parents, it seems, Jon's father played here by a gauche Tony Danza. Jon's walk down the proverbial corridor of life sees him as someone more interested in playing with himself than playing with others, and even when he's joined on that walk by Barbara, his compulsions and her single-mindedness come to drive a wedge between them. The narrative here is fairly simple, however, especially during the first half of the film, in which the usual conventions of romantic comedy are adhered to in spite of the central character's compulsory masturbatory habits. And this makes for a slightly hollow veneer, in my opinion, especially with some horribly outdated and quite banal exchanges in which girls are rated out of ten. Which, had the dialogue and design not seemed so false, it probably wouldn't have been one of many issues I have with this film. Jon's wonderment that he can view porn on his mobile phone also left me bemused at the writing of a film that's nowhere near as sharp as it would like to be. Basically, it doesn't ring true. However, the introduction of a third character, played superbly by Julianne Moore, changes the dynamics of the film. Her ever-excellent screen-presence finds her well cast as a genuinely three- dimensional character with an emotional core. Here is where the best of the film takes hold, and that's also noticeable in how Levitt directs Moore and the scenes in which she appears. Still, I was disappointed with Don Jon, which is tame next to something like Shame, and is more generic than its fledgling director may have desired. But it isn't without interest or merit, given Julianne Moore's performance. But it needed to be smarter, shorter and that bit more daring.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A film exploring themes that are rarely explored even if it isn't overly in depth,"Jon Martello (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a modern day Don Juan who only cares about a few things in his life, his body, his pad, his ride, his family, his church, his boys, his girls, and his porn-especially his porn. One night as he and his friends are scoping out women at the bar, he sees Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johanson), he instantly falls in ""love"" with her and eventually he begins to date her. Barbara is addicted to romantic movies, the ones with unrealistic expectations and just completely distorted related, it is used as a parallel to Jon's porn addiction and works fairly well. Jon continues to be obsessed with his porn as he dates Barbara and she expects too much of him due to the movies she watches. A set-up for failure.Another character Jon meets is Esther (Julianne Moore), he meets her at a weekly night class that Barbara asked him to sign up for. She becomes more prominent and important as the film goes on but to avoid spoilers, I won't go on. The themes of the movie are certainly important and I can't think of many films that have gotten into the depths of pornography addiction or the problem with unrealistic romantic Hollywood movies, so its nice to see. Could the movie have gone a bit more in depth? Yeah probably. But, it still manages to do a nice job of displaying problems that should be displayed.It's entertaining and filled with plenty of comedic moments especially with Jon's narration, which I'm still not a fan of voice-over narration but sometimes there really isn't much of a way to get into the head of this character, so it's a necessary I suppose. In general, I found the movie to be very tasteful and almost pure in a sense. Its one of the few movies were the aspect of love seemed to feel real and genuine, rather than the typical fakeness displayed in plenty of movies which was obviously the point of this film amongst its themes of pornography addiction. Again, it's very much on the lighter side of its themes, it doesn't try to get overly complex but still manages to explore what it needed to well. Overall, it's a good time and I'm a big fan of Joseph Gordon-Levitt as an actor and now as a director as well, I hope to see his career flourish even more.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nobody is likable,"Just finished watching ""Don Jon"" on video. Immediate response is: It's hard to like any of the characters in this movie. That may be because the subject matters. There are several major issues of humanity raised in this film that may be too big for one film. I may be wrong, but I think ""Don Jon"" was meant to compare and contrast the difference between sex and sexuality as perceived through the filters of males and females. Complicated stuff, even without including the differences created/presented by cultural and ethnic social systems (ie, Asian, African, etc.) or environmental (species survival) issues. So, to keep it manageable, I will address ""Don Jon"" only vis. sexual relationships in 21st Century Northern Hemisphere, so-called ""Western"" culture. And I will summarize with a baseball analogy: A quality at-bat, but no better than a sacrifice fly. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, as writer, director and star, deserves kudos for pioneering new territory; Sexuality in the age of Internet Porn. All thinking people recognize that there has long been confusion between sex and romance; ""Don Jon"" is the only film I know of that has attempted to examine how the availability of on-line fantasy fulfillment will affect that confabulation. But it does so in what I regard as too shallow, too cursory, a manner. I also think ""Don Jon"" suffered from overly ambitious casting: I just never believed Scarlett Johansson as a manipulative, sex-as-a-tool Jersey Girl. I kept thinking she was channeling Eliza Dushku and wondering what ""Don Jon"" could have been... But back to (what I believe was) the point of ""Don Jon"": Men and Women value ""sex"" differently. At the risk of seeming simplistic, I think men are instinctively motivated to isolate sex from love while women instinctively understand that men don't recognize their inherent confusion. ""Don Jon,"" to its credit, tries to illustrate this. Unfortunately, it fails in this attempt. If I am allowed, I will quote a statement attributed to Germaine Greer: ""Men will swim across a river of snot if they believe there is friendly p***y on the opposite bank."" This aspect of male behavior, particularly in the age of internet porn, is what I think ""Don Jon"" wants to examine.Oddly, throughout the movie I kept waiting for Brie Larson's character (Monica, Jon's sister) to have an effect on the plot. She did. Brie Larson continued to play the live-action version of Jiminy Cricket she established in ""The United States of Tara"" and ""Scott Pilgrim vs....."" by being the character who ""revealed"" the truth the main character denied. Thank goodness she did it so effectively or ""Don Jon"" would have been a complete waste.The future may regard ""Don Jon"" as prescient, insightful, visionary. It may deserve these descriptors. But that's for the future.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Fantastic!,"Before I start reviewing this film I have to mention that in the film they mentioned pornhub.com as a master porn web page. I choose xhamster.com over it. You porn lovers will love it. It is a king of porn web pages.As far as the film goes this is it! This film goes right into the middle of the issue. THE ISSUE! Men watch porn! That is right in the middle of the men minds. They are fatally attracted to it! And a lot of women for that matter! I really think there is nothing to it. It just happens, and does not affect society for that matter. A lots of people think it matters a lot, but actually it does not.When Holland legalized prostitution in 1960s everyone thought that Dutch society would fall apart. But it did not. Opposite happened! Holland started attracting a lot of tourists. Legal prostitution spread like a wild fire to many nations on Earth, and porn is helping that. In effect I think it has a positive impact on the World. People get together, have sex and are less violent, For example in Holland there is almost no domestic violence. There is significantly less of it then in the societies where prostitution is not legal.To make a long story short, this film is fantastic and answers many questions about porn, sex, and love. It answers questions on societies in general too. It is a MUST see! Please take time to watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Great Romantic Comedy Movie I've ever seen.,"I Love this movie. Joseph Levitt is so cute and rock. I love that the ending of this movie said that, love is not about me or you, but it's about us. How we connected to each other. And that's so sweet. It's me make learned that relationship is a huge thing of our life, we receive and we shall give, that's exactly meaning that if you want your partner to love you then you should love him back, and love itself is not just about sex, it's more than that, it's about understanding each other. Understand that, that's what he or she needs, if you want to stop his bad attitude than you should tell them easily, tell them slowly, and show to them that this is the way to change, so if they change, they will really feel comfortable with change they made. When they feel that, they will be so thankful for you. and this movie deliver this message. And it's about pure love. You're so good Levitt.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A ladies man finds some love and relationship meaning .,"""Don Jon"" is one fun sexy and wild romantic comedy that keeps you entertained and gives you feel good laughs. It's something that many men can relate to and that's being a ladies man when they bed change on a relationship to relationship meeting phase.

Yet none of those hobbies can match his love for online porn viewing and going to bed with beautiful women.

Overrated,"I may miss something here. More than 100 reviews, 7,3 average, described as stellar and hilarious. Is it Italian dubbing's fault? Or American's idea of hilarious? Not really sure but what I found is simply ""genuine"" (like in the poster) foolishness.The first section on Jon's porn philosophy is great and the camera work, the editing, the music just represent it in all its magnificent pride. Then comes Scarlett and the massive editing stops remembering us all what real life is (and how beautiful can be...). Then you forget that it's a film and it becomes a live bad drama-bad comedy-bad docu (some actors were pretty good nonetheless): here you're not interested anymore in the editing and you just wait for something, the climax, the point, a smile... then comes the end.I don't really know if there's a point here. It seems that here we have a docu on porn addiction and sexual issues, a comedy on an ignorant nice guy in love with the most gorgeous girl of the town or a drama on sexual relationships and the balance of power between modern men and women. And I don't like either of them:The docu is superficial. Some good moments with Julienne Moore only. I appreciate the view on Jon's porn philosophy he shared with us in his simplistic style: I find many interesting points of discussion in there and would have appreciated a film ""talking"" about that.The comedy is not hilarious at all. It's a matter of tastes but this is truly bittersweet too much with the church and the family and the friends. Too much to make me something more than smile.The drama is the least engaging and you would even like to see something else instead of Scarlett. Why should be interesting that a guy falls in love for his virtual sex dream without even knowing her, then porn separates them, then you get that some women may behave like b*****s with men without brains and with the sexual life of an orango in heat. So deep and engagin.I think many reviews really overate it by finding something likable in any of the three tracks (Scarlett in the drama of course).Intouchables was hilarious.

Everyone else is just going through the motions of delivering bad dialogue like they know it's bad. Even the writer doesn't seem to believe his own words.Scarlett Johansson is sufficiently irritating as the shallow, self- centered girlfriend, but her performance feels like a performance.

A True Diamond in the Rough but Still a Gem Nonetheless,"Back in early fall 2012 Don Jon released what was probably the best trailer ever made. Unfortunately, the actual film falls short of the perfection of the trailer but its unique, fun and endearing enough to still be a must watch for film-lovers and casual fans alike.Don Jon is funny, truly unique and visually and narratively interesting. Joseph goes above and beyond the typical directing duties and chooses surprisingly insightful camera shots and unique editing that elevates the narrative. In addition the script's midpoint-curveball turns the classic movie love story upside down and gives a fresh take on the genre that takes maximum advantage of the porn vs. romance movies premise.But, on the other, the movie is far from perfect, in fact, it's a bit messy. The writing ranges from absolute brilliance to ""what is going on?"", the editing similarly ranges from dramatically powerful to downright jarring. And worst of all, there are shots in this film that are literally out of focus...So yes, unfortunately the film is plagued with a sense of sloppy amateurism but it is also blessed with moments of brilliant auteurism. And the one thing Don Jon does execute perfectly is showing the world that Joseph Gordon Levitt is an auteur to watch out for in the years to come.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Love JGL, but, man, did I hate his character here","Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes his directorial debut. He's probably the best actor of his generation, and he proves to be more than a competent director, but, I have to admit, I could never get over my initial hatred of his character here. A meathead guido is just never going to do anything other than repulse me. The truth is, this is a film about a jerk who grows into a better person by the end of the movie, but I just could never get over the initial jerkiness. JGL plays a stud who can bed any woman he wants, but he actually finds watching internet porn more stimulating. After an excruciatingly long courting period with his new girlfriend Scarlett Johansson, JGL instantly ruins it when she catches him watching porn. Johansson is good in her role, but she's every bit as despicable as JGL's character. Later in the film, JGL becomes involved with an older student in one of his classes, Julianne Moore, who helps him get over his addiction. Tony Danza is pretty good as JGL's father. Good enough where you can see that one other good role could redeem him as an actor. Brie Larson, who really broke out with Short Term 12 this year, has a Silent Bob-like role as JGL's sister.

"Sharp, focused and not at all blurred: Joseph Gordon-Levitt delivers a clear take on gender roles","Don Jon is the feature film debut from writer/director Joseph Gordon-Levitt. In it, he plays a New Jersey guy named Jon who's addicted to porn, not to mention church, cleaning, road rage and bedding women—the rituals that get him through the week (or day, as the case may be).Jon is sexist, shallow and one-dimensional. So, not surprisingly, he winds up with sexist, shallow and one-dimensional Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), whose addiction to romantic movies feeds her unrealistic expectations of the opposite sex just as much as Jon's addiction to porn feeds his.The relationship plays out as you might expect. And then Jon gets to know Esther (Julianne Moore), who's older and far more self-aware than either Jon or Barbara. She has rituals of her own to get her through the day (to lose herself, as Jon might say). But they don't stop her from trying to make a connection to Jon.There are two reasons I'm writing about Don Jon: First, because it's part of a long line of exceptional work from Gordon-Levitt, and an early indication of what he might become as a director. Second, because, in spite of its focus on porn and countless close-ups of women's bodies, the film offers a welcome counterpart to some of the other pop media out there today—the kind that doesn't bother to show a different angle.I have a particular piece of pop in mind, but I'll get to that a little later. For now, it's first things first.In case it needs to be stated, Gordon-Levitt is a highly prolific and unusually gifted actor. He's been in tons of first-rate films, including Brick, Looper, Inception, 50/50, The Dark Knight Rises and Lincoln.He's also founder of a really cool open-collaborative production company called HITRECORD. They're putting out a slew of fascinating, high quality pieces, including books and even a forthcoming TV show. (Check out this call for artists for a documentary segment on unity.) As a fan of Gordon-Levitt's work, I was eager to see Don Jon. And I wasn't disappointed. Already, with his first feature film, he comes across as an assured director with a strong grasp of visuals and editing. It's not like he's a rookie; he's been on sets for nearly three decades and has already directed several short films. Still, Don Jon is an impressive first feature.I'm looking forward to seeing Gordon-Levitt go further into creating mood through cinematography, and develop more complex story lines. But as it stands, Don Jon presents a lovely character arc, as Jon stumbles through romantic entanglements, and offers poignant observations on how we treat one another and the dangers of falling prey to the influence of popular media.Which brings me to my secondary point. Because Robin Thicke's idiotic song Blurred Lines certainly doesn't deserve to be front and centre. It's the kind of thing I hate so much that I wouldn't normally give it any space on this blog. But it came to mind while I was watching Don Jon, so here it is.I'd heard bits of Blurred Lines on the radio, and let it play because it's catchy. But when the lyrics sank it, even just those approved for the radio stations I listen to, I tuned out; something about wanting a ""good girl"" who still likes to ""get nasty"" was a little off-putting.Then, when the damn thing got stuck in my head again (""'Catchy' is not a redeeming quality,"" says my wise buddy ACR), I looked the lyrics up and was totally appalled. The original version is beyond sexist; it's misogynist and threatening. I'm thinking of one line in particular, but the whole thing is just grotesque. Now when it comes on the radio, I always change the station, never mind how addictive the beat.Anyway, I was really appalled and wanted to see what kind of reaction others were having to Blurred Lines. So I went online and found an interview in which Thicke acknowledges that his song is degrading to women, but says that it's okay because he's married and has respected women all his life. How big of him.If that kind of ""context"" is going to carry any weight, it has to be established within the song. Take Eminem's Love the Way You Lie, a far superior listen; yes, it's got references to violence against women, but its lyrics have a clearly ironic tone. And by including the woman's voice (Rihanna's, no less, a woman who has borne evidence that abuse is no joke), he brings her perspective into it, redefining the lyrics and underscoring the irony.Coming back to Don Jon, I'm not sure exactly at what point in the film I was reminded of Blurred Lines. But when Gordon-Levitt took care to show that people—of both sexes—are more than just their appearance, it made me very grateful that we also have men like him contributing to popular culture. And that he understands the importance of losing yourself with a real-life human being, one you can look at, but also one who is able to really see you.Here's to more insights like these, from Gordon-Levitt and all artists who want to create works that will bring people together, rather than further divide, isolate and objectify.* * * ""You better lose yourself in the music, the moment You better never let it go."" – Eminem, Lose Yourself",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dumb Jon,"So my big takeaway from Don Jon is that when women are nice to your family, ask you to take classes to help your career, perform for you sexually in a way that's pleasing, and watch movies they enjoy, they're being controlling and demanding. I'm sorry but is Scarlett Johansen's character really supposed to be the one we dislike here? This film aimed for something higher but Gordon-Levitt has the most surface level understanding of porn addiction and women. And the fact that the film almost got an NC-17 rating because there was too much porn in it, well, the irony is not lost on me. That being said, this film is hilarious and entertaining in all the wrong ways, hence the generously high rating of three stars. It truly is so misguided despite its intentions that it ends up being super watchable just by how exaggerated it gets. If you want the most uncomfortable laugh of your life, watch this. It legitimately feels like Joseph Gordon-Levitt self insert fanfic.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
I loved this movie until I saw it,"I've been a fan of Joseph Gordon-Levitt since his first recurring role on a series, as David Collins in the prime time revival of Dark Shadows. Although I kind of lost interest in 3rd Rock after the first few years, I was blown away by his fearless, aggressive turn in the 2001 indie Manic. From then on I have avidly anticipated his films and virtually never been disappointed. He seems to be one of the few actors who can slip easily between edgy, quirky character studies and big budget popcorn fare without sacrificing his own unique charm, style and vulnerability.So much so that I almost resisted seeing ""Thanks For Sharing"" last week out of fear that it would compare so unfavorably to this similarly- themed investigation into the thrills and perils of sex addiction. I could not have been more wrong. Whereas Mark Ruffalo delivered a nuanced, engaging and very believable portrayal of a man struggling with his objectification of women and it attendant intimacy issues in that film, JG-L seems here to be engaged in some sort of Funny or Die YouTube parody of Jersey Shore. I'm still reeling a full 24 hours later at not only his lack of understanding or remotest sensitivity for the material, but his complete lack of credibility in the role. He was everything he never is: mannered, stiff (not in a good way) and really kind of vague in his choices. I'll let others complain about the holes in the storytelling, clunky dialog, laughably obtuse attempts at sexual satire and the cartoonish supporting cast (apart from the always ethereal but mostly wasted presence of Julianne Moore).The main takeaway, the one that I find truly mystifying if not downright disturbing is the work of the auteur himself. All I can suggest is that he get himself to the filmic equivalent of a nunnery and stay there in penitent seclusion until he has thoroughly paid for this sin, as well as seriously confronting not only his strengths but also his limitations as an artist. At 10 he was a protégé but at 32 he should be much more prepared before attempting such lofty creative feats lest he end up an overnight cessation.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Confident, stylish, intelligent","Don Jon is a movie of staggering confidence, artistic swagger, and biting humour. It is especially impressive for a directorial debut. Joseph Gordon Levitt's control of tone in the service of an important, carefully observed, and nuanced story is amazing. Note the difference in pace, editing, and camera-work as The title character learns to see sex and relationships in the new light. The actors are universally good, rising above stereotype to deliver performances of deep understanding. Especially notable is Scarlett Johansson who turns out to be a comedian of great precision. There isn't a false note in the whole picture, which is brought in at an admirably concise 87 minutes. Levitt is building a whole career on surprises and daring.

Don is Dumb,"Saw this movie several years ago and all I can say is Don is Dumb. If I had a girlfriend who looked as good as Scarlett Johansen, I would not be going to porn sites to look at other women. If he had to look at other women, then he should have thought to go to history in chrome and clear history. That would have gotten rid of all links to porn sites. Then go to search engine, click once where you type in name to search for, see the list of names you already looked for, find the porn site name from lists of searches & highlight the name. Then hit delete. That gets rid of the name in search engine.

A porn addict advisory film,"I want to start off by saying this film was a failure, from my standpoint, and as such I would have rated it below average. But then I realized how the trailer for the movie was specifically crafted to make you think this is another genre entirely, so I had to punish the grade further. It really gets on my nerves when someone cheats me by letting me think I am getting something else and then giving me anything else.The plot, to make it clear, is that of a lower class guy who is addicted to porn. He meets a girl that he seems to be in love with, one that is the opposite of him, apparently: classy, beautiful, wants him to go to school, get a better job, watch romantic movies, etc. They split up over the porn business and he meets Julianne Moore, who is clearly not scared of nudity, porn or any sexual behaviour, and that cures him of his inability to relate to women.That is the whole plot. It is a philosophical story, one that could have been better made, one that is worth telling, just not by tricking people to come see your movie thinking it's a romantic flick, as the trailer implied. It is NOT a romantic movie. Instead it is one that shows the first girl, Scarlet's character, is just as alienated as the main character, only in a completely different direction, that of the fake romance and perfect life plan. A film that shows that people are never perfect and illusions are fine unless they stop you from living your life (and even then, I would argue, but I am talking about the film).Bottom line: I am sure there could be a better version of this story. As such, it almost feels like an anecdote that one says to a party or one of those awful education advisories children are forced to watch in school. The actors played well, but they just didn't have a good script to work with. One ""gets it"" and the ending is even slightly philosophical, but the presentation is all off.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Must See Joseph Gordon-Levitt Movie,"I've always known about this movie, but pushed it away cause it was about porn and I'm just not a big fan of sex in movies. But Throughout the last couple of years JGL has become one of my favorite actors so I decided to finally give it a chance.I'm so glad I did, this movie is about so much more than just porn it talks about the struggle of addiction to porn and the way it can take over your life and ruin relationships.

Risible drivel,"I think I've used this summary for another of my reviews - but I couldn't think of anything better for this repugnant offering.I don't think I'll be giving anything away by saying that this is about a man who watches porn and his girlfriend doesn't like it... and that's it. Nothing else of interest happens, it isn't funny, it doesn't tackle any pressing conditions of modern man, the script is badly written and it isn't worthy of your time - despite some of the rather bewildering reviews to be found on here.Everything about most of the characters is repulsive - from their accents to their behaviours and their inter-actions with each other.It does raise three questions in my mind however.1. How does this adolescent drivel get made ? Whoever was able to persuade studio executives that this would be an entertaining contribution to the movie world ?2. What possesses previously well established and respected actors to take part ie Johansson and, especially Moore in a film that continues the depiction of women as objects to be conquered by a greasy sleaze-bag in a dodgy nightclub ?3. Who would waste 1 hour 30 minutes (precisely) of their time watching this without wondering why they bothered ?Wrap it up in as much pretentious mush as you like (and critics have) but this is, indeed, risible drivel.For any of you who can't (or don't want to) keep up with the limited activity going on inside the main protagonists' head, his weekly confessions give you a regular handy update....yes really.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

A carefully planned tale of expectations vs reality in terms of sex and relationships,"""Don Jon"" has something to say. Joseph Gordon-Levitt very clearly saw something troubling in the way that pornography and sex in the media has impacted how people think about sex and relationships, and so he decided to write and direct a movie about it.Gordon-Levitt also stars as Jon, the epitome of a New Jersey stereotype, who cares about little else except family, friends, working out, his car and women —women both real and on his computer screen. Jon can land just about any girl he wants, but in his mind, nothing can take the place of Internet pornography. He finally comes face to face with the notion that he has an addiction when he can't shake his need to watch porn despite it being his new girlfriend Barbra's (Scarlett Johansson) number one request.For those curious how what kind of approach the charming leading actor takes behind the camera, Gordon-Levitt loves playing with sequencing in this movie. Jon is a routine guy: go to the club with his guys, make eye contact with a girl, dance with her, take her home, go to church, confess, get road rage, eat with his family, go to the gym, etc. (with porn of course interspersed). Gordon-Levitt ropes us into that routine to best understand Jon and how his lifestyle feeds his addiction subconsciously.The curveball of the film is Julianne Moore's character, Esther. After Barbra coerces Jon into taking night classes, he meets Esther, who catches him watching porn on his phone and proceeds to engage him about it. Her role is meant to break Jon's routine, to challenge his thinking about love and sex. She's not merely a tool to these means — she has her own complexities — but she has a distinct purpose, as with all the characters.Take Brie Larson as Jon's sister, Monica. Every time we see Monica she's staring at her phone and completely unengaged. But an actress like Larson doesn't get cast a screen filler simply meant to show another form of addiction (phone attachment) that's a bit more rampant in society. She's a sleeper character, ready to make a meaningful contribution to the film when you least expect it.Everything is very planned in this movie. You can see the characters and scenes as pieces working together to teach us about the danger of having certain expectations about love and sex based on how it's portrayed in pornography, in romantic movies, the media, etc. You can clearly tell Gordon-Levitt's an intelligent guy and there's something satisfying in the way he so transparently makes a statement with his film.In doing this, however, the film loses its organic energy. The characters feel just a bit less real, the situations a bit contrived and the drama doesn't elicit a lot of emotion. The performances are excellent — good actors are needed to breathe life into characters who were created around ideas — but ""Don Jon"" doesn't hit you anywhere. It's the kind of film that will provoke discussion and appeal to those who enjoy analyzing film, but not necessarily win over folks looking for emotional escapism in their movies.Gordon-Levitt definitely has more directing in his future. He's learned a thing or two from folks like Rian Johnson (""Brick,"" ""Looper"") and Marc Webb (""500 Days of Summer"") about edgy, contemporary filmmaking. He might be better off working from someone else's script, but there's nothing seriously wrong with this debut effort.~Steven CThanks for reading!

The Struggle of Modern Times,"This movie certainly revolved around an interesting topic. Pornography is prevalent throughout society in all forms of media, and it's no surprise that it's one of the most common addictions today. Learning about this movie, I was interested from the beginning since it was a film that tackled a relatively sensitive issue head-on. For this, I congratulate the crew who produced Don Jon, but there were definitely flaws it should have addressed first.The plot was...dull. Man sleeps, cleans his house, goes clubbing, has sex. Then masturbates. Going to Church to repent for sins yet committing the offence is something I agree many in the world do today. I just wish it showed some form of sincere repentance or even just a push to change since it diminishes the whole act. The movie starts to become incredulous here and only becomes more illogical later. Afterwards, the relationships seem a bit too bizarre. The romantic ones do not seem to be anything but physical. It appears the world is full of sex-driven individuals whose only desire is coitus. This version of life just seems so extreme and incongruent with normal society. Even the ties between siblings and parents are distant and it's hard to take this movie seriously when everyone's so detached from each other.With enough will power, stopping anything is possible. To kick an addiction literally overnight, if it is as deeply rooted as depicted in this movie, doesn't seem realistic, though. The overall plot, even little things like dinners with his family, chilling with his friends and just total disregard for his future give me the impression that Jon is a pretty static character who's unwilling to change.The acting itself had to be some of the worst I had personally seen as well. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is one of my favourites, but he disappointed me greatly after Don Jon. The sheer lack of emotions throughout the movie just prevented myself from relating with any aspect of it. I honestly found it a struggle to keep watching since it all just came across as artificial.I can honestly say that my initial excitement quickly disappeared as I realized this movie was just about a man living a hedonistic lifestyle in a self-indulging society.

His only escape,This story is a very oblique approach to reacting to what is expected from people in their lives!What I'm trying to say is that Don lives in a world of 'expectations'. His father expects him to be 'the ladies man'. His mother expects him to marry & settle down to have children because she wants to be a grandmother. His girlfriend expects him to do what she considers 'male' things which does not include domestic duties. His buddies expect him to be 'the big man' and bag a chick every night. And to top it off Don himself expects just going to church and confession makes him OK!His porn is his only time when there are no expectations pulling him in different directions. It's just him being himself with no 'judgement by others' to deal with.Then he meets Esther - and a whole new door to himself opens for him to discover.This is a fine movie with many hidden messages!,9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A film that muddles it's hard hitting commentary on today's culture with stereotypical rom com fluff,"I really wished this would've turned out better. I do. The message it strives to convey is an interesting one on the way people view media, but it unfortunately gets bogged down by corny scenes and underdevelopment.Levitt, in his directorial debut, plays Joe ""Don Jon"", a stereotyped version of a New Jersey boy who, after bedding various one night stands, becomes enchanted by Barbara, played, sigh, by a very weak Scarlett Johansson. What is it about her? Her range is just not there. It always seems half assed and never fully committed to any film she does. And though it's cute that she plays a stereotyped version of a Jersey girl, there's no real emotion there to make me connect with the character, and therefore the film suffers. Joe and Barbara begin a relationship, with Joe modelling his love life after the porn he watches and Barbara after the romantic movies she enjoys. Complications arise when their views collide and cause irreparable harm to their relationship.It spurns Joe to be taught how a relationship truly works by Esther, played by Julianne Moore. The character has a backstory, but there's no real development aside from that. She's just kind of there.But what really makes Don Jon not work is how, while depicting the exaggerated views people hold, they exaggerate the way people from New Jersey act. A lot of residents from the area were offended when they were depicted as, for males, sex addicted, body building tough guys and for females loud, gum smacking, hoop earring wearing divas. It's inaccurate and unfair towards how life really is in New Jersey.I once again assure I liked the message it tried to convey, but it's flaws stand out and become too distracting.Don Jon 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"If you're a guy, watch this alone.","Rarely do I see a movie that makes the unconscious, conscious.Without giving away too much, how many men put on and adopt a mascaline persona, have very unhealthy sexual habbits and have trouble being their authentic self?The film highlights the similarities between male and female selfish behaviours. It asks the viewer to question, what practices do we think are say romantic or harmless, but are actually very self-absorbed or detrimental to the soul and ultimately our own happiness.I'm sure people will give what they perceive as better examples of films that would make you reflect and think more deeply about your own life. But for the average male, I guarantee Joseph Gordon-Levitt's film will make you question and reevaluate your habits and the life you really want to lead, rather than 99% of the typical avant-garde esc films a critc would recommend for the same purpose.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
JGL wasnt ready to write this story,"I appreciate that JGL wanted to tell a story about porn and relationships and the dangers of conflating the two,but unfortunately he wasnt prepared for it. What seems to be the case to me is that he understood the situation of the young machismo male caught up in dating, but his resolution to the story was so lacking, that I have to believe that his life experiences haven't given him something intelligent to say here. I believe that he believes in his story, but he got too ambitious with it and tried to come up with an ending before getting to a place in life where he could understand how a story like this should really end.This leads to a very illogical, and self-refuting conclusion....MINOR SPOILER....the main character comes to the conclusion that you shouldnt look to a young beautiful woman to solve your issues, because that's just expecting someone to fix you. What you should do is find an older experienced woman who can fix you. (I'm putting this in possibly too simple of terms but I dont want to give detailed spoilers) He uses the exact same logic function to resolve the film, that he had just set up and knocked down, in order to get there. Again, I just dont think JGL has a good enough real idea of how these things work, in order to develop a proper ending.In short, this movie is kind of like a young single guy who's never been married telling his married friends how to raise their kids.

The dangers of pornography,"I recently saw Don Jon and had mixed feelings on the movie. While I am somewhat impressed that in our society someone decided to create a film that subtly showed how porn can ruin a man's ability to bond with a woman because it creates unrealistic expectations of women, I think it left out many important aspects of the dangers of porn, including how porn leads to violence against women. The porn is the movie was portrayed as fulfilling to Jon because he got to see people have sex in crazy positions that he didn't get to enjoy in real life. But porn is not just watching people have sex. It typically shows violent sex and portrays a man always in control. It often shows women saying ''no,'' a man forcing himself on her, and the girl then thanking him because she enjoyed herself, which is clearly sending a dangerous message and shows that porn could be a factor is the increasing number of rapes in our society. Other porn shows multiple men violating one girl at the same time. These ideas of violence and domination are influences the men in our society. Porn promotes violence by portraying it as sexy, and while some men think they are immune to the media, they all will be subconsciously influenced and for some, this learned violence can be carried over into their real life sexual interactions. This should have been addressed in the movie, in my opinion. I also think the movie made light of the effects of porn. In the end, it seemed that Jon's porn addiction was cured when he found the right woman for him. But she was not as sexually promiscuous as the women in the porn he was watching, so I do not see how his addiction could have realistically been cured. He still has an image of women that his girlfriend will never live up to. Porn hates men and women. It aims to distort man's image of women so he is incapable of forming a relationship with any woman, which includes the redheaded woman in the end of the movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's very nice to see Glenne Headly playing the mom. She is an under appreciated actress.

"Decent attempt at something offbeat, but not quite there","Don Jon tries to be a typical new age Rom-Com but along a different path.The porn addicted Gordon, is a well written character with tons of background for him to work on, but that is never exploited; and so you're left wondering why all the back stories... Personally, not a Gordon Fan, and I found it difficult to think of the simpleton as a Womanizer. The fit body, the muscle car, and the walk just did not seem enough to change my opinion.Scarlett, puts in a nice performance as the typical modern day demanding Girlfriend, working along the cloaks of a mystery and making you think if there's something more about her.Julianne plays the highly clichéd 'weird gal' and although she fits the part, once again the lack of usage of the back stories hurts the overall character.It's a flick you may wanna watch with your partner, if you wanna bring porn up.

The Don,"What a unique experience. Don Jon explores the life and relationships of a Jersey ""Bro"" who has a strong porn addiction and I really applaud this and Mr. Gordon-Levitt for tackling this subject. Possibly more impressive is the fact that he's just as solid as the titular character as he is behind the screen. We also get another great ScarJo performance, even though I hate her character she plays it great, and an always delightful showing from Moore. It's a very solid drama exploring a very real thing that is oft unexplored.Downside here, and this might just be because of his newness behind the camera, is in the editing on this. There are a lot of little clips and snippets thrown in as transition points or monologue fodder and they just started to feel a bit amateurish after a while. Still, this is a really solid movie and one I think is worth watching. I'd be interested to see how women respond to this though because it is one of the few movies I could see impacting the genders differently.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Heavily flawed, but often very entertaining","Like Michael Fassbender's character in Steve McQueen's excellent Shame (2011), Joseph Gordon-Levitt slick-haired, gym-obsessed meat head Jon spends his entire life thinking about the thing dangling between his legs. Yet where Fassbender in Shame was hooked on discreet and loveless meetings of the flesh, Jon's passion lies in indulging in a different, yet equally soulless, activity - a key modern First World problem - internet porn. It's a racy subject for what is, narratively-speaking, ultimately a traditional rom-com, yet Gordon-Levitt, here directing for the first time, manages to pull off the trick of being both sweet and provocative, regardless of it's many flaws.Jon has a few simple passions in life - his car, his girls, his pad, his family, and his church. Yet none of those can eclipse the wonder of losing himself on the easily accessible world of pixelated pleasure. He goes out with his douchebag friends to clubs and rates women out of ten - ten's being 'a dime'. He regularly bags 8's and 9's and takes them back to his place for what he sees as dull, awkward sex, and can't resist a midnight liaison with his laptop as his weekend prize sleeps in his bed. When he finally meets a dime that steals his heart, Barbara (Scarlett Johansson on impressive form), he vows to change his ways and goes back to school, focusing all his attention on her. Yet regardless of how happy he is, Jon just can't resist having cyber-sex with his computer.Don Jon asks a lot of its audience in that Jon is your atypical boring, conservative narcissist, one of those bronzed 'cheeky' chappies who manage to smile their way out of being an a******e. He redeems himself somewhat by genuinely trying to change for the better, as Barbara's high-maintenance girlfriend demands total dedication. He also redeems himself in the eyes of the Lord (or so he thinks), by frequently going to confession and vocalising his Hail Mary's while pumping iron. I can certainly appreciate Gordon-Levitt's attempt to subvert the clichés of the genre (Jon and Barbara go to see a ridiculously sentimental rom-com starring Channing Tatum and Anne Hathaway), but it does makes the plight and arc of its protagonist somewhat less sympathetic.Suspension of belief is also required, as Jon meets a lonely older lady (Julianne Moore) who teaches him the way of true love and real emotion. It's a sentiment worthy of the countless soppy money-machines it's gently mocking, and leads to an ending so abrupt, it feels like Gordon- Levitt was scratching his head when thinking about how to give closure to the story. Yet Don Jon is often very entertaining, featuring a supremely confident performance by it's lead, and one of Johansson's best roles to date.

Granted, the movie feels a bit derivative when it comes to its screenplay and editing, but it actually helps to draw the attention to the story line. Which was a clever way of reflecting on our societies obsession with unattainable ideals and the objectification of women and to some extend the objectification of men. What I really liked about the movie is that it wasn't just a redemption story, where the viewer is let to believe that change is simply a matter of finding a way to measure up to generally accepted standards. Instead, it shows how change is way more subtle and that the main source of motivation for it has to come from yourself. As mentioned, it also explores the idea that women objectify men in a similar way with Scarlett Johanson's character trying to push Don Jon into becoming someone he isn't. The overall message I took away is that you have to learn to see people for who they are and not for what they should or could be.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

As creepy and disgusting as Gordon-Levitt's character is he's still really likable!,"'DON JON': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes his feature film directorial and writing debut with this romcom/drama film about a New Jersey womanizer who's addicted to porn and lets it get in the way of his relationships with women. Gordon-Levitt also stars in the film as the title character, who's nicknamed 'Don Jon' (after the legendary character Don Juan, from popular literature) due to his ability to 'score' with beautiful woman. Scarlett Johansson co-stars as a beauty he finally tries to settle down with. The film also co-stars Jualianne Moore, Tony Danza, Glenne Headley, Brie Larson and Rob Brown. The movie is a triumph for Gordon-Levitt on all fronts and one of the best romantic comedies this year.Gordon-Levitt plays Jon Martello, a man in his thirties, who lives in Jersey and attends dinners and church weekly with his family. He goes to confession once a week and confesses his weekly sexual experiences every time, which is usually 15 to 25 times masturbating (although his record is ten times in one day) and a couple of times engaging in intercourse with a woman. He's addicted to porn and prefers it to the real thing. He also believes every guy watches and jacks-off to porn every day. This leads him to objectify every women he meets until he encounters Barbara (Johansson) at a bar one night. He believes she's a ten (he and his buddies are always rating women) and the most beautiful woman he's ever seen. He thinks he's in love with her so he pursues a relationship with her and is willing to put off sex (at her insistence), while he tries to win her over, but his porn issues become a problem.There's so many things I liked and loved about this movie. Gordon-Levitt's performance is probably the best part of it (he totally lives and breathes his character in this movie) but his clever and thoughtful script and stylized and effective directing are almost equally as impressive. The rest of the cast is good as well but this movie is all about Gordon-Levitt and should make him a bigger star. The movie is equally funny as heartfelt and as creepy and disgusting as Gordon-Levitt's character is he's still a really likable and lovable guy. I didn't know it was possible to jack-off ten times in one day or an average of 20 times a week, weekly, for that matter (not at 32 years old). I also found it crazy that Gordon-Levitt's character actually prefers watching porn to having sex with real women. As outrageous as it all is it does seem believable in the world of the movie and as perverse as the title character is he does learn from his flaws and grow as a person (and maybe teaches the audience something in the process, even if your problems aren't nearly as extreme). A relationship that develops later in the film is truly beautiful and Johansson makes a great despicable bitch, who does seem true to life (I can think of a few people like her at least). I also really liked the commentary on catholicism and the guilt and relationships with God it brings up, that one has at church (the family stuff was also interesting and entertaining). A nearly great film and about as much as one could possible ask for from Gordon-Levitt as a debut filmmaker!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6PeSUJEcyg",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Original,"I have always liked him as an actor and now see the depth of his talent. I was expecting a better than average romantic comedy, but what I got was a meaningful look at how disconnected and self absorbed relationships have become in our world. From the juxtaposition of porn and the confessional, the big screen television and sister texting at the family meal (yet still being more aware and caring than any other family member), details worked to create a great film.I thought I was going to be entertained for an afternoon, instead I have a new favorite.

JGL as its best!!,"I just came home from the theater where i watched Don Jon. I've been admiring JGL for a long time now, so i might not be impartial about this. I think Don Jon is a movie to see for many reasons: It shows the real life, how jocks and too much romantics girls act together. There is no perfect coincidence, extreme luck, its the real life. All the actors and actress were amazing! I especially loved Julianne Moore's character, her and Joe were the funniest. It is a very good start for his directorial debut, the movie was a bit repetitive at some points, but the story flooded well. I think JGL could of use a bit more help on the writing though, the end of the movie is a bit blurry, i wish there would of been a bigger conclusion. Also, the movie was hilarious, i would of add some more jokes here and there. But trust me, if you love JGL or any of the two girls, you WILL love this movie. Lots of porn in there, you might feel awkward going with your folks lol.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Better than ""Shame""","In what would make an excellent double feature with Steve McQueen's extremely depressing but unfortunately flawed (by way of Carey Mulligan) ""Shame"", ""Don Jon"", an at times equally graphic (just with no full frontal) film (written and directed by and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt) tells the story of a Don Juan-type Jersey boy, named Jon, who states that he only cares about a few things in life; his body, his pad, his ride, his family, his church, his boys, his girls and most of all, his porn. But when he meets the girl of his dreams, played by Scarlett Johansson, who also just happens to absolutely detest pornography, Jon is forced to confront his porn addiction head on.Side Note: While the subject matter of ""Don Jon"" isn't solely fixated on internet porn addiction (it brings up interesting criticisms on everything from sexual images in the media, to the unhealthy nature of the ""chick flick"", to a quite scathing look at how outdated the Catholic church (or any religious institution for that matter) seems to be when it comes to dealing with the young people of today) it mostly is about porn addiction, so viewer beware. This movie earns its R rating.The fact that the trailers make it seem like this is going to be some kind of romantic comedy, is a bit of a misnomer. While ""Don Jon"" does deliver instances of ""funny"", as it moves forward and Levitt's character becomes more realized and less cartoonish, the movie fully abandons the comedic for the serious and quite dark (still, not as dark as ""Shame"", but more than likely darker than a majority of audiences will have expected). ""Don Jon"" is pretty much a movie of two halves. The first, I will refer to as the Scarlett Johansson half, and the second, the Julianne Moore half. The Johansson portion is quite funny and entertaining, as we watch Jon attempt to juggle a girlfriend alongside his ""personal activities"" (basically, everything you see in the trailers). The issue with this half is that it never feels authentic enough to be taken all that seriously. Now, once Moore's character enters the picture, ""Don Jon"" becomes not just a particularly poignant film, but nearly flawless. During this aforementioned ""darker"" (or more dramatic) section, we follow Jon as he discovers the effects of pornography on his intimacy and overall interactions with women. The greatest triumphs to come out of ""Don Jon"", other than a hilarious supporting performance from Tony Danza playing Jon's father, are the long stretches of back-and-forth's between characters. I must praise Levitt for constructing a script full of scary realistic and ultimately award worthy conversational dialogue. On the other hand, Levitt's direction is this films major (and only) flaw. While it's obvious that the abundance of flashy music video-esque editing ploys he uses serve a purpose, it all comes across as a bit too stylized; a kind of, style before substance. Also, many of the activities preformed by the characters are intentionally over-the-top, but are filmed in a very forced and ultimately contrived way, which gets in the way of a rather interesting story. And I won't even mention the rather abrupt ending (oops, I just did).Final Thought: Overall, ""Don Jon"" is one that did surprise me by how much I liked it, in sort of the same way as last year's ""Magic Mike"" had; a movie that I was expecting only vapid-ness from, but got a film full of substance and subtext. No, ""Don Jon"" isn't as good as ""Magic Mike"", but it was better than ""Shame"" and that is saying something for a first time writer/director.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Portrays a strong message about how pornography and romance movies deceive both partners in a relationship,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt excels with his directorial debut and shows that he is equally as strong behind the cameras as he is in front of the cameras. Don Jon is a movie about a New jersey bartender called Jon Martello (Joseph Gordon-Leviit) who portrays a universal image for men as porn lovers. Also starring alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore who give performances just as strong as the main actor.This movie stuck out to me in one major way, the power to portray how both men and women's perceptions of relationships are deceived by porn and romance movies. Men who watch porn expect women to be like the female porn stars they engage so much time into. In this respect, men automatically decide that all females in this world act like porn stars, which is not the case. When their hopes and dreams of a 'perfect' woman turn out to be false they are automatically let down and don't think that woman is for them. The same can be said for women, who expect a relationship with a man to be that from typical romance movies, romantic, perfect and unbreakable. When these standards are not met by the man and woman in a relationship, it breaks down due to the deception from these romance movies and pornography.Overall Don Jon gives a realistic perspective on modern day relationships, with strong acting, directing and narrative on top. Don't be drawn away from this movie because it is cast under romance as it's nothing like the genre it claims to be. Any moviegoer should see this movie, especially with your other partner as it may say a lot about your relationship and provide ways in which you can improve upon it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
JGL's Directing Debut,"I've been a fan of Joseph Gordon Levitt's since the first movie that I saw him in, so naturally I would see his directing debut, despite the subject matter.JGL has written an inventive story that shines light on the expectations that people have when it comes to relationships. Nowadays, everything seems so one-sided. Typically, these expectations come from movies, or books, but the movie mostly focuses on Jon, a porn addicted ladies man.Being his porn addicted self, a lot of pornographic images were shown. Yes I understand why, but it's honestly just not my thing.Besides that point, I really thought the movie was quite excellent. JGL's directing is quite wonderful. A lot of the events were told in the same kind of scenes, as if they were on a conveyor belt, bound to come around again, always with something changed.All in all, JGL really outdid himself.

Rather Impressive Directorial Debut!,"Don Jon, the directorial debut of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is a rather impressive look on the issue of porn and how it can destroy (or even create) relationships. The movie does have a few flaws whether it was the unlikable main character or how the movie feels repetitive at times, but on the whole it was a good film with good themes. The movie is not just about porn, but it is about sensitivity, addiction, and finding love.Levitt's film is about a man named Jon Martello who has a rather unhealthy appetite for porn. He lives life to a very strict routine whether that is going to church, being with his family, or just watching porn. But when he meets the most beautiful girl in the world named Barbara, his private world and public world are bound to collide.The acting is pretty impressive. Levitt holds his own as Jon, but did I ever find his character repugnant and plain unlikeable, perhaps even narcissistic at times. But maybe that was the point. Scarlett Johannsson is just a film goddess and her beauty still shines like an angel in the film, but her acting skills are just as impressive. Julianne Moore does a good job as Jon's college friend. Finally, I have to give props to Brie Larson. She is mute for most of the film, but when she finally says something, that is the best moment of the film.Overall, Don Jon was an interesting movie to watch. I'm surprised it did not receive an NC-17 rating especially how the movie is very sexually explicit. While it may be about a porn addiction on the outside, the deeper theme is about finding love. The movie is meant to be a comedy, but I viewed it more as a drama. I did chuckle a few times though. I liked how they spoof New Jersey accents and our driving skills. As a resident of NJ, I found this to be accurate. But all things said, the film is a nice directorial debut for Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Satisfying but not completely orgasmic,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt's ""Don Jon"" is a bit self-absorbed, but it still delivers the goods as an enjoyable entertainment fare. Gordon-Levitt stars as Jon, a New Jersey Guido-like ladies' man who is addicted to pornography; but still manages to be devoted to his church & family. His friends and hooking up with the ladies also play instrumental to his life, but unfortunately Jon needs to be ""born again"" instead of ""porn again"". His pornography addiction does get out of hand; sort of speak. Jon does hook up with a sexbomb Guidoette in the voluptuous Barbara Sugarman. I guess his ""searching for Sugarman"" was a sweet find. Barbara is a chick-flick lover, but not the same type of ""chick flicks"" that Jon logs on to. Jon also befriends an older night school peer in the depressed Esther who plays vital in his development. ""Don Jon"" is Gordon-Levitt's baby, as he also wrote and directed the flick. His head- on direction and humorous screenplay did come with the goods, but the egoism behind most of his characters was a bit of a turn off. Gordon- Levitt's starring performance as Jon was solid but not spectacular. Scarlett Johansson was exquisite & debonair in her performance as Barbara, and Julianne Moore was great as always in her work as Esther. However, my favorite performance of ""Don Jon"" was of Tony Danza who was a scene-stealer as Jon's vociferous father Jon Sr. Tony showed that he was the boss in the film's family dinner scenes who Gordon-Levitt also presented them in homage to the similar themed scenes in ""Saturday Night Fever"". I will not reveal if ""Don Jon"" has a happy ending because that would be cinematically criminal. But I will reveal that you will feel most satisfied seeing this movie into its final climax. **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great director debut,"I've always like JGL as an actor, so I was quite looking forward to ""Don Jon"".

Plus he really has the whole New Jersey kinda-macho character down! The supporting actors were great too, some of them deliciously annoying (I'm looking at you, Scarlett Johansson! Quality acting on her part), and some of them quite attaching. Anyway, what I liked about too is, although porn is an important part of the plot, the sexual scenes are not too-much, too Hollywoody; they feel natural and touching.

It is totally normal to watch porn once a day, is it our is that what we want to believe? It's normal that people starve while we get fat, is it? Or does it fit in to our perceptive of normality. Many parallels, more meaning. If it was as superficial as some people have taken it than it would have touched on the subject of pregnancy.

Spunky satire about the male tug of love.,"This dynamic new dramedy is a sensational writing and directing debut by the irrepressible Mr JGL. What a presence and what a star he is from this film. I actually felt it an update or a remake of Saturday NIGHT FEVER but smaller scale and crossing much of the same male ego and sexually provocative territory. But updated with new century chrome slickness and filth. It is a good film. Great casting, especially with Tony Danza and young Scarlett, always game for a smutty drama, and here being the emotionally manipulative GF to JGL's ego bastard. Then along comes some mature mind-sex leading into the proper emotion of the story. Clocking in at a slim but sturdy 85 minutes and with far too much product placement including the porn site which actually exists like an 85 minute ad for them, DON JON is fast and furious phallusy entertainment. Unreleased in cinemas in Australia because of the porn advertising site so vigorously displayed, DON JON was no crowd puller at the box office but is a firm favorite on the couch at home.

A good watch that makes you explore,"I'm a woman and I think this movie deserves more stars than it got on here. I gave it an 8. It takes an objective look at the relationship between a person and porn. Porn can indeed be an addiction. It's just like smoking when you want to feel good- once you're used to it, you can't give it up even if it affects your relationships.I don't think porn is ultimately bad, neither does this movie probably. The movie does make a point that good sex brought by a good relationship can be much better than porn and can replace porn...It depends on how you think about it: The main character likes porn more than real sex. Is that a problem, a bad thing? This movie takes a side slightly saying yes, but it doesn't push it down your throat. You can explore.Overall, I liked the movie. It made me think about this whole porn thing and expectations from sex in general. Joseph Gordon-Lewitt did a nice job, so did Scarlett Johansson. You can watch Scarlett here acting as a slightly vicious character and that's a change. Julianne Moore did great as the older woman who is troubled but charming. A good watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

This film should be used for educational purposes for young people! I've seen testimonials from a number of parents watching this together with their children, helping to form a healthy view of sex and love.When regarding the more cinematic/acting aspects, I do agree that it is not the best film of recent years, but the plot, characters and message that it sends makes it a well spent hour and a half.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Two words Julianne Moore,I didn't really like this movie . I don't really like Scarlett the actress or the character she played. She's every male's worse nightmare. Julianne Moore as a person actress model a gorgeous red woman. I first saw her in Boogie Nights. And here is the truth. There was a girl I graduated with that while in HS looked like Julianne Moore and just sparked like her and became the woman like Scarlett died her hair blonde married some bloated unattractive rich guy.. And crushed me or the fantasy. But she was my inspiration when I realized who Julianne represented. But Julianne especially if you look her name up and click images... There's 1000 of photos and every photo of her sparkles . She is the woman I'm waiting for not the real Julianne but someone that looks exact like just everything about her represents color beauty and more of all purity. I just turned 53 and I tend to like male character who I despised ... But what I realize is I spent my whole life wasting it on adult stuff started when I was a child lusting after actresses and singes and models then in the 1980's when video tapes came around and that could rent that happened..Which when DVD and then the internet happened it became a nightmare... And when I would watch on of these billions of this stinkin square icons on millions of these sites one thing that it did do was cause depression a bad self image of myself hatred for myself and those video sites and the people in those video sites. And like 53 years old the oldest virgin in the world. And I knew this earlier on that when I made money it didn't go on so much visual material it went on worse horrible women who get paid for it ... Which I stopped that also because it killed what was once the thrill and turned not really a video watcher or anything just someone who hates himself but is wanting needing almost to the point of taking my own life because I can't have. Someone like Julianne Moore. There's no happy ending to this and I feel alone on the planet ... Thank God life does end . So it will end my pain. God bless Julianne Moore for making me believe that purity exists but you end dying alone for it.,8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Secret is Revealed,"I must say it is a sensitive topic but the way it is represented in this movie is awsum.I really enjoyed Don Jon. It strikes as a solid balance between art and entertainment, it's filled with lots of laughs and it touches on a sensitive topic in a way that doesn't seem preachy. The ending is a little weak, but everything up until that is golden. However, I'm not sure if it's what one would call a date movie, since it will probably lead to inquisitive stares during a quiet car ride home afterward. And honestly, that's really too bad. For the people that are willing to embrace the fact that everyone looks at porn, this movie is well worth the price of admission.

Absolutely love how accurately addiction is portrayed in this movie (albeit porn addiction, addiction is still addiction). Very well written, the movie gets to the point and doesn't drag or bore with scenes that aren't necessary. The actors do a tremendous job in their respective roles, and the movie itself is more of a lifelike portrayal, rather than silly and ridiculous. It has just the right blend of comedic and dramatic moments. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did his research and did a great job. Throughout the movie I was unsure of how it would end, which is pretty awesome considering I can usually predict the end of a movie in the first ten minutes of watching it.

Loved it,"I really like this movie, in seemingly simple way and with easy story it opened so many questions and stereotypes. I'd recommend it to everyone, it's actually hilarious how 'deep' this movie is, which I'd never guess by looking at the title. So many things touched with it, Italian community and their family, strings between family members and roles they act on, approach to religion and growth through experience, obsession with porn and young people's unrealistic expectations of sex, modern society and promiscuity, relationships and so much more. Not sure how I'd classify it, it has some drama, romance, you can laugh at it but it's definitely not comedy. If you don't read reviews or don't care who's directed it like me, and you can see deeper meaning beside shallow, two dimensional thing that are so common now you'll find it refreshing and exceptional, just let movie take you and judge t by what you see. And acting was really good. So watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A vibrant movie with genuine message!!!!!!,"Jon Martello (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a strong, handsome, good old fashioned guy. His buddies call him Don Jon due to his ability to ""pull"" a different woman every weekend, but even the finest fling doesn't compare to the bliss he finds alone in front of the computer watching pornography. Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson) is a bright, beautiful, good old fashioned girl. Raised on romantic Hollywood movies, she's determined to find her Prince Charming and ride off into the sunset. Wrestling with good old fashioned expectations of the opposite sex, Jon and Barbara struggle against a media culture full of false fantasies to try and find true intimacy in this unexpected comedy written and directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not what I expected. Much better, actually!","Okay, so my high rating reflects the fact that this is a strong directorial debut from Joseph Gordon-Levitt. This guy has just been knocking it out of the park with his transition from child star to adult actor and now director, and isn't it nice to see someone do that with such grace? Don Jon is not a perfect movie, but it certainly surprised me with its polish and seriousness. JGL could have gone for a much broader comedic performance and more ephemeral theme, but instead he delivers an interesting meditation on internet porn, dating, bro culture, addiction, religion, etc. This is not a throwaway romantic comedy, and for that I was very grateful.I also don't agree with the sentiments of those who found the message and delivery heavy handed. I thought the style suited the subject matter and accurately reflected our modern internet culture. To dismiss it as gratuitous might say more about a reviewer's mindset than the movie itself. It's not a movie suitable for kids or the prudish, but everyone else should be able to appreciate it. There is no offense intended, nor should any be taken. Folks, lighten up and enjoy this movie for what it is.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Had never seen it...,"I watched this for the first time nearly 10 years after it's release and I have been missing out on a surprisingly lighthearted rom-dramady (if that exists). It's equal parts comical satire, adorable, albeit sex-focused romance, and dramatic exploration into self discovery of sexual preference and interest. Would highly recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
the most under-rated movie ever...,"The movie is a master piece made by (to my surprise) Joseph Gordon- Levitt. It's the most perfect movie which depicts the life of most of the people in today's world. The most satisfying for me was the length and ending of the movie. If the movie have been any minute longer then maybe it will be not perfect for me, but it was perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful,"I have loved JGL from my first view of him on Third Rock From the Sun. ""This planet both sucks and blows!"" Then, I caught ""Mysterious Skin"" which was amazing but I won't recommend because it's a difficult film to watch. He made the lightweight 500 Days which I enjoyed. He was in a few blockbusters and I enjoyed seeing him in every one.But then he did 50/50 which I loved. And now Don Jon which I will watch several times to witness the character development and the changes that each goes through. I can't say enough about the performances of Julianne Moore.And Brie Larson! Love her from United States of Tara. The entire cast was pitch perfect. You will enjoy it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
#HotGuyProbz,"#HotGuyProbz could be a fitting alternate title to Don Jon, a film that examines a man's complaints about his favorite hobby. Younger men often acquire a reputation of being sex- craving animals. The topic of pornography is on display as blatantly as Mr. Levitt can possibly make it. There's sex, there's boobs, there's Scarlett Johansson's voluptuous figure (Johansson is the Marilyn Monroe of our generation).Levitt's directorial work is focused and carefully executed, while his screenplay is a fun little vehicle. Together those aspects create a mature film about masturbating if there ever was one. The stylized ""man dream"" and use of repetition grows tiresome by the conclusion, but you'll be glad you saw the film for its honesty about sex. Mr. Levitt comforts women wanting mature men by telling them that men are capable of growing up and have the ability to love the way they want them to with a little guidance.The cast ensemble is outstanding. Taking the lead role, Levitt acts with great ease and the slickness we know he's capable of. Tony Danza gets a few scenes, which he uses to his make his character wildly memorable. Julianne Moore elevates any film she signs onto, no different here. She's an ally to Mr. Levitt's film; however, at times she is not as quirky as the character is meant to feel. The bulk of Moore's scenes take place as soon as Johansson exits the picture, which may explain my ""friendly-from-a-distance"" response to Moore.The film's brightest and most clear star is Scarlett Johansson. Her casting in a selection of her previous films can be thanked to her beauty and sexual aura, not because Johansson was the best choice for the role. Consequently, she often is bland, but here she couldn't be more fresh. She mixes up her usual laid-back beat and jumps on her character with a hilarious accent and embodying the shady side of Barbara's psyche. It's her best performance and may be the reason the film signals a depression once she is no longer predominate to the plot.Grade: B+Rating: 7",,Anonymous,Romance
Pretty good,"I have to start off by saying that I'm not a Gordon-Levitt fan at all. He was decent in 500 Days of Summer, but in everything else I've seen him in since then I've just been so bored and unmoved by him. With that out of he way... this is easily his best performance, from what I've seen. He nails the accent, the character completely, shedding any previous notion I had that he didn't have much range. He's just fantastic in this, and I wish he was in more talks for an Oscar nomination. The rest of the cast is also really great, hilarious. Johansson I've also had problems with in the past, although with her it's more mixed. Here, she's fantastic, probably the best acting I've seen her do (and yes, I've seen Lost in Translation... I will never get the love for her and the film). I give props to Levitt for coming up with a pretty bold subject to base his film across, and although it gets formulaic in terms of narrative and structure, it still works very well.",,Anonymous,Romance
subject that isn't easy,"I recently watched the movie that tackled a sensitive topic - porn addiction. The film seemed to be aimed at individuals who were struggling with this addiction, regardless of their gender. However, I couldn't help but feel that Joseph Gordon-Levitt's portrayal of justice was a little lackluster. To me, it seemed like the movie was trying too hard to be dramatic, rather than focusing on the real-life struggles that individuals face when dealing with addiction.That being said, I appreciate that the film shed light on an important topic. The history of pornography spans back hundreds of thousands of years, and it's an issue that deserves attention. While some viewers may have preferred a different actor for the lead role, the fact that the movie was made at all is a step in the right direction.Overall, I felt that the movie was a wasted opportunity to address a serious topic in a meaningful way. Instead, it came across as a tacky rendition that missed the mark. I hope that future films will take a more nuanced approach to sensitive topics like this.",,Anonymous,Romance
Come on ahaha,"I don't think it's a proper film, I'm only sorry for Scarlett who is a great actress and this film certainly doesn't make her a good resume. I give 1 because I don't really recommend it as a movie.",,Anonymous,Romance
