"""One of the best movies of 2008""","F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' has been transformed into a splendid film by David Fincher. A marvelously made film, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is one of the best movies of 2008. The cast is terrific and director David Fincher beautifully puts together the tale of Benjamin's life. The only large flaw many will find is that the concept of the film's premise seems too unrealistic.The film tells the life of Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt). Born as an old man, Benjamin ages backwards; gradually getting younger as those around him age normally. Benjamin is abandoned at birth and picked up at an old-age home. As a child - or rather as a hunched over 80 year old - he meets a girl named Daisy (Cate Blanchett). Together they engage in innocent child games, and through this they develop a special connection. As Benjamin goes off into the world, Daisy continues to grow up, later pursuing her dream of dancing. Benjamin joins a crew and sails round the world, ending up in Russia. Then, after Pearl Harbor, Benjamin joins in the war effort, following battles across the north Pacific and only engaging in one combat situation.Returning to New Orleans, Benjamin has grown taller, lost many of his wrinkles, and grown more hair. The visual effects are spectacular in following Brad Pitt through the various stages of his life. From an old man to a young teen, Benjamin always resembles Pitt. Upon arrival in his childhood home, Benjamin learns that many of the tenants he knew have passed on. This is the tragedy of aging backwards, those you knew continue to age forward as they exit this world while you do the opposite. Benjamin also meets Daisy again, who after many years has become a successful dancer and has blossomed into a beautiful young woman. Long gone is the innocence of childhood, and Daisy has become intimate with many men in New York City. Missing by an inch, she and Benjamin do not initiate a relationship until later in the film.Narrated from the present, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button starts with Daisy's daughter reading Benjamin's diary to her mother in a hospital on the cusp of Hurricane Katrina. This allows the narration to occasionally halt for an elderly Daisy to comment on events of her life. A key motif running throughout this film is time. Beginning and ending with sequences about the same clock, David Fincher seems to allude to the notion that things fade, and that we must hold on to the things we love in the time we have with them.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a fantastic film. Beautifully created, David Fincher paints an image of the south of the United States in the early 1900s which seems both realistic and fantastical. The film also illustrates war, travel, death, and many of the other events of life. Brad Pitt shows emotional depth as Benjamin, and Cate Blanchett is terrific as Daisy. It is surprising how much we can take away from a 166 minute movie, the audience feels as if they have known Benjamin and Daisy for all of their lives. While some may question the premise of the film, arguing that time is linear and that the plot is therefore incoherent, there can be no arguing that this film does its best to develop human relationships and to establish emotional connections between characters. As Roger Ebert once said, ""A film is not about its subject; it's about how it's about its subject"", and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button certainly handles its subject material splendidly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"Sort of like ""Forrest Gump"" run in reverse and without the laughs.","""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" sure got a lot of attention when it came out in 2008. It got so much attention that it received three Oscars and is ranked in the IMDb Top 250--currently at #247. And, as a result, when I finally got around to seeing it, my expectations were way, way too high. I was expecting too much, I am sure, as it's hard for a film to live up to all this hoopla. Now if I look at the film and try to ignore all these ridiculously high expectations, I see that it is indeed an exceptional film...but perhaps not quite the 'must-see' that I thought it was. I can't put my finger on it...it just didn't seem like a film a cinema freak must watch...though it was a nice, gentle viewing experience. And, after seeing this and ""Slumdog Millionaire"", I can see why ""Benjamin Button"" didn't capture the Best Picture Oscar.Probably the best way to describe this film is like ""Forrest Gump"" run in reverse...and without the laughs or meetings with presidents and all the celebrity status. That's because although Benjamin SHOULD be world famous for being the only person to ever live life backwards, curiously he isn't and people seem to almost take it in stride. In addition, and this part DID bother me, everyone's performance seemed way, way, way too restrained. There were very, very few emotional highs in the film--and even those were curiously subdued. To me, that's what's curious about this ""Curious Case""---why such an excellent film pulled its emotional punches throughout the film. As a result, when it should have been exciting, it wasn't...or not nearly enough. Still, it's well worth seeing...it has some lovely romantic elements and is a sweet film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
not much to say,"I don't have too much to say about this film, except that it was one of the most beautiful, touching, poignant, and bittersweet films I have ever seen.Benjamin Button lives his life in reverse. Despite this, it's a great life, full of adventure and love and learning. He finds out that no matter what, it's the people who make life so special.The film is beautifully photographed and true to the periods it represents.Brad Pitt is fantastic, and those CGI and makeup techniques for him and the rest of the cast are marvelous. It's a tribute to the film that it's very organic to the cast so we are not aware of makeup and CGI. Cate Blanchett is incredible; she is a dying, old woman in the beginning and gives a tremendous performance.We're born helpless and without life memories, and some of us die that way. In a way, I guess, it doesn't matter if you're born old or die old - it's like Benjamin tells Cate Blanchett in the film, you'd still end up where you are now. The life experience, the people you meet, the wisdom you acquire, all happens -- and it happened to Benjamin at a time when he could really value it. But as he points out: ""For what it's worth: it's never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. There's no time limit, stop whenever you want. You can change or stay the same, there are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
An Astonishing Rarity,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film unlike any I've ever seen and probably ever will. A true epic that left me utterly speechless. It accomplished so much through such simplicity. Everything was top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score. The film demands you to feel not only for the death we witness, but for the incredible life we discover. It prays on the obvious morality issues we all deal with but also dangles the idea in front of us that everyone goes through the same joys and grievances, just not in the same way. This is a momentous tale that deserves nothing less than the title of brilliance.This visually and emotionally rich movie recalls the life of a very peculiar man born in the early 20th century who ages backwards. His tale unfolds through a diary read by the daughter of his love, Daisy. Throughout life he goes through the same things we do, growing up and eventually growing old. He's a thoughtful observer, discovering life from all different angles. But it is not his life that makes him unique. His love is what makes him special. He spends a lifetime trying to understand how his love for Daisy works and still only gets a few incredible years really loving her. As their lives tell us, the years of frustration and hardship are all worth it if only for a few moments of happiness.The direction in the film is almost flawless. Hopefully, Benjamin Button will garner David Fincher the recognition he deserves. He winds this clock so well and with such grace that the movie has this undeniable flow that is enjoyable from start to finish. At nearly 3 hours, there is not a minute wasted. Every shot is jaw dropping and while some will find issue with the time, it is used wisely.The acting is also a thing of wonder. This is by far Brad Pitt's best performance. He is so believable and realistic throughout. His nuances are spot on and despite the heavy use of make-up and CGI used to portray his character, it is Pitt who makes Benjamin that much more curious.I left the theater astonished that some one could review this movie badly. It is an extremely graceful depiction of life, love, and the things we lose. After so much anticipation I was certainly not disappointed. This movie is probably not for everyone though. It's not your average drama that spoon feeds it's audience their emotions. It is something of awe and astonishment, an absolute gem. What makes our lives memorable are the moments we never seem to grasp long enough before letting go. Life in itself is indeed very, very curious and Benjamin Button is no less of a wonder.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
A Memorable One,"I always get a teary eyed when watching this movie. It always leave a different moral lesson after finishing it. I have no idea why this movie keeps getting better as you get older - until recently where I realized this movie has a way of showing you the right path when you lost your way; motivates you when you are down; accompanies you when you are alone; reminds you to appreciate what you have and not to take things for granted; cheers you up when you're feeling blue; gives you hope when all seems lost. If I were given the opportunity to write my own dictionary, this movie is the definition of perfection. This movie deserved to have a rating of at least 9.0 and it is quite rare for me to review a movie - let alone expressing my feelings in public, hell I have never done it until now. This movie really has earned a place in my heart. I will forever cherish this movie and will watch it to my children and theirs. I hope you guys do too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"A truly haunting, moving, and fascinating film.","Brad Pitt makes his mark as an actor here as Benjamin Button, a man with a strange disorder - physically aging backwards. Along his emotional journey of life he encounters friends, family, loved ones, adventures, and most of all, chances.Rarely has a film keeps the realism intact while still sustaining the magic of it. Truly, David Fincher and Pitt have created a film that is leaps and bounds ahead of its time. Taking a strange and fascinating tale and making it into one of the decade's very best films is something of an accomplishment.Pitt, here, is an actor, not just a pretty face anymore. With the state-of-the-art visual effects at his hand, he pretty much carries the whole show. It is perhaps the first time since Andy Serkis' rendition of Gollum in The Lord of the Rings, that great acting has eclipsed terrific special effects. You genuinely feel and sympathize for his character, rooting for him all the way. Pitt owns the film, in short. He and David Fincher make a great team, and they look unstoppable to create more terrific films.For the supporting cast, Cate Blanchett plays the love interest of Daisy to great effect. Her tale with Benjamin's make them somewhat star-crossed lovers. I won't go that far into detail but you'll see much later into the film. Taraji P. Henson also shines as Benjamin's surrogate mother, who gives her son the support he needs. Not to mention Tilda Swinton as an early love interest.The screenplay by Eric Roth is excellent. Told from Benjamin's point of view with some highlights by Daisy, there are no clichéd dialogs to be heard, and the script is filled with equal moments of joy, ecstasy, sorrow, and understanding. Some dialog here is timeless and quotable, such as the film's tag-line; ""We are defined by opportunities, even by the ones we miss."" When you age backwards, you get more chances rather than missing it. I love that and wish for it, but sadly that is what movies are made for. And if that is what you've been thinking after or during your viewing of this film, then this film has succeeded.David Fincher is a tour-de-force of film-making. Straying away from gritty violent thrillers such as ""Zodiac"", the unmatched ""Fight Club"", and ""Se7en"", he takes a bizarre love story, the most expensive budget he's faced, and crafts a film with such substance and flair that he adds quality to the film. There are moments in the film which make it obvious Fincher is calling the shots. The paced is slow, but this allows us to absorb and be infatuated with the characters. There is not one dull moment in the film. It is constantly gripping and re-watchable.Technically speaking, the cinematography and lighting is absolutely perfect; gorgeous to the eyes and senses, and while giving the right tone and feel to the film shows us director Fincher's trademark. Accompanying this is the beautiful and heart-wrenching score by Alexandre Desplat, which is absolutely flawless. The special effects are unique and well-made, and you'll find yourself confused to whether certain scenes were made with special effects or not. If you want to see actors when they were young this is the best rendition of effects possible, and I hope the future movies use more of this amazing technology to make their stars more bankable. The special effects deserve their Oscar for it is the best I've seen in any movie in 2008.In short, it is a beautiful, tragic, and terrific movie. It is certainly timeless and will stand the test of time, and hopefully, age well like fine wine (no pun intended). This absolute gem deserves the nominations it gets, too bad it was released the same year as Slumdog Millionaire.Overall rating: 9/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
It's a Wonderful Life,"Before seeing The Curious Case of Benjamin Button I wondered how I would react to the story of a man who is born old and gets younger as he grows up. Of all of the stories I have come across, this is by far the most bizarre and intriguing. If i had to pick someone to bring this story to the screen I do no think David Fincher would have been my first choice.How wrong I would have been. This film is by far one of the best if not the best of 2008. Fincher's direction is flawless! The film from start to finish does not let up. There are moments of joy and ecstasy followed by sorrow and understanding. Brad Pitt stars as Benjamin, a boy born an old man who must live his life in reverse. His friend from childhood, Daisy, is played by Cate Blanchett. The story is narrated from Benjamin's point of view with some particular highlights from Daisy.The cast does nothing wrong. Pitt leads with Blanchett and a strong performance from Taraji P. Henson as Benjamin's surrogate mother Queenie, the only person in the world who seems to understand and truly love him from the start. Other cameos along the way bring a large array of characters, including Tilda Swinton, one of Benjamin's early love interests.The film spans from the end of World War I to the the arrival of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. The transitions from life stage to life stage and decade to decade are seamless. Fincher does a tremendous job at maintaining a steady flow of action and dialogue. There is not a dull moment in the film. The cinematography is superb and couples nicely with Fincher's style of accentuating certain colors to enhance a mood or moment.There really is nothing wrong with this film. Even with a runtime of about 160 minutes, time just flies by, much like it does for Benjamin, only we are going forward. This is a tender and meaningful film you do not want to wish.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"He ""Youthens""","Other than F. Scott Fitzgerald's vivid description of how Benjamin Button has reversed the aging process in his life, there is nothing of his the plot of his story. But the idea behind the updated version is as vivid as when he put it to paper.When Fitzgerald published the story it was 1927 probably at the height of the jazz age and his creative powers. As he wrote it, Bnejamin Button was born after the Civil War and lived through World War I. But he lived backwards as it were. In Camelot, King Arthur describes Merlin as not aging, but that he 'youthens'. That coined word describes just what happens to Benjamin.When he's born he comes out of the womb a little old man, something like you might imagine Yoda if you can ever imagine him as a child. With all the usual problems of old age. But as he grows older chronologically, Benjamin loses all those infirmities gradually and gets younger and younger. Several actors play him before he finally morphs into Brad Pitt.Which makes the achievement of director David Fancher all the more impressive. Although Brad Pitt was recognized with an Oscar nomination for Best Actor, the directing of several others almost in tandem to play the same role at different stages is a great achievement. Too bad he didn't get the Oscar for that alone although Fancher was nominated also.In fact The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button got a flock of Oscar nominations including Best Picture as well as those mentioned. It won for Art&Set Direction, Visual Effects, and in fact if it hadn't won for makeup the Oscars should have been picketted that year.Taraji Henson was also nominated for Best Supporting Actress. When Benjamin is born and his mother dies giving him birth and his father abandons him, the caregiver who is black takes him in to raise in her large and extended family. Given both his physical condition and the circumstances of his childhood, Benjamin had one unique perspective on life indeed. Henson is nothing short of fabulous in her portrayal.Cate Blanchett who was overlooked in the Oscars for this role plays the woman whom he loves, but who is working her way up in physical age while Pitt is working down. The film is seen from both her's and his perspective as she tells her daughter to read from this diary that Benjamin kept. When they met at the middle though as Benjamin ran the bases backward through life, there love was real and really physical.The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button is a remarkable achievement that gave some career roles to some fine players.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Coldness and Warmth,"Technically, like most of Davin Fincher's movies, ""The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button"" is a wonder. The curious saga of a man ageing backwards, gives Fincher the possibility of doing what he does best, tricks. It is the drama part that he doesn't seem to master or perhaps he doesn't care. ""Zodiac"" was his most coherent dramatic venture. Here he gets infatuated by the CGI and manages some spectacular punches but it is thanks to Brad Pitt the the exercise has a soul. He is truly remarkable. He manages to overcome the distraction of the gadgetry and show us the interior of the man. Brad Pitt's warmth wins over David Fincher's coldness and the most successful parts of the film are reflected in Brad Pitt's eyes. Geared towards an inexorable ending, there are moments of real beauty and tenderness. I'm convinced those moments could have been captured with a Super 8. The over direction of Fincher puts the emotional undertone in real jeopardy but, thankfully, the overall experience is mostly a welcome and rewarding one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Fincher's Magical Masterpiece,"Possibly the most anticipated winter film of 2008, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a curious film indeed. It's got an intriguing and completely absorbing story, as well as my favorite director, David Fincher, on the top of his game. With ""Button"", Fincher cements his place as one of the best directors alive, as his film is nothing short of magical, mesmerizing, riveting, ground breaking, and ultimately, timeless.When I first heard about this movie, I had to wonder...how was Fincher, the guy responsible for realistic, gripping, crime thrillers like Seven and Zodiac going to pull off the fantasy film of a lifetime? Armed with a massive budget, Fincher uses everything a director can use to craft the most charming and technically brilliant film of the year. It's a film to be cherished for ages.""Button"" has struck me like this because a recurring theme in the film is that age is only a number, and that we as people can choose what we do with our lives, no matter what our age is. What better way to tell this message than through a story where the titular character ages backwards, and must experience life in such a way? How does one fall in love when he could one day appear young enough to be his spouse's child? How does a 5 year old play with the neighborhood children when he's confined to a wheelchair stricken with old age? Fincher's epic explores our choices, lives, and the timelessness of life itself.Brad Pitt plays the title role of Benjamin Button with a certain air of likability like he always does. While I felt he did a good job with the part, he didn't have to do much...Benjamin, fittingly, is a rather quiet character (I'd be willing to bet he narrates more than he actually talks in the film). In terms of acting, the film belongs to the ladies, Cate Blanchett and Taraji P. Henson in particular. Though Blanchett may seem overrated to some, there's no denying her unrivaled talent at playing a character as complex and deep as Daisy, and she pulls it off with ease and charisma. Taraji P. Henson will warm your heart as Benjamin's mother, as she's humorous, warm, and loving, so loving that I felt as if she was my mother.The main complexity behind the film, especially with a director like David Fincher, is keeping the film grounded in reality, while maintaining the undeniable magic within. As a director, you don't want to lose too much of either quality, instead keeping a healthy balance of the two. I feel that Fincher accomplished this perfectly. He is mainly helped out by a magical score, and absolutely stunning cinematography (which immediately identified it as a Fincher film, because of the darkness and lighting of it).Despite the wonder and awe of the film, mixed with the realism that Fincher always brings, the true allure of the film is not just Benjamin's aging problem, but the romance between Benjamin and Daisy, which is beautiful. Two people in love, regardless of age, time, or place. It's one of the most compelling romances of the year.""Button"" is also the most technically well made movie of 2008, as the true standouts are the Visual Effects and the Makeup, both of which are Oscar worthy. Pitt plays the character at almost every age, but it's almost impossible to tell when the CGI is being used on him. You know it's there, obviously, but you can't tell it's being used. When the transition is just smooth enough for the Visual Effects to be retired, but just rough enough to use makeup, it's absolutely perfect. If you've ever wanted to see Brad Pitt look 20 again, look no further, as the effects that make our actors young again (the same goes for Blanchett) are just as stunning as those that make them older.Despite a long runtime, the film never drags. If I had to point out one thing I would've liked to have seen a little more of, it would've been more of Benjamin as a little kid, as I felt that was rushed (for those who don't know what I mean, I mean the last parts of the film when he's old, but his body is young). This doesn't hurt the film in any way, as it's just my wishful thinking.I know I've used the word 'magical' a lot in this review, and don't think it's on accident. If I could pick one word to describe David Fincher's masterpiece, that would be it: magical. ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is a captivating piece of art that shouldn't be missed by anyone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"""I was just thinking about how nothing lasts...and what a shame that is...""","I had been awaiting to see this movie for some time. Alas, it was Christmas Day and you bet I was there to see the movie on opening day. I set my expectations really high on this film. I expected nothing short of brilliance with a film coming from director David Fincher, director of the masterful ""Zodiac"" and screenwriter Eric Roth, writer of the classic ""Forrest Gump"". The acting is brilliant in the movie. Brad Pitt and the marvelous Cate Blanchett share a fire that resonates so effortlessly out to the audience. Other performances are notable as well, such as Taraji P. Henson's as Benjamin's mother, and Tilda Swinton's as Benjamin's first lover. Another notable achievement in the film is the visual effects; none of it is overdone and it is quite convincing. The music in the film is great as well. The haunting and mythical music is composed by Alexandre Desplat. One thing that did surprise me in the film was the amount of comedy present, but I guess comedy's needed for a tale with such sorrow. I really do think that this film is a classic. And I would go and see it again. When I was walking out of the theater, some people complained that the movie was very good, but that it was too long. I disagree; I actually didn't want it to end. It's the perfect film to watch all snuggled up in a blanket during the dead of winter. All things aside, this movie is about the short time we're given with life and how we are to make the most of it. Even with a story as fictional as Benjamin Button's, the message rings true.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Do You Still Wish You Could Turn Back the Clock?,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was a near epic film in almost the same way Forrest Gump was. I am not particularly a fan of David Fincher and his work. Yet I strongly admired The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. This film is about a man named Benjamin Button who leads much of an ordinary life under not so ordinary circumstances. The one thing that separates him from any other human being is that he ages backwards. Despite such large differences between the audience and Benjamin Button, the film finds a way to connect with a large variety of people in a way that does not seem to happen so often.The acting was very good throughout the movie. Especially that of Cate Blanchett who seems to be turning out one great performance after another. She plays the role of Daisy, Benjamin Button's real love interest from start to finish. In fact she played so well it might have been a partial downfall to the movie. Her performance out shined that of the main character, played by Brad Pitt. Although Pitt was very solid in his performance I do not believe he deserved an Oscar nomination (rather Blanchett deserved one) for his role of playing Benjamin Button. He was not a necessity to the movie and did not add much to it. He was not bad but he wasn't spectacular. Throughout though many of the different actors and actresses lit up the screen. Especially Tilda Swinton who was wonderful to watch as Button's short lived love interest. Her presence was magical and a joy to watch. I would have loved to see just a little bit more of her character.The directing of David Fincher in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was of what I believe to be his best work to date. The screenplay of Eric Roth was written very well as he has had experience with these type of movies. In many scenes the dialog and great direction combined for some epic scenes.Ultimately I enjoyed this movie very much but something felt missing from the movie. Something seemed left unsaid that was vital. I felt that the great downfall to this movie was that Brad Pitt didn't give an amazing performance and did not take control of the movie rather Blanchett stole the show from him which made Button seem less important to me. Despite that though it this film was done very well and I would recommend it to all. Its an important story that makes us self reflect and think deeply. It displays how we need to live with our mistakes because they are part of our life. We need to appreciate what we have rather than wonder ""what if...?"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"A great, worth film","This film is worthy of a 10/10 rating simply because of its imaginative and complex nature, I mean, I couldn't bring myself to know why this simple idea of a man aging backwards hadn't sprouted up before. Set all the way back at the end of the Great War, to New Orlean's meeting with Hurricane Katrina, this movie tells the story of Benjamin Button, a baby born an old man of eighty, destined to die in the mere form of a zero-year-old. I found this movie very emotional and special because there's reeally nothing like it. I honestly thought, when I found out the immense length of the film, it was going to be boring....I was wrong, it gripped me from start to finish. There are many emotional and touching scenes in it, including the end, where it brings forth Benjamin Button's 'younger' years as an old man. Nothing went wrong with the cast, Brad Pitt played a great job as a reverse-aging man, and Cate went well as his childhood friend. Overall, this movie was great and I recommend it to anyone who loves the genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
ONE OF THE MOST UNOQUE MOVIES OF OUR TIME!!!,"There are moments in life where we all feel ""Different""!In the Curious Case of Benjamin Button, on the one-way highway of life, Benjamin Button lived and died...going the wrong way!.... ...Well, at least, COASTING the wrong way!And therein RESIDES perhaps the great flaw/conundrum in David Fincher's film: For 2 hours and 40 minutes, ""Button"" seems content to meander aimlessly and unhurriedly toward its, and his own, inevitable conclusion. Thusly, it must be frankly said that BUTTON, at times so languidly paced...prompts us to ask, was Fincher, the director, as appears to be the case with his lead character, seemingly not knowing or caring EXACTLY where he was going.... If any place at all?What a shame! Because the basic premise is nothing short of breathtakingly original... Perhaps one of the most original concepts to arrive on the screen in the past decade!I will admit that I am conflicted on this point. Perhaps the seeming pointlessness of Button's retro-existence is a bit of a metaphor for own lives, which, in the long term scheme of things, end up, do what we may, whether we like it or not, being hollow, devoid of purpose, simply inertia-driven and without any GENUINE merit or worthwhile impact!!It shakes up our mindset, casting a shadow of doubt over our entire life/death belief system. In that sense, Fincher's film haunts me as almost no other film has. If this was one of his goals in making BUTTON, I would say he was quite successful!Visually, this film borders on miraculous. Three well-deserved Oscars in Art Direction, Make-up and Visual Effects certainly back up my last statement. However, none of what you see is in-your-face. Every minute detail seems delicately integrated in a blissfully natural tapestry that is nothing short of inspired.On that note, let's look at Brad Pitt's performance in the title role...An actor who, ever since his twitchy, neurotic, paranoid Jeffrey Goines in 12 MONKEYS, has never ceased to amaze us and certainly does not disappoint as the soft-spoken Button. Pitt's interpretation convincingly shows us a human being who has adapted to his unique condition and who has learned to take life one day at a time, virtually expectation free!Kate Blanchett as Daisy is superb! The singularity of the nature of her relationship with Button allows her to take the audience into unchartered cinematic territory and oh what a delicate and sophisticated journey she takes us on!David Fincher's Benjamin Button surely is an ageless film for the ages!....ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en ESPAÑOL, are most welcome!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
An interesting premise that drags.,"The film is surprisingly vague in themes outside of the ones that hit you on the head. It never attempts to answer the elephant in the room, and I think that was the right choice, instead focusing on its characters, allowing the audience to interpret their experiences for themselves and how it relates to their own perspective on mortality.The film does look beautiful but is fairly unambitious. For a film opening up so many different conversations, it would have been nice to see the director take more risks to enforce them.The acting in this film is mostly great with Taraji P. Henson and Tilda Swinton being standouts, although Brad Pitt gives one of the stalest Oscar nominated performances I have ever seen. He looks bored throughout most of this movie, making it hard to relate to his character, a huge disappointment to watch compared to his other great works.The main issue with the film for me is its length, having a near 3 hours runtime where some stories drag unnecessarily.A well-made fantasy drama that I am unlikely to rewatch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
More Moving Than I Expected It To Be,"'Twas amazing. Best effects film in ages (not just awesome effects, but a real movie magic feeling comes from this that we kinda take for granted in the 21st Century with effects today). Ages, being really, I guess, since event effects films like Titanic, The Matrix, Jurassic Park and Forrest Gump. Not about animation, where amazing things happen every year in film, e.g.Wall-E, but visual effects blending with real live action. Along the lines of the successes of the Star Wars, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings films recently. But those are so filled with animation and obviously computer-enhanced realities that the ""magic"" one feels by the use of less effects to create more illusion is a bit missing. Course, this was not about Two-Face in The Dark Knight stuff, not just like that with its half live action, half animated face, or even like a fully believable Golem in LotR, this was a movie where everything was fairy tale and everything was immediately touched with a sense of photographic trickery, but where you just couldn't tell exactly what was make-up and what was CGI, or what was an illusion or real... even though a lot of the tricks are clearly there. You know you're looking at Brad Pitt's face on an actor who is probably about 10 yrs old, with CGI and makeup all doing their best, but you're just not interested in thinking about that. Subjective of course, that's just what I felt. Plus, the movie was really eloquent on the subjects of our perception of age and beauty. It's a tragedy though. Like Forrest Gump in some ways, even if Forrest Gump was a cultural satire and a journey through the American Experience since the 60s, this was a similar feat of storytelling on film.

A Masterpiece,"Brad Pitt is not just another handsome guy who's made it big in film. This guy is one hell of an actor who'll walk away with this year's Best Actor Oscar as will the movie garner 10 awards. It is simply a masterpiece; no words can aptly decribe the poignancy and beauty of this celluloid Renoir.Kudos to two geniuses who wrote it;Eric Roth and Robin Swicord,masters of imagination. To think of the idea whereby the march of time runs clockwise for the entire world but backwards for Benjamin is, in itself, masterful. The concept allows for the type of intersection of people and events which has never been shown on the screen previously.I suggest that no one reads anything about the plot because the entire impact of the film will be lost by doing so. See it with an open mind and you will be totally astounded for close to three hours. Every once in a while, a film of this brilliance comes along to take the public by storm, the last being ""Million Dollar Baby,"" therefore get set for another movie treat of a lifetime.Simply stated: this film is NOT to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Intriguing and Unique,"In New Orleans, while in her deathbed, the elder Daisy (Cate Blanchett) asks her daughter Caroline (Julia Ormond) to read the journal of Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) for her. Caroline reads the fascinating story of a man that was born a diseased old man on the day that the First World War ended; abandoned by his desperate father Thomas Button (Jason Flemyng) in an asylum for elders and raised as a son by the black caregiver Queenie (Taraji P. Henson). While aging backwards, Benjamin meets the girl Daisy and they become friends; then he works as a sailor in the towboat Chelsea and travels through the world, participating of the World War II after the attack to Pearl Harbor; finds love with Mrs. Elizabeth Abbott (Tilda Swinton) and returns to New Orleans, when he meets his biological father and Daisy, who is working as ballerina in New York until he finally dies as a baby. While reading the diary, Caroline discloses a secret about her family.""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is one of the most intriguing movies ever. The original story is supported by an interesting and curious screenplay that discloses the whole life of Benjamin Button and a stunning direction of David Fincher. The cast is magnificent, and it is not easy to highlight an individual performance (I loved Cate Blanchett), supported by magnificent cinematography and make-up. Surprisingly there are bad reviews of this movie that I recommend for those viewers that seeks a gem that is unique. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""O Curioso Caso de Benjamin Button"" (""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"")",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

Spectacular makeup effects do not make up for a densely boring narrative,"David Fincher, as brilliant and astonishing a filmmaker as he is, is a meticulous perfectionist. Some films show this off for the better (Fight Club, Se7en and The Game), while others falter and are weakened by it (Zodiac and Panic Room). So it should have surprised no one when the buzz came in over all the problems associated with The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. And unsurprisingly, this film also suffers from that perfectionist stroke.Benjamin (played prominently by Brad Pitt) is born just after World War I with a rare disease that makes him age backwards; appearing older when he is young, and younger when he gets older. He is left on the porch of an elderly home as a baby, and is almost carelessly discarded for how hideous he looks. But one of the staff members, Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) takes him in and raises him as her own. Gradually as Benjamin ages, he grows younger and can begin to do more. But he is seen differently by everyone who meets him, leading him down various journeys and paths.Fincher has crafted his second epic (the first being the slow-burn crime drama Zodiac), and has stumbled on the same mistakes he did the first time. He starts off with a great opening and first act, packed with the minutest of details that I doubt anyone could spot everything he is conveying in one sitting. But as the film takes off into its second and third acts, it becomes inundated with too many details and too few interesting moments. The film is a mere fourteen minutes longer than The Dark Knight, but it feels like an eternity longer. As it trucks along, Benjamin Button just slowly becomes more boring when it should become more interesting. What should be focused more heavily on is not, and what is, should not be. It feels like Fincher is trying to up himself over and over again, while still pleasing everyone else. He used to know when to say cut, but here, he seems to have totally lost himself in trying to build an epic that did not need to be as lengthy as it is.A key reason for this is because of a love story between Benjamin and Daisy (played prominently by Cate Blanchett). He meets her as a young boy (although he looks like a senior nearing death), and falls in love. The love story between the two seems cute and sweet at first (despite being a touch creepy because of Benjamin's initial appearance versus Daisy's), but slowly becomes melodramatic and overbearing. Yes, the character of Daisy is integral to the story, but by the end, she seems to be a nuisance. An epic is not an epic because of an eternity spanning love story. It is the storytelling method that makes an epic, and unfortunately, hinging it on something like this is a bit amateur. Surely Fincher could have helped fixed up Eric Roth's screenplay to be a lot stronger?What also does not help is the chemistry between Pitt and Blanchett is not all there. Yes, they work off each other well, but for long lost lovers to become connected after so many years, they do not do a convincing enough job. The chemistry practically emanates between Pitt and relative newcomer Madisen Beaty, who plays a teenaged version of Daisy. How can Pitt make a relationship more convincing with someone who is so much younger, than someone he has actually worked with in the past? Sure, we can chalk it up to the CGI wizardry being used at that point in the film, versus later on, but surely Pitt can act better as himself than as a special effect?Pitt carries the film fairly well, but is not particularly well suited for the role. He does well as the younger Benjamin, exploring and learning about life, but as the wiser and older Benjamin, he seems to waver. Like the film, he is great in the first half, and slowly falls apart as the film goes on. Blanchett has done much stronger work than this, and is surprisingly tame in her performance. It is actually the supporting cast that does a great job. Henson is astonishing in her nurturing mother role, bringing just the right amount of humanity and zest to a character that could have easily been phoned in as a stereotype. Jared Harris does excellent work as Captain Mike, and Jason Flemyng is great as Benjamin's dad Thomas.But the real reason anyone should even attempt to sit through this mess of an ambitious film are the spectacular special effects. Making Brad Pitt look like a feeble old man who looks nothing like the actor is clearly not an easy thing to do. But every scene, whether it is actually the man himself caked behind enormous amounts of makeup (whether to make him look ancient or to look like the golden boy we first remember him as back in the early 1990s), or he is digitally placed in there, looks just as realistic as the next. You will believe that Pitt is really that age. The effects are just that believable. I was simply stunned watching him on-screen, interacting with other people. It is almost terrifying to think how far we have come that something like this could look as realistic as it does (likewise to Blanchett, who spends a good portion of the film behind an endless amount of makeup as well).The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is not a bad film, but it is not the great film it could have been either. It could have been so much stronger if Fincher was a little less of a perfectionist. Cutting a good forty minutes out would have done this movie an immense amount of good. For such an ambitious effort, it makes a lot of silly mistakes.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
This is a lovely movie,"and one worth going to see simply for it's escapism.Loosely adapted from F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1921 short story by the same name, this is what going to the movies is all about. It offers escapism, it's full of delight. It's full of looking at life from a different perspective, something most of us don't do.I don't go to the movies to write critiques, I go to be entertained and to escape the regular humdrum of life, this movie fulfilled my desires. The nice thing about attending the session I did, it was a full house and people actually applauded at the end of the movie in appreciation of the acting and the concept of the story.

With a running time of over 2hrs 30 mins a film needs to be something special to keep me entertained for that long and I was not disappointed. Brad Pitt was on top form and the direction of the movie was fantastic. The premise of someone born with the physicality of a dieing old man and growing younger over time was dealt with in such a beautiful way that you don't want it to finish, and emotions are triggered at several points in the movie.

Outstanding,"When I first heard about this movie, I thought it would be a dumb, overplayed sci-fi flick. But it wasn't that at all. This film was about a man who needed love, and found despite the most unlikely circumstances. This film was about the choices we make and how it affects us as individuals, our lives, the people around us and their lives, and the rest of the world. Its message was clear: life is a precious gift that must not be wasted. Another one of its important morals was that everyone is different; no one should be treated badly because of their differences. This movie had amazing moral character and showed a great knowledge of what life is about.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Like Forrest Gump without the wit or charm,"The most irritating part of Benjamin Button is that it has this strange premise (aging backward) and doesn't take advantage of it. The Fitzgerald short story actually shows Benjamin going through life stages backward (from cranky old geezer to mild-mannered husband to young virile asshole; it's actually pretty funny and interesting) whereas the movie merely shows this dull blank slate of a character aging backwards biologically with this soporific love story thrown into it. Like he starts off as this little old man, but he just comes across like a soft-spoken kid with a bad skin disease (I get that it was trying to go for that 'second childhood' phase but I felt like it chickened out, like why not start out asa cranky old geezer). The movie was too afraid to be weird and interesting, instead vying for safer Hollywood schmaltz. It was all just so incredibly bland.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Brad's finest,"Wonderful performances from Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, in a fascinating film from David Fincher. Cate is always good, but Brad delivers his finest performance as the titular Benjamin Button, a man who is born a geriatric, ages in reverse and dies an infant.More than a few touches of Gump are all over the screenplay (same writer), but Fincher largely avoids the hokiness of Zemeckis' overrated twaddle. The central message hits the viewer like a sledgehammer, but there are some genuinely touching moments delivered by the two leads.Beautifully shot and epically told, Button is not quite the masterpiece I expected, but it is certainly very good. Brad's finest acting until Once Upon Time in Hollywood delivered his Oscar. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

He met strangers who didn't bring negativity into his life; instead, they taught him important lessons and showed him new ways to think. I'm amazed at how well the writer captured Benjamin's character. The script was well-written, and David Fincher did a great job directing it.I really love this film. After watching it, you'll feel good. If you're an aspiring screenwriter or director, this film offers a lot of insight into writing.

An ambitious biopic-style film that impressively hits its emotional notes dead on,"I wasn't convinced I'd like Benjamin Button - it's a drawn out introspection on aging and life, and wasn't sure if it would really engage me the entire time. I shouldn't have doubted Fincher, because it doesn't feel too slow and the characters are quite engaging. Fincher uses Benjamin's life to speak to universal themes and give a narrow story a sense of sprawl. Unsurprisingly, the primary theme running through the story is how aging changes people and how they develop over time. I didn't think the script was anything special - it was heavy handed in its ideas and didn't have remarkable depth, but the performances and direction let the themes shine through anyways. The unconscious judgements people make based on appearance and age are drawn out by Benjamin's contradictory age and appearance. Rather than play this for laughs, Fincher takes this seriously and makes Benjamin a plausible character who yearns for connection but only has a few people who can truly appreciate him. It's this very specific connection he has to Queenie and Daisy that make the third act of the movie so poignant. The story structure being interspersed with jumps into the present seems odd at first, but comes together beautifully as the ideas of love and permanence are emphasized by the ripples caused by Benjamin's life. The cast is stellar, with Pitt and Blanchett leading the way. This movie reminds me of Forrest Gump as we go through many world events and locations through the eyes of someone with a truly unique perspective, and watch their struggles to be with the person they love. It is more of a journey that you feel than a story that leaves you thinking, but the direction, cinematography, and editing are all excellent. I'm excited to see Mank later this week, as Fincher clearly deserves to be trusted.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Time is precious and goes by before we know it,"This movie very much brings a forest gump vibe, its rather a lesson about life. Directed by David Fincher and starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, the movie tells the unique story of Benjamin Button, a man who ages in reverse. Born as an old man and gradually growing younger over time, Benjamin's life is filled with the same challenges, joys, and heartbreaks as anyone else's, but his unusual condition makes everything more complicated. The film explores themes like time, love, and mortality in a deeply reflective way. One of the movie's greatest strengths is its ability to blend fantasy with genuine human emotion. Even though the premise is strange, it doesn't feel like a gimmick. The movie takes its time, allowing you to really connect with Benjamin's journey.And he visual effects, which show Benjamin aging in reverse, are impressive, adding to the overall believability of the story. Brad Pitt delivers a strong performance, making Benjamin a character you truly care about, and Cate Blanchett is as excellent as playing Daisy, the love of his life.However, the film can feel very slow at times, and its nearly three-hour runtime might be a bit too long for some viewers. There are moments where the story drags, especially in the middle, and a tighter edit could have helped with pacing. Despite these flaws, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a beautifully made, thought-provoking film that sticks with you long after the credits roll. It makes you reflect on the nature of time, the inevitability of aging, and how precious the moments we share with others truly are. While it's not a perfect film, its emotional depth and unique story make it one of those movies that stays with you, leaving a lasting impression.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
A Love Story Beyond Time,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a 2008 film directed by David Fincher, based on the short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald.

The film explores themes such as fate, destiny, identity, belonging, and the meaning of time.Pitt delivers a remarkable performance as Benjamin Button, portraying him with subtlety and nuance in every stage of his life. He conveys Benjamin's curiosity, innocence, wisdom, and courage with authenticity and grace. Blanchett is equally impressive as Daisy, a passionate and spirited woman who struggles to cope with Benjamin's condition and their unconventional relationship.

"'Sometimes We're On a Collision Course, and We Just Don't Know It'","'The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button' is unlike anything of David Fincher's previous works. It was an entirely different experience from watching his previous works like 'Fight Club', 'The Game' and 'Alien3' which had more energy and adrenaline. It is a more 'mature' movie in comparison.Fincher is known for being a very stylistic director but here he uses a gentler tone that is rather subtle and quiet. The art direction is simply amazing. Fincher uses a sepia lighting that takes one back in time and adds to the nostalgia (this especially contrasts well with the modern day hospital scenes that use a cold lighting). The makeup department does a splendid job by disguising Pitt and Blanchett and physically demonstrating the aging of their characters. The camera-work is equally wonderful. Editing is sharp. The gentle soundtrack is lovely and flows beautifully with the story.Fincher beautifully tells the story about the life of Benjamin Button. The story mainly revolves around Benjamin Button's curious case of aging backwards but what I liked most about it was his complex love story with Daisy followed by Queenie's motherly devotion towards him. The remarkable dialogues are poetic and philosophical.I have always thought of Brad Pitt as an average actor overall. But there have been a few movies where he nailed the part and 'The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button' is one such example. Though many would argue that Pitt doesn't 'act' much in the movie because he's quiet, who says that acting has to be loud or even vocal? If anything, this movie shows Pitt growing as an actor and he is very able to successfully downplay roles that demand to be played with subtlety. Cate Blanchett is incredibly beautiful and is phenomenal as the vibrant Daisy. Taraji Henson is lovely and adorable as Benjamin's mother who loves him unconditionally. This actress delivers a spirited performance and she's a scene stealer. Jason Flemyng, Julia Ormond and Tilda Swinton shine in their roles.'The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button' was a unique experience because of its treatment of the material. The story itself is derived of a novel concept but it is Fincher's presentation and treatment that makes it one of a kind and hooks the viewer from start to finish. Above all, this is his accomplishment.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Not your typical lovestory,"I watched the film because it sounded really interesting and is definitely something different. The love story that slowly develops is very unusual, so much so that it's a bit strange in places.

Sometimes I got a little bored in the middle of it, but that's how I honestly feel about almost all romances and the movie isn't supposed to be thrilling.RECOMMENDATION:

Overrated,"This movie was good, but I don't know that it deserved the slew of Oscar nominations it received. It certainly wasn't good because of Brad Pitt, he has one of the least expressive faces in show business and it is difficult to actually believe he is feeling any of the emotions the script calls for. Another liability of this film is its length, most of which is spent showing the title character bouncing around apparently trying to find himself, which makes sense, given his circumstances, but it is a very superficial treatment. Finally, his aging process is not actually linear (neither forwards nor backwards), so an already implausible premise becomes even more difficult to buy into. I'm glad I saw it, but it is not the spectacular film people would have you believe.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Reflective yet funny,"I didn't have high hopes for this film, but I wanted to see it anyway as it looked very intriguing. I went to see it with two friends, and when we left the theater, we concluded that it was good but not that good. The next day we had all changed our minds, the film was excellent! It took some reflection (plus the fact we were distracted by a theater that was sweltering hot at about 85 degrees) to really see the beauty and simple message of the film.The acting is solid and well done across the board. Whoever cast this movie was genius, I wouldn't have changed one actor. Pitt and Blanchet were amazing at every age they portrayed. It wouldn't be the film it is without their incredible performances, they are truly believable and have great chemistry. Fincher directed an amazing piece of film. The CGI and effects were excellent, as well as great makeup jobs. I was really impressed by the color and artistry, not overdone but just right.The storyline is never confusing, but not quite predictable. I loved the humor of some of the characters that appear throughout the film. My biggest criticism is that the film was about 30 minutes too long.

Slow paced movie about life with an end that mat hit hard.,"I remember being on a plane for a business trip to Bangkok some 14 years ago, when I watched this movie for the first time.

Very bittersweet movie.That scene always stayed with me as the years passed by, so I decided to watch it again last night. This time the movie resonated probably even more. Being 14 years older, kids grown up, loosing my brother who died too young at 51, my father passing away about 3 years ago, my youngest going through chemo therapy for a year, my oldest becoming an alcohol addict at 18, being divorced, becoming unemployed, building a new home all over again, experiencing how time seems to accelerate the older you get.

You Can ALWAYS BET ON MR. David FINCHER for a good flick!!!,"I consider this guy the among the best directors in Hollywood. Rest of the pick are Ridley Scott, John Mctiernan, David Cronenberg, and Michael Mann.This film has a very, very interesting topic about reverse aging and an engrossing character named Benjamin Button.""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is based on a short story written by F. Scott Fitzgerald and first published in Colliers Magazine on May 27, 1922. It was subsequently anthologized in his book, Tales of the Jazz Age, which is occasionally published as The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Other Jazz Age Stories. Development rights to the story were held for years by the late Hollywood mogul Ray Stark. Stark retained those rights until his death in 2004, when they were purchased from his estate.The film adaptation DIFFERS GROSSLY from the short story.Brad Pitt, the actor I liked in Fincher's bleak thriller Seven, does a professional job in his role as Button. Cate Blanchett plays Daisy Fuller, Benjamins's lover. She also complements Pitt's character. Other notable actors are: Taraji P. Henson as Queenie, who adopts Benjamin and fulfills her role as a mother to him. Jared Harris as Captain Mike Clark Benjamin who offers Benjamin a job on his Tugboat. Rampai Mohadi as Ngunda Oti, a pygmy who befriends Benjamin.Full Plot: In 2005, Daisy, an elderly woman, is on her deathbed in a New Orleans hospital. Daisy asks her daughter, Caroline, to read aloud from the diary of Benjamin Button.In 1918, a boy is born with the appearance and physical maladies of a very elderly man. The baby's mother dies shortly after giving birth, and the father, Thomas Button, abandons the infant on the porch of a nursing home. Queenie and Mr. ""Tizzy"" Weathers, who work at the nursing home, find the baby, and Queenie decides to care for him as her own.In 1930, 12-year-old Benjamin, having exchanged a wheelchair for crutches, befriends six-year-old Daisy, whose grandmother lives in the nursing home. As Benjamin's body grows younger, he accepts work on a tugboat. Benjamin also meets Thomas Button, who does not reveal that he is Benjamin's father. In 1936, Benjamin leaves New Orleans with the tugboat crew for a long-term work engagement and starts an affair with Elizabeth Abbott, wife of the British Trade Minister.In 1945, Benjamin returns to New Orleans, and learns that 21-year-old Daisy has become a successful ballet dancer. Benjamin again crosses paths with Thomas Button, who, terminally ill, reveals that he is Benjamin's father. Thomas wills Benjamin his possessions before he dies.Daisy's dance career is ended in Paris in 1957, when she is hit by a taxi cab and breaks her leg. When Benjamin goes to see her, Daisy is amazed at his youthful appearance, but frustrated at her own injuries; she tells him to stay out of her life. In 1962, Daisy returns to New Orleans and reunites with Benjamin. Now of comparable physical age, they fall in love and move in together.Daisy gives birth to a girl, Caroline in 1968. Benjamin, believing he cannot be a father figure to his daughter due to his reverse aging, sells his belongings and leaves the proceeds to Daisy and Caroline. He travels the world alone during the 1970s.Benjamin, appearing to be in his early twenties, returns to Daisy in 1980. Now re-married, Daisy introduces Benjamin to her husband and daughter as a family friend. Daisy then visits Benjamin at his hotel, where they share their passion for each other. Daisy admits that Benjamin was right to leave; she could not have coped otherwise. Benjamin departs again.In 1991, widowed Daisy receives a phone call from social workers. They have found Benjamin — now apparently about 12 years old — living in a condemned building, and have contacted her because they found her name in his diary. The bewildered social workers say that his condition resembles dementia. Daisy moves into the nursing home where Benjamin grew up and takes care of him as he becomes increasingly younger until, physically, he becomes an infant once more. In 2003, he dies in Daisy's arms remembering who she was. Benjamin's story now told, Daisy dies in her New Orleans hospital bed, as Hurricane Katrina approaches.Verdict: Buy it on DVD! Other D.

Curiously empty.....,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film of near near robotic technological precision. It is also one of near robotic emotions. Despite a few good supporting turns, the characters come across as simply means through which to display directer David Fincher's eye for the camera. Fincher is a gifted directer,who brought us such gripping films as ""Fight Club"" and ""Zodiac"". However these two films gave him something that this one did not: a good script. Eric Roth has borrowed heavily from his previous work, ""Forrest Gump"" with themes of innocence and learning, along with those nifty catch phrases. However unlike ""Forrest Gump"", ""Benjamin Button""'s themes feel tacked on and not fully developed. At times it sounds as if the characters are giving the audience a lecture, that serves themselves no true purpose. This is not to say the the film isn't a technical marvel. In fact, some of the films better moments have no speaking, and are more a display of Fincher's solo talent. The performances are solid, but often crumble under the clunky script. One exception is a brief, but marvelous turn by Tilda Swinton, who has the film's best scenes and adds a much needed layer of character complexity. However Swinton is simply not on screen enough to elevate the film as a whole, and by the time the credits arrived, I simply thought...""OK, that was kinda cool...so what?""",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
An Enjoyable Watch For All!,"Saw this movie in my local ""Odeon"" cinema this past Sunday.Now i had extremely high expectations for this one and it didn't quite live up to them. This is not to say it wasn't a good film as from my rating you can see i gave it an eight it was a brilliant film just not quite as gripping or ""amazing"" as a lot of other people seem to have thought.The story is obviously the highlight it really is beautiful and the director and the actors involved all helped portray it in the best possible way they could to be honest which was not an easy task. This really was a film that could have been easily screwed up but it wasn't! Pitt and Blanchett's performances were great from Pitt playing a small wrinkly young man! to some really brilliant scenes involving the both of them together.The film has quite a few ""emotional"" parts portrayed in the story and 80% of the time they work. There are other times some of the scenes i felt didn't really pack a strong enough punch and you didn't really feel any sort of emotion towards anyone involved.I seem to have said this about a lot of films of late but it's true it ran at 3hours 10 minutes including the usual ridiculous promotion before the film gets going but like the staff promised us before entering this film it will not bore you nor does it drag on it really is a pleasure to watch. It really is the sort of film that is halfway to being a masterpiece a lot more could have been done to secure it's place in film history but to be honest it could have been a bad film and it certainly was not that.I feel a few of the category's it has been nominated in at the Oscars it deserves to win.Overall it's a wonderful film with a great story backed up with some outstanding performances. Go in with no expectations and it might be one of your all time favourites. I wish i had not grown such high expectations of the film as i might have enjoyed it further. However a second time round i feel is one day in order!8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Probably my favorite movie of All Time,"This movie blew me away and I have read many reviews of this movie being boring or too long, I think this movie is a perfect length. More movies should be this long to build better plot lines just like this one. I have to say after I watched this movie I was speechless for 10 minutes. Which is the exact score I give this movie. David Fincher has to be one of my favorite directors, from movies like ""Zodiac"" and ""Fight Club"". Fincher once again stole, dare I say, my heart with his incredible plot line of a life of a strange man such as Benjamin Button. Its a lot like Forrest Gump's life except not just the highlights of Gump's but all of Benjamin's highs and lows. I really felt like i knew him at the end of the movie which is an amazing thing to know after only a little over 3 hours, compared to hearing every story of my Grandparents in years of knowing them of course. I was very disappointed that ""Slumdog Millionaire"" beat this movie in the Oscars. I also think if it wasn't for Sean Penn, Brad Pitt deserved a Oscar for such a deep role. It may not be his most Iconic but definitely Brad Pitt at his best. Every Actor and Actress in this movie deserved all the praise and respect they got for this movie. This is one of the few movies in my life I've seen that I would definitely give, if possible, over 4 stars.It is a must see hit that i will recommend to every future generation in my family. It will be my family's ""Forrest Gump"". Not every movie is perfect but this movie comes very damn close.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"A rich, generous Christmas present to anybody who truly loves movies --their art & their power.","('Til today I thought TDK was going to the best movie of '08.)Make no mistake about it this is David Fincher's best film! ...Button has all the power of Seven but for entirely different emotional reasons.This is a warm, thoughtful, thought-provoking, heart breaking, uplifting example of what happens when great writing meets visual artistry.The only thing I'll say about about the story is that it is about the love of Life & Death & Love. Those of you who --like me-- who were looking for the ultimate Twilight Zone episode will not be disappointed. It is a love story. It has a love of language. It is complex. It is beautifully acted. It breathes (it is nearly 3 hours long because it had to be). It uses lightning as a punchline over & over again to great effect.Fincher has always been a Michaelangelo, a Rembrandt, a DaVinci when it comes to visuals & he at the height of his powers here. If you are not seduced by what you see then Button may bore you. There are frames in this film that I could stare at for long, long minutes rather than the few seconds that they appear on screen.HOWEVERNo movie works if the story doesn't grab you. Obviously this one has it. Visuals aside, it is a delight to listen to as well as look at.The performances from a large cast lead by Brad Pitt & Cate Blanchett are wonderful.I've read some early reviews that the movie is ultimately cold --a common Fincher rap. It has Fincher's trademark intellect (if he hasn't trademarked it yet, he should). IT IS NOT COLD. It has the emotional power of a tugboat bring in a wrecked liner.Others criticize Button for being too much of a good thing & that it has too many elements & it does. And I'd rather have a film try too hard then try too little.You had to wonder why they waited until Christmas Day to release this film. The answer arrives when you see it because it is the only day they could have released it.

"Technically impressive but the weaknesses in the material makes it a ""good"" film  not the great one that everyone is suggesting","Daisy has been on her deathbed for quite some time and her daughter Julia is determined to be there as she leaves this world. As they sit together, Daisy asks Julia to read from her from the diary, postcards and letters of Benjamin Button, a man she had known her whole life. His life begins by being abandoned by his father on the doorstep of an old people's home where he is taken in and pitied for appearing to be older than many of those at the end of their life. So it continues as the child Benjamin starts his life as an old man but appears to be younger physically as he ages. His story tells of love and loss, war and peace, life and death.Benjamin Button comes to the UK on a wave of Oscar hype and nominations and many critics here have given it an unquestioning five out of five stars and lavished praise on it. Of course I was keen to see it and went to see a preview as soon as I could  not expecting brilliance but just out of interest to see the film that is wowing them. The truth about the film is as to be expected these days about many ""big"" films, which is that it doesn't really deliver on all the things you hear about it. Fortunately this is not a dull summer blockbuster that had all the money shots in the trailer and Benjamin Button is an engaging and enjoyable film  it is just not the ""soul-filling"" ""visionary piece"" or ""modern classic"" that some have hailed it as. In the broad story of a man's life, the film is engaging and has plenty going on  as others have said the film doesn't feel as long as it is and in essence I was interested in what was happening and what was going to happen.The problem is that I was rarely that interested in what had happened and I didn't really feel myself being that engaged by the lives I was watching. In a way this is a positive thing because the film doesn't ever go for the easy emotions and it stays away from the sweeping musical scores and grand emotion that some directors would have milked as hard and as often as possible. This restraint is to Fincher's credit as it creates a more adult and worthy feel as opposed to the feel of someone frantically pushing ""cry"" or ""laugh"" buttons but it does leave me with the problem that I ended the film feeling like I had watched a ""nice"" film  not a great one. Within the context of the narrative, the ageing backwards concept didn't produce what I would have liked. Here and there it gave me pause for thought due to putting a slightly different spin on a common situation but I'm not sure how much I was doing versus the film. Outside of the odd moment, the film follows birth to death and the direction of ageing isn't really that important in terms of the story being told, it makes it feel unusual sure, but doesn't actually deliver much with it. I was looking for a new perspective on things, something to justify the concept but it never really came. What this left me with was an OK film and I am left looking on at those weeping and proclaiming it to be one of the finest films ever and wondering, really, what am I missing? Technically I have no qualms with the film because the special effects are so good that you barely notice them. The ""old man"" effects are one thing but it is really impressive to see Pitt looking younger than I've ever seen him but still unmistakably be Brad Pitt. This is true of the whole film as it just feels pretty real, whether it be the ""show piece"" effects or just the way everything convinces as being of the period. Indeed in this area the film excels and I think it deserves the many technical etc Oscars I'm sure it will pick up. The performances are good but perhaps not quite as heartfelt as I would have liked. I do not mean I needed them to be obvious or weeping at the drop of a hat but they didn't have as much inside consistently as I wanted. Pitt is solid and has easy charisma but I didn't feel for him, I didn't think he put anything into his character's heart as a result of ageing backwards. Likewise Blanchett was only strong in a few specific scenes and didn't have much to work with beyond that. The support cast are good though as we have turns from Ormound, Flemyng, Henson, Swinton, Koteas and others all doing solid work.So perhaps it is just me. I suspect I will have the votes and the PM's to assure me how wrong I am but I cannot see this film as being more that ""pretty good"". No matter how impressive the technology is or how interesting the concept is, it just doesn't have enough about it in the material to really be engaging, insightful or particularly moving. It is in no way ""bad""  I liked it and time moved quickly despite the length but it is just now the classic that many are calling it. A good film that could and should have been much better  don't expect more than that.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Nothing to care about,"This film did not induce into any deep emotions in me. It was an interesting film, but nothing great and people shouldn't be all ""oh my god, this is amazing"", oh, the concept is very good but the execution is nothing special and nothing that we haven't seem a hundred times in other films. The fact is that this is one of those mass produced canned Hollywood biographical feature films that are exactly alike each other, with some very minor variation in concept.So, here we have, another Hollywood biography based on the same mold as millions of others. This time, however, the protagonist got younger with the passing of time! Ohhh.... Nothing special here. Sorry.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"Unusual, but touching and exquisitely filmed","I had wanted to see The Curious Case of Benjamin Button for a long time, I had heard people raving how amazing it was but others calling it overly-sentimental tripe. After seeing it myself, while it is not my all time favourite movie or a perfect film by all means, I am glad to have watched The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. There are some parts where the film is very slow, and it is probably too long as well. Also I do think Se7en and Fight Club, also directed by David Fincher were better movies.That said, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is still an interesting, worthwhile and very good film on the joys of life, the sadness of death and a love that endures beyond time. It's concept is curious and unusual but is explored in a poignant and sensitive way. The screenplay does have some honest moments, and the story is incredibly heartfelt and touching, I admit I was emotionally wrecked at the end. Fincher's direction once again is very impressive. To top all this, the film has exquisite visuals, seriously the cinematography is stunning, the scenery is sumptuous, the make up is superb and the costumes are gorgeous. And the score is breathtakingly beautiful, very hypnotic, soothing and haunting. Personally I really liked the acting, Brad Pitt while I do think he has given better performances is surprisingly touching in the title role. He plays the role with real humanity and depth, and I didn't find his narration annoying at all. Cate Blachett has also been better, having been mesmerising in the Elizabeth movies and The Aviator, but she looks gorgeous in this movie and acts as a very sympathetic time-crossed soul mate, and the two stars are believable together.Overall, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is very good, not outstanding but I am glad I watched it. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
I am curious elderly,"""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" left me with mixed impressions. Brad Pitt's role as a man aging in reverse poses the questions of mortality and lost love. I got the feeling that the idea of Benjamin's approaching his eventual passing mirrored the hospital scenes as Hurricane Katrina bears down on New Orleans, leading to the destruction of the Crescent City and the end of its festive reputation. The idea that Benjamin starts out looking old, rejuvenates to the point of looking middle-aged, and ends up looking like a baby makes me think of something else. There's a certain period of his life where Benjamin can lead a normal existence, due to looking his age. Meanwhile, he has to spend both his youth and old age in nursing homes. He ends exactly as he started. Maybe the implication is that old age is, in a way, a return to childhood.As for the story itself, I guess that it didn't impress me as much as it could have, just since it seemed similar to ""Forrest Gump"" and ""The World According to Garp"", and also ""Youth without Youth"", about an elderly man who gets struck by lightning and starts aging backwards.Overall, I recommend the movie, although it's not one that I would have thought to nominate for Best Picture.

Not just another Forrest Gump,"""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" (2008) is the thinking man's ""Forrest Gump"" (indeed, the two films were penned by the same screenwrite, Eric Roth). It is a quietly tragic tale of one man's very unique journey through the 20th Century.Directed to near perfection by David Fincher, the film is not only a well crafted fairy tale, but also a meditation on age and the unrelenting passage of time. Based upon a story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, ""Button"" follows the titular character from his birth as an elderly infant on through to his death in a similar state. This breadth of material explains the film's near 3-hour running time, and causes things to become a bit unwieldy now and then. There is a framing gimmick involving Daisy (Benjamin's love interest, played by Cate Blanchett with her usual elfin grace) upon her death bed, recounting to her daughter the tale of Benjamin Button. This element wouldn't be so bothersome if it didn't cut into the proper film so much; each time it does, it's like cold water dowsing a soothing flame. Apart from this, the film is nearly flawless.Conjured with the same meticulous beauty as most other Fincher films, ""Button"" crafts a golden vision of the 20th century that is both nostalgic and authentically real. The camera lingers on just the right detail at just the right time; a character's expression or the cresting sunrise. The cinematography is immaculate and delicious.Paramount among the films qualities, however, is the acting. Taraji P. Henson brings just the right amount of tenderness and wisdom to the role of Queenie, Benjamin's surrogate mother, to keep it from lapsing into caricature. Tilda Swinton is watchable as always as a British aristocrat who carries on a short affair with Benjamin.On parallel double duty are Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt as fated lovers Daisy and Benjamin. This is their film; all other players, while skillful, are here only to shepherd these two through the story.This film displays some of the finest age work in the history of cinema. The practical make up is subtle and convincing, but more importantly the performances are spot on. Blanchett especially manages to capture decrepit old age surprisingly well for a woman of only 39; her eyes take on just the right kind of weariness, her voice is wise and aching to just the right degree. She takes Daisy on a bittersweet journey from young adulthood to middle age right on through to death's door.Similarly, Brad Pitt gives maybe his greatest (definitely his subtlest) performance. He is tasked with first giving a digital performance for the film's initial third. Much akin to the method that brought Gollum to life in ""The Lord of the Rings"", Pitt had his face recorded by a computer and then pasted onto older and shorter actors to realize Benjamin as an elderly looking child. This might be the finest example yet of this very new technique, and it is very much the focus of first part of the film. But once Pitt takes on full acting responsibilities, providing not only his face but this whole, real body, Benjamin becomes the quiet little center that the noisy universe of the film revolves around. Pitt's work in this film confirms what I've suspected for awhile - that he is in fact a character actor in a leading man's body.""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is cinematically melodic. It is not only the thinking man's ""Forrest Gump"", it is the anti-Gump.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Good Love story but No chemistry,"Good but i feel there are better movies with lower ratings that deserve this rating more than this movie.Brad pitt didn't put his emotions in this movie, something felt missing. I feel like its the chemistry between daisy and brad pitt, and even brad and the lady at the hotel.I feel the point of the movie is to show two people with one aging backwards that happen to fall in love but just like with everything in life, there is always an end.Someone could be dying somewhere while a baby is been born somewhere else.It's meant to be a realistic love story like the notebook but i couldn't feel the chemistry between Benjamin and daisy. I felt brad pitt isn't good with love movie so it was hard to really connect to the love story part of the movie but the movie did pass the rest messages it needed to pass hence the 6 rating from me.At the end of the day i couldn't justify the reason for the movie been 2 hours and 40 mins asides character development, and then i also wondered the whole general idea of the movie, was it centered on the love story or the rare disease of benjamin as well as his life?",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Fincher delivers another masterpiece.,"Saw ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" last night. I can't resist a new David Fincher film. It deviates wildly from the F. Scott Fitzgerald story (which could be why I liked it so much). The performances, make up, and directing are all amazing. The screenplay is a little slow and meticulous (Eric Roth also wrote the screenplays for Forrest Gump, The Horse Whisperer, Munich, The Good Shepherd) but the directing made it work perfectly (give me Fincher over Mann, DeNiro, Redford, Spielberg or Zemeckis any day). It really doesn't feel like a two and a half hour film.I could easily envision Oscar wins for Fincher, Taraji Henson, Brat Pitt and Cate Blanchett.Be warned - it is a bit of a tear jerker. It deals with mortality quite a bit, as well as the usual heady subjects of love, loss, war, and redemption... with just the right touches of passion and joy.10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

"A sweeping, visually enchanting  Masterpiece!","The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is perhaps the only film in recent memory that has exceeded all my expectations for it.Let me start off by saying that the story of this film is perfect in every way. I found it was old-fashioned in a way, the way a man's life is explained through a journal. The sweeping feel of the film, perfectly balanced with a strong backstory, makes this film just more magical. The screenplay is perfectly written as a modern day fairy-tale. David Fincher has proved that he is capable of anything. This is not only his best film, but also one of the best achievements that a director has ever captured on screen. The pure poetry verses and lines that the film has are to resemble themes about life, death, and love. They were all perfectly balanced to make sense to the story.As much as this is a director's film, it has fabulous performances. Brad Pitt portrays each moment in Benjamin Button's life perfectly. His subtle acting as an old, yet juvenile man amazed me. To a greater extent, Cate Blanchett gave another amazing performance. Her role was not too flashy, but I think it helped her. I thought that she also did an amazing job playing the different moments and stages in her life. You could really feel her sadness, feelings, regret, and love as time passed by. The supporting performances were all fitting to the story and feel of the film, especially Tariji P. Henson's role as Benjamin's protective and loving mother.This film is absolutely perfect in every single art department. It probably has the best art direction of the decade. The costumes were perfect for the era of the film. The make-up is so amazingly done. The special effects are so first-rate. You could not even tell when, and how, they made younger and older versions of both Blanchett and Pit, whether it was make-up or visual effects at times. The music score was just so brilliant and soothing. One of the best I have ever heard. The cinematography was beautiful, thanks to the set designs.Overall, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is truly the single best film of the year. It is a film that is gripping, and one that is very touching. It is a tragic love story at times, a sad film at times, an enjoyable film at other times. This is a perfect film for adults too, and for children. I have not said this to any films this year, but everyone, praise Benjamin Button!

Good Concept; Disappointing Execution,"For special effects and make up, this movie is incredible. However, the length of the film causes one to believe that there is a lack of overall substance. Its message is cluttered by a series of life moments that are reminiscent of Forrest Gump without the humor.As advertised the plot of the picture is both simple yet intriguing. The movie traces the life of the main character Benjamin Button born as an 80 year old and growing younger every year and his life's intersection with Miss Daisy first seen as a young lass who recalls the story in flashback form as a dying elderly invalid. The intersection of their lives when both are substantially the same age forms the tension in the movie.The ending is the strongest part of the film. One should try to stay awake for the first hour. I was underwhelmed by Brad Pitt's performance. Given his incredible acting ability as shown in the earlier Burn After Reading movie, Pitt relies on the special effects and make up to carry his role.The elderly Daisy character recollecting her past is reminiscent of the elderly female character in Titanic.

What's Coming for You,"Greetings again from the darkness. No doubt headed into this one with inflated expectations of greatness. While the basic theme fascinates me, the execution of the storyline just didn't quite keep my interest. Mostly I just kept asking why. Why do so few people realize what is happening?

Why is Cate's character attracted to BB (he seems quite dull)?David Fincher is a stud director with a resume that includes Zodiac, Fight Club and Seven. He seems to do what he can with Eric Roth's adaptation of Fitzgerald's short story ... I just felt it needed more detail and more happenings. Our only real glimpse of BB's travels are on the tug boat and those are probably the highlight of the film, next to the uniqueness of the make-up and special effects. Contrast this to the far superior Forrest Gump, also penned by Mr. Roth.Brad Pitt plays the role in a disarmingly quiet mode, while Cate Blanchett and Tarij P Henson go overboard.

Enchanting and wonderful fairy tale of an extraordinary man who lives a rather ordinary life in both moments of drama and unexpected love. And he lives it all in reverse!,"""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" though a fairy tale film of wonder, excitement and joys of unexpected moments broadens it's themes more in depth by showing the joys of life and love. Adapted from a short story from F. Scott Fitzgerald the direction from David Fincher(one who's known for his dark thrillers like:""Seven"")is beautiful as many scenes were done so well with the wizard of computer magic and top notch camera work. Yet most catching of all is it's message proving that each have an expected path in life everybody has a fate. Yet this the main character lives his in a most unusual way he lives it backwards! Just imagine escaping the norm as we are so use to living and being in existence from birth being young and living life till our old body gives out. Only how about trying it in reverse! This film has star Brad Pitt(Benjamin Button) who's born as an 80 year old and during his life span he ages backwards all the way to an infant. Yet from the beginning of his start in New Orleans at the doorstep of an old folks home his life spans thru the years from his meeting of people and friends to travels and journeys of memories that anyone would cherish.Beginning with Button's friendship early on when he befriends a little female Daisy(wonderful performance from Cate Blanchett)and many years later as Benjamin starts to gain his youth he once again meets up with Daisy along the way after she's became a successful ballet dancer and the two will develop a passionate romance and love story that anyone would dream of it was just so true and simple.The film even though long moves well with it's journey of drama and life discovery for Benjamin as it's memorable for his working and making a living on a tugboat. And his first love and his being seduced by an elegant and sophisticated married lady(played gracefully by Tilda Swinton). The film is clearly a journey of life's common ups and downs that are common for all yet this man's story of age and living is most uncommon.Overall this film is a masterpiece of joy told thru flashback it's a real taste of a historical journey of love, drama, and changing and most of all it shows to be happy with yourself no matter what. It's fairy tale and magic theme is well enjoyed as the wonder and thrill to see of how one can age backwards and still enjoy life, have success and discover love is amazing. Remember everyone is different, it's okay to be different and everyone lives and does life in a different way. That's what this epic masterpiece of a film shows it's clearly an emotional, and touching picture to love for the way it shows how life can be in a different order yet still it shows that it can be memorable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"Long, long movie from short F. Scott Fitzgerald story...","THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is only half successful.First of all, if there are any Oscars to give out here it's got to be for whomever did the miraculous make-up jobs. Technical awards category might give this one a few Oscars for visual effects and cinematography. And the music by Alexandre Desplat is gorgeous.But the story is a ponderous one, something about the time warp that occurs if a person ages backwards and keeps getting younger than all his contemporaries--but as fascinating as that concept might be, it takes a much better grip on fantasy to work for a movie that runs two hours and forty-seven minutes. Frankly, there isn't enough of a story here to sustain such a lengthy film. How many of us have to worry about getting younger each year, so where's the connection?And towards the middle, it really starts to sag, despite some good performances from a first-rate cast performing brilliantly under Bryan Singer's direction.BRAD PITT has certainly chosen an unusual role to play and he does it with his customary capabilities intact. CATE BLANCHETT is outstanding as Daisy, the childhood sweetheart who grows up to be the love of his life, but her motivations are sometimes vague and her character is sometimes irritating.Most interesting supporting roles are well played by TARAJI P. HENSON as Queenie who finds the foundling Benjamin and raises him as her own, and JASON FLEMYNG as the boy's wayward father who abandons the baby.The biggest hurdle for BENJAMIN BUTTON to jump is making the story seem credible, as fantastic as the concept is. But since the concept istelf isn't grounded in any sort of reality, it's too big a leap to make.Should find its special target audience in fans who love the arty type of flick, no matter how slow moving the story may be. But in the end, it's all rather meaningless. After all, is anybody else in the world going to have Benjamin's unique problem? Only in the movies--or if your name is Dorian Gray.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Everyday,"It's so amazing how impatient people are. Every day I come on here just so I can have a reminder of what I've watched; it amazes me how many people can't sit still and watch something. So many of the lower reviews, not only on for this film but any other slow films, never even finish the content solely because it's too slow for their feeble minds.I watched this movie when I was a kid when it first came out. I remembered that I liked it but I really couldn't remember much so I watched it again. I didn't realize how long this movie was. I didn't realize how sad it was. Many of us are afraid of growing old, this showed how equally terrifying it would be if we instead grew younger.Considering how long the movie was sure they could've added a bit more background; to the daughter, to the pygmy man, to his mothers husband/lover, and definitely to Benjamin's own story. However, as it stands, this movie is great and worthy of having its time of day.Don't watch this movie thinking it will be over quickly and you can move onto to whatever task you have for the day. Watch it when you have nothing to do and can give it your full attention so you can formulate a proper thought and proper emotions.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Should Button up a few Oscars,"Definitely among the top films on my list this year. Despite its sometimes brash bid for Academy Awards (and worthy of them for Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett and David Fincher, plus cinematography, makeup and costumes), BENJAMIN BUTTON stays the course even as it threatens to veer off into art for art's sake. Think of the touchstones of a certain Oscar-winning GUMP, stir in some TITANIC doomed romance, a reversal of DORIAN GRAY and even a touch of what Coppola only wished he'd done with YOUTH WITHOUT YOUTH, and you have a good start on BUTTON.

"Not perfect, but who cares?","I saw a screening of it in Portland last Thursday and was blown away. It's definitely not perfect and has its flaws, unfortunately. It had the potential to be one of the greatest films of all time, and even with its flaws I still feel that it is one of my personal favorite films I've seen in my life. There are spurts in the film when its absolutely mesmerizing, a really unique film experience that is unlike anything you've ever seen. I wish the ending had been stronger, with everything that led up to it I was hoping to have a Shawshank Redemption type ending, but it never came. There were a few other things scattered throughout the film that need not have been there or were a bit cliché. So all in all it wasn't perfect, but in the end and after a few days since seeing it I realized that I didn't care about the small problems, and that it's without doubt one of the best films I've ever seen. With its scope and scale, a project this inspired is nearly impossible to be entirely perfect with all the little details. The vision of it is unrivaled. The cinematography and score are heavenly, and the acting is beyond superb. When you think of the film as a whole, the story, the vision, you can't help but appreciate what you've just witnessed and the people that were involved to dream up such a beautiful piece of art, including F. Scott Fitzgerald. So see the film, let it flow, and enjoy the ride.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

Brad Pitt remains, scene by scene, a revelation because he seems be part of his role , more than interpreter of it. he does more than a good job - he gives the perfect translation of solitude, joy, expectations and hope , perfect way for define Benjamin Button as reflection of the viewer. a film who impress. for its admirable simplicity.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"Good, but way over-hyped","Yes, Benjamin Button is a good film and a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. It looks beautiful, sounds beautiful but we must all be really starved of good film-making if this movie gets people waxing lyrical. It's a great high concept idea, but what do the film-makers get really out of that besides the ""life is unpredictable... you never know when change is gonna come"" theme that permeates the movie. Well, dah, there's nothing that profound about that. Also, while Brad Pitt is gorgeous to look at, and a very likable movie star, his performance somehow left me a little cold - it doesn't hit any deep emotional chords, and while you could praise him for being subtle, he just doesn't have the everyman quality, that sense of human anguish anyone can relate to, that someone like Will Smith does. I wish he would just let go a little more like he did in Babel, and really show us the man behind the beautiful veil. David Fincher got gritty and great in Zodiac, but he gives in to style a little too much in Benjamin button - too many beautiful shots of Brad Pitt on motorbikes with sunglasses on, in front of a magnificent sunset. I wanted the whole movie to feel more real. Don't get taken in by the hype, Oscar voters!",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"the curious, yet bland, case of Benjamin button.","I was really excited to see this new David Fincher film, and the premise of the movie was awesomeness. However, I thought that for the most part this movie was very bland and slow. At times it would seem that it would be for a more dramatic effect, seeing how you are going through his whole life, in a Forrest Gump kind of way. But often times i found myself loosing interest. The first hour or so when he is between the ages of 1 and 19 or so, where very entertaining. But from there, with a few exceptions, the movie bored me most of the time. The sequence explaining the events that led to Daisy being hit by a car where entertaining but it has been done many times before. I also felt that for the more than ample budget that this film must have been given, they really didn't use the money as well as they could of. Lastly I'm not so keen on the style Fincher used in this film. I enjoy an upwards crane shot when it is necessary. But it seems like almost every time somebody would walk a crane shot from a window was used. Oh and also, Brad Pitt could have done a much better job with the role. I wouldn't say it was a poor performance, it was definitely a good one, but meet my expectations it did not. In short, David Fincher you have disappointed me dearly. After the first hour and a half of the movie I just couldn't wait for it to end. 6 out of 10. Word.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
The curious case of an old man growing young,"David Fincher's ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is based on a short story by renowned Jazz Age novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald. Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) is an extraordinary individual, one who was born old and keeps getting younger. The film explores how this strange situation affects his relationships with other people through the years.The screenplay garnered one of the film's many Oscar nominations and keeps us interested through a hefty 166 minute runtime. Could it have been trimmed? Sure. Is the ending a little anticlimactic? Some might say. Nevertheless, storywise, the film is satisfactory.Brad Pitt was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance and I'd have to say that it's his best to date. His co-star Cate Blanchett wasn't nominated, though, which is perhaps understandable since she has done better work elsewhere. In supporting roles, Taraji P. Henson landed an Oscar nomination while the rest of the cast (which includes Julia Ormond, Jason Flemyng & Jared Harris) contributes solid support.Fincher's direction is well-handled and was rewarded with an Oscar nomination. Overall, the film shows significant refinement, as reflected by the 13 Oscar nominations that it received. The film's three Oscar wins came in technical categories that I think should have gone to other films but the general level of technical proficiency is undeniable.In conclusion, ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is a worthwhile fantasy/drama, complete with fine performances, a compelling story and first-rate craftsmanship.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is superbly made and an unforgettable experience, the direction and acting but of course the visual effects, everything is perfect","What's so interesting about The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is the story and you are probably not alone in thinking, a man who ages in reverse has to be difficult to do. Well, David Fincher succeeds perfectly. The film truly is a piece of art, cinema on the highest level with some awe-inspiring filmmaking from David Fincher and all the crew. This is how a production should be, everyone working to create the best experience for the audience and also making a story worth investing in with some great themes. The direction, writing, cinematography and production design along with visual effects. Truly spectacular! I went into this blind, having only read a few things about it and seen a trailer a couple of years ago, and it was the right choice? Why? Because of how deep and epic the story is, how they're using the film's length to chronicle the story of Benjamin but also Daisy who is the second main character. Closest you can come to compare it to is possibility Forrest Gump, it's the same scale in scope, but with a twist.Tells the story of Benjamin Button, a man who starts aging backwards with consequences.Brad Pitt stars as the title character, Benjamin Button, in what possibly is among his best performances. With so much heart and emotion poured into the role, also the character arc is the basis of a fantastic performance as we see Brad Pitt portray Benjamin in different ages and times. The film also stars Taraji P. Henson, Mahershala Ali, Jared Harris, Julia Ormond, Jason Flemyng, Elias Koteas, and Tilda Swinton. I found it interesting in how they began the story during the first world war whilst the present timeline is set during the Katarina Storm in New Orleans, a hurricane which destroyed parts of New Orleans and destroyed many lives. One of the first shots and scenes are of the clock which goes reverse which is also one of the last scenes, it goes hand in hand with the story of the film and its themes, the hummingbird too is quite great in that regard. As I wrote before, I can't praise the director and crew enough, everything is top notch. If the visual effects weren't that good, the film wouldn't work as there's much you can do with makeup and prosthetics but what the visual effects does is contribute to make everything from the city to Benjamin Button work so much better, making it whole. The film won Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Makeup and Best Visual Effects. Also nominated for thirteen Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director for Fincher, Best Actor for Brad Pitt, and Best Supporting Actress for Taraji P. Henson.Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter felt the film was ""superbly made and winningly acted by Brad Pitt in his most impressive outing to date."" Honeycutt praised Fincher's directing of the film and noted that the ""cinematography wonderfully marries a palette of subdued earthen colors with the necessary CGI and other visual effects that place one in a magical past."" Honeycutt states the bottom line about Benjamin Button is that it is ""an intimate epic about love and loss that is pure cinema."" This review summarizes perfectly why you should watch this cinematic wonder, a masterpiece in my opinion. I found it slow in the first 30 minutes but still amazing, then came 2 hours and 10 minutes of pure perfection, the definition of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

It felt a lot like a dream, and I didn't want to wake up.Acting, Cinematography, music, period work, staging, and every other thing is pitch perfect.

A Classic Tale Adapted For the Modern World,"At the close of the first Wold War, a child is born... Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt), who extraordinarily happens to be physically about seventy years old despite having a child-size body. Throughout his life, he grows younger rather than older.David Fincher just keeps growing as a director. While I'm very partial to his earlier, darker work (""Seven"", ""Alien 3"", etc.) his latest projects just continue to amaze with his unique sensibility and with a wonderful cast of friends and crew.There's really nothing bad that can be said about this film. The original story took place about sixty years earlier, but you would never know that... the screenwriter was so careful to make a new story while still respecting the old concept. I think F. Scott Fitzgerald would have approved.Brad Pitt was wonderful as always (here's another person who grows all the time), Cate Blanchett was enjoyable, Tilda Swinton was tolerable (I don't generally like her) and we had some nice supporting roles filled by the likes of Elias Koteas. It's no wonder this film is in the top 250 on IMDb as of this writing.I have to give special credit to the CGI crew. While I am not generally a fan, they did a great job. The ""old"" Pitt was decent, but I was really impressed with the younger Pitt. He was ""Thelma and Louise"" young all over again...",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"""When it comes to the end, you have to let go""","The makeup and visual effects are amazing. The Academy Awards for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and Best Art Direction and Best Visual Effects were truly deserved.This is a sad and touching story of a love that lasted decades, but could never be because one person was aging in reverse. Benjamin Button's, played by Brad Pitt, insides were aging as normal, but mentally and physically he was not. How horrible it must be to watch those you love grow older as you are growing younger. How lonely it must be not to have someone with whom you can grow old, and not to be able to raise your children because eventually you will be younger than them. Poor Benjamin had such a short life. I think his only life and happiness were when his foster mother, played Taraji P. Henson, was still alive, and when he was working on the tugboat. His brief affair with Daisy, played by Cate Blanchett, provided some happiness for him, but it was wrought with fears. Daisy feared growing older as Benjamin grew younger.Taraji P. Henson was wonderful as Benjamin's mother. Pitt's and Blanchett's chemistry lit up the screen. I thought they were great together. Such a sad story, but worth the watch.""Goodnight Daisy""

A Backwards Fairytale,"It is January 3, 2008. I saw today The Curious Case of Benjamin Button for the second time with my father. It was a hassle getting him up.. When he was younger, in his twenties, he was playing tennis with a friend and when he went for a backhand, his spine cracked. He had to get surgery on his lower back and has hard a scar ever since. His back got better, but a few years ago, it began to feel sore again. He had to get an enhanced type of surgery to help stabilize his spine. After this surgery, he progressively got better, but his back continued to fluctuate between feeling all right and feeling worse. There are many reasons why I feel the need to tell you all this before talking about Benjamin Button. The first and most obvious reason of all is because the film is about 3 hours long, and my father had the guts to sit through it, and still enjoy it. But past that, there are more complex reasons why Benjamin Button connects to my fathers life. You see, this film is different than anything anyone has seen before. If you are sick of seeing the same story over and over again, this is the sort of movie you've been waiting for, for it is a story that has never even been touched or thought of before. It begins without a touch on the life of Benjamin, and instead, opens with an old woman and her daughter in the hospital, the older on the death bed, and the daughter telling her mother how much she loves her. The woman tells the story of a blind man whose son goes to war, and in the meantime, builds a clock. The man and his wife get the message that the son is dead, and when the clock is finally revealed to the public, the clock moves backwards; he figures time should go back to honor the memory of his son, in the imagination that maybe he'd be able to see him again. After that story, the woman decides to spend the last moments of her life being told the words from a diary, and it turns out to be the life of Benjamin Button. And from this point on, you are swept away on a miraculous and wonderful, self righteous journey of a man is physically born an old man, growing younger. As his life goes on, you see deaths around him, how his life influences the people around him, and how others influence his own.. You honestly feel as though you are seeing through the eyes of someone different; someone who lives their own life and gets carried away by the pleasures of life in general.I will try not to sugarcoat it, but Benjamin Button is truly a film that helps you believe in life. With the help of fantasy, it is a film that can open your mind and help you get past all the pettiness of your own life (atleast it has helped with mine). But don't take the miraculousness of this film from someone as biased as me, take it from my father. You see, Cate Blanchett, who plays the love interest of Benjamin when he is old and she is young (they meet each other in the middle, don't worry), says it herself: we all end up in diapers. Benjamin Button is a film that can inspire any age, give life to the old and wisdom to the young. It can even get a pained old man with screws in his back out of bed. So go see it for yourself. It's a film that becomes a part of you forever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

No chemistry whatsoever between the two leads. It's a mixture of Forest Gump and Big Fish, but not nearly as emotionally impactful or entertaining as either of them.Not to mention Brad Pitt is completely emotionless the entire film. I get that he's supposed to be a vessel for the story to move through, but he has such little character development. He's the same from birth to death (or vice a versa considering the plot).There were scenes that really touched me and taught me some life lessons, but I struggled to stay engaged in the film due to the lack of chemistry and focus on (what seemed to me to be) the wrong plot lines.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"An Exercise in Complete, Cynical Pointlessness","On here, I've read a lot of reviews from users who abhor this film, and they give their reasons for hating it. The truth is, this film isn't bad - it's certainly not an awful film. It's just a film that's ultimately pointless and a complete waste of time; literally considering that's what the film's central plot device is.Think of it like this; you're listening to somebody talk - say, a politician - and this politician goes on and on and on, and he tries to explain things that we already know for 3 straight hours. Then suddenly he stops and the speech is over. What have we learnt from this speech? Absolutely nothing.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is exactly the same. It's a film that tries to tell us something (at length) but ultimately says nothing we didn't already know outside of some paraphrased, ersatz-Confucian drivel you'd find in any fortune cookie - ""all we are is dust in the wind, dude"", etc.By no means am I stating the film is terrible, mind you. I'm stating explicitly that this film is completely pointless. It tries to teach us something but from the teachings we learn nothing. It's a film with all the good intentions at heart, it's a film about morality and existence, and understanding what's important while we are all still alive - but it's nothing we didn't already know, frankly.Pretentious, condescending, tedious, heart-achingly melodramatic and ultimately a complete waste of time, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film that - whilst avoiding blatant and obvious cliché with a potentially unique premise for a story, offers the viewer nothing new with its message.Ironic, really, that a film whose central message is to tell me that I shouldn't waste my time on earth has resulted in me wasting three hours of my time on this earth watching it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

Some people dance.,"This is not normally my type of movie. Moreover, Brad Pitt is not always my favorite actor. Yet he knows how to pick movies with a character that is made just for him. This movie definitely is.The basic premise is simple. It is of a person, Benjamin Button, who was born old and becomes younger with time. We get to follow his life through a series of flashbacks in which the reader eventually realizes she is his daughter. The storyline is simple but what makes the movie is the presentation from the color the sound to the great acting. This is one of those movies that does not take you very long to forget that you are watching a movie, and it makes you feel like your part.Be sure to watch the movie again with the voiceover by David Fincher and you will see what he is trying to portray and how well he does it.

You'll age in this over long and over hyped movie,"There's whole genre of movies whose plot line could be summarised as 'a fish out of water' where the central character is out of place (""Crocodile Dundee"") or time (""Back To The Future"") or body (""Big""). ""Benjamin Button"" is firmly of this type with its preposterous idea of a baby born as an old man and then becoming younger and younger. The proposition comes from a 1921 short story by F Scott Fitzgerald that, most unusually for a literary work adapted for the screen, can be read much faster (about 10 minutes) than the film can be viewed (an overlong 165 minutes).The eponymous curiosity is played by Brad Pitt who gives such a languid performance than one suspects that he was as bored as many viewers will be. Really the star of the movie is the ever-excellent Cate Blanchett who is BB's love interest Daisy (actually he manages an awful lot of sex in spite of his physical challenges) and Tilda Swinton and Julia Ormond are fine as well.The narrative takes nothing from the short story except the name and the concept and screenwriter Eric Roth is clearly attempting a repeat of his success with ""Forrest Gump"" - another 'fish out of water' - but ""BB"" has none of the humour and charm of the earlier work.

Fascinating but not the most compelling,"On her death bed, Daisy (Cate Blanchett) recounts the story of blind clockmaker Mr Gateau to her daughter Caroline (Julia Ormond). In 1918, Mr Gateau made the train station clock that runs backwards to commemorate his son as well as countless other lost in the great war. Daisy asks Caroline to read the diary of Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt). He was born on the night when WWI ended. His mother died in childbirth. He was born horribly old and his father almost threw him into the waters. He is left on the doorstep of Miss Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) who ran an old age home. As he ages, he appears younger and younger.Director David Fincher has created a fable. It's darn interesting, but I can't say it's a compelling watch. It's fascinating without being exciting. It has very little tension or suspense. The workmanship is excellent, but the slow pace really tests anybody's endurance. It's a marvel of technology to see Brad Pitt in BB's every incarnation. But it takes too long to get to the heart of the movie which is the romance with Daisy. Also the age difference in their appearance make the romance kind of awkward. I think it would be better for them to meet at a later date, and start the movie then. The movie is basically one big flashback. I think the movie should flashback to his childhood only as needed. Take away the reverse aging, this is a movie about a long winding life. It's a little too long and too winding for my taste.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

The movie just left a bad taste in my mouth and tried so hard to be the next Forest Gump. Mr. Pitt attempted to pull your heartstrings throughout the film with little bits of humor here and there.

I was curious alright and glad it got the better of me..,"This is a film I've been highly curious to see for a while and finally got round to it. I heard it was long and it is long for around 2 hours and 40 minutes but it is a rich story, sympathetic characters and makes you wonder at the preciousness of time and life that we have.Brad Pitt - now I never really saw him as much of an actor but boy has he done a great job here. You forget that he is the tabloid pretty boy everyone keeps talking about. In this, he feels more like a character than ever. Cate Blanchett is superb and the chemistry between the two leads is terrific. It is also interesting to see how they both grow older but in different ways - he becomes physically younger and she gets older.What I think the film is trying to get at is how we all emphasise on the fear of becoming older. But if you did it in reserve - where you start off as an old person and become younger - do you really become younger? You still live out life and go through the journeys that normal people go through. You love, you feel pain, you cry etc. This is made more ironic by the fact that when you are born, you start off being helpless and when you are old, you become fragile just as if you were born as well but with more wisdom.While I think the ending could have touched more on its message, it leaves you to interpret what they are saying here. It's what you take away from the film and the experience of Benjamin with you. And while it could have been a bit more specific with its message, I think if you are highly moved by this film, you will pick up your own moral from this film.Essentially it's almost like a Forest Gump type of film where it's about a man who goes through life's experiences. There isn't really a solid based story here - you could simply dismiss it as a bunch of things that happen to this person, but what makes it meaningful is how the character develops with the realisation that time is short for him just as everyone else, and that is something all of us can relate to.I spent two and a half hours watching this and I certainly don't regret it. This is a film that will either move you or for some, bore you but I wasn't bored. I have more respect for Brad Pitt after seeing this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Interesting Movie,"Can be compared to Forest Gump. In the beginning the movie was ugly , with diseased old baby. The life was unfair to him. As the story progresses the hero gets young. But he was not proud of youth. He is a reasonable man, who gives primacy to logic over emotions. The Trials and Tribulations of his life make him travel at his youth and old age alone. Most of his life, this man lives alone. The line "" You may be mad at how things went down for you, But in the end you have to let go."" Brad Pitt choice of movies are interesting. I can just watch a movie on the confidence that brad pitt chose to act in this movie. The Knowledge given to the man to her daughter is insightful in the end. The dementia of old people. The struggle to remember who we are is real. The love is eternal and truthful beyond age and circumstances.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Radiant film-making. Good watch.,"Has been compared with Forest Gump and Big Fish, and justifies to some extent... With Fincher directing it, you can easily expect great cinematography, acting and effects... Lives upto it... Though, at one phase, movie slows down and one would have expected Fincher to come up with something unexpected!However, I loved a few small scenes, ""The Accident Description"", ""The on- going 7 Lightning story"", etc. to name a few... Probably not in par with Fincher's masterpieces but an example of radiant film-making :)""Life isn't measured in minutes, but in moments""In the end, the message sent in the film, as quoted from the film, ""We are meant to lose the people we love. How else would we know how important they are?""",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
This movie has to be watched,"Benjamin Button. Brad Pitt has done a very good job and he transforms himself according to his age. Cate, beautiful, lovely, pretty lady that she is, has again performed well. The movie is pretty unusual and the direction, cinematography is excellent. Each character has its uniqueness. Its a simple film that projects human emotions that actually complemented. One of the few films that has actually filmed as it is taken from the book. Everyone has contributed to this films success. Highly recommended. My first thought about this film when i saw the trailer was; OK another film to watch. But after watching this movie i have not got over the character of Benjamin. I still watch the film for Cate.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Not So Much an Emotional Experience As It Is a Tremendously Impressive Technical Achievement,"Following the procedural but audacious Zodiac, this film shows Fincher on his own reverse-evolutionary course. The story opens with a man who has suffered the loss of a loved one, putting his talent to creative and profound use in a way that wishes for those who we've lost to return. And then we see the concept of his work put into practice, and though there are miraculous aspects, elements and moments in the unique subject's life, it has the same well of tragedy, heartbreak and loneliness, just different kinds, making them harder. And we see that no matter who one is, life is defined by its tragedies.In spite of this, I never shed a single tear, never felt my heart sink. David Fincher's questionable epic, really his first non-thriller, to me, is not so much an emotional experience as it is a tremendously impressive technical achievement. There is not a single frame that could have been better shot or edited. Atmospherically, it is a masterpiece. In the creativity of envisioning the character of Benjamin Button throughout all of the stages of his life, it is a masterpiece. But that is essentially the aim of the film, rather than having you leave it with one of many life-affirming cathartic experience under your belt.It deliberately spreads its scope wider than necessary. We begin by seeing the elderly Daisy, a barely recognizable Cate Blanchett, on her deathbed with her daughter in a New Orleans hospital as Katrina approaches. Daisy then narrates perhaps the most incredible sequence of the entire film, of a blind clockmaker played by Elias Koteas, who was contracted to construct a clock to hang in the New Orleans train station. Subsequent to the news of his son's death in The Great War, he sustained an even deeper occupation with his clock, which he deliberately conceived to run in reverse, perhaps to artistically honor the grief of mourning parents of soldiers, or with the dream that it actually would bring back those who died in the war.Back to Daisy. She asks Caroline to read aloud from a diary containing photographs and postcards written by Benjamin Button. Caroline begins to read as the story transitions to Benjamin's point of view. For a film with such a transcendental concept, and one with such import, this narrative format is quite stale. If only it could've simply told the story without the stretched scale and let us be Caroline, let us react the way she does, rather than detaching us to watch Caroline dramatize the emotional worth for us. Brad Pitt, in the virtually monolithic title role, goes through many changes but at a few of them looks very much like himself and at some points even younger. I don't know what my Kinsey rating is, but he simply is one arrestingly beautiful man.At any rate, we go into a movie or a book with the supposition that it will tell a story in sequential time. We understand and discern flashbacks and flash-forwards, even when the signals are very subtle. If a story moves in reverse, its scenes indicate a chronological progression seen backwards. Even if a scene recurs, it has its place in chronology. If time is splintered into diverging avenues, it is about how the characters try to have power over their existence. Even 21 Grams, The Time Machine, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, et. Al. require the inescapable command of time.There was another film in 2008 that isn't nominated for Best Picture or anything secondary or tertiary in importance, or listed among the favorites of the year at all, and it's an admirably extreme contemplation of the procedure of existing and getting older. But people en masse need time for it to grow on them. Charlie Kaufman's Synecdoche, New York will be beheld and treasured in time.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Lovely film,"I saw this last night at a sneak preview. This is a gentle, loving film done with a glow of kindness. The scene of the father of the soldier rowing out to see was breathtaking. The story is intriguing, entertaining and a joy to watch unfold. The performances were mostly good, however, Brad Pitt didn't react to specific scenes in ways that were logical or emotionally correct. Cate Blanchett is just wonderful and Taraji Henson is unforgettable. The girls who play Cate's character when younger are breathtaking to watch. This is a lovely film --- yes, it is almost three hours long but it didn't feel like it. And the packed theater audience was totally enthralled the entire time. I so enjoyed the movie and recommend it. The story also shows Hurricane Katrina coming to New Orleans, which we know is where Brad Pitt is working to rebuild the city and raise his family much of the time. Keeping that in mind makes the story even more golden.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Great story based on such a simple concept,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button boasts a very good storyline taking place over near a century with a simple but interesting concept: a man growing younger instead of older. It did not seem long although it lasts almost 3 hours. It did make me think of Forrest Gump, specifically how you see the characters in the historical context although Benjamin doesn't really meet famous people. Cate Blanchett in simply sublime in every possible way as the female lead. So beautiful, gracious and soulful. Brad Pitt in the title role is adequate but sometimes lacks enough emotion to truly relate to the audience.The directing is sober but very strong with several beautiful cinematographic moments (it did win the academy award for best cinematography and also for visual effects). I would have liked in general if the film had been more melodramatic because it sins by excess of moderation. I would have liked to be moved to the point of tears. The potential was there. It is possible the director David Fincher simply respected the spirit and story of the original novel but I somehow doubt the movie is that faithful. In finishing, was I the only one who was a bit disturbed by the somewhat artificial appearance of Benjamin when he was young (when he resembled an old man)? It's just my opinion and the film did win the academy award for best makeup which is deserved considering how well the aging or de-aging of the characters were done. It's worth buying unless you're allergic to Brad Pitt.Rating: 8 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button provided a unique performance from Brad Pitt,"While my friend wanted to watch this movie because he's a big fan of Brad Pitt, I was simply more interested in the premise and the fact it was shot in my neighboring city of New Orleans whose scenery is breathtaking here (the fact that present scenes are set during Hurricane Katrina was also a fine dramatic touch). Pitt is quite touching as a man aging backwards in time and I loved the romantic scenes with both Tilda Swinton as the middle-aged wife of a spy and Cate Blanchett as his childhood friend Daisy especially her dancing scenes. Those scenes on the tug boat with that tattoo captain were also good especially the wartime sequences. If there's one quibble, it's that I didn't see enough of Queenie's daughter to really discern how she got along with either her mother or her brother Ben. Otherwise, this was a fine piece of work from director David Fincher and screenwriter Eric Roth who mined similar adapted territory when he previously worked on Forest Gump.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"Not really my cup of tea, but this was brilliant","If you're going to make a movie with this material (and I can think of a lot of reasons not to, ""Forrest Gump"" being at the top of the list), you really need to take your time setting up the world these characters inhabit, and David Fincher is in the position where he can...take his own sweet time.I would recommend that if you're ambivalent about this at all, go when you can surrender three hours as well as yourself. Sentimental and romantic (an excerpt from the Broadway musical, ""Carousel"" is recreated here and it fits perfectly), the tone Fincher creates is pitch perfect and amazingly sustained--with the help of Brad Pitt's performance--from beginning to end.Using the Fincher bag of cinematic tricks to seduce the viewer into accepting without even trying to understand the hook here, the main character's aging backwards, the film packs several emotional wallops, particularly the long end sequence with the amazing acting of Cate Blanchett.The audience I saw this with was stunned at the finale. And so was I. Likely the film that will sweep the awards season.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Poetry moving backwards...,"I really don't understand all the critics attacking this gem of modern cinematography accusing this movie to be too abstract, too unusual, too unrealistic to be intense, moving, beautiful. Who said that cinema is all about telling true stories, about true events or true characters? We have emotions inside, and, as humans, we need to have our emotions, our feelings, touched by a movie that sometimes makes us think about things greater than us, like life, like all the tiny passing moments of pure joy, like the people we love, like the people we loose during a lifetime. This, and much, much more is ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"". There is so much stuff, so much content beneath the surface of this wonderful adult tale.The direction of David Fincher is absolutely amazing. We've got already a demonstration of his talents with perfect movies like ""Fight Club"", or his underrated vision of ""Alien 3"", the research of perfection, the colors always gray-shaded, the perfect photography of the scenes. This movie is no exceptions: it's perfect. All the scenes in all the sceneries (from old New Orleans, to Russia, passing through a moving set in the ocean).The special effects are incredible: u can't tell where there's CGI here and where there's only an incredible makeup work to transform Brad Pitt in an old man then in a teenager, or the makeup work on Cate Blanchett (acting beautifully in her role).The movie is long, yes, but it's about 3 hours of poetry, an hymn to life and to people we love,and about the short, but intense,pure moment of life. All moving backwards, like the clock at the train station at the beginning of the movie. Poetry moving backwards.All this magic is decorated with a beautiful soundtrack performed by Alexandre Desplat.In conclusion, ""Benjamin Button"" wants to tell us a story: a story about life seen with the eyes of a man aging backwards, of an almost impossible love, and a story about the endless, infinite, cycle of life.It's impossible to not appreciate such ambitious, yet strange movie. It's impossible to remain cold at the end of this intense, magic voyage through time. It's a movie everybody must see, because everybody must see life through the eyes of Benjamin Butt once...at least...10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Another Gump,"I love epics. Movies should be made like that: sweeping tales that light up the big screen. But they're not, at least not the ones that the Academy seems to like these days. The Reader, Milk and Frost/Nixon- all of which have been nominated for Best Picture at this year's Oscars- are more HBO-style made-for-TV movies than Epics (which is not to say that they aren't well-made). The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is unabashedly epic, and had it not been for Slumdog Millionaire, it would have, despite its shortcomings, been my favorite film of the year.I've always suspected that the really great looking actors & actresses suffer from an acting- handicap: their perfect good looks lead us to think of them in terms of gods & goddesses, and therefore any effort by them to play human beings is seen as flawed.This works well for those who can't act at all- like Salman Khan- as it compensates amply for their lack of skill; but for those who can act- and I mean, really act- it's nothing short of a curse. Brad Pitt falls in the latter category. He is perhaps the most underrated actor of our time- principally because of his extraordinary good looks. No wonder he opted to act in a film in which the first-shot of him is as a horribly deformed baby that even his father doesn't want. And then of course, he begins to grow younger and also, more and more like the actual Brad Bitt...The trick, I guess, was for Mr. Pitt to look the various ages he portrays in- and as- Benjamin Button. The wizardry of special effects can only do so much; the rest was up to him, really. (Remember Dustin Hoffman in Little Big Man- back when they didn't have this kind of technology.) He has terrific company in the form of three extremely gifted actresses: his mother (Taraji Henson), the love of his life (Cate Blanchett), and his fling (Tilda Swinton). Julia Ormond plays his daughter, but she hardly ever leaves the room. In any event, we remember them all having done these kind of roles before- but not so for Mr. Pitt. (Not that he hasn't but we just don't remember him doing them.)The entire premise of the film, taken from a 1920s short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, seems to me to be needlessly weird; despite going through great pains to make it look believable, it simply doesn't. After all, wouldn't a man who defies the most fundamental law of nature- that we must all grow old and die- attract our news-obsessed society's attention? Mr. Button, however, does not, leading a relatively uneventful unnoticed existence. Also, the whole business of a 90 year old man falling in love with a 9 year old girl edges a bit too close to bigotry for my taste.But the single greatest flaw with this film is that we've already seen it before. Not one with the same title of course, but the way the tale is told. In case you are wondering, let me give you a clue. Two words: Eric Roth. He was the guy who wrote the screenplay for Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump. The only real difference between the two films is that while Mr. Gump grows older; Mr. Button becomes younger. Everything else- every single scene, every single character they come into contact with, every single shot, even the plot- are almost identical. The Academy has already honored Forrest Gump once before; there is, in my opinion, no point in doing so again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
As simple as life can get!,"Simplicity is the keyword of this movie which tackles many themes such as love, inevitability, individuality, perfection, and mortality. I could easily write a million pages criticizing the movie and explaining the themes, but there's no need to, because what will be written is simply what we face everyday i.e. life!! Some think that it was too long, and I have to admit, I thought that too, but a deeper look made me realize that it was all part of the intended effect; our life sometimes could seem long and boring and insignificant, but by the end of the day we realize that every single person we meet, ever single word we hear or say, and every single look... count.

Lifeless.,"Hated it. A lot. From the trailer it looked like Button was going to be an epic, self-indulgent way too overly sensationalized mess of a film. Now I don't go into a film expecting anything good or bad, so don't think that I went into it determined to hate it. And even if I had, it wouldn't be for those reasons. Although there are a few moments of the film that fit that description (the Mr. Gateau story, for example), most of the film was more low-key. However what the film did turn out to be was unbearably dull. There was no emotion, no intrigue, no life. It's a shame that a story which is fascinating on paper could turn into a picture that is so absolutely lifeless. The performances, the characters themselves, the direction, the screenplay. All of it contributed to a completely comatose picture. The visuals weren't even impressive. Sure they weren't bad, but they sure as hell weren't anything above average. And thus Button is just another highly-praised film that's making a dent in the awards season that I simply don't understand the praise for, at all.

More simple than one would expect,"I'll say right away, that for me the movie was a little disappointing. Only because it is David Fincher (director of Fight Club) and I expected something a little more bizarre and a little more stylish. Aside from the completely random draw to the movie here, which is the fact that Benjamin Button was born old and is growing younger, what we have here is a very simple love story/tragedy and nothing more than that. But putting that personable flaw aside from the start, what we have here is a very impressive love story.First of all, whatever kind of make up effects/digital editing they used to make Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett look older and younger was f***ing phenomenal. Just after the old man baby phase, when Brad Pitt is a ""100 year old man in a body the size of a 7 year old"" - it is ridiculous looking! In a good way! Also, when Cate Blanchett is supposed to be about 23 years old, i don't know HOW they did it, but they made her look HOT! Normally i think Cate Blanchett is hideous, but somehow they altered her face just enough to do it.Of course all of the performances are impressive, but that is expected from these two. The script and story is heavy and emotional, I dropped a tear a couple of times. We get a nice character out of that creepy redheaded guy with the moustache in the movie Happiness. He is probably the best comedic relief in the film.The movie works. You feel it throughout. The ups and mostly downs. I didn't get bored in the 2 1/2 hour running time, although some people I went with did. It was interesting to watch how things unfold mentally for a withered old man with a little boys brain, and vice versa - but I felt that it wasn't enough. They should have dug deeper into these perspectives instead of rushing through them and focusing so much on the basic love story between the two characters.If you're looking for something psychologically challenging, you can skip this one. If you want to see good acting, feel a couple butterflies in your tummy and a couple tears in your eye, then this one's for you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

The most extraordinary condition in the history of mankind is treated as a crushing bore,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is one of the most confounding pieces of screen writing that I have experienced in quite a while. Here is a movie built on the idea of a man who has the most phenomenal affliction in human history and surrounds him with characters that treat it as if it were a new haircut.The man is Benjamin (Brad Pitt) who is was born in 1918 the size of a normal infant but possessed all the infirmities of a man in his 80s. He ages backwards (apparently though a magic of a clock that runs backwards) and through the progress of this affliction, we see him spend his toddler years in a nursing home with wrinkles and liver spots then grow into his middle age and on down to his youth and develop the feeble mind of an elderly man when he reaches his preteen years.At birth his mother dies and his father gives him away to a nursing home where he is cared for by the loving caretaker Queenie (Taraji P. Henson). All around Benjamin are elderly tenants like himself who die with a sad regularity. Benjamin notices those around him getting older while at the same time his skin clears, his stooped walk straightens and he has fewer aches and pains.Somewhere in this elderly state, he meets a child named Daisy who will become his lifelong love. She arrives in his life periodically on her way to be a great ballet dancer. We know, inevitably, that they will be in love and that their best moments will take place when they eventually reach the same age. We wait patiently for the two to seriously begin discussing his bizarre aging process but when they do, they don't discuss it with any depth or any reason. They might as well have been discussing their wedding day.No one else really gets to the business of questioning Benjamin's predicament either and that's troubling because here is the most amazing thing that has ever happened in the history of the universe, a man is aging backwards and all through the movie, those closest to Benjamin treat this incredible miracle as if it weren't all that unusual. This is absolutely the wrong note on which to approach this premise. All through the movie I kept waiting for a doctor to examine Benjamin and turn him into a bit of medical history, but no, we follow his life's journey as he takes a job working on a tugboat, fights in the second world war and eventually shares a brief love affair with Daisy. Ho-hum.The fact that Benjamin's journey through life is so ordinary and unexceptional makes his aging process seem all the more like a movie gimmick. The story was written by Eric Roth who also adapted Forrest Gump, another story of an afflicted man's journey through life. But while Forrest dealt with his affliction and used it as a catalyst for an extraordinary life, Benjamin just seems to be running out the clock. We know what will happen to him (which is extraordinary when it finally happens) but what happens in between is paced so slowly and features events that are so unexceptional that we feel like we're following his life in real time.Benjamin Button was directed by David Fincher, a brilliant talent who has made films that I have loved like Se7en, Zodiac and Panic Room and some that I didn't like Fight Club and Alien 3. What all of these films have in common is a bold visual style that's fun just to look at. He has made bad films but he has never made a boring one. What he achieves with Benjamin Button is a different visual palette for every decade of Benjamin's life and an amazing array of visual effects to transform the tall, good looking Brad Pitt into a doddery old man who is about 5 feet tall and carries him through all the stages of the man's reversed age. But all the special effects and make-up don't mean a thing if there isn't a workable story to put around them and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button contains a lackluster story within an extraordinary idea.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

A Magical Epic,"It's no surprise that this movie came out during Oscar season. Everything about it just screams ""Academy Awards."" The rhythmic, but not too wordy, dialogue, the epic scale, the unfolding storyline, this one's got it all. I've criticized a few movies for being manufactured to be Oscar darlings. While I won't deny that that's probably what happened with ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"" but this is much better because it doesn't SEEM like it.""I was born under extraordinary circumstances..."" Had this movie been a megahit (and perhaps it will, having been freed of the shadow cast by the indie-favorite Best Picture winner ""Slumdog Millionaire""), these words would be as iconic as ""I'm king of the world!"" Still, that's the best place to start the description of the movie. It's also the best place to end it. This is one of those movies that's all about the premise, and what the filmmakers do with it. Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) was born an old man, and grows younger by the day. It's a fascinating premise, and the filmmakers do everything that can be done with it.The acting is terrific. I've never been a Brad Pitt fan, and the tabloid obsession with him and Angelina Jolie makes me like him even less. But this has got to be his best performance. He's reflective, and ably portrays such an unusual character. There's no sense of showboating, or that he's ""acting."" We don't see Brad Pitt as Benjamin, we simply see Benjamin. Cate Blanchett is a goddess among actresses. Except for perhaps Meryl Streep, I can't think of anyone who can match her versatility. Therefore it is reasonable to expect that Blanchett would be terrific as Benjamin's lover Daisy, and Blanchett delivers. Taraji P. Henson is solid as Queenie, and while I wouldn't have been one to demand that she get nominated, I'm not going to complain. Tilda Swinton is underused as Elizabeth Abbott, the woman with whom Benjamin has his first fling, but it's not a very important part. A movie like this is filled with bit parts by unknowns. But for me, one of them really struck me. That is Jared Harris, who plays Captain Mike. While he may be a drunk, Captain Mike is really the one who teaches Benjamin the most about life. He's a likable character who really resonates with the viewer (not to mention Benjamin).Acting aside, this film belongs to David Fincher. Known mainly for his visual style, Fincher has gradually become known for other aspects of directing. The tone changes throughout the film, but Fincher knows this. It goes from magical to dramatic to a conclusion with pathos. Fincher has complete control over it.However, Fincher has not lost his ability to create awe-inspiring visuals. From the dream-like cinematography to the jaw-dropping visual effects (like the aging on the young Benjamin), they are amazing.One thing of note is that Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett looped their voices over those of their younger counterparts (though the actors adjust their voices accordingly). It creates a distance between the movement of the mouth and the timing of the audio. Some people may think that this is a mistake, but I liked it. It creates an otherworldly feel to it.Do yourself a favor, see ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."" You won't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Overdrawn boring tale dragged down by vanity of the players,"One of the few times I wanted to get up and walk out of a movie. The core concept is amazing - what if we aged backwards physically? but once we get past that, everything else falls apart. Just wanting to create another Forest Gump does not make it so.The narrative is so burdened by the vanity of the principal character that it looses its charm. Women audiences may swoon over Brad Pitt riding a bike but that has nothing to do with the story - his character would have done that in his youth even if he was aging like the rest of us.The director seems to be so overtaken by images (Lousiana setting sun) that he looses control of moving the story along.I will be scratching my head over the critical acclaim for this one for a long time!",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

A really good drama... watch it if you can.,"THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTONThis movie is a movie that has always interested me, but I never got round to watching it until recently.The movie is about the life of Benjamin. When Benjamin was born his mother died during child birth. When his father saw the baby for the first time he was disgusted by the way he looked and left him on the steps of a house. The reason he looked so different was because Benjamin has a condition which makes him age backwards. He was born an old looking child and the older he got the younger he looked.I like the idea of this... when I first heard about it it did make me ask a lot of questions. The good thing is, they all got answered.The story was sad in places, but so happy in others. It is a drama that keeps you hooked to the TV. The movie is steady throughout. I can't remember one bit where I was bored or lost interest. The movie is quite long, it is on for 2 and a half hours, but it didn't feel that long.You really get to know the characters. Another thing I liked about this film was the fact that Benjamin was a likable guy most of the time, but from time to time he was horrible. He did things that was not too nice and even made me hate him at one point, but then he seemed very gullible at times.The acting was top class from everyone. Brad Pitt was fantastic playing Benjamin. He was even good at playing an old and young man. Cate Blanchett did a fantastic job too. I really felt sorry for her most throughout. Her character went though a lot and didn't deserve what she went though.Finally I have seen a movie where the make up is amazing. Brad Pitt actually looked old without the make up looking plastic. I have never seen make up this well done... in fact I am not sure it was make up or just computer effects that made him look old. It was just too good.This is a great film that I will watch again in the future. I am not surprised that it won numerous awards. They are all well deserved.I will give this film 7 out of 10.""It's a funny thing about comin' home. Looks the same, smells the same, feels the same. You'll realize what's changed is you.""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"Life isn't measured in minutes, but in moments .","Adapted from the 1920s story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" follows the life of Benjamin Button, who is born with the appearance and physical limitations of a man who is 87 years old. Abandoned in a nursing home by his father, Benjamin begins aging backward on the outside of his body. While in the home, he meets Daisy, a young aspiring ballerina. As the film progresses, the two fall in love, while struggling to deal with the issue of one growing younger while the other grows older.My favorite film from David Fincher is ""Zodiac."" By the end of the film, I found it quite surprising ""Benjamin Button"" wasn't all as great as people hype it to be. Don't be surprised when you find this film not as great as you imagined it to be. The hype makes the film much more than what it really is. However, that doesn't make the film bad. In fact, it's really fantastic, but, again, not as good as you would've wanted it to be.What starts off on a mediocre note, ""Benjamin Button"" is like other films you've seen before. You see this old woman, Daisy, in this hospital. Her daughter is sitting next to her. The mother tells her to read off a diary, written by the man she loved. Then starts off the journey of the film. While the story goes on, once in awhile, or quite often, the story stops and goes back to present day. I found that quite annoying. It does break the flow of the film but I guess all movies do that.Filled with flaws like that, ""Benjamin Button"" is not a perfect film. The film is awfully long that I found some points in the film very pointless and have no meaning to the story whatsoever. However, I guess the point of the film is to show the life of Benjamin and not the romance tale between him and Daisy, which I thought would've been just as good a movie, making it probably forty-five minutes shorter. This being said, the best parts of the whole movie was the romance tale between Benjamin and Daisy.As the film progresses, the film turns mediocre to great until the brilliant last act. The fairy tale has a very timeless feel to it and I guess that's what made the film so great. Brad Pitt does a great job portraying Benjamin at various ages. When Cate Blanchett comes in, she, as well, does a great job with her role. Supporting roles like Taraji P. Henson and even cameo roles like Tilda Swinton do their best for the movie.Like Fincher's previous work, ""Benjamin Button"" has a great look throughout the film, portraying different pieces of time fantastically and believably. On the same level, the costumes are great as well as the special effects. In the end, ""Benjamin Button"" is not perfect, but I didn't care. It's a fantastic film filled with flaws and it's proud of that fact. I think it's a great fairy tale for everyone, excluding kids, to see. While not the best film of the year, it's pretty high up there as well as being the most ambitious work from Fincher.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Poignant tale of life,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a polarising film that lies firmly within the Magical Realism genre, which often straddles the line between whimsy and nonsense and often struggles to find a point to the strangeness. In this case, the film tells the story of Benjamin Button who ages backwards and is told in many vignettes, along the lines of Forrest Gump. Brad Pitt does a great job as the main character showing all of life's stages and how his reversed aging tears apart any relationship he can make before he can get attached to a new life. At points he makes attempts to get reattached to those he finds familiar like his mother or Daisy, but these inevitably never work out, despite his best efforts to settle in a life that can work for him. Within these stories, the ""point"" of the magical realism becomes clear as he has to value and cherish what he has before it goes away, just like all of us. It's poignant and touching, but not a masterpiece due to some scattered elements that slow down the film and don't really connect, especially the framing narrative. Visually, the effects portraying Benjamin Button may have been impressive at the time but they are very distracting and rubber-faced by today's standards. A strong 7/10 but could have been better with more streamlining and emotional connections between the vignettes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Good but could have been great,"I like many of you had tremendous high hopes going into this film, and now after seeing it can honestly say it was good, but not great. Pitt, Blanchett and many others give excellent performances in the film, the film is beautifully shot however it never gets you to shed that all important tear. I stilled loved the film, and I think it's a front runner for best pic, but I can't help but wonder what could have been with a few minor tweaks. My take away is that life is composed of many subtle things that ultimately shape how we end up, and this movie delivers that. The theatre was packed, go out and see this with someone you care about it will definitely give you something to discuss.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Read after watching the movie only (SPOILERS) To Help you all understand,"All of you are critiquing this movie and have no idea what a good film is. When telling a good story or directing a good movie, you must leave things up for discussion or interpretation. This wasn't transformers, it was a film that allows different people to grasp different feelings from it. Many themes can be found in this film such as ""Don't judge a book by it's cover"" - People assumed that Benjamin was an old man who was going to die any day but inside he was as young as a baby.""The separation between body and mind""  Although Benjamin's BODY had aged backwards, his mind had been aging forward just like everyone else. Which can be seen by the fact that a 5 year old child has Alzheimer. This shows you how powerful the mind is, that even when everything is reversed it is still strong enough to function properly.Ingenious  To have a child grow up backwards, all alone with nobody to relate too. He is with the old people who have seen it all and are content with the confines of their nursing home. Benjamin can't sit still like that, he has the mind of child and wants to explore his surroundings. He seeks the opportunity to take chances, like working on the boat for a day or having drinks with his real father, traveling the world and joining the navy.Due Date  Other than terminally ill patience, nobody ever knows when they will pass. Benjamin knows his whole life, how much time he has left in this world. As he gets younger and younger, the countdown continues to the point where he knows he will eventually run out of time. 0  infinity is how we look at a normal life but Benjamin's was 80  0. He knew that barring some type of tragedy that he had exactly so much time left.Relationship  Benjamin begins his romantic life in a backwards fashion as well. While many older men find themselves incapable of procuring a women based on their looks or abilities they have to pay for the company of a stranger. All the while Benjamin is having fun but longs to be with Daisy the one he loves. The only problem is that Benjamin and Daisy both love each other and at one time or another when they do consummate their love they both want to feel good about who they are at that point. ( This can be seen when Benjamin turns down Daisy when she visits home initially because he feels old and she looks beautiful. The reverse happens when Benjamin looks younger and Daisy is all banged up in the hospital after her accident and spurns Benjamin.) But finally when she is well she finds Benjamin and is ready to be with him.Love  Benjamin and Daisy love each other when he is an old man and she is a child and all through their lives the continue to love each other all the way through to when he is a young child and Daisy is taking care of him. Love knows no bounds and no age.Symbolism  Every time Benjamin's life is about to change or progress there, is some type of clock in the picture or the noise of a clock ringing or changing an hour.The clock in the beginning that roles in reverse seems to be directly connected with the life of Benjamin Button. As the clock roles backwards so does Benjamin's life. The only other person place or thing that is on the same page as Benjamin is the clock. It is almost like a countdown to the end of his life and the only person place or thing that Benjamin can relate too.Another symbolic point is the introduction of the humming bird. The Humming bird's wing pattern is that of a figure eight, which is the symbol of infinity. After the boat captain passes away in the attack Benjamin looks at sea and sees a humming bird fly in his direction. This symbolizes that even though he is dead, that he lives on in Benjamin because he shared his stories with him. Later on in the movie after Daisy's daughter figures out that Benjamin is her father and that she had unknowingly met him before she finishes the book and we see the humming bird. This is symbolic that Benjamin now lives on through his daughter because she has heard his story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button...... Perfect.,"First off, let me start by saying that a 10/10 is not enough. Never have I cried so hard at the end of a film. I even cam home no more than half an hour ago and cried on my bed. This movie really gets to you, and I know that this may sound a bit cliché, but it has everything an excellent film could want. Comedy, drama, romance, mystery. I know some people out there may not agree with me, (like that butt - hole roger ebert who only gave it 2 and a half stars!) however I am finding it difficult to put into words how great this film is, as emotion has swarmed over me. The Curious Case Of Benjamin button is now easily in my top 5 greatest movies of all time. To not see this movie would be a grave mistake. I am so yearning to read the original book. I know this review/comment may sound like someone rambling on but this movie, without a doubt, is perfect. That's the only word I can use to describe The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button...... P-e-r-f-e-c-t. I don't just highly recommend this movie, I hearteningly implore you... nay, beg you to at least watch this film once, as it will leave you swept off your feet with vast amounts of emotion. And that's all i have to say about that.Adios ! Y'all",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Life In Reverse,"It's Christmas Night. I have just returned from seeing what is easily the Best Film of 2008, and though there are some heavyweight contenders (or so I've heard), they would all have to go pretty far to beat THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMNIN BUTTON. I have seen MILK, and as close as that comes to taking the cake, it still has its work cut out for it when being compared to this bizarre, engrossing and ultimately moving tale of the life of one extraordinary man.David Fincher (SE7EN, ZODIAC, THE GAME, FIGHT CLUB) has just officially floored me. He would be the last director whose name would come to my mind when seeing a character- driven tale of such life-affirming power. Spielberg, yes; Chris Columbus, probably; Rob Reiner or Ron Howard, without a doubt, but David FINCHER? This movie is going to change his fortunes as a director.But not his alone. Brad Pitt officially joins the company of Newman, Redford and other memorable screen hunks whose status looms large in our consciousness not just as matinée idols, but as real ACTORS. As for Cate Blanchette, I've never doubted her acting ability, and she matches and compliments Brad scene-for-scene with a grace and subtlety that makes her other work pale by comparison. And for her, that is a stunning achievement.As for the rest of the cast, they all make me glad that I am not a voting member of the Academy: Taraji Henson (HUSTLE AND FLOW), Jason Flemyng (INDIAN SUMMER), Jared Harris, the luminous Tilda Swinton...I would never be able to single out just one of them as ""best"", because each brings their own special 'something' to the table that this tale would've suffered so greatly without. Eric Roth, who did such an amazing job with the screenplay for FOREST GUMP has triumphed again, and this should be reflected at Oscar time as well.I don't want to give away a lot of the details, and even if I tried, I don't want to dilute your experience of seeing this film with some mundane attempt to describe how wonderful, sad, hysterically funny and moving it is overall. Simply saying that BENJAMIN BUTTON is the story about a man who lives his life in reverse, is like saying that ROOTS was the story about a slave. Or GONE WITH THE WIND was about a war. Or CITIZEN KANE was about a man who ran a newspaper.The less you know going in, the more astonished you'll be when you have seen this in its entirety - the FIRST time. Don't be daunted by the nearly three-hour running time. Like the best parts of your own life lived, it goes by in the blink of an eye.Well, mercifully, I will cut my senseless babbling short here. I only ask, no, BEG you to be sure not to wait for the DVD. Let that be the fate of all other movies you see from this year. But this one? Get to a theater and see it NOW. And take family and friends as well. It's the best holiday present you will give them....EVER.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Beautiful,"Some years have passed since I watched this film. Nevertless, it's still fresh in my memory for various reasons: 1- The theme of this movie is powerful: time and how we spend it in life. The evolution in the relations that Benjamin establishes with every single soul that he meets are quite enjoyable to watch. Even with the character of Cate Blanchett we can observe some interesting dynamics: sometimes we are not destined to be with the great love of our lives. Or at least, not in the fashion that we may suppose.2- The acting. I was quite stunned to see Brad Pitt in a role that made me look every single minute of the film. Cate Blanchett is quite brilliant and charming as in every other movie of her career.3- Maybe the most important of all: this film made me cry so hard (specially during the death of B.Button) Worth seeing, definitely. But be warned, you may cry so bring tissues.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Something New Handled With Ease,"The curious case of benjamin button is totally a fresh concept with two powerhouses of talent leading the frame and subtle direction leading its to its glory.Talking about screenplay, this must be said that while the story is groundbreaking, the screenplay although being great doesn't match its glory and loses it in the second half. This isn't to say that the writer just did an average job. In reality, the film's plot and detailed script comes as a relief. Probably one of the finest from the past year.The film has been directed with enough brilliance and the way Fincher pulled off a very masterful film while keeping the atmosphere subtle is brilliant. Managing the film, the way it has been was tricky, and due to Fincher's amazing talent, the film does just that.Talking about the performances Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett did an amazing job, however these are not the performances their careers will be remembered for.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a refreshing concept, acted and made in the equally refreshing manner, however the film runs for way too long....",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Terrific movie!,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"", it is a sweeping epic of a motion picture, and is superbly executed by all involved. The film is very touching, and you become quite taken with the characters, particularly Benjamin, wonderfully portrayed by Brad Pitt.Much like ""Meet Joe Black"", it's such a good movie that you hardly notice the long running time, about three hours. To me, that's one sign of a movie very well done, when it's long, but still feels short because of how good it is.The scene with Benjamin on the Triumph motorcycle is absolutely iconic, and I think the film is testament to how talented and versatile Brad Pitt is as an actor. I would definitely recommend this movie to others, that's why I felt compelled to write this review! I am very much looking forward to seeing what Mr. Pitt has in store for us next.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Best ever,"OK...Probably the best ever seen movie for me, after Forrest Gump. I think the most important thing, why so many people are so interested in this movie, is the curiosity of what would they do in Benjamin's place? Is this worse or better to born old and die young?I think the story is also good, because it's left without beeing chasen from crazy scientists or something like that, becasuse of his up side down life. It's just a wonderful love story with Brad and Cate in best form, I would say.The story is long enough, which has funny, sad and love moments. Also the end, when he recognises her, is also very touchable.I think that IMDB rating doesn't match how good the movie really is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Very well developed plot but too long,"This movie is in my opinion an Oscar winner. The acting was very well performed, the music beautifully fit the scenes, and the story is well developed. If you are a big fan of Fitgerald's short story novels, you will find this movie very satisfying. I felt the movie started out very slow and there were some parts that did not seem necessary and only made the movie longer. For instance, they stopped too many times in the middle of the story and showed us the dying woman and her daughter scene, which at some point distracted me and cut the flow of the Benjamin story. But overall, I came out of the theater with a smile and a thought in my mind...",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Stunning!,"This year i have been under the misconception that the films nominated in this years ""Best Picture"" category at the Oscars are not up to the standard of recent years. Don't get me wrong , ""Milk"" and ""Slumdog Millionaire"" are good films but are they great? Not in my opinion , but last night i watched a movie that blew me away.A stunning film that lives up to it's hype and goes straight into my top 10 films of all time .That film is ""The Curious case of Benjamin Button"".As soon as i heard those words ""I was born under unusual circumstances."" i was hooked.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is adapted from the 1920s story by F. Scott Fitzgerald about a man who is born in his eighties and ages backwards: a man, like any of us, who is unable to stop time. We follow his story, set in New Orleans from the end of World War I in 1918, into the 21st century, following his journey that is as unusual as any man's life can be.Directed by David Fincher and starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Benjamin Button is a grand tale of a not-so-ordinary man and the people and places he discovers along the way, the loves he finds, the joys of life and the sadness of death, and what lasts beyond time.I love films that bring out emotion in me. I'm not the most open person at the best of times as friends and family will confirm I'm sure! So when i get emotion over a film it has to be good.Watching ""The Curious case of Benjamin Button"" makes you realise how lucky you are to have the love of friends and family and to have a lifetime of that support. The idea of a baby being born an old man who gradually gets younger is a brilliant one yet tragic. It instantly raises so many questions. questions that do not always have pleasant answers.Brad Pitt is fantastic as strangely youngering ( is that a word or is there a word that is the opposite to ageing?) man. His screen presence is mesmerising throughout which is not easy considering the length of the movie.There are been many plaudits for the special affect and they are totally deserved but it's not so much the affects of when Benjamin Button and Daisy are old it's the ones when they are young. How they got Brad Pitt and Kate blanchett to look 20 is amazing.There is one scene in particular that rang so true for me. It was when Button explains the circumstances of how Daisy broke her leg and how if just one single thing like a Taxi Driver being delayed by 5 seconds because of a series of trivial events had not happened , her life could have been so different and that is so true for all of us .What if your father had not gone out the night he met your mother because of something trivial like a car breaking down or a minor illness? Think about it.As Benjamin Button says "" Your life is defined by its opportunities... even the ones you miss.""The last twenty minutes is gut wrenchingly sad .When Button goes from a young man to a child and he loses his memory of Daisy i found myself filling up.The curious case of Benjamin Button might not win the big one tonight at the Oscars but in my mind it has already won. It's such a magical , mystical , gem of a movie that will live with me for a very long time.10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
A Magical Experience!!!,"Being a fan and an admirer of David Fincher's movies like Fight Club, Social Network, Zodiac and The Girl with a dragon Tattoo, I decided to catch with the Brad Pitt starer 'the Curious Case of Benjamin Button' based on a 1921 short story. A totally new concept is what I witnessed after watching this movie thereby considering this endeavor to be Pitt's best till date. In the year 2005, Caroline goes to see her mother Daisy lying on her deathbed in a hospital in New Orleans. Aware that she is not going to live long, Daisy makes Caroline read a diary which contains the story of Benjamin Button. After end of World War 2, In November 1918, a mother died giving birth to a boy. Since the infant is old, wrinkled and ugly, he gets abandoned by his father Thomas Button by leaving him on the stairs of an old age home. The mistress of the old age home Queenie takes care of the little baby clearly getting over the fact that he is ugly in appearance, considering him to be the child of God. The doctor claims that the baby boy won't live long since his body condition is weak and deteriorating. But Fate has something else in the store for Benjamin (as he is so named by Queenie). Throughout the film, Benjamin follows a reverse aging pattern. Rather than becoming old, he starts becoming younger than before. The prime soul of the film is Benjamin's friend Daisy who goes on to become the pivotal part of the movie. Right from 1918 to present day 2005, the plot goes forward recreating every era it witnesses. The movie is mainly about Benjamin's life and his struggle in coping up with the world that looks at him again and again in a way which makes him realize that he is different. The film is about the unconditional love which Benjamin and Daisy share and how they seemingly realize they can't be together for long due to Benjamin's curious case. The film contains scenes which triggers emotion in the viewers. Pitt escapes off with a fine performance. Cate Blanchett who plays the young Daisy also gets on very well. Overall, a big bow to Fincher for gifting us this magical experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
elephant in the room,"a potentially good movie; nice quiet performance by pitt, carried by getting more from blanchette, misused and underused ormond, nicely shot, seems quite promising- except for the elephant that keeps charging into the room- the reverse age thing; you have to buy, or overlook, the premise of reverse aging, but then they keep hitting you with it in the wrong ways- like he starts as a 4'8"" cripple who reverse ages to a 6-foot paragon; old people do sometimes shrink an inch or two, but not a foot or two; there are too many times when pitt is supposedly 10 years younger, but shown with a more furrowed brow, and blanchette is 20 years older and not a wrinkle; it's a though the continuity girl lost it- the one on the set who is supposed to see that when the cigarette has burned down to the filter, the close-up takes don't show it freshly lit; also suffers from been there done that, a la dorian gray and others; and the conundrum of a baby dying by becoming younger? as though unborn is dying? doesn't quite work metaphysically; so as you get hooked in, an usual love story, through the ages, even backwards, the movie keeps hitting you with implausible and impossible conditions instead of brushing them aside and keeping the story and your attention on track",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"Disjointed, stupefying nonsense","I saw it up there on the screen but I didn't connect with it. It was a beautifully mounted movie with nothing interesting to say -- not to me, anyway. I did my best to accept the central premise as a fantasy not to be questioned -- I mean when I found myself wondering how the body of an infant born with the skin and the arthritis and the cataracts of an old man might conveniently be blessed with growth spurts in old age followed by shrink spurts in youth ... nah, I decided there's no need to go down that road. Repeat after me: The movie is a fantasy. Benjamin Button was born old and progressed to infancy and that's the movie's premise and I accepted it. And with that behind me, I wanted to see the life of Benjamin Button developed into a story that would fascinate -- that might offer insights on life as viewed by someone living it backwards.Instead I got a mishmash of vignettes told in flashback from a dying woman's hospital room in New Orleans -- with EEK! HURRICANE KATRINA! bearing down to no apparent dramatic purpose whatsoever. I saw a pygmy and a brothel and a Russian beauty and a boat and lightning strikes and a broken leg and a war and ... Cate Blanchett kept getting older while Brad Pitt kept getting younger and by the time Benjamin Button met his daughter she was an adolescent and so was he ... and it was just one melancholy development after another and ... how in the world am I supposed relate to any of this disjointed, stupefying nonsense? Here's the movie: Benjamin Button's friends and family grew older and died as he grew younger and died. Period, that's it, no more, no lessons learned, no insights gained, no emotional connection, not even any marveling by the world of science at what was happening to this unique individual.Well, OK, this happened too: Some young man died in WWI so his blind father built a clock that ran backwards and I never figured out how this related substantively to the rest of the movie. I do know, though, that it is not the nature of New Orleanians to replace ornate, historic, quirky old railway station clocks with digital monstrosities. Bleh. I truly regret that I invested time in this mistake of a movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"Intriguing Premise, But...","This movie is a visual feast. It is lush with the images of America in all its incarnations from the early 20th Century. I agree with Roger Ebert that the premise is also the thing that short circuits the film. Once Benjamin comes to realize what is happening to him, he now has to play by a set of rules that are not of his own making. All relationships of any substance are clouded by his fate. Even taking the premise about living in the here and now because we all eventually meet our end, doesn't help me. The sadness that hangs over the entire movie (which is awfully long for drama), with all of the implications of outliving virtually everyone, make it a hard sell.Even with all of that, I thought there were wonderful performances by just about everyone. I am a great Brad Pitt fan and felt that he was masterful in his performance. I was pleased that the transitioning of his being wasn't accelerated. The gradual movement back to his youth is subtle and the make-up and special effects people are to be congratulated. They also integrate his mental acuity with his physical change. I could go on. I just believe that this is a good, engaging film, but it was doomed somewhat from the start.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
A Worthy Film Experience,"Just saw the film last night and liked it. It's got some very poignant moments and is a thoughtful reflection on life and love. The aging backwards is an unusual technique but not a distracting one, as some would have us believe, and ultimately the film stays with you, and you leave the theater reflecting on your own mortality, grateful for the time you do have... My only real complaint is that the dialogue with a few different characters (the dying Daisy, for one) at different times was inaudible--a problem both with the miking and the actor's delivery. On such a sumptuous production this was very irritating, as all other details had been tended to. The director should have had a grip on this!",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"Good, but not the best","I watched this movie since David Fincher was my favorite director. His films were likely to have large surprisings at the end of films, such as Se7en and Fight Club, and that is just what I liked. This ""Benjamin Button"" has nothing as such, but is well-made enough to satisfy the audiences.""Benjamin Button"" has some common factors with the film ""Forrest Gump"". For example, both films serve us a lot of beneficial suggestions through a very unique man and his unique life. Both are highly excellent films in the cinema history, I suppose.I love this film's implications, that life has many meetings and many partings, that somebody familiar may disappear suddenly and may never appear in my life again, and that life is always wonderful even though unhappy. All messages might be ordinary and stereotype to you, but they get to be valuable and colorful again, due to coming through a special man's life and eyes, named Benjamin Button.Nonetheless, there is a disappointing factor to me, which is the fact that the film would have been more fabulous, if some items had worked in more effective manners. For example, the items such as hummingbird and the great clock turning counterclockwise do not appeared in the story so much, though they could be very good metaphors related with human life, moments, and Benjamin's curious way back to birth.Well, as a whole, I love this film so much, because I can feel the creators' politeness to this film. Benjamin and Daisy really fall in love each other, only for several years when their lives and ages are crossing. The period seemed too short for the fateful 2, which was highly moving me.In a word, this film is awesome fairy tale for adults.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"... But when it comes to the end , You have to let go","The last film of David Fincher is a brilliant and masterfully made movie and is a huge step ahead of previous films made by master(David Fincher) . maybe for those who go to Theaters for fun it wont be how they expected but for those who love Cinema and are Students of Cinema , it is a FILM SCHOOL , for sure . I wonder how the sequence of Mr Gateau , The Sequence of Daisy's accident and of course The sequence of Death of Thomas Button are all well made . just see that how sentences is following the shots like a poem : "" You could be mad as a mad dog at the way things went .... but when it comes to the end you have to let go "" Some Directors have a team and when you see the cinematography , editing or you hear the soundtracks , you know that the film is good because they are there to help the director and to inject their own genius into the movie .

Don't believe the hype.,"Don't be fooled. Many critics have gone on record calling David Fincher's ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" the year's best film. It's attracting tons of Oscar buzz as this review is being written. I walked into Fincher's film with high expectations, but I was let down. NOTHING about this movie screams ""Best Picture"". With a recycled screenplay, too many misfired metaphors and a generally gimmicky, confused premise, no amount of brilliant acting or technology can save Ben Button.The premise is clever. Primarily based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the film chronicles the life of Benjamin Button, played by Brad Pitt, who's mother dies during child birth, and who's father abandons him on the doorsteps of an old-folks home when he is born with the appearance of an elderly man. The home, run by a black maid named Queenie, takes him in as a son, and people begin to see that he is in fact aging backwards, from old to young. Its a premise that, in the right hands, could have been expanded brilliantly to reveal poetic ideas life and death, but, starting with the screenplay, a series of mistakes cause the film to sink.People need to accept that Benjamin Button and Forrest Gump, both written by the talented Eric Roth, are fundamentally the same movie. There must be at lease 30 similarities. Both men are southern gentlemen, both have a miracle moment walking for the first time, both spend time on a boat, both spend time fighting a war. Additionally, both films involve a female love interest who ventures out of her home for several years to pursue a dream, while on a rocky road to find herself. These 2 movies are identical, and the film's biggest defenders will have a hard time arguing against that fact.But I'll ignore those similarities for minute, because I should assess this movie as its own work. And when looked at that way, I'll say the first word that comes to mind is preachy. Every 7 minutes, Benjamin, narrating the film, gives us a brand new metaphor about life and how its just so ""un-predictable"". There's also some completely pathetic visual poetry with a hummingbird, whose significance in the film's message I'm still unsure of.But you wanna know what's funny? For all its preaching about unpredictable events, Benjamin button lives a pretty normal life. He works on a boat, he serves in the navy in WWII, he co-owns a dance studio with his romantic interest Daisy, played by Cate Blanchett, and then he operates a toll booth. That sounds pretty average to me, and I found personally that Benjamin Button is, himself, more of a bizarre science-fiction character than a human being we could all relate to. The fact that he spends his whole life seeing his friends die off is interesting, but it seems repetitive and gimmicky by the middle of the movie.I must concede though, this film has its strengths. Technologically, the make-up and height adjustments made to Brad Pitt are astonishing, and the way that he looks like an old man getting younger and younger progressively is extraordinary. Additionally, the performances, including Pitt and Blanchett, but also Tilda Swinton as a spy's wife staying in the same motel Benjamin is, were good, although I noticed Cate Blanchett struggled horribly with a Cajun accent.I just don't get it. In a year filled with multiple competitive Oscar contenders, like The Dark Knight, Frost/Nixon, Milk, Slumdog Millionaire and Changeling, it is astonishing to me that this is the stand-out for Best Picture. Surely, Benjamin Button's technology is worthy of awards buzz. But little else is.I feel like this picture thinks itself to be better than it actually is. Why else would the structure of the story by so explicit, the production so high quality, the acting, as a whole, so good? I don't know, and come Oscar time we will see if any members of the Academy saw what I saw in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."" I hope they do.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Simply Brilliant,"From time to time there's a movie that amazes us for it excellent story, magnificent cast and more great things and that becomes instantly into a masterpiece. That's the case of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. David Fincher's latest film is one of those movies that catches you from the very beginning with its fantasy, romance, action and some moments of humor. The movie tells the interesting story of Benjamin Button, a man who starts aging backwards with bizarre consequences. The plot is convincing and very well developed by Eric Roth. David Fincher makes a magnificent work directing, although it is a two hour and a half movie, it has a fast paced rhythm making it enjoyable and it never bores you. It has excellent special effects, the makeup is wonderful, great locations, the movie is set to the perfection in the different years that occurs in the movie. The cast is simply great, Brad Pitt gives us one of his best performances ever, Cate Blanchett is fantastic as Daisy, Tilda Swinton is very convincing as Elizabeth Abott and the secondary roles of Julia Ormond (Caroline), Taraji P. Henson (Queenie) and Jason Flemyng (Thomas Button) gives a really good support to the movie. In conclusion, A very entertaining movie worth to see. It is destined to be a masterpiece and the great winner of the upcoming Academy Awards.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
The fantasy is only a detail in a stunning film about the wonder of life,"I had wanted to see ""Benjamin Button"" since I found out what it was about. I had read Fitzgerald's short story (the inspiration for this) and wanted to see just how that would transform into a three-hour film. Incidentally, the short story and film have very little to do with one another save for the title and a man named Benjamin Button who ages backwards.Incidentally again, that curiosity turns out to be the least magical part of this amazing movie. The story begins at the end of the first World War. I imagine had the story began in modern times we would have watched something akin to a Discovery Channel medical mystery in which poor Benjamin is studied by a myriad of doctors and scientists along with a handful of others who also age backwards with every fascination focused on what in the world was going on. Not here. This is a story of a man's life first and foremost. The oddity of his age is merely a detail.And that is where the magic truly comes in. I happen to be a sucker for the story that inspires me to live life to the fullest. If Benjamin is such a freak, why is it that so much of his life is relatable? Love, adventure, family, loss? I'll step away from the sentimental now. This is a finely crafted gem of a movie with first-rate acting and a direction style that prefers to mosey along with random tangents to backwards clocks and men struck by lightening. Frankly, I walked into the threatre expecting something depressing. Save for the theme of life that always seems to include death and loss, this was quite charming and even funny in spots.I thoroughly enjoyed ""Benjamin Button"". It is a beautifully made film with a stellar story. I don't know if it will be up for anything in particular when the Oscars come around, but it was satisfying, haunting, and therefore should deserve something. Bravo, all those involved.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
A different turn for Fincher,"As an aspiring filmmaker I love that a director who normally deals with violence and scum of the streets changes his tone completely to test himself. I am not sure if Fincher is the best at this story because he doesn't want to be too sappy, but he certainly isn't bad at it because he gets cinema. Now, maybe Spielberg or Zemeckis are better at this kind of story, but who cares, this is a great escapist film and the best technical achievement of the decade next too Pan's Labirynth and The Lord of The Rings series. The film doesn't stick with you as well as something like Forrest Gump, which you can't help but compare it too because they are very similar, mostly b/c they are from the same writer; If you don't know who that is then you're an idiot. I loved watching this film and the nearly three hours felt like an hour and a half. All the performances are good, and may deserve Oscar nominations, but should not win, because the technology of the film helps there performances a lot and also because in every acting category there is at least one, two, three, or four performances that were better. I think Pitt can be very good, especially with Fincher, I love Cate Blanchett, and Taraji P. Henson is awesome here. I wanted too think this was a completely great film, but I couldn't for some reason. I had problems with the film. I did not like the narrative of the story being told during Katrina from the daughter of Button(Pitt) and Daisy(Blanchett). After the film I realized it was contrived and unnecessary, even though I really liked the hummingbird at the end. Instead what they could've done is just show the hummingbird during the rain right after Button is dying. Also, I would have liked for some of the people to be a little angrier, everything was a little too melancholy and even silly, silly might be too strong but you know what I mean. I loved the Tilda Swinton chunk of the film and I especially loved the part of the film where Daisy and Button meet in the middle. The themes are strong, and the story is strong, but they are not as strong as the technique; that's why this is not the best film of the year. I made a top ten list of the year, like I do every year because I'm weird, and this ended up being 8th on my list(In Order: Slumdog Millionaire, Milk, The Dark Knight, The Wrestler, Synechdoche, Rachel Getting Married, 4 Months 3 weeks & 2 Days, and then The Curious Case)because of the lack of emotions after the film and the flaws in story telling. Not Forrest Gump or the best film of the year, but it's not that far behind and technically it probably is a greater achievement. Look out for Fincher to win Best Director at the Oscars this year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
An Unusual Tale of Aging,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is David Fincher's longest film (and it certainly feels like it), and shows his best skills as a director, but his weaknesses in adapting the screenplay. Like my previous issue with Fight Club, I loved the direction, but felt that the film was poorly adapted from the original novel/screenplay.The story of Benjamin Button's life is a great, intriguing concept for a film, and it definitely has its high points, but it also isn't quite enough to carry a nearly three-hour film. Where the film could have benefited from adding more depth to existing characters, some additional event or unnecessary character is introduced just to give viewers the impression that it feels more like a lifetime than a man's emotional and physical journey. Screenwriter Eric Roth basically transcribes the formula of his greatest work, Forrest Gump, and adapts it to Benjamin Button's curious case. It has many moments that feel inspired by Forrest Gump, and many moments that try too hard to be just like Forrest Gump. Your enjoyment of the film will depend on your enjoyment of certain parts of the story. While I enjoyed the serious, emotional moments of the characters and their emotional reactions to Benjamin's condition, other viewers may be more interested in the contrived events of his life, akin to Forrest Gump's successes, meant to prolong his journey.Another exceptional aspect of this film is the makeup and the performances. Brad Pitt may not be doing very much work, but the makeup artists have a hell of a job to do and they deliver flawlessly. Benjamin Button looks and feels complex as a result of the excellent makeup and body acting done on him. Cate Blanchett also does a great job portraying Daisy, Benjamin's lifelong love, and reacts to the situation she finds herself in realistically and emotionally. Depth is added in places you would expect, but it is lacking in places you would expect it to be. Also very pleasing and smart on Fincher's part was the ending which satisfyingly ties the film together and concludes many of the loose ends.If only the film tried less to be like Forrest Gump in reverse, the characters would have felt more realistic and the emotional payoff more earned. Even with the screenplay's faults, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button has a better overall effect on the viewer than the individual scenes do. Great cinematography, direction, makeup, and performances elevate a unique, intriguing concept with a lacking screenplay to make it one of Fincher's more emotional works, but also one of his less memorable.3.5/5 stars",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
What if we grew to be younger,"The story is kind of unique and perplexing. It lets you think and reflect about our creators and his wisdom behind letting us start of as infants and then passing through different stages from toddlers, teenagers, adults, elderly to finally close our eyes and sleep forever, instead of cming to existence and elderly and pogressing reversely.It is definitely a reflective movie. It allows us to reflect about our purpose in live and why we are here. Just because it switched the life cycle of our growth scheme, you start to think.The love story within the film have its special effect and as we engage with a relation in our childhood, the story showed that early love has its strong effect. It is maddness and then winter starts and hearts become lazy and cold, yet the love remains.The ending of the film was saddening to a great extent. You never know whether the saddness is because the lovely Benjmen died as a baby, or whether it is the idea of death is itself is the source of you getting the tears at the end. Here also we reflect about death and why when we lose some one we love we lose the reason we live for.I liked the movie as it is different from the ordinary. If you are reflective in your nature, it is definitely a simulator. It is as if you want to see how the Benjmen will grew younger and prettier. How a person who is older than you looks younger and youthful.Would it be better to die with your wife as an infant? Or as an elder person? Will this result in a different set of feelings, being on a death bed as a baby? Is it less painful? Or may be less suffering for both?It is a must see film.

Good,"This film is not to be missed. It is a masterpiece full of poignancy and beauty. I urge you to see it with an open mind. Pitt is good when he is bad and good when he is good, so no point in dwelling on him. This is the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. Pitt is a unique presence in North American cinema and hopefully will do more of these kinds of austere, gripping character pieces in the future. The film's screenplay is tight and well-written, and worthy of praise. Its complexity begins within its characters. It's a great work, everything I had hoped for in fact. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
I love it!,"The movie Benjamin Button is a masterpiece that deserves all the praise it gets. Its vibrant characters, heartwarming moments, and subtle messages about kindness and strength make it a film that everyone should watch. It teaches us that life is not always easy, but we keep moving forward despite the hardships. Through its powerful storytelling, the film reminds us that the only thing that truly matters in the end is the love we share with the people who care for us. It doesn't matter where that love came from or how it was shared; what matters is that it endures. So, if you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor and watch it.

Classic case of IMDb-hype,"Okay, so it's the big movie of this Oscar-year. But is it justifiably as good as the mountain of nominations should imply?I don't think so. Granted, the storyline is good and the movie makes you feel for the characters that are involved. But the material on hand is not that of an instant classic, straight into the top half of the IMDb top250 list. Maybe the general consensus of 8/10+ ratings on this movie is linked to the hype connected to the Oscars. Even if the movie looks great and holds its own against other films, the story just isn't THAT good. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie a lot and enjoyed watching it, but I don't believe that it warrants 13 nominations. Rant over.The acting is thoroughly enjoyable. Cate Blanchet gives 'Daisy' a real zest for life and makes her instantly likable. Her recent form as an actress really underlines the feeling that we are experiencing a class act. Move over Meryl Streep! As for Brad PittOther reviews have highlighted that he has no expression in his face, or rather just the one. However, he plays Benjamin with a certain innocence that suits him well, ""the charming do-gooder"". Button as the main protagonist is a success, but I wish that the experiences he gains and the moral of the story could have been a bit more diverse. Jason Flemyng, Jared Harris and Tilda Swinton also deliver solid supporting roles that add much to the movies appeal. Cudos to them.Not as Wow(!) as Gran Torino, Milk or Slumdog Millionaire, but a solid and enjoyable movie. Go see it, just make up your mind in the theater.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
More Of An Exercise Than  An Experience,"I hate to be the resident party-pooper, but I was left feeling cold by the end. For me, the gimmick wore off and I was left with a bunch of really sad lives, particularly the leads.The entire relationship left me puzzled. I don't know about you, dear reader, but when they first meet and he looks 70 something and she's about 7, I just sort of felt that was awkward and not right.There is some nice humor sprinkled all throughout, particularly from the aged residents of that house, and with the early scenes that introduce us to Benjamin. But as the relationship between Benjamin and Daisy transforms in the second half, it was harder to accept this big block of Hollywood cheese. Their scenes as they begin to get closer in age started to feel strained to me. There is a scene where Benjamin visits Daisy in New York, and it's just stilted and forced.I really wanted to care more about this film, but I feel like it was more an interesting exercise than a real experience that leaves us with something.For me, a 6 is where movies go that I liked in some ways, but that are near misses, and all the thick laying on of melodrama and bittersweetness finally just did the picture in.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Plenty to go by!,"This movie is a pure case of excellence by a great case, great story about turning back the clock. Benjamin Button(Brad Pitt) is a man who is born old and gets younger from time to time. He is taken care of by an African-American woman who has a heart of gold, and treats him like it was her own. To me, any woman with experiences of parenting can make the most out of the person's life by being the parent they are. When times go on, Benjamin gets younger and younger by the minute. In one time, he meets Daisy(Cate Blanchett) and gets the experience for which he will never forget. He travels to different countries, meets different people, got to see the sights he never seen, that should be an experience for anyone at any age. For Benjamin love knows no limits. This movie is close to ""Forrest Gump"", only the character has a little more sense. 5 stars!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Breathtaking.,"Having just watched this film, I can't stop thinking about it. Everything about it is simply sublime. A professional and hard to fault job as usual from Fincher, one of the great Directors. Performances from the leading two were incredible ; I couldn't take my eyes off of Cate Blanchett, even when she did get older. Locations, colour palette and score are magnificently assembled. It is a shame that this is slipping down the Top 250, it should be right up there, certainly with Slumdog Millionaire. It may well be compared to Forrest Gump, but it appeals on so many levels, and in different ways that it will make it on it's own.

One Mans Affliction As A Metaphor For Love And Loss,"First, I am struck by the originality of this story. I mean it's frickin' brilliant. But, the real brilliance is in the detail of telling a preposterous story that serves as a perfect metaphor for life's journey of love and loss.There must have been tremendous hurdles to telling this in a way that was not sensational - to make it seem relevant and not fictional. Yet, the digital effects are so natural and the seamless transitions so well done they merely serve the story and never get in the way. Brad Pitt is shear perfection, Cate Blanchett is absolutely transcendent and elegant, and Tilda Swenson is so wonderfully loving that the viewer can't help but be drawn into the shear humanity of it all. Direction and cinematography are certainly up to the same high level. I would vote for this in just about every category for the year's best.Bottomline: In a year where there are some very strong contenders for best picture I feel this is the one that rises to the top. If you miss it you will deny yourself something very special. A must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Imaginative and Thought Provoking - Beautiful,"I am certain that many have written of the superb acting, absorbing and imaginative story line and, the remarkable realism of the age progression and regression of the main characters. Some, I am sure, may have criticized the length but, I found it not to be so because it is easy for the thoughtful to develop a profound interest in the characters as well as a fascination with the implications of reverse aging. For example, most of us have said wistfully at one time or another, ""If I only knew then, what I know now."" The passions of youth can compel us to make unwise choices while disregarding worthwhile pursuits. Benjamin Button had the oppressive effects of a decrepit body when he was young to prevent him from making imprudent choices but, had the wisdom of age to productively direct the passions of a youthful body when he was older. An interesting idea.Overall, a beautiful, thought provoking movie which I highly recommend. I hope Hollywood makes more movies like this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Oscar-aesthetics overshadow what could have been a thought provoking story,"Before I start, I have to say one thing: The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button"" goes on for long enough that it won't leave you completely cold if you've made it all the way to the end. However, the movie drags on too much. Very often I found myself wishing that the story would move along quicker and I couldn't wait for Pitt's character to get younger and finally die.Maybe, ""Benjamin Button"" was just too conventional for my taste. The score, the cinematography, the lines of dialog (which are incredibly clichéd and humdrum in certain parts) all seemed to scream: Please, please Academy. Give us the Golden Statue!"" Even though I wasn't much of a fan of Slumdog Millionaire"", at least that movie had its own original aesthetics and wasn't a run-of-the-mill Oscar-nominee.Speaking of a lack of originality: Am I the only one who sees more than just a few parallels to Forrest Gump""? Benjamin Button is the gentle Outcast who experiences all sorts of adventures through the years, one of them on a ship, not unlike Forrest on his shrimp boat. There he meets a captain, not too different from Lieutenant Dan. Benjamin has this erratic love interest in Cate Blanchett's character, just like Gump has in Jenny. The movie has a reoccuring symbol (the bluebird), as does Forrest Gump"" (the feather), and the Life is like a box of chocolate: You never know what you're gonna get""-catchphrase here is You never know what's comin' for ya"" and so on and so forth. More than just a few similarities, if you ask me.This definitely doesn't mean that Benjamin Button"" is completely worthless. It has some nice ideas (the aforementioned bluebird as a symbol for infinity, the clock that's running backwards) and the screenplay is clever, but all in all the kitschy cinematography, the dramatic setting with Hurricane Katrina waiting to happen, all of that is just a bit too glossy and conventional for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

Salvation of a young old man,"David Fincher is well known for his Thrilling pictures like Seven or The Game (Alien 3 is not counted) and others but i feel that The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is something different. some story of reverse growing up and the problems based on it.I by myself did'nt expect this movie . this year's Academy Awars Nominated pictures are rarely good . as i understood the subject,every year the choice of Academy is based on movies which have been shown in December. because of that movies like this and The Reader ,Frost/Nixon ,Milk and Slumdog Millionaire are chosen.i declare that the absence of Revelutionary Road is deeply felt.but somehow this year's movies are perfect.Benjamin Button(Brad Pitt)'s life starts with a disaster.when he Born's his face and body condition declares the strange condition . he looks like a 90 years old man.he is thrown out of his house by his father Thomas Button(Jason Flemyng) after his mother passed away.and he is raised with old people with a kind black woman Queenie (Taraji P.

However there is something missing in this film that prevents it from entering the dizzy heights masterpieces. There is no denying that I enjoyed the film a lot, as the plot was interesting and deeply moving at times, and the effects to make Pitt look old and then young are unbelievable. But as I said before there is something lacking in the complete package, where as a film like Forrest Gump, I feel was as good as that film good be. It is common to mention the two films in the same breath and for me Forrest Gump was the more accomplished piece. I couldn't help but leave the cinema thinking that it could have given the audience more, not much more, but that cherry on the top that truly makes movies stand out.

"Visual, acting beauty","I have not read the F. Scott Fitzgerald literary piece that serves as the basis for this film but the idea is extremely interesting, and the clock by Mr Gateau that runs counter clockwise is a wonderful figment of the imagination that sets the whimsical tone for the whole exercise. David Fincher's direction comes across as very sound. There is no doubt he is one of the most competent directors around, especially from a technical viewpoint. He keeps continuity fluid, he extracts a superb performance from Brad Pitt and a delicately enticing one from Blanchett, and the photography is gorgeous, including memorable sunsets, Blanchett dancing against the skyline, winter shots and pleasing compositions throughout.The attention to period detail is most impressive, filmed with loving memory and care, down to the flickering pictures of the late 19th century.It is, however, the way that the film conveys the inflexible vagaries of time that impresses me most. With it stems the realization that the oft-stated wish that one should not get old certainly could do without the alternative of getting younger on the outside only. Sadly, all the cosmetic surgery of the current age appears to seek that very goal but, though great to look at, Brad and Kate are definitely worthy human beings capable of love for each other and for mankind.There is nothing cosmetic about their feelings and values but perhaps one flaw is that Fincher needlessly adds 20 or so minutes emphasizing Brad's youthful good looks in particular, and perhaps the scene of Blanchett's accident could do with a little bit less repetitive explaining of the inexorability of fate. That said, I see those as minor foibles.Benjamin Button brings to mind the figure of Forrest Gump as he wanders through the box of chocolates of life -- but he emerges as infinitely more intelligent and perceptive. There is something Christ-like about Benjamin that adds to the subtly religious experience the film offers going back to the pastor that gets Benjamin walking, the passing of the piano teacher, and the chanting at Queenie's funeral.Curiously, as Benjamin Button's brain begins to age and become erratic and forgetful I was also reminded of Hal, the computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey, as his memory bank was dissembled; and Benjamin's last shot as a newborn but perishing baby brought to mind the starchild at the end of the Kubrick film.All told, I liked it very much. The fact that it made my brain tick, that it ushered in so many possibilities, and that it has stayed with me pleases me no end. It stands as a rare item in this age of mass production and bended knee to technology. I hope it does well at the box office and receives the plaudits it deserves from critics, the Academy and the rest of it. Highly recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

The ghost has transcended the limits of self.

Maybe Brad Pitt Should Stick to Zippers,"I read a book a couple of years ago called ""The Confessions of Max Tivoli,"" about a man who ages backwards. The book was nothing special, a moderate diversion at best, but what it did do well was explore the emotional and psychological conflicts the main character faced as he watched everyone around him -- including his love -- lose their youth while he gained his.That same kind of conflict is the missing ingredient in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"" and without it, this wisp of a story doesn't add up to anything. This film is a three-hour journey with a blank slate of a character who doesn't seem to react much to the things that happen to him. Yes, Benjamin Button ages backwards, but the film never establishes how Benjamin's life is any different because of this quirk than if he had aged traditionally. The gimmick offers a lot of excuses for cool special and makeup effects, but otherwise this is just a long and rather boring episodic story that doesn't have anything to say about its characters.It's time for the world to face that fact that Brad Pitt is simply a limited actor, and it's a mistake to put him at the center of any film that relies on a complex performance to make it work. The same thing was wrong with last year's ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,"" but that film worked despite Pitt's presence, largely because good actors were cast in all of the other roles, and they created interesting characters to compensate for the dull one at the film's center. The same is not so here. The only other actor who gets a meaty role to play is Cate Blanchett, and though she looks lovely, she's simply not given the material with which to create a memorable performance. Taraji P. Henson, who plays Pitt's mother, just does the strong Southern mom routine that Sally Field already created in ""Forrest Gump."" The best performance comes from Tilda Swinton, who has a tiny role as an enigmatic woman who shares some intimate moments with Benjamin. She was so fascinating that I would rather have left the movie I was watching to follow her story instead. That's never a good sign.It's hard to believe that the David Fincher who made last year's endlessly fascinating ""Zodiac"" helmed this film as well. While ""Benjamin Button"" is nowhere nearly as maudlin as it could have been (and probably would have been in someone else's hands), it's downright gloopy compared to Fincher's other works. The sentimentality is not helped by Pitt's thunderous voice over narration that's full of machine-made homilies, the kind that start with phrases like ""The funny thing about home is...."" or ""Sometimes the people that mean the most to us...."" The film is as technically accomplished as they come, every scene pretty as a picture. But one wishes that Fincher and company had spent a little less time making their film look nice and more time fleshing out a story that would engage our interest for nearly three hours.Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"Impossible and yet a perfect fable for love, memory, aging, and life itself.","The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008)Magical, bizarre, emotional, sentimental, gorgeous, profound, impossible.Thankfully the director of this amazing short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald was David Fincher. You can imagine how overblown and needlessly saccharine it might have been in the hands of a more centrist director (say James Cameron) or how needlessly fanciful and detached by a more visionary one (say Baz Luhrmann, who just released that other Fitzgerald adaptation, ""The Great Gatsby""). Fincher shows a sense of psychology in the characters, and of probing how we all think through edgy, improbable situations (from ""Fight Club"" to ""Se7en"" to even the one-dimensional ""Panic Room"").I say ""amazing"" story because in fact the original story is even better than this really moving, excellent movie. (It left me weeping at the end.) So maybe start there. Google ""Benjamin Button xroads"" for the full (short) text.Or start here. The beginning makes clear the problem. A child is born an old man. Infant-sized (unlike the story) but with cataracts and arthritis and so on. And as he grows (and does not die as expected) he gets younger. Eventually he becomes a tottering Brad Pitt, and then an extremely handsome Brad Pitt. And then...well, what can happen as you get so incredibly young after six or eight decades?I know, I know, how ridiculous. But somehow Fitzgerald makes it all work, and Fincher pulls out that core for the story here. The biggest issues are love and death (as Woody Allen keeps reminding us). In love, you can see how it might be frustrating to fall in love with someone and then realize that as they get older you get younger and you end up literally growing apart. In death, the problem is even more profound, because even though the title character, Benjamin, seems to be lucky because he doesn't grow old, by his final years he ends up facing all the same problems--losing friends, losing his ability to function as he once did, and eventually, shutting down. Dying. (The final line of the book: ""...and the warm sweet aroma of the milk, faded out altogether from his mind."")This gives nothing away, not really. It's how this happens that matters. And simply seeing it happen. This is where Fincher does such a solid, delicate job. There has been a lot of worthy talk about the effects used--aging people (in both directions), and working with the different eras so fluidly. The movie does span most of the 20th Century, ending with a Hurricane Katrina echo in the 21st. It's a visual masterpiece, for sure (much like ""Hugo"" is a computer-enhanced masterpiece in turn of the century France). But not once does an effect get in the way or announce itself.Pitt, it has to be said, is brilliant--and brilliantly restrained. Unlike his ""restrained"" role (one might say deadened) in ""Tree of Life"" we see here a subtle inner mind at work, an ""old soul"" with some wry wisdom and delight at being alive showing. He's sometimes played up for his looks alone (on purpose, and it made us laugh out loud at the poster-boy look he can pull off), but mostly he's just really convincing. Equally so, but with a smaller part, is the other main character, Cate Blanchett, who also ages (in the normal direction) and works through her years against the main character's.There are some additions to the movie that are moving and not Fitzgerald's, and some of them are unnecessary for the story, and maybe distractions or attractions depending on what you need from a movie. The biggest example is the way the story is told through reading a diary at the bedside of a dying woman in a hospital as a hurricane approaches and the lights flicker. It brings to mind ""The Notebook"" (which will make you cry even harder than this movie will), and it's not badly done, but is not actually helpful, either, except to give the plot and the characters more depth. Likewise, there are lots of little historic scenes thrown in for drama--World War II, for example--that are purely extra material. Good enough. But also more than enough, perhaps.Most of all the movie changes the love-affair of the story from a realistic and heartbreaking tale of aging and changing attraction to a very Hollywood ""love is forever"" kind of romance. It's fine, and you'll probably like the optimism, but Fitzgerald tapped into something more trenchant that Fincher was apparently afraid of.The movie is too long for sure, dragging at times. And it's too dreamy and sentimental for its own good, too, at least sometimes. It lacks some kind of puncturing force, wrapped up so nicely as it is. But see it, regardless. It's got too much to recommend it overall.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
A pretty interesting exercise of style,"Definitely, a beautiful movie! Superbly shot, with obvious plastic virtues, and a keen eye for epoch reconstruction and historical precision. A real feast for the sore eyes.The script itself, however, is quite linear, devoid of logic and imagination. One should remember that the genre of fantastic realism supposes certain rules that must be followed. Once we propose a fantastic premise - here, the ""curious case of"" a child born old and gradually regressing to youth and infancy - we must construct its relationship with the real world, rational and natural as we know it, in a coherent and credible form. This is how we achieve that ""state of real"" which makes the basis of any successful fantastic story.In this case, the state of real is sorely amiss. Although aware of the protagonist's oddity, the people around react in an apathetic and conventional way. As such, paradoxically, the convention doesn't function (or, in other words, ""conventionalism kills the convention""). As a result, the much needed conflict is weak and fragmentary. The writers show a surprising lack of creative imagination, just going with the flow. And the flow is slow. And low.One should also point out that the script departs its own referential frame. So, our character ""turns young"", with all the consequences as such derived. But, dearies, sclerosis, Alzheimer and any other forms of senile dementia are 100% results or the brain's physical degrading (the neurotransmitters' failings, the proteins' faulty processing, and so on!) As such, WHY does the ""old child"" B.B. turns senile, when his brain is literally young and vital? BY CONTRARY, in that instance, we really had a high potential for drama: an individual having all the knowledge and living experience of eight decades of life, amplified by the super-intelligent and vivid mind of a child! A ""wonder-kid"", a ""genius"", not due to any super-powers, but strictly as a result of his own peculiarity: age regression! THIS was the true ending of the story - and how dramatic and compelling it would have been! A real ending to remember! As such (and following also the total lack of depth and fantasy of the story, plus the stereotype profile of B.B. - who has no personality at all), everything remains shallow, useless, slow-paced, boring and insignificant. Thank God, the plastic departments are sublimely represented! At least for cinematography, sets, costumes and, of course, first of all make-up, this movie would deserve some Oscars (but only in those fields!)",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

Your life is defined by its opportunities... even the ones you miss.,"With 13 Oscar nominations and three wins, and almost as many BAFTA nominations and wins, there is no doubt that this is one of the best films of last year.First off the makeup and visual effects and sets and cinematography and sound were all superb as one would expect of a film of this caliber.The acting? Well, Cate Blanchett, Taraji P. Henson, Brad Pitt, Julia Ormond, and Tilda Swinton were all absolutely amazing. Yes, there was a huge cast of supporting characters, both playing the above at different ages, and there were others interacting. They all made this a most enjoyable experience.It was Eric Roth's screenplay and David Fincher's direction that pulled it all together into one of the most captivating movies I have ever seen.

An emotional journey that should not be missed.,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button inspired me on levels that most movies today fail to do. Not only is this my favorite movie of 2008, but it's in my top 5 favorite movies ever. I remember going to the theater to see it and not knowing what to expect. The trailer seemed interesting so I thought I would give it a try. When the movie finished, I had tears in my eyes....because I just saw one of the greatest movies ever made.One of the things I appreciate about Benjamin Button is its level of emotion, and the acting is superb in every way. Cate Blanchett is one of the most gifted and talented actresses. She truly gives an intense, gut-wrenching performance. I can't picture anyone else playing Daisy. Brad Pitt gives the performance of a lifetime. I always thought he was an excellent actor (after watching him in Meet Joe Black, Sleepers, and Fight Club) but this movie puts the cherry on the cake. He breathes life into Benjamin in a way that really wowed me. Tilda Swinton also gave a great performance.It really saddened me that this movie didn't win for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, it's a Hollywood tragedy. From beginning to end, Benjamin Button had Best Picture written all over it. I highly recommend The Curious Case of Benjamin Button to anyone looking for a beautiful, emotional, thought provoking story. No matter where your tastes lie, there's that something in it for everyone. This is one of those special kind of movies that stay with you long after you watch it.As I end this review, I just want to say thank you. Thank you Brad and Cate because this movie will inspire me and live in my heart for the rest of my life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Nice- But not the best movie of the year,"Don't get me wrong, I very much enjoyed The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Its an interesting idea. And it has little funny moments, and others of true poignancy.( VERY minor spoiler in the paragraph ahead ) Some of it feels like dead air, but the movie is interspersed with occasional strokes of genius-- The scene of little insignificant events that led to Daisy's accident, the ""struck by lightening seven times"" parts and Benjamin's letter to his daughter are all nothing short of perfection.But the film, on a whole, was less than perfect. The characters lacked complexity and some subplots seemed unresolved. It simply failed to move me, or make an impression. I felt like the special effects and cinematography, while they were great, were running away with the picture, dragging the actors and director behind them.I recommend The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.

...toc-tic..toc-tic...toc-tic..,"The central premise of THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is that the title protagonist doesn't age, but rather grows steadily younger throughout the film. He is born the size of a newborn, but his body is racked with the ailments of an old man  - arthritis, cataracts, wrinkles, etc. The story follows his seven decades of existence as a backward ride through a forward moving society, until he progresses/regresses and dies as an infant. It is a bizarre and strangely pointless concept, which seemingly would have to carry with it a message about life and living, otherwise, why bother telling it. But for all of its lush storytelling and sometimes strikingly beautiful imagery, BENJAMIN BUTTON is a very long film with nothing of any real relevance to say.There are several problems here. One, though the film can illustrate his physical change through make up and special effects, it can't  or at least, doesn't  capture the emotional and psychological effects of such a development. To be a child, with all of the expanding wonderment that entails, but to be trapped in a decrepit, aged body, would have to carry with it a remarkable psychological burden. The story, as penned from F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story by Eric Roth, sidesteps this by contriving circumstances wherein young Benjamin is raised in an old folks home. Thus the story gives us a character, who by his very nature is an outsider, but places him in a cocoon during his formative years where his malady is seemingly perfectly natural and accepted. He is an old man raised in an environment of old people. Where is the drama in that? In his middle years, aged twenty to fifty or sixty, his age isn't that important to what he does; and his last years, where he shrinks from a teen to a tot, are rushed through with little concern for their importance.But the retirement home isn't the only place where the film negates Benjamin's curious condition. The film details his growing younger and the other characters are always noting the change, but no one seems particularly surprised, let alone shocked by it. Though years pass between the times Benjamin sees various characters, there is no questioning that the suddenly younger Benjamin is who he says he is and only the mildest of confusion about the situation. And given the uniqueness of his condition, it would seem that it would be a biological anomaly that would warrant genuine scientific study, perhaps even popular notoriety; but that isn't the case. The story plays out like an unrealistic fairy tale set against a realistic background, yet its only moral seems to be that it is painful to outlive the people you love -- which is true with or without the backward growth gimmick.For all the purpose it carries, the story could just as easily have abandoned the anti-aging tricks and it wouldn't have had much effect on the events in Benjamin's life; with little change, the same story could have been told had Benjamin aged naturally. Maybe, free of the central gimmick, the film might have been more interesting, or more honest anyway. As is, the film contains little wisdom about the joys and pains of growth and even less about how one's age is reflected in one's environment.The film's biggest problem however is that Benjamin Button isn't that interesting as a character. At least, not as played by Brad Pitt. The incredibility of the story could be accepted or forgiven if Benjamin was a person worth being concerned about. But there is nothing larger than life about Benjamin; and other than his wartime adventures, there really isn't much that happens in his life that is all that remarkable -- falling in love, losing love, becoming a father, facing the death of loved ones, etc. These everyday joys and tragedies could be powerful if presented as part of the life of a colorful and caring character, but in Pitt's hands, Benjamin is a quiet, polite and even docile person. Pitt gives us a character who is simply rather banal. If the point of the story is that Benjamin's biological oddity is what makes him distant and aloof, then the film does a poor job of making that clear. The most curious aspect of Benjamin Button's existence is that after spending several hours with him, and experiencing all the ups and downs of his life, one is likely to be at a loss to remember him at all.What makes BENJAMIN BUTTON a curious case is trying to figure why it was even made. Devoid of an intriguing center in Benjamin and wrapped in an elaborate and meaningless gimmick involving his reverse aging, the film is a harmless, if long-winded trifle. BENJAMIN BUTTON is like its protagonist, a pleasant enough acquaintance, but one that will pass through your life with barely a ripple of difference.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Another great flick from Fincher!!!,"A wonderful movie about love, life and death. This is the Forrest Gump of this decade. This is no Fight Club or Seven. This is totally outside Fincher's usual genre.Pitt and Fincher are back together again. Which is where the two's best work seems to emerge from. Not since Fight Club has Brad Pitt shined so much. The only movie that Pitt was good in since Fight Club is The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.The acting was great like it always is in Finchers movies. Brad Pitt was great as Benjamin Button, a confused man who is aging backwards. Cate Blancett gave a grade A performance as Daisy a girl who becomes friends with Benjamin.I recommend it.

Unique and Interesting But Not Amazingly Good,"Here is the problem I have with Benjamin Button: It's not amazingly different or special in its own way. I think a friend of mine summed it up as a slightly mystical and more tragic cross between Forrest Gump and The Notebook. On one end, you have the man whose life spans many great moments and scenes and his disability (mentally or aging backwards) actually barely plays a role in what would be a great life for anyone. No doubt the use of imagery, period costumes and music, and time passing are key elements in telling the story. On both ends to some degree you also have the life long romance, from friendship to lost romance to finally capturing it and there is even the story-telling from a 3rd party aspect going on.What problem I don't have is that both of those films happened to be good and while I'm not saying Button rips them off, it hardly does anything that makes it powerful in its rite like them.What does it do well? Of course the aging-CGI is impressive and the makeup for everyone is excellent. The costumes are top quality and this movie does a better job of portraying time passing without the 'in your face' historical notes and blatant music overkill that Gump used. While the lead acting is good (Elle Fanning has a nice little part), it's largely out shown by the underrated Taraji P. Henson and an excellent side role by Tilda Swinton (who has not lost a step since Michael Clayton). Some of the side and smaller roles of this film do a better job of defining his life and experiences than the character himself. If you're into amazing, panoramic scenery with impressive makeup, CGI, and period sets and costumes, this film is a solid 9 out of 10.What is it missing is pop. The seemingly deep devotion and realistic portrayal of young and unbridled love pushed the Notebook along strongly. In Gump, not only were his unintentional involvements in historical and popular events funny but it also flowed as smoothly as the metaphorical feather in the story. This story...well it didn't flow for me. The slightly tragic and pained romance, to me lacked magic. It lacked punch and in the end, it was a story that really lacked ""Oomph"". It had lots of scenery and beauty to it but plot-wise didn't deliver. It hung several times out there and yet disappointed me each time. Instead it stuck to a rather bland, mystical and magical sort of tone to his life and an unconventional romance.I'd 9/10 for elements from costumes, sets, cinematography, and makeup. A 10/10 for aging effects. The acting is a 7/10 with most great parts being smaller ones and a 6/10 for plot. It has a nice hook but the actual plot lacks originality or anything special to it.If you want to watch a movie for its visual aspects at a very high level, this is a new classical must see. If you want a truly great romance, there are many better out there. I won't say this is a bad movie, it's definitely worth seeing but it's not the instant classic some paint it as. It's a great movie for appealing to a sense of wonder and ones eyes and maybe ones spirit but certainly not to the romantic heart.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
MY TOP 4 MOVIE OF ALL TIME,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a 2008 American fantasy romantic drama film directed by David Fincher. The storyline by Eric Roth and Robin Swicord is loosely based on the 1922 short story of the same name by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The film stars Brad Pitt as a man who ages in reverse and Cate Blanchett as the love interest throughout his life. The film also stars Taraji P. Henson, Mahershala Ali, Julia Ormond, Jason Flemyng, Elias Koteas, and Tilda Swinton.Producer Ray Stark bought the film rights to do the short story in the mid-1980s with Universal Pictures backing the film, but struggled to get the project off the ground until he sold the rights to producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall in the 1990s. Although it was moved to Paramount Pictures in the 1990s, the film did not enter production until after Fincher and Pitt signed on along with the rest of the cast in 2005. Principal photography began in November 2006 and wrapped up in September 2007. Digital Domain worked on the visual effects of the film, particularly in the process of the metamorphosis of Pitt's character.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was released in North America on December 25, 2008 to positive reviews from critics, who praised Fincher's directing, Pitt's performance, production values, and visual effects. The film was a box office success, grossing $335.8 million worldwide against its $167 million budget. The film received thirteen Academy Award nominations, the most of the 81st Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Fincher, Best Actor for Pitt, and Best Supporting Actress for Taraji P. Henson, and won three, for Best Art Direction, Best Makeup, and Best Visual Effects.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

"A whimsy and eloquent dance on life, beautiful and tragic whilst human and fantastic.","Fairy tales and fables come in all sorts of different forms, the least of which certainly not being the film, and while the novel may have came first, there still remains a certain extra-dimensional beauty to seeing a good piece of fantastical fiction being pulled off up on that giant silver screen. At risk of over-romanticising what is nevertheless a fairytale grounded deeply in the human spirit and heart, I submit that The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is exactly that; it's a rare example of an eloquent dance synchronised along to the melancholic keys of a piano played within a rustic bar on the edge of New Orleans. It's tangible, real, and yet ethereal and poignantly larger than life at the same time. Yet there remains one key aspect to Benjamin's story here that most fables fail to resolve - that is that a key theme, in fact, the absolute idea behind his story is the idea of the entirety of life, death and everything between; not just the happy parts, or the struggles, but the whole of that journey in all its details. Of course, Benjamin's case isn't exactly what you'd call ""normal"", and yet despite its somewhat fantastical façade and makeup, there is still plenty of humanity on show here that always plays first and foremost to the backing of Mr. Button's curious, but harrowing tale.For director David Fincher, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button represents a dive further into long, grand pieces of character-driven work largely dominated by larger than life statements. Indeed, as was a somewhat unfortunate flaw within Fincher's previous work Zodiac, the only problem prevalent here is that his feature tends to get overwhelmed by the size, scale and scope of the story to which he is trying to tell. Granted, telling eighty years of mans life, and doing so backwards -in a sense-, is no easy thing to do, but it remains a testament to the ambitious director and indeed the movie itself that much of the scrawling runtime is paced evenly enough to avoid any major disjointedness. Despite this sporadically distracting flaw, Benjamin Button showcases Fincher's ability to draw human characters out of surreal situations to the point where emotional response is consistently drawn from the audience without resorting to cheap ploys and devices. Instead the feature builds characters, and relations which transpire within a somewhat meagre plot, telling their stories in an eloquent, refined and subtle manner; this, in contrast to Benjamin's unique disposition in that he ages backwards, provides a fairytale that caters to the viewer's romantic and realist sides in ways that only the best of art can claim to do.Like the best of fairy tales however, there remains a poignant mix of styles to Benjamin's story that reaches beyond just plain character drama and romance. There's action, comedy, even a little bittersweet lust for life in there too, and while much of this would be easy to misplace and in turn spoil the coherency of the story, Fincher does well to keep things consistently engaging regardless. Most of this of course lies for the most part- outside of Fincher's direct control however, in the form of Brad Pit who portrays Mr. Button here in what is undoubtedly a career defining performance. He, his co-stars and his romantic interest played by Cate Blanchett reflect the majestic nature of Benjamin's story without loosing touch of their distinct human qualities. Sure enough there remains some degree of ill-fated dissonance to Benjamin and Daisy's romance as a direct result of their tragic dispositions, but despite a somewhat anti-climactic uniting of the couple of during the movie's middle act, the movie retains its whimsy, airy charm throughout. It's not a perfectly constructed romance by any means, and this again is a detrimental result of the movie's extremely large scope at trying to tell a fleeting romance within such a large time scale, but the emotive power of the story is not without its impact during the first and last hours.While it would be presumptuous to walk from a showing of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button with the rose-tinted view that it represents cinema and storytelling in perfection, such an occasion is only rarely and briefly awarded to cinema goers. Yet, despite the fact that Fincher here delivers a film that has quite a few failings that more discerning viewers will be disgruntled with, there is nevertheless no denying the simple power of Benjamin's Forest Gump ¬tinged biographical story. What it represents is a whimsy and eloquent dance on life, beautiful and tragic whilst human and fantastic. Indeed, by the time the curtain closes on Mr. Button's curious case, the impact of his story remains with you long after the credits stop rolling; it's the kind of film that is imperfect but not at the expense of making a statement so poignant and hard hitting that the movie as a whole succeeds in being irrefutably futile to resist in its warm embrace. Most importantly and somewhat ironically however is that Benjamin's story provides an almost ageless and unforgettable tale that simply uplifts and emotionally resonates without overly romanticising the small nuances of life. Reflected during one of the movie's strongest sequences, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button takes to heart that life is a strange series of events, ostensibly random and yet poetically beautiful; indeed, somewhere between the chaos theory and that of predestination lies Benjamin Button- and sure, it can be a bumpy ride, unpredictable and seemingly cruel in design, but Benjamin ascertains that that's just life, and that's exactly what Fincher and Roth deliver here.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"Beautiful, but too much for something so simple","The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button is curious, but not the best interesting thing that you could be expecting.First of all, it's curious the fact that David Fincher is the director, because he's the wizard of kick asses like Seven, Fight Club and The Panic Room, so you could never imagine that someday he would just jump into something that is too much Chris Columbus, Robert Zemeckis or even Tim Burton for him. But that's OK. Maybe he's just trying to dive into something a little different to express his eclectic taste or also his versatility as a director.For someone that built an entire career as an outstanding director of amazing thrillers and was responsible for some kind of revolution into the genre, Benjamin Button seems a little vain in his hands. This kind of story holds dense feelings that David Fincher is not able to express intensely, failing at times that other directors like Columbus or Zemeckis would probably care a lot more than he did.Getting 13 nominations for the Oscars doesn't mean anything because this is the movie that Academy's waiting for so long since Titanic because it's romantic and perhaps intense over an uncommon story, and everybody loves it. So, this is the kind of thing that Academy will always receive and announce with open arms even if it ends up with none of the statues.The story is simple and everyone already thought about dying young once in a life, but it happens so slowly and suddenly it ends so fast as an attempt to make you feel together with the character his perception of time passing by with the ages, so there are times that you just want to skip all the intense narrative and jump right to the point that everyone's expecting since the beginning: how will it ends? That line connecting fantasy to reality riding you naturally thru the movie like happens in Forrest Gump fails a lot even Fincher trying hard for it sometimes.For sure it's a beautiful movie that makes you think about all the meanings of life for hours, but it's a long-long movie that sometimes seems going to no where. The best parts of it are when Pitt's character is not alone because Benjamin Button is a curious character but he's not interesting enough to hold entire movie up on his back. Brad Pitt is a lot different from everything he did and he's a lot convincing as an old child during the first half of the movie, but that's it, because he backs to his comfort zone after it. Cate Blanchett has a very supporting role in a story that's about Benjamin but surrounds her all the time, anyway... any comments about her are dismissed because, you know, she is Cate Blanchett! The make up is outstanding most of the times, but it's kinda bizarre that they had so much care about Pitt's character that the same cannot be said about Blanchett's.Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie, I just think that there are too much in it than is needed and most of its success are for the important names in it than for the story itself as it's told. Maybe if things were a little different like being produced, written, directed and performed by different people the results could be a lot better but it also would never get 13 Oscars nominations and probably would never be a massive success.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Cant never forget this movie,"Absolutely loved it! This cinematic masterpiece soared beyond my expectations, earning a solid 9/10 in my book. The acting was nothing short of captivating, with each performance weaving seamlessly into the narrative tapestry. The film editing was a symphony of precision, creating a dynamic flow that kept me on the edge of my seat. The strength of the film lies not only in its compelling characters but also in its ability to flawlessly blend genres, leaving an indelible mark on the viewer's psyche. While every production has its minor flaws, they were overshadowed by the film's mesmerizing music, which served as the heartbeat of this visual odyssey. The cinematography was a visual feast, a testament to the director's keen eye for breathtaking shots. The underlying message resonated deeply, adding layers of meaning to an already rich storyline. In essence, this film is a triumph in the world of cinema, a harmonious convergence of artistry and storytelling that left me in awe.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"What a over-hyped, boring , dull lousy movie","I resented the fact that I wasted almost 3 hours of my life watching this. The screen writing was a disaster. The premise wasn't tight. There was so much bad about this flick. The only redeeming feature was some of the acting and the scenery. The way the story was told screamed similarity to Titanic - an old women telling the story. And in some ways it was like a bad - I mean really - bad take on Forrest Gump. Which is fitting since it made me want to ""run, Forrest, run"" out of the theater.So there's a diary being read to an old lady on her deathbed. A diary that began being penned around the time Benjamin was 6 years old. At no point do we ever see him write a word. And penning a diary simply wasn't believable. So there is this apparently magical clock and we are supposed to believe that Benjamin's unique birth is somehow tied into the clock simply because he is born on the same day it is unveiled. I would imagine then that all babies born in New Orleans that day were born old. Where was the tie-in? It took seemingly forever for the story to even beginning to gel. There was no early ""hook"". I was almost sleeping by the time the old kids is revealed. Frankly, after 2 hours I was wishing Hurricane Katrina would kill the old lady or her daughter would put her out of her misery.This was so miserable I would have rather endured the nauseating banter over the stimulus bill. At least it had ""stimulus"". Academy awards material? Not on your life. This is right up there with Pennsylvania 6500.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Almost great,"Benjamin Button is almost a great film. The problem is the length which is at least 30- 40 minutes too long. It would have worked as a two hour movie. David Fincher needed to get his ego under control and leave some things on the cutting room floor.A backwards running clock starts things going as a reason for the plot of Benjamin Button(Brad Pitt) aging backwards, starting as an old man and time shifting in reverse to youth. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote the original as a short story.Benjamin falls in love with Daisy(Cate Blanchett) and so begins a life long romance with the twist being that she gets older and he gets younger as the years pass by. Real historical events such as Pearl Harbor are used as a background. Brad and Cate have a natural chemistry and Fincher's visual sense is acute, this is a gorgeous feast for the eyes. I was initially mesmerized by the concept until the final 1/3 which became ultimately exhausting. My only advice to Fincher next time is edit, edit, Edit.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Timeless,"I remember being young when I watched this movie and I fell in love. Now, 2021 I am watching it again and can't help but to feel as no time has passed by.

The short story is way better than the film adaptation!!,"I'm one of those people who for months anticipated seeing this movie only to leave the theater disappointed. The film's producers took a great idea and ruined it by making a 2.5 hour movie about nothing.The drawn out scenes and bland performance from Brad Pitt makes the movie feel 4 hrs long. The main characters are less likable than the supporting characters. To avoid giving up spoilers, I'm not going to talk about the plot holes.The only thing that makes the film adaptation of Benjamin Button worth watching at least once is the cinematography and the special effects. It's one of the most beautifully filmed but boring movies I've seen in a long time. But watch it when you have time to kill.I initially rated this movie a 7 out of 10 but after reading the short story that the film is based on, I had to knock the score down to a '6'.

A wonderful masterpiece.,"This is a film unlike no other and epic movie that may never be seen again which makes this even more magical. The film was not only filled with top notch actors, directing and wonderful performances. We are all compelled to not only feel for the death we witness but also for the amazing like we see him experience. This was an incredibly visual and emotional journey of a man who ages backwards. The man played by Brad Pitt goes through the same things we all do growing up and growing old. He starts to discover life from all angles but that doesn't make him any more unique its the love he has. His whole life he tries to comprehend how his love for Daisy works and only has a few years to love her. With the frustration and hardship that their lives shows us its all worth if even if its only a few moments of joy. The end result is nothing but flawless. The way he is able to weave the story together and makes it flow so that it is enjoyable from start to finish. All the shots are impressive that at almost 3 hours none of it is wasted. With the performance of Brad Pitt is nothing short of amazing, his nuances are so believable and realistic throughout even with his make up and computer graphics he still is the one who makes him come alive. This was such a imaginative depiction of life, love and loss. This is not your average drama that spoon feeds emotions, its the message that what makes our lives impressive are the moments we don't seem to grasp long before letting go. With this movie Fincher should be solidified as a top in the industry with a film that is so magical, riveting ground breaking and a timeless classic. The theme of age is only a number and we can choose what to do in our lives no matter what that number is. The best way they choose to tell this was a man who ages backwards and the experiences he has. How can we fall in love with someone when that person looks like the persons child? How can a child play with the kids on the block when your body is old enough to be in a wheelchair? Although Brad Pitt does a great job the winners go to the women with Cate Blanchett and Taraji p. Henson. Blanchett playing the complex character of Daisy with ease and charisma. Taraji with her performance warming your heart as a mother not able to bear children takes Ben in and takes care of him as her own, her funny and loving nature showing she was the mother. With the complexities of the film David was still able to make the film seem reality and still having that magic. The score and cinematography also helped with the beauty of the film. Seeing the romance between Ben and Daisy seeming to transcend age, time and location made one of most compelling romances of the year and within years. With fabulous computer graphics and make up its hard to tell when it is used and when its real which goes to the skill of the people working on the film. This film was a work of art and should not be missed by anyone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
The Preposterous Pecadillo of Benjamin Button,"If you have always wanted to see a really wrinkled baby grow up in reverse while he learns valuable lessons about life and love, then this is the movie for you. First off, any time that you see a title that has double alliteration (""Curious Case"" and ""Benjamin ""Button"") and then up the ante with a whimsical name like Benjamin Button and the promise that you're going to see a truly Curious Case, then you know you're in for something good. They even bring in the sultry seductress, Blanche Devereaux, from Golden Girls to get the groove going (although I was upset that Rue McLanahan wasn't available to play her this time). Still, imagine how thrilled I was to sit through something like four and a half hours of life, love and tears, as wrinkled baby becomes handsome huckster becomes young boy with the mind of a 90-year-old. What better way to learn how you should feel about life and love? After seeing this movie I totally re-evaluated everything I've done so far, left my husband, quit my job and left on a search for the giant-sized, adult baby man with whom I fell in love so many years ago. My search continues, and I shall let you know how it goes. Thank you, Paine Webber, and thank you, Benjamin Bratt!",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Fincher's brilliant direction is just one of the many things that elevates the film to its rightful position.,"What you're about to read would be my personal opinion. It's just so rare that I give a 10 to a film due to several complex factors that drown you completely in its greatness, the plot, the characters, the beauty presented in each scene and they are all compelling, nothing lacking, they're just perfect. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, in my opinion is a film that has everything, a masterpiece in every possible way. It is a great story completely wrapped in a very complicated plot and it would be too hard to digest if it wasn't because of Fincher's flawless film direction and genuine creativity. Every film enthusiast can have his or her own perception to what makes a film good or bad. This perception is generally based on various considerations involving particular film aspects. However, despite those different points of view, they usually agree on the greatness of certain film, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button would be the case here. I think we can all come to an agreement that this film really brings back David Fincher to The Golden Throne of Great Film Director because of its meticulous film framework. Fincher's brilliant direction is just one of the many things that elevates the film to its rightful position, besides the absolutely artistic design, impeccable soundtrack, amazing moments of visual imagery and a story that transcends its starting point. Benjamin Button is a story about life, about coincidences, about self improvement, about finding oneself, and ultimately, on how to appreciate our existence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) - I'm 88 Years Old, and I'm Still a Baby! I Think I'm Aging Backwards!","Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett star in a movie about a man named Benjamin Button with a condition to age backwards, while being born as an old man. There's one strange thing about this movie, since this movie is way too similar to the movie, ""Forrest Gump"". Here are some reasons why these two movies are similar. They are both written by Eric Roth, both have 13 Oscar nominations, both is about a man with a condition, both have romantic struggles, both have supporting mothers, both involve the war, both have wonderful life stories, and they both contain a big heart. But besides that, the movie was an excellent movie due to the works of director David Fincher, screenwriter Eric Roth, and the brilliant cast of Pitt, Blanchett, Taraji P. Henson, and Tilda Swinton. Also, the exhilarating use of makeup and visual effects stole the show, with the addition of incredible cinematography, art direction, and film editing. This movie is a unique portrait of our every day life, but the other way around (since the movie involves a man aging backwards). The story, similar to ""Forrest Gump"", felt like it was told through someone's point of view. This movie contains incredible life lessons about being true to ourselves, no matter what age. This is a beautiful movie, and it's work of art in itself. ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"", in my review, ""a beautiful 'point-of-view' portrait story"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"emotionally touching, delicate, supported by outstanding female performances","Really curious is the case of Benjamin Button, a movie that, besides being, of course, improbable and really strange and besides the extraordinary effectiveness in rendering the passing of time on the faces and bodies of the characters, is able to offer many significant and by no way banal stimuli of thought. The most interesting one is the choice to leave history in the background, focusing attention on the ""small"" histories of the protagonists, who do not seem to be affected by what happens outside their lives. The impression we get is that ""great history"" is always there, doing its inexorable course, but that our personal story has a force and a value of its own, able to overcome the greatest events. Wars as well as Katrina will bring death and destruction, but our story will remain our greatest and most powerful bulwark of self-defence, something which nothing and nobody will be able to erase. Within the long (but never boring) time run the curious life of Benjamin is displayed with delicacy, arousing feelings of tenderness and authenticity, as to underline the complexity of human life, along a line where TIME is the essential point, always there to remind us of the shortness of life and the necessity to catch the moment, being however this universal warning never stressful or annoying. Female performances are really outstanding: Kate Blanchett, Julia Ormond, Tilda Swinton prove to be three great prodigies of acting and hit the mark in an impressive way. Less convincing is Brad Pitt, sometimes victim of his own timeless handsomeness, and appearing entrapped in a sort of monotonous face mime. A movie that gets to engage the audience, just by touching some very sensitive chords of the human soul.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

It was simply too hard to judge at times how old he was, and distracting from the movie while trying to figure it out.Another flaw was the length.

pseudo life philosophy,"Benjamin Button teaches us a multitude of great things about life: people die. Unbelievable.

But I guess some of the people who rated this film so highly probably even got touched seeing this... As for the rest: there has been exhaustive comment here on the weak points, here just a few in summary: -completely bad performance by Brad Pitt -lack of depth in all the protagonists -lack of message (altogether): the film is empty -full of cheesy clichés (...)

Epic tale about love and loss,"""Button"" is a movie that takes its time. It tells three different tales--the story of the titular hero who ages in reverse (Brad Pitt), an introductory yarn about a very special clock, and the framing tale of a daughter preparing to say goodbye to her elderly, dying mother (Cate Blanchett). That the stories are all connected should be no surprise, but what is surprising is how much time Fincher is given to weave his tale. This is a big, intimate epic. It's a sprawling movie that sets out to tell a life and grapple with mortality. The special effects are dazzling, but I was more astounded by the storytelling chutzpah. The director is working with a huge canvas.David Fincher will fare very well in future critical surveys of his work. He has already made a perfect film in ""Zodiac"" and other than the serviceable ""Panic Room"", his films are consistently ambitious, visually assured, and gripping. ""Button"", however, is the first film he's made that will get the awards folks to take serious notice and likely find broad appeal among women. (His previous works also include ""Seven"", ""The Game"", and ""Fight Club"".) The film uses its special effects well and they strengthen the story as opposed to overwhelm it. Seeing Pitt as both an infant senior citizen and an elderly teen is fascinating, but it serves the story. (And seeing Brad Pitt look as young as he did in ""The River Runs Through It"" is mind boggling.) The film will be compared to ""Forrest Gump"", both of which were written by the same screenwriter, but ""Gump"" frequently seemed to be about its special effects. In ""Button"" the make-up and computerized effects blend more seamlessly and accentuate the story. The logistics of the reverse aging will also please the sci-fi and fantasy geeks in the audience.But the aging is a device used to tell a story about longing, regret, and trying to hold on to others in spite of the inevitable. It's a necessarily sad tale, but it also heartens the audience and gives us appreciation for our loved ones and own lives. And for that it's a movie to be cherished and admired.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Dignity,"A film about Death and Time, with a fantastical side. At one point there is an anecdote about a man who was so afraid of dying in his sleep that he only took a few naps. He thought he could fool Death.It's very classic in terms of production. Too classic perhaps. The love story between Benjamin and Daisy is rendered in a conventional way. Fincher's direction is generally neutral. The Great American Cinema adapts the Great American Novel (or rather short story here). It's a huge production in terms of resources, you can see it on screen, especially in the scenes at sea. The brown and gray tones dominate and reinforce this classic patina.Everything is restraint, subtlety, unsaid and dignity. There is a rather formidable and disturbing dignity in the central character, a strange benevolent and astonished muteness, without us entirely knowing if this is due to the fact that he takes life in reverse and therefore is permanently out of step with the rest of humanity, or to a form of southern 'deadpan' restraint (the character is from New Orleans). This is an inspiring performance from Brad Pitt, in a high quality film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Disappointed in this movie,"I found the film to be very boring to the point of falling asleep thru much of the movie. I found the mumbling of the elderly Daisy to be irritating and unable to be understood. There wasn't anything exciting about this film, nothing to look forward to, and not much romance in it. Though some of the scenery was excellent and the makeup exceptional, it did little to tweak my interest. I left the theater feeling I had wasted my time and my money on a film so lacking in any thought-provoking ideas or interest. All in all, it was a very bad movie and if any of the actors or the film receive Oscars, it will be a tragedy because there are certainly other great movies out there that are deserving of these awards.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
A love story of strength and perspective,"As corny as that sounds, I believe it so. The Forest Gump-like tale of perspective is inspiring and the strength of our leads in their delivery and character is amazing. This isn't as fun as Gump, but we get a real love story instead, spread over lifetimes going in different directions. Cate Blanchet is amazing as both the story teller on her deathbed and Village dancer in a time where decadence and desire were accepted. Brad Pitt, as Benjamin, is solid throughout, and his reactions are accepting rather than judgmental. That in itself, was special, but not always believable. Director David Fincher delivers an experience, albeit through a ton of CGI, that is not to b missed. Surely, some will balk at the concept, pace, or star power, but that would simply be their loss.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

Episodic Script's Lost Opportunities Prevent Emotional Involvement,"""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is blessed with impressive special effects in the aging of Brad Pitt, and a clever MacGuffin: a man's body ages backward, from old age to infancy. The movie's episodic structure and the script's lack of depth prevented me from forming any emotional reaction to the material, though. It ended with a whimper and I left the theater unmoved.The film is episodic: a character comes on, has his moment in the spotlight, delivers a soliloquy, and then departs. The characters are eccentric in a way that serves no larger purpose than for them to be eccentric. One such character designs a clock that runs backward. Another has been struck by lightening seven times. Another character is very fond of hummingbirds. Another character tried to swim the English Channel but was thwarted by bad weather. None of these characters meet or interact. They stand alone in the narrative spotlight, depart, and then another eccentric character takes their place. Their stories add up to no larger point. ""Ain't Life Funny"" seems to be the film's main point.The aging of Brad Pitt is praiseworthy and will be the most remembered feature of this film. Unfortunately, during several brief but key scenes, the filmmakers inexplicably decided to jettison the aging techniques and cast another actor in Brad Pitt's role. Many viewers reported losing their emotional attachment to the film at that point.In characterization and performance, Brad Pitt's Benjamin Button is little different from Tom Hanks' Forrest Gump. He's a blank slate, a wise idiot, who says little, reacts mildly, and drifts through a lifetime of meeting random eccentrics. There's material here that BEGS to be plumbed by a worthy script. Does the scriptwriter really want to give Benjamin NOTHING to say about aging backward? No outrage, no poetry, no cri du coeur, no ""God, why me?"" There are important scenes between Benjamin and his parent. The scriptwriter does nothing with these scenes.Other characters are also clichés. Benjamin's adoptive mother is a one-dimensional saint who says more about white guilt than about any real life black woman. Cate Blanchett, as Benjamin's love, is never developed. Their relationship is also never developed. This is meant to be an epic love that withstands the test of time in a way that no other love has ever been asked to do. And it's boring.Really  the chances that anyone will ever again write a love story between a man who is aging backward and a woman aging forward are pretty slim. Why couldn't the script writer have at least tried to give voice to the extraordinary agonies and ecstasies, fears, hopes, and unique vows and commitments that would have arisen from such a love? Was the script struggling so hard to get the audience to buy its unique premise that they didn't want to draw attention to its implausibility by having any characters talk about it at all? Or is this just a post-verbal script, in which the frequently repeated phrase, ""I've been struck by lightening seven times"" is supposed to do all the work of expressing every feeling that every character feels? There was one scene that works beautifully. Benjamin, perhaps ten years old, but looking like a seventy-year old, hides under a table with a little girl. They are lit by candle light. I may look like an old man, but I'm not one, he says. That moment is poignant. There should have been more moments like that, instead of just another dead-end episode with yet another eccentric character.Hurricane Katrina is also harnessed and not made much use of. The hurricane is never seen, which is a shame, because nothing is more cinematic than a hurricane. Rather, shots of TV screens showing radar images of Katrina's path are shown. I have to wonder at a director who would choose TV shots of weathermen talking about radar over actual footage of frothing waves, wind-whipped palms, and houses being ravished by tides.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Sorry but it's just not cutting it...,"Really, really, really! I just don't like it. I love the idea. Who wouldn't? It's got some really promising bits in it and the look of the film is obviously first rate. I love most Fincher movies and his stamp is all over this visually. And some of the acting is very good.Unfortunately i base my ratings for films on whether i enjoy them or not and not based on a concept or the lighting or the effects. Yes it's creative but it runs out of steam fairly quickly. I spent the first 30 minutes thinking, nice concept, cool characters i wonder where this is going. By the final third i just didn't care anymore. I didn't engage with the characters at all. Brad Pitt is not a great actor and doesn't win me over at all. I didn't want to cry and i cry at pretty much anything, honestly it's a curse. I just ran out of putting the effort in to stay with the story.People are entitled to their opinion but an average of 8.5...come on. Top 75 films of all time. Not even close. It's an over-hyped piece of cinema ""cool"". You do not have to pretend that this is the bees knees. Be honest with your reviews. Your misleading the public and perpetuating a myth.So i'll finish on this. My true rating for this film is about a 5. I'm giving it a 1 though as i'm hoping it balances out the over enthusiasm of some of the IMDb crowd of Film fascists who care more about clever than they do about entertaining.I don't know, maybe i'm wrong but please, do me one favour. give it an honest vote.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

A flawed yet technically brilliant achievement,"When I walked out of the theater after seeing The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, I really had no idea how to describe it. On one hand, it is a technical masterpiece with jaw-dropping visual effects and perhaps some of the most realistic makeup in any movie I've ever seen. The process of seeing Benjamin Button (played with brilliant subtlety by Brad Pitt) and his lifelong love, Daisy (Cate Blanchett) grow younger and older, respectively, marks an astonishing revolution in the technology of the movie-making industry. There is not a single scene or moment that does not look just spectacular. Unfortunately, the visuals were so great that the story itself did not quite rise to the challenge.The screenplay, written by Eric Roth and based on a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, has striking similarities to Forrest Gump, which was also written by Roth. That's not necessarily a bad thing. It certainly contains plenty of clever, original dialogue and touching scenes, but it's impossible to miss the connections to the 1994 Best Picture winner. Of course, there are many similar elements between the two movies (both show the aging and growth of a man who is, in some way, a bit of an outcast; they tell important messages about life and death while channeling several different eras in recent history), but the quality and tone of the film itself is different enough to make it feel unique. While Forrest Gump focused mostly on the intricacies of the characters and plot, Button puts more emphasis on the overall themes and morals of the story. In fact, the main flaw in the screenplay is not its similarities to Forrest Gump, but in its structure. Like Gump, the central story is told in a sort of flashback form and frequently returns to the present. While these scenes do occasionally help with the story and emotion, many of them, particularly at the beginning, feel unnecessary and interrupt with the flow of the story. If the script had stayed more focused on the actual plot, the emotion might have been stronger and, perhaps, it would've been easier to truly get to know and connect with the main characters.Aside from the visuals, Benjamin Button does exceed in other ways. As mentioned before, Brad Pitt gives a terrific yet subtle performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. Cate Blanchett plays Daisy straight while bringing out the more troubled side of her character. The result is an interesting dynamic between the two actors and a convincing romance that never strays into formulaic or too-familiar territory. For me, many of the movie's best scenes were the ones showing their relationship and how it grows and changes over time as the two characters head in completely different directions only to inevitably meet up again. The supporting cast is solid with noteworthy performances from Taraji P. Henson as Benjamin's adoptive mother and Tilda Swinton, who plays a married woman with whom he has a brief affair, but the movie never really delves into the finer details of their characters, so that they never feel quite as deep or real as they could have. Even Benjamin Button and Daisy have an almost enigmatic aura about them and, even with the voice-over narration, we never truly get into their heads and find out exactly what they're thinking.One other thing worth mentioning is David Fincher's direction. This is his first PG-13 rated movie and, being someone with films like Fight Club, Zodiac and Se7en on his resume, he is venturing into unknown territory. However, he seems confident with the material and he lends the film a unique tone that is alternately fantastical and somber. He manages to display the groundbreaking visual effects without ever making them distracting or overly showy. Even the makeup and CGI used to age Brad Pitt 80 years over the course of the film never say 'Here! Look at me!' We automatically recognize how revolutionary they are and they blend in perfectly with the film. Also, he has a way of making the quieter scenes both intimate and strangely detached at the same time. As viewers, we feel as though were merely observing the characters and we don't necessarily feel entirely absorbed in their world, but, partly because of the talented cast, we come to care about what happens to Benjamin and Daisy.The film concentrates heavily on themes of mortality and living every moment of life to its fullest. While it occasionally comes on a bit too strong, it is really a moving message and it is delivered powerfully, making viewers start to reflect on their own life and achievements. It teaches us to cherish every moment, every opportunity and person that comes by because we never know when they might be gone. ""Life is a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.""

Would life be better if we were born with 80?,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film underestimated in my opinion, David Ficher is always remembered by Fight Club, but few people remember the excellent Seven and the great The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, here Ficher makes a different movie without Plot Twist Human being opposite of others works too much, while others get older, Benjamin Button gets younger, the film good dialogues, has sad moments, a good soundtrack, a great costumes, the film is a little longer than it should, and this It hurts the rhythm, the script would work even better if the film were shorter, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a film and deserves to be seen.

Tried to be Forrest Gump 2.0,"I enjoyed the film. But something told me I was meant to feel more when the credits rolled. What I mean by Forrest Gump 2.0 is that It takes you through the life of Benjamin (backwards), he lives an alright life, but then when his life becomes great... disaster. This could've been great with characters that were more likeable. Which I think is why I've rated Forrest Gump is 10/10 and Benjamin Button only a 7/10.

"Strange, but well-made....","David Fincher is a fantastic director... 'The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button' proves that! But does the aging-backwards fare impress? The answer is, yes and no!The problem here, is the length and its unique treatment... every cine lover won't enjoy this one. Some will love it for its niche, while some will hate it for being a long-long biopic. Fincher brings the short-story to life beautifully with his epic direction... but script wise, the film has its loose ends.The tale of Benjamin Button leaves you curious as well. Final words,, watch this man's journey only if you're a die-hard fan of Brad Pitt and unique themes.Pluses of the film: Fincher's direction is outstanding. His Oscar-Nomination was meant to happen. Production value from all sides is A class. Performances are superb: Brad Pitt is fantastic as Ben Button. He plays his part with remarkable ease. Cate Blanchett is excellent. Taraji P.Henson is equally good. Others are good in their parts.Minuses: The theme might not attract many + the film is too lenghty.on the whole, this man's journey is entertaining,boring and adventurous.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Truly the real Best Picture of 2008!,Brad Pitt in a role that is a real inspiration to all in this tale of self exploration and true drama.Benjamin was a strange case as he was a child born with an odd condition that left him aging differently than other people in the world. Growing up with others dying around him he managed to gain a unique view of the world in light of his condition.This film pretty much is a remake of Forest Gump in most aspects which is one of the reasons that this one has an 8 instead of a 9. This tale shows many adventures of our hero over his lifetime and Brad Pitt's portrayal of this character rivals Tom Hanks in his portrayal of a similar character type. With him and his counterpart Cate Blanchett they get along well together making the interactions very smooth and enjoyable overall.In the end the message of enjoy life in the moment gets across well and this movie is very much one of the more enjoyable films of that year.,8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"Mind-numbing, surprisingly bad film.","This is a curious case of a fantastic idea taken up by idiotic hands. The result is a great concept and not much else. The acting is laughable throughout the film, the script predictable and saccharine and the cinematography/screenplay bland.There's a constant, irritating feeling that the director thinks himself a 'genius of our time' and he takes special care to remind us just how wise he is at every single step of way in long, hollow, moralising speeches which don't help us in any way.I gave the film a very good chance (2 hours), but had to stop watching in the end.Not recommended.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Nothing lasts... What a shame...,"""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is one year's best movies, although it runs a little long. Coming from Director David Fincher (""Seven"" and ""Fight Club""), the movie is unexpectedly sentimental. Brad Pitt gives perhaps his best performance. Cate Blanchett is awesome, and deserves an Oscar nod. The screenplay by Eric Roth from the story by Robin Swincord and Roth based on the F. Scott Fitzgerald short story is the lyrical allegory of a man who ages backward through his life. ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" feels reminiscent of Pitt's ""Meet Joe Black"" and ""Forrest Gump"". This may be intentional. I am guessing that the original F. Scott Fitzgerald story may have been darker.Fincher envisions ""Benjamin Button"" as a poignant parable of change in life, and life being whole and complete. The old woman, who teaches Benjamin to play piano, tells him, ""Everyone you love will eventually die"" I think Fincher and Roth tell a story of legacy, mortality, and love. Effectively told from retrospective narrative, the story follows the life of Benjamin (Pitt), who is born an old man, and grows physically younger as he ages through his life. After giving birth to Benjamin in 1918, his mother dies. His abhorred father Thomas Button (good Jason Flemyng) abandons his son at an elderly care home.The baby is raised by strong young Black woman Queenie (Taraji P. Henson), who names her son Benjamin. This is an amazing narrative touch, as ""old man"" baby Benjamin is raised among the elderlyhis people. There Benjamin meets the love of his life Daisy (who eventually grows into Cate Blanchett) when she is 7 years old. Here Fincher and Roth display a delicate touch. Benjamin and Daisy's fostering relationship is endearing and awkward, when it could easily have been a little creepy. At 17 years old Benjamin decides to leave home and sail the seas with tugboat skipper Captain Mike (larger than life Jarred Harris). All the while Benjamin writes to Daisy as he promised. Daisy grows up into a beautiful free-spirited ballerina.Eventually, their lives collide somewhere in the middle. In a moving scene together Benjamin confesses to Daisy, ""I was thinking how nothing lasts, and what a shame that is."" And we watch as Benjamin and Daisy deal with their fate and the inevitable. Along the way, life happens. Henson is so strong as Queenie, who loves Benjamin as her blood. There is such a moving moment at Benjamin's father's funeral. Queenie holding Benjamin's arm tells him that his father will be buried next to his mother. Pitt quietly says, ""You're my mother."" ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is about the fleetness of life and mortality, but is also about family and love spanning the generations. Along that line Julia Ormond is amazingly poignant as Daisy's daughter Caroline, who discovers her mother's amazing life. Tilda Swinton is also riveting as Elizabeth, the other great love of Benjamin's life.""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is so moving, because of the powerful performances from Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Brad gives his best performance. He brilliantly balances the wonder and pain of a man fated to live his life backward. His chemistry with Blanchett is authentically moving and touching. Pitt and Blanchett make us believe that Benjamin and Daisy are soul mates. Blanchett is amazing, and deserves an Oscar nod. Although she plays the normal Daisy, who grows old like the rest of us, she emanates a deep compassion and humanity that is so moving. She is great with Pitt as their love story blossoms in the middle. Blanchett is powerful in her compassion and silence in the moments near the end.""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" celebrates life, unexpected and always a wonder. David Fincher maintains a sense of humor, and tells a touching and inspiring tale with an edge. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are amazing and powerful.

There is No Curiousity in Knowing That This is a Clever Film,"This film might be a bit slow, but it is real clever and charismatic. The storyline itself is original and monumental.

Their collaboration very much connects with the storyline.Some historical moments are displayed in a way that suits the storyline. I enjoyed watching this film.

Magical,"Curious Case of Benjamin Button, The (2008)**** (out of 4)David Fincher's latest tells the story of Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt), a man who ages backwards with various consequences throughout his life. If Forrest Gump was about a simple man doing extraordinary things then Button is a extraordinary man doing simple things. This was the last of the five Best Picture nominees for me to watch and I must admit that going into the movie the entire storyline left me rather skeptical to say the least. I really wasn't sure what to expect since the film sounded like Forrest Gump 2 and while the two films share a lot in common this one here is remarkable enough on its own to really pack a terrific punch. Button doesn't do anything overly special in his life except live and fall in love and these simple things are what makes the film so memorable. Clocking in at close to three-hours I must say that I hoped the movie would keep going as not once did it feel overlong or as if the story was running out of things to say. I think the most interesting thing is that director Fincher really paces the film in a way to where the viewer can see Button's life unfold but at the same time have the viewer wonder what they would have done under the same circumstances. The way Button learns to live and love makes for plenty of great drama as well as plenty of laughs but that the same time it's quite remarkable at how touching and uplifting all of it is. The special effects in the film are also quite remarkable because there never take away from the story that's going on. The are various effects being used with the CGI looking great in recapturing the look of the 1920's and 1930's. The real special effects come in how they get Pitt to look like a child, an old man and back to a kid. The visual effects used here, and I'd be lying if I said I understood them, are quite remarkable to look at but again, what's most remarkable is that they don't take you out of the story. A lot of credit also has to go to Pitt who turns in another great performances. One can only imagine what was going through his head as he tried to come up with the various emotions that would go into a role like this. I mean seriously, how does one prepare to have the body of a 80-year-old man but the mind of a baby? Is there some special class to take about having the brain of an 80-year-old yet the body of an infant? Pitt nails everything his character goes through and that includes the terrific vocal work that he must tackle throughout the film. The supporting players, Julia Ormond, Cate Blanchett, Tilda Swinton and Taraji P. Henson all deliver excellent supporting work but there's no question that the film belongs to Pitt. Some might balk at the film saying life doesn't work this way and perhaps that's true but a lot of the film is a fantasy but one written so close to human nature that it's not hard to imagine what you see is set in a reality. If I could have changed anything about the film it would have been how the story is told as Blanchett's character is on her death bed going back through a diary of Button's. I think the story could have been told straight but this is just a minor issue. When the credits finally started I couldn't help but feel incredibly moved by what I had just seen and this is certainly one of the year's best.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Vapid But Not Totally Forgettable,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is Oscar bait. But whatever awards may or may not come, it is a film with a clever premise but absent an engaging story. It is a good film with a few great moments and characters. However it is not a great film. This is going to be the first David Fincher movie I will not buy for my personal collection.Benjamin Button is a bit Titanic and a bit more Forrest Gump as if it were made by Jean Pierre Jeunet. Naturally David Fincher, a Jeunet contemporary and associate, would typically be the best thing for this type of film. Zemeckis was probably a bit too, happy-go-lucky with Forrest Gump, also written by Button scribe Eric Roth, who seems to love overwriting multi- character historical epics. And while the stories are vastly different, there are a multitude of similarities in tone and execution to Jeunet's ""A Very Long Engagement."" And like that film, Button suffers from the same issues of pacing, redundancy. Also, both films try, often without success to be too clever and end up being much too boring.One facet of the story that deserves notice above others, are the supporting characters. Sure Pitt and Blanchet are decent. But they are hardly the main attraction. Taraji P. Henson as Benjamin's mother and Jared Harris as the tug boat skipper are clear standouts and deserve recognition for their work.Benjamin Button is most enjoyable in the first section, when Button is an old man. His early years are by far the most involving and pay-off the gimmicky premise the best. I don't want to reveal too much of the story, because it is one worth seeing in general. Unfortunately the second half of the film fares, by design, more predictably and far less involving. Many attempts at drama such as Benajmin's time with his father fell a bit flat and the humming bird metaphor felt weak and contrived.I would say my most obvious reaction to this film was that Fincher simply did not seemed very interested in these characters, nothing to invest in their emotions. There are numerous scenes that are filmed very artfully, but never felt more than filling time and empty space. Fincher's camera, and thus his eye, are far more interested in Button when he was young and at his most curious. The later years of love and loss, are endlessly bland and procedural and an ending that seemed more at home in an episode of ER than in an epic love story. The truth is the film had probably ended about 20 minutes earlier and by that time, everyone involved had overstayed their welcome.So no I would never buy Benjamin Button for my Blu-Ray player. I have been following Fincher ever since Alien3. I found his twisted visual sense to be enjoyable to the last drop. Seven and Fight Club are wondrous in their trickery and The Game and Zodiac are moralistic troves down dark alleys of the mind. Even Panic Room is one of my favorite thrillers because it was full of life and unexpected turns. But with Benjamin button, Fincher has strayed from his flock. We feel every turn before we get there, because of the premise, we know the way to the end and its not much interesting when we get there. Sure its a sad story, but it isn't a very interesting one. And no matter how well the film is made, there is a feeling of disappointment one cannot ignore. There is really no reason to watch this more than once. If you wish to see a deliberate story of love lost and a life unattainable, I point you to Kubrick's timeless Barry Lyndon.One last thing is on the technical side. Being a photographer, there are some points I will pick at. This is the second time Fincher has used the Viper digital camera system. The film is purposely desaturated, but just like with Zodiac, the digital capture just cannot capture light in a truly luminous manor. Almost every image just looks flat, devoid of snap. And just like Zodiac and some pieces of the Viper-filmed Miami Vice, the images tend to be a tad soft, probably because the Viper cannot resolve the same level of detail of film---yet anyway. So props to Claudio Miranda for his craft, but the equipment still has a ways to go.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
A film that has everything.,"This film is based on Fitzgerald short story called the same way. I read Fitzgerald and honestly the movie is very different but way much better. Here we see how great the special effects went on Benjamin's face, Brad Pitt did a really good performance with very natural expressions.The plot is basically a man that was born physically looking old, and the film goes on deeply into his life and all the events and situations Benjamin confronts only because he's different for growing young.This movie can be seeing as a point of view of a social criticism because society often rejects the difference, sometimes because it's just unusual and can't be accepted or sometimes because of the fear of accepting it without knowing future consequences. But also, this movie can be interpreted as a message sent to the audience, a message that is never too late to achieve your goals in life. And so, in my first impression, the thing I got in mind was that when people get older they start to act like little kids again, so it's wonderful that this movie portraits how the time play us back.After watching this movie, probably you will see life for another perspective and will want to enjoy it at the fullest and start to work for your greatest aspirations because time is not forever and it can't be turned back.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Grossly Overrated,"Ben Button is a very much overrated film about a man who is living out his life backwards, beginning with an old man and living out his life until his death as a baby. The film was based on a short story as I recall and in my opinion should have stayed as one, the film spans out to approximately 3 hours and depicts many insignificant moments in his life. Along with the most boring footage I have ever seen in a Golden Globe nominated film, it carries some exiting yet impossible moments (despite the fact that the concept as a whole is unbelievable which is completely understandable). The film in my eyes is a cross between Zemekis' Forrest Gump, and Cameron's Titanic, except even The Titanic was better than Ben Button. Despite my dislike of the movie, I would have to admit that Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett were decent, and the production quality of the film is high. The only thing that this film lacks is substance and in a film like this, it is the most important part. I voted this a 6 out of 10 only because of the acting, which as I said before was decent and the quality of the film's production.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

Not worthy of the rights to Fitzgerald's short story,"This film has the audacity to claim that it is based on the short story ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" by the incomparable F. Scott Fitzgerald (published in 1922) who credits Mark Twain and Samuel Butler for the philosophical idea that 'it's a pity that the best part of life came at the beginning and the worst part at the end'.This film version of ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" did not retain any of the cogitative ideas presented in the book when a man ages backwards. So when watching, there is no deep thought-provoking concepts explored, and nothing to engage you in a philosophical exploration of life. I'm guessing that the only thing of value is supposed to be that part of the film has Brad Pitt looking not attractive. That is as far as Hollywood can take a good book.Clearly the film does have high production values and they may have done a lot of good things, but they lost their right to be judged fairly as a film once they bought the rights to Fitzgerald's story. Now nobody will even have a chance to see this great story brought to visual life, and that is a travesty.Please go to your local public library and borrow a copy of ""Tales of the Jazz Age"", you will be able to read the short story and get so much more out of it than the film and in less time and money.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
A captivating masterpiece?,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a weird little - it's a 2 hours and half - film. The subject is intriguing enough to get you to watch it but you stay because it's simply captivating. I was so invested in the story that I cried several times while watching it. The film is touching and heartwarming, and also subtle. It seamlessly breezes through times and really brings to life what the tagline is about ""Life isn't measured in minutes but in moments.""The film does go through Benjamin Button's life and really shows every step, moments, that defined who he is. The movie is very much grounded in reality which makes the fantasy elements of the story real. You quickly believe that a boy born old but with the mind of baby is possible. So the magic is there, grounded in the reality of Benjamin's life. I don't know who to accredit this to but it's very clear, palpable, that when Benjamin is growing up, looking like a man in his nineties his youthful energy shines through.Brad Pitt, being the title character is just stunning in this film. He helps make the weird aspects of the film OK. The same goes for Taraji P. Henson, she makes the old wrinkled baby the most normal thing, she brought the dramatic gut wrenching emotions of a mother's love in all her scenes. They all have their moments Julia Ormond, Tilda Swinton and Cate Blanchett all bring another layer, another moment in Benjamin's life. Blanchett evokes the undeniable question of love, and a lasting one as that. Benjamin's condition raises a valid question about age and love, which is interestingly dealt with in the film.More than a riveting story with great acting, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a technical prowess. The make up, the cinematography, and the special effects are mind-blowing Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett look older and then younger and it's done beautifully. The darkness and lighting in David Fincher's style of film making really compliments the story but more so the technicality of the film. He was the perfect director for and did an amazing job throughout.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a wonderful film about time, life, and love. It's another David Fincher masterpiece that is timeless.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Another good Fincher and Pitt partnership.,"Although Brad Pitt takes on a supernatural role for the third time, I feel his grim reaper in ""Meet Joe Black"" still stands out, even surpassing his undead character in ""Interview with a Vampire"". That said, his Benjamin Button is not only off the wall, but in a subtle way proves a timeless message – No matter who you are or whatever you become, there is always a beginning and an end.The story is narrated by a dying elderly lady, through the title character's journal. It begins one night in post World War I New Orleans when a hideous baby is born, extinguishing his mother's life as he begins his own. Aghast by this abomination, the father immediately abandons the infant hoping it would never see the light of day. But a kind hearted black woman finds and shelters the baby. Benjamin, as she names him, is a freak of nature as he is born old and frail with no apparent chance of survival. However, that doesn't stop her from raising him as her own. Then a strange thing happens, while learning to walk and talk, Benjamin starts to ""grow"" younger. As the years go by, he gradually becomes younger, while everyone around him are aging and dying. Along comes Daisy, an adolescent redhead who strikes an immediate bond with a very senior Benjamin. But their new found friendship is short as she pursues a career in professional dancing while Benjamin starts work as a sailor. As the years fly past, their paths cross many times until a point when they are almost the same age, allowing them to grab a moment in time, giving into a relationship both secretly hoped for. From here on the film takes on a darker tone and like Benjamin, suggests we have already seen the happy ending in the beginning.""Forrest Gump"" is one of my all time favorite movies but I couldn't help notice some uncanny similarities between these two films; starting with the Southern setting and the very Southern accents from several characters in both films. There are also mutual references to the violent hurricanes that frequent these US regions. Both Forrest and Benjamin are ridiculed and loathed from a young age, but go on to become legends of sorts. Sub-plots from both films blend with actual American history along with a short yet intense war scene. Finally, both films have an unrequited love theme that is reciprocated too late. Comparisons aside and without a doubt, the only thing more curious than Benjamin's inverted world is this intriguing story from the legendry Scott Fitzgerald. But adapting Fitzgerald's short story into a screenplay is the ingenuity of Eric Roth, the screenwriter behind ""Forrest Gump"". Even as an adaptation, the concept here is beyond original thanks to director David Fincher and his nuance as a master storyteller. It is always entertaining to have twists and turns in a good story, but an abstract story that also becomes believable as it is beautiful? From its phenomenal beginning to its profound ending, this story is about the frailty of humans and passage of time through our greatest emotions – love, yearning and loss; but not necessarily in that order.If it weren't for the overrated ""Slum Dog Millionaire"", this film would have easily grabbed the ""Best Picture"" Oscar at the 81st Academy awards. Picturing how Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett would look when they get old is one of the reasons why this film did win an Oscar for ""Best Makeup"", amongst two other Academy Awards. Sharing intermittent screen time together, Pitt and Blanchett are perfectly cast with magnetic screen chemistry. Despite the makeup and cinema magic, this is Brad Pitt with his best foot forward and easily one of the best films of his career. Having worked with Pitt before, this epic film from Fincher will take up more than two hours of your time, but films like this are a rare achievement in contemporary cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
an intriguing setup but too broad and too long,"From director David Fincher comes this tale of a man born under unusual circumstances. Pitt is Benjamin Button, a man born old who ages backwards and has the burden of trying to live a normal life despite his bizarre and inexplicable predicament. Beginning in the early 1920s the story focuses primarily on his relationship with Daisy (Blanchett), and their attempts to maintain a romance despite the tumultuously changing times and their inevitable age difference. Fincher (who seems to be taking a page from Robert Zemeckis) creates a dazzling world all its own with striking cinematography, breathtaking visual effects, and unforgettable characters, but it's too long and only seems to exist for playing the gimmick of a man who ages in reverse for all it's worth. Pitt is good, though his performance is drowned out by the scope of complex makeup effects, Blanchett is adequate, meanwhile Henson is fabulous as the devout southern woman who ""adopts"" and comes to love Benjamin as her own. Some touching moments, and some funny ones, but they'd be more effective with a shorter running time. **½",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button,"The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button is about a man born with unusual complications who later goes on to lead a normal life, but his unique condition may come back to haunt him and he must deal with that as he seeks work and falls in love. I was overall quite disappointed with this film. After seeing how many awards and nominations it has earned, I figured I would really like this story, but it left me with much to be desired. Technically the film is very well made with great makeup, sets, cinematography and visuals. I also liked the overall visual style and the period piece settings as well. The acting from the entire ensemble cast was also quite good, so I guess my main problem lies with the film's screenplay. I thought the first half of the film was fascinating and really quite involving and unique. I was actually quite intrigued about what would happen to this character in the second half of the film and that is where I was disappointed. Whereas, I felt the first half of the film to be quite interesting and have a good pace to it, I could not say the same for the second half. To me an original and intriguing idea just used many old Hollywood clichés and story lines and for me the film really started to drag. Normally, I do not have a problem with films with a longer running time and if I am really enjoying said film the time goes by really quickly for me, but this film had a longer running time and it was dragging for me and I was getting quite impatient for it to end. Not to mention that the second half of the movie was very sappy and melodramatic to the point of being ridiculous. It's one of those films that tries so hard to leave you with a lasting emotion, that it actually tries too hard and goes overkill with overly sad music and situations. I have nothing against sad movies, or even crying at a film, but when the film feels so forced on the viewer like this, it just does absolutely nothing for me. I wasn't heart warmed, or deeply saddened. I was just basically bored and ready to leave the theatre. If the second half of the film had been quite as well written, or original as the first half I could definitely see this film winning many awards and getting tons of praise, but as it currently stands I think it is just an okay film that could have been a lot better. Still this is just my opinion and others seem to love this film, so you the reader have to make up your own mind over the movie, but for me it just didn't hold up as well and resulted in another typical Hollywood film released at Oscar time hoping for a nomination, but with nothing new, or original.

Its ambitious, its risky and it pays off. I dont really agree with it being slow even with the run time. It had my attention like a good book. The acting by the leads is just superb. Brad Pitt really flexes his abilities (I happen to thing hes a great actor) and couldnt imagine another co star aside from Cate. Just trying to imagine being put into his shoes through stages of his life is difficult, interesting and scary to thing about. Which this is the type of stuff the movies gets to stick with you.

The first hour was quite interesting, and yet one of the major flaws I had with this film became apparent: No matter how old he looks or how old he really is, he seems like the same character.No one in the film really seemed to undergo changes. For some reason his relationship made me think of Forest Gump and his Jenny, but it was no where near as deep as Gump's relationship.No one made a big deal about a man who is aging backwards. The film could have just been about the life of any normal man. There was no real feeling of magic about his reverse aging. No real sense that it made any difference to the film.

A damn-long movie with a long name...,"Among a group of 5-6 friends I was the only one who did not like this movie. So one may conclude that it should not be a bad movie after all. To me, however, it will be remembered as a ""boring movie with a long name"".So the idea is that a man ages backwards. Well, that's a good idea for a movie but even the writers of a 30-minute late night show may come up with better ideas. ""Memento"" is a great film not only because of its brilliant idea but the way that idea was implemented.Although this film is packed with some good actors and dazzling makeup and visual effects, the weak script and character development makes this movie a failure. After the first hour of the movie I lost my faith in the story and was just waiting for the occasional lightning scenes!The movie has so many irrelevant events with no help to the main story like war scenes, hurricane Katrina, the woman who liked swimming, and even the mumbling old Cate Blanchett parts. In a well-developed story all of these would have been a part of the whole puzzle but here they are just unsuccessful attempts to give more dimension to this rather predictable story.Had not the movie received so high IMDb rating, I would have given it a 5 or 6 minus. Now I give it a sole star to keep the movie south of really good films in the chart!",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Curiously Empty,"THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON certainly has no trouble living up to its name. It is very curious indeed, for instance, how a man can be born to this world the size of an infant but with the physical affliction of a man at death's door. It is remarkable that a two and a half hour epic can be so consistently beautiful to behold and breathtaking until its final moments. While it isn't the least bit unusual to catch Cate Blanchett on top of her game, it is certainly impressive to see Brad Pitt exhibit such restraint and internalized inquisitiveness. It is definitely intriguing to witness a director as dark as David Fincher (ZODIAC, SE7EN, FIGHT CLUB) abandon the genre that made him who he is and side step into such a grand, romantic piece with such apparent ease and enthusiasm. But it is perhaps most curious how this film, where every element is so delicately placed and nurtured to a point where it borders on technical perfection, can be so cold and empty an experience despite itself.Of course, within the context of the film, the curious thing about Benjamin Button is that he is aging backwards while all of humanity is progressing naturally. Benjamin must suffer through his childhood in the body of an old man who has already lived his life when he is really just discovering it. Too frail to participate, he must watch life happen from the front porch of the old age home that has taken him in. Here, he bears witness to life in its final stages and grows accustomed to the constant presence of death. His perspective is undeniably unique as he is always moving forward despite the reversed nature of his physical growth. Yet, this view and the wisdom it could bring are not shared with Benjamin's most ardent observers, the audience. We are here for his story and the meaning it could bring to our relatively uncomplicated existences but instead, all we are given is the story itself. This amounts to little more than the long life of Benjamin Button, which would not be particularly different if it weren't for the whole aging backwards thing.It is one thing certainly to have all of the characters who encounter Benjamin accept him for who he is but that expectation is mildly unrealistic to ask of an audience. Still, this film has been bouncing around Hollywood for years for a number of reasons, not the least of which was figuring out how to make it look realistic. Fincher finally settled on having graphs of Pitt's face drafted onto actors of different sizes and stature playing him at various stages of his aged infancy. The results are entirely believable and the makeup work, which so often detracts in such extreme cases such as these, is quite complimentary. And so visually, we buy into it. The performances also guide us to do the same as they are natural and heartfelt. And as if this weren't enough to transport us to this historic, fantasyland, Claudio Miranda's rich, contrasting cinematography does everything needed to fill in whatever gaps were left. With all this effort spent to make sure we believe what we are seeing, it is an awful shame that equal time wasn't spent on giving us something to believe in.I blame Eric Roth. With so many things going for THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON, I have to lay the blame somewhere and Roth is the easiest person to point at. Roth's script is epic in proportion but minute in terms of purpose and meaning. Having proved his ability to carry people on long life journeys, such as that of FORREST GUMP, it is clear why he would be chosen to expand F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story into such a long film. In the process though, he took an unconventional concept and told it as conventionally as he could (did I mention that Benjamin's entire story is read from a diary at Blanchett's hospital deathbed). He created a character that is not so unlike the naïve Forrest. Benjamin is an observer of life; he watches it move forward from a perspective that none of us can truly comprehend and one that sadly, Roth and Fincher never allow us to see.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
The curiously compelling case of Benjamin Button,"Benjamin Button was born under unusual circumstances. He was born old, a baby with the wrinkly appearance and multiple maladies of an elderly man. As everyone around him grows older it is Benjamin's fate to grow younger. Backwards Benjamin goes, from that wrinkly baby to a child confined by ""old age"" to a wheelchair to an older-looking Brad Pitt. And then to just plain Brad Pitt and then a younger-looking Brad Pitt and...well, you get the point. Curious indeed. And this exceptionally curious life's journey is captured brilliantly. Pitt's performance in this incredibly challenging role is terrific. Obviously in this kind of story special effects and makeup are going to be critically important. If the effects fail the movie is doomed to fail. That proves to be no concern as this is one movie in which the special effects are special indeed. As Benjamin lives his life in reverse the whole thing actually seems plausible and believable. It looks real and for that the effects and makeup teams cannot receive enough praise. For as good as everything looks though the film still has to grab you emotionally to really work. The viewer has to really buy in to this story and director David Fincher crafts his tale in such a way that one can't help but become emotionally invested in the curious life's saga of Benjamin Button.At its heart this is a love story. Now how exactly, and with whom exactly, could a man like Benjamin Button fall in love? How is it possible for this man to share his life with anyone? The answer comes in the person of Daisy, a young girl whom Benjamin meets during his childhood. Of course during his ""childhood"" Benjamin is by all appearances about 70 years old. But Benjamin and Daisy have an instant, if rather odd, connection. Nobody seems to really understand Benjamin. Somehow though young Daisy seems to get it. And their bond remains strong as Daisy grows older and Benjamin grows younger. The young girl growing older, the old man growing younger, destined to meet in the middle. It may be the most unusual love story you'll ever see but the love between these two is very real and incredibly heartfelt. It's a powerful, compelling and rather beautiful story which is always tinged with a hint of melancholy. Because when Benjamin and Daisy do eventually meet in the middle the unspoken truth is that they remain two ships passing in the night, headed in opposite directions. This really cannot end well can it? We shall see.This is a movie unlike anything else you'll ever see. Well, most anything else as many Forrest Gump parallels are obvious. But while that comparison does work somewhat the fact is Benjamin Button is an incredibly unique film. If this story fell into the wrong hands we could have been left with a film which was an absolute mess. But director Fincher steers this production beautifully. In so many ways it is an incredibly challenging story to tell and you get the sense not many people could have really pulled it off. Fincher does it wonderfully, helped immeasurably of course by Benjamin himself in the person of Pitt. What a long, strange character arc Benjamin has and Pitt is spot-on every step of the way. Having a wonderful actress in Cate Blanchett to play off of certainly doesn't hurt Pitt's cause. Blanchett's portrayal of Daisy is, as you would expect, magnificent. So many other characters float in and out of Benjamin's life and a terrific ensemble cast brings each and every person to wonderfully vibrant life. Such a large group of performers and it seems there is not one casting misstep. Credit again to Fincher for drawing out amazing performances from so many people. Maybe the film is a tad bit long but it's hard to say which scenes you could really do without. Benjamin Button led an amazing life and you can't help but want to see as much of it as possible. All in all it's a film which is a magnificent technical achievement but more importantly it's a wonderful story. And that story is told beautifully in what proves to be a thoroughly enjoyable and heartwarming film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

Takes a long time to say nothing of consequence.,"There are certain films that I claim are ""amazing"" or some other similar adjective but don't actually recommend for people looking for entertainment. 2001: A Space Odyssey is such a movie. An extraordinary example of movie making as art but most will find it boring as hell.Some movies explore a concept or idea in minute detail and at great length, that is to say the film makers used the movie to convey a point, some great truth or what have you. These movies can have entertainment value or deliver some emotional payload.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is neither.Long winded without saying anything. Slow to start.. but never goes anywhere. Brad Pitt's accent will strike you as absurd several times throughout the movie.I think the goal was a new Forest Gump but the film makers forgot the memorable characters, the interesting events, an engaging story.Absolute waste of time, I stuck around thinking ""surely this will become interesting"" after I realized that wasn't the case I stuck out the last 60 minutes! just to see how they handled the childhood part of the title character's life.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

It is an inspiring film.,""" time is passing, even backwards."" Benjamin's time is passing backwards. It is an unusual story from other films. It's a piece of wonder. Benjamin Button was born under unusual circumstances that he ages backwards. No matter this is a curse or a gift from God, he still has his own life as other people. That's what the film tells us. Besides, Benjamin encourages us to be the ones who we want to be, and make ourselves the best. Many times I can acquire from the film is that we always look backward on our life, at the moments we should still know what we are going to do next and we must live our life forward. Actually, the case of Benjamin Button is extremely incredible, but it is established as a real life of a man. It's so true. It's well- directed. And the acting is also a brilliance that both Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett acted in a perfect way. Totally the film cultivates a comfortable and favourable ambiance. At last, I admire this film very much and I may say it has become one of the films on my favourite film list. I strongly recommend this to you all as it might inspire your mind.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Benjamin Button: An Interesting Concept Slightly Flawed in its Execution,"Benjamin Button is an enjoyable film. There is humour, drama, emotion, and action. The idea of a man ageing backwards makes for an interesting film and is an original way to explore the themes of life and death. However, the theme exploration is one of the areas where the film falls flat.First off, the acting and the characters; Brad Pitt was not a good choice as the lead, in my opinion. I would probably have gone with an actor who is less of a typical Hollywood leading man: e.g. Gary Oldman. That said, he does a passable job in this role albeit seems to lack emotion at key times in the movie. Cate Blanchett was, I believe, a considerable better choice that Pitt- she out-acted him despite her character being arguably the less interesting one. The characters narrowly avoid being dull clichés and stereotypes with an extra touch of depth to each one, keeping you rooting for the protagonists. The supporting cast was excellent; no complaint there.Next; the story and the way it is presented. The story, like the characters, avoids the general clichés and pitfalls of a lot of these types of films. I felt that the story was one of the stronger points of this film- it seemed like a more believable version of Forrest Gump. One of the flaws in the storytelling, however, was the narration. It's a cheap trick to move the story along and did very little in Benjamin Button; generally, when a film has a narrator, I expect some extraordinary insight and commentary from the narrator- that didn't happen (with the exception of the favourite scene in the film involving a long chain of events, I'm not going to spoil it), and I got the feeling that the only reason the narration was in the films, was so the entire audiences follows the story (very old and overused trick).I mentioned theme exploration earlier; well, let me return to that. Benjamin Button has very strong themes, I can't deny that. They are sufficiently explored through some interesting (albeit simple) motifs: e.g. man getting hit by lightning, hummingbird etc. Despite this, I felt the themes of life and death could have been explored much more in-depth through the plot. I mean, this is a supernatural story- the makers had a lot of artistic license and could have used this to their advantage. I finished the film feeling that the point of the movie wasn't used to its fullest potential.I will end this review on a high note: the directing and overall cinematography. First, I will do what I rarely do and compliment the special effects; the make-up used on Brad Pitt was extraordinary (especially towards the end where he easily passed for 17- very subtle touch of special effects there). Second, the directing was excellent and there are several very beautiful shots in the film, so kudos to David Fincher; the directing was often enough to divert my attention from often-times bland dialogue. As a piece of film-making, Benjamin Button is unique, interesting, and simply very-well done. Hollywood hasn't made a good period-piece in years (I mean, one where I actually believe for the entire film that it takes place in that era); The Curious Case of Benjamin Button comes close (if it weren't for some unrealistic 21st century-esquire lines).Overall, I would recommend this film to anybody who doesn't mind watching something that isn't mindless action for almost three hours. It won't keep you glued to the screen the entire time, but I found that the movie had my full attention most of the time. If you liked Forrest Gump, I think you will find Benjamin Button enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

To me it was filled with love. The gentle character of Benjamin himself, the selfless love of ""Momma"" All the scenes were beautiful even while they were violent. I loved the scenes in the kitchen in the Russian winter palace, in the home, the last scene, the sailing scenes. This was so rich and dense with characters that were all interesting and ultimately loving, from Benjamin's father to the twin brothers on the tugboat and the kindliness of so many of the people in the home, Benjamin's ""sister"" the welfare workers and the main characters themselves.

"Original, Creative and Funny","The movie is based on a short story, it describes the life of Benjamin Button, who's mother died during his delivery, and who's father put him on the doorsteps of home when he is born with the appearance of an elderly man. The home, run by a black maid named Queenie, takes him in as a son, and people begin to see that he is in fact aging backwards, from old to young. But you wanna know what's funny? For all its preaching about unpredictable events, Benjamin button lives a pretty normal life. He worked on a boat, he worked in the navy, and then he operates a toll booth. That sounds pretty average to me, and I found personally that Benjamin Button is more of a science-fiction character than a human being. The fact that he spends his whole life seeing his friends die off is interesting.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"Good, but a classic?","I went into this expecting a good movie, and that is what I got out of Benjamin Button. The film-making and direction are obviously amazing, and Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett turn in commendable performances. Unfortunately, I just didn't feel an emotional connection to the story until over 2/3rds into the movie.I don't put too much stock into comparisons with Forrest Gump. I'd say Benjamin Button and Gump deal with very different themes, although they both have a lot of plot elements in common. A few of them were very apparent and annoying at times, the most egregious being Button's mama's favorite aphorism: You never know what's coming for ya'.The biggest problem I have with Button is that in spite of the fantastic direction and acting, the story and the main character just don't elicit a great response from you until the end is nigh. The last 40 minutes or so are the best of the film, and the most touching. But in the first two hours, Button's character is an enigma, and we learn nothing at all about what he thinks or feels, beyond his love for Daisy and his mama. The final 40 minutes are a triumph because through his actions, we finally learn something about Button - what he thinks of his condition, and what kind of life he decides to lead. It doesn't hurt either that Button's character has a diminished role in the final part, with Cate Blanchett taking a more prominent position.This is an unusual Hollywood epic, that much is certain. We don't see movies like this from Hollywood very often - a movie with great direction and acting, a long epic of consistent quality. The problem is that the story and the protagonist just come off as a bit too flat, a little too 2-dimensional, for most of the movie. I liked Benjamin Button, and it's sure to be remembered for quite a while, but the storytelling just doesn't work quite well enough for it to be among the best. It is really hard for fantastic acting and directing to rescue a shabbily-written story, and unfortunately, I don't think even the great team on Benjamin Button was up to the task. Do watch Benjamin Button, but don't be surprised if you find the storytelling a little lacking.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"Very good through most of it, but novelty wears thin through second half!","I enjoyed this film but do think it was rather long winded. It was pretty cheesy in places and almost too well done if you know what i mean.As you would expect the acting was flawless.The special effects were incredible.The idea is genius.The story is a bit too long and kind of predictable, not that there's much to predict.I think the message could have been expressed within 2 hours and being longer kind of ruined the film for me, however being the whole story of someones life, you can't complain too much.Put the effects and idea aside and you don't have too much of a spectacular film, I wouldn't want to see this one winning too many awards. I have seen some much more interesting and better films in the last month and wouldn't put this one up there.As Benjamin gets younger the story gets less interesting and the novelty wears off, you can see where the story is going and I personally felt a bit annoyed knowing I would have to watch another hour of it. I wasn't exactly going to stop before the end, mainly because I wanted to see how they would make Brad Pitt look like a teenager but the message had been made and the story had pretty much been told.All round, this is a watchable film and definitely worth going to see, but certainly not one of the better ones this winter, and most definitely not worth being in the top 250 on here (as it currently is)I'd rate it a 7.5",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
A Hollywood Masterpiece,"A great film no, no, no a remarkable film from David Fincher(Director of Fight Club, Seven, and Zodiac if you happened to not know already)and Eric Roth(Writer of Forest Gump and Insider) and, although, this film strays far away from the original short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the film was still infused with Fitzgerald's philosophical awareness of America and its future, which was apparent in the final shot of Benjamin Button.The story spans from the early 19th century to just about when Katrina hit New Orleans and with that it brings a presence that invokes lots of conflict and even more resolve. Benjamin, as everyone should know by now, ages backwards and is subjected to a life of turmoil. He joins the Navy in war time, has a fling, inherits a small fortune, falls in love, has a baby and then travels the world. Of course, there is more in between, but I'd rather not say because I wouldn't want to ruin the film for anyone. But I can say the shear beauty of this film both ellued and hypnotized me with the magnitude of its composition and range of its rhythmic pace. It was an utter breakthrough for Hollywood, not only because it will remain a memorable story but, also because of its its uniqueness in the garbage that's getting pulled through the mainstream.And with that said and done, It was great treasure to watch and enjoy on opening day and I expect and recommend that every person watch this extraordinary film.Jacob Reategui",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
no Forrest Gump,"This is an ambitious movie, and it will enjoy I believe success especially with the American audiences and with the academy members grabbing a number of Oscars (but I hope not the one for the best film deserved I think by 'Sinedoche, New York'). It is Oscar stuff with a story located in America (New Orleans filmed at its best) spreading over decades, with greater than life characters. Or I should say greater than time in this case.The ambitions exceed even the usual American saga story. The script written by Eric Roth, script-writer of 'Forrest Gump' and loosely inspired by a short story by Scott Fitzgerald tries to tell deeper things about the relativity of the passing of time, the inevitability of death even if time runs for the main hero from old age to childhood, about the power of love to transcend time. Yet the ideas as interesting as they are do not all find a cinematographic equivalent on screen, the result being a film with many memorable parts but also with failed ones.I did like the story telling in the first part of the movie, the many simple stories and moving characters coming together, but I had the feeling that there were too few new elements or surprises in the second part to justify the almost three hours film length. I loved the setting of the city of New Orleans, which filmed across many decades provides a fabulous landscape of color and passion, sounds and mist where all legends are possible. I liked the acting of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, each of them would deserve an Oscar, but overall they did not come together perfectly in a story that needs intense emotion and perfect chemistry in order to overcome credibility problems. Most of all however the feeling on mission incomplete derives from the fact that not all the ambitious philosophical messages found a cinema equivalent on screen.At the end this film does not stand the comparison with Forrest Gump, the other story of a different type of hero located in the Southern hemisphere of the American universe. The reason is maybe the fact that while Tom Hank's Forrest Gump carried the innocence of permanently rediscovering the purity of the world through the eyes of his character, Benjamin Button's recession into young age and childhood lacks such innocence and keeps a taint of sickness and uneasiness failing despite Pitt's magnificent acting to take us viewers with him into his universe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008),"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008)  Was unsure whether to watch this due to the largely mixed reviews it had received but I am glad I did. The short story was masterfully transferred to the big screen with a truly engrossing plot that brought joy, sorrow and intrigue in equal droves throughout. The title character had you truly absorbed and Pitt managed to garner empathy almost effortlessly with a watertight performance. Blanchett was also superb for her part and the two leads obviously no how to get the best from one another. The three hour playtime flew by and I left the cinema having been totally sucked into the story and taken away from the world outside, which to me is what any great film should do. The best film I have seen in the cinema for a long, long time. ********* 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Nice movie,"To start with, I have to say I'm quite surprised how they made a movie, which is more than two and a half hours, considering how short the book is (in my country it's less than 49 pages). They just got the idea from the book and the rest is something else. For example, original Benjamin Button isn't that loyal to his girlfriend. I'm glad the first time I saw the movie I didn't know about the book. Anyways, if I ingore this fact, the movie is nice. I liked acting, music and cinematography. 2,5 hours well spent, again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Benjamin Button is a wonderful film,"I found the film to be very well thought out and the roles played with amazing warmth. I did not find that old Benjamin and young Daisy were ""attracted"" to each other in the way that some posters here seem to believe. I thought it more as a kind of ""on the same page"" type of thing as opposed to a sexual desire on either part. He was drawn by her blue eyes and she was drawn because he was ""different"" to the others in her grandmother's retirement home. That's my view anyway. Nevertheless, I think the film is well worth the nominations it received. I have nothing against Brad Pitt but I am not an avid fan. With that being said, I think he gave a brilliant performance. Cate Blanchett is beautiful and genuine in her portrayal of Daisy. I hope this film cleans up at the Oscars. :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Holds up well - worth your time,"I remember really liking THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON when it first was released in 2011. It made me a fan of Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchette, Tilda Swinton, Taraji P. Henson, Jared Harris and Director David Fincher - and I defended this film to those that did not have as high an opinion of this movie than I did. So when my daughter recommended we re-watch this film (a film I haven't watched in 5 or 6 years), I was excited to revisit it.And...I'm glad I did...for I re-fell in love with the portions of the film that I remembered fondly while I was also able to see the flaws (mostly in pacing) that drops this film down a peg.Based on the short story by F. Scott Fitgerald, THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON tells the tale of a man who ages backwards. His life is chronicled from his birth (right after the ""Great War"" ended in the 1919) and follows right up to his death.As played by Brad Pitt in an Oscar nominated turn, the titular character is earnest, honest, somewhat naive and (as he gets younger) very attractive to look at. I've been a fan of Pitt's acting since the days of FIGHT CLUB and 12 MONKEYS (and think he deserved his Oscar for ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD) and he does not disappoint in this film, especially since he has quite a few strong performers to play against (even while under heavy make-up).Jared Harris, Taraji P. Henson (in an Oscar nominated performance) and Mahershala Ali all bring strong, winning performances but is the performances of 2 strong actresses that drew my attention to them from this point forward. Tilda Swinton (SNOWPIERCER) brings a sense of longing to her portrayal of a woman that Benjamin has a brief affair with. Their scenes together are touching and poignant with a sense of sadness that had me rooting for Swinton's character throughout.But, it is the appearance of Cate Blanchette (THOR: RAGNAROK) that elevates this film for me. I had been a fan of Blanchette's since her Oscar winning role of Katherine Hepburn in THE AVIATOR, but this performance raised her abilities in my eyes and I eagerly await everything that she is going to appear in (including CAROL, a film that I loathe).Director David Fincher (Se7EN, FIGHT CLUB) was also Oscar nominated for his work in this film and he blends a lifelong love story with events of the day while mixing in some wonderful CGI that helps age (or de-age) Benjamin as the film unfolds. This film, for me, was a departure for Fincher who I came to admire for his trippy films, but he brings a human-ness to the proceedings that helps ground the fantastical into reality.Upon this viewing, I did find that this film does drag a bit at times - it is as if Fincher (and the cast) fell so in love with the characters and the scenes, that they lose track of the pacing, letting the film bog down from time to time. The film runs 2 hours and 46 minutes...and I think I could help find spots to trim about 20 minutes out of it.The film did win in 3 of the 13 categories it was Oscar nominated in (it was nominated for BEST FILM, but did not win that award). The Oscar wins were all for special effects of some sort - and I kept looking to see if I could spot the tricks and Special FX in the film - and I could not. A good sign that this film is holding up 9 years later.Take a trip through time (backwards) with Benjamin Button, it's is worth it.Letter Grade: A-8 stars out of 10 (and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"""The brief and vivid union of a tempestuous heart united to the tempest""","This is a remarkable film, and to me, Fincher's attempt to create a complete picture is as admirable as it was nearly achievable - successfully drawing together the two parts of my existence perhaps most common to us all, if ever a thing can group us together. That is, love (the search or loss of it) and our terminal stay in this world. The first is realized through two fine performances by Pitt and Blanchett, and the latter, by their circumstances, which prove non-too-unusual after all. Our life is fleeting, yes, as are our actions and the few relationships we will have during our stay. The condition has summoned some to revolution, and others to their premature, or perhaps, fitting exit. The characters in this film will come and go like us as well. Though many of us will pass this life unnoticed, few of us will attempt to draw from this strange security, the subsequent freedom it thus affords us. Often too passive or too impatient at what we later discover are the wrong moments, we lose great love or the chance at it, and discover at long end, that the actions which finally drew their present course, lead us to a life we are non-too-pleased with.Strangely, this grim bell is why the film remains hopeful, despite its subject, and ultimately succeeds. Indeed, though epic love, like Benjamin's strange condition, war, or the beginning of yet a new life all find within them the same terminal fate, and although the winding paths we each cut across the progression of this common fatality may multiply the swings of its axe, our short stay CAN STILL prove rewarding. Brad Pitt's representation of Benjamin, and Fincher's story, are therefore at once hopeful, appropriate and terrific because the one plays, and the other shows love fashioned through a terminal life is not only possible, but also possibly remarkable. To have done so from the viewpoint of Pitt's passive observance is commendable for both the actor and director, who in so doing, place him like us, as an observer becoming gradually aware of a marvelous and yet frightening condition he cannot escape.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"Groundbreaking, but it doesn't realise its promise","The potential of David Fincher going into the mainstream is seemingly enormous. He is a director of brilliant vision and superb talent. With ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"", the story of a man who ages backwards, he has the chance to explore the full extent of his talents, both as a visual filmmaker and a storyteller. It was an exciting proposition, but, for some reason, he only manages to pull out a solid piece of work, which, whilst being visually impressive and technically astounding, is somewhat lost in its own pretensions.The film's strengths are many in number, though light in weight. The most notable of these are the groundbreaking visual effects and make up which allow Brad Pitt, and to a lesser extent Cate Blanchett, to roll the years back and forward. This is a ""Gollum"" moment: another brilliant and unexpected leap forward in visual effects technology.No matter how they may have been altered, the cast are also excellent. Brad Pitt delivers a very effective performance and is utterly believable all the way through the film. Cate Blanchett is as good as ever, whilst Julia Ormond is given a thankless task as Blanchett's daughter but she carries it off well, and there is also a lovely little performance by Tilda Swinton. Taraji P. Henson, however, steals the film as Button's mother, and fully deserves her Oscar nomination.David Fincher, himself, excels in his usually way, with his optimum style. Some sequences are breathtaking, such as Daisy dancing for Button which is wonderful to see. The film is utterly arresting as a visual experience. It looks beautiful from start to finish and is magnificently shot by Claudio Miranda.However, for a film which is 166 minutes long it does depressingly little with its time. The central motif of Button ageing backwards feels like it should be doing or saying something, but it isn't and, as the condition is never explained in the story or by a theme, it jars somewhat. There are only hints of ideas in this film. There is an anti-war (anti-Bush) theme which floats in occasionally, but is ultimately too short-lived, but there is nothing else which is really going on. Everything seems to be half-baked  enough to envelop the viewer, though not to grip.The film is a sentimental tale and is not an unpleasant way to spend almost three hours. It is at times an astonishing thing to see on screen, but it is not a magnificent thing. It promised so much, but it is a disappointment. It lacks a deal of sophistication and depth which the film perhaps deserves. A masterpiece was hoped for, but all we have is a solid, if groundbreaking, piece of film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
The Reverse story of Benjamin Button,"This is really one of the best movies I've ever watched lately, It's really almost optimum in all (Performance, makeup, photography, selection of the characters, places and decorations, ...) really this masterpiece deserved all it was nominated for ..The story is mainly about the reading in the dairy of Benjamin Button, these diaries were read by Caroline (Julia Ormond) - A young lady - to her dying mother: Mrs Daisy (Cate Blanchett) in the hospital under a quite threat of a nearing twister heading to this hospital ..The dying mother Daisy mentioned the story of the great clock in the station which was designed and manufactured by Monsieur Gateau (Faune A. Chambers)in 1918, as a result for his great sorrow and pain for the loss for his only son in the great war, he had designed the clock to tick backwards in the reverse direction and he went away ..The diaries were dated on 1985 and were written by Benjamin Button, he talked about his strange and curious case since his birth, his mother died after she gave him birth in 1918 after the end of the great WWI, his father was obsessed by the idea that the baby is a freak, got rid of him by leaving him at the door of a retirement care house, A maid in this retirement house called Queenie (Taraji P. Henson) found him and took care of him as a son to her as she has a problem and can't give birth to a baby ..It was found that he baby had all the diseases and look of an aging dying old man (An old man of about 85 years old !!) like the cataract, deafness, .. etc and the doctor predicted that the baby won't last living more than days or weeks at most!! The baby lived .. and had grown up under the care of the kind Queenie to be like a very old man like those in the retirement house .. as he was 5 years old he looked like an 80 years old aging man ..By time it was clear that Benjamin Button was getting younger in body and look while he was getting older and more mature in mentality over the time. he had regained the ability to walk normally, his hearing became better and his sight became sharper .. he met Daisy (Cate Blanchett) as she was a little child living with her old grandmother Tizzy in the retirement house, Daisy liked Benjamin and liked to be closer to him since the first time she saw him ...Life went on with Benjamin who was getting younger and younger .. and he gained the experiences of life as he was getting younger, he learned to drink, make love and relationships and to work .. he faced a lot of situations like facing a German U-boat on the boat he was working on .. he found his father Mr Thomas Button who told him the truth about his life before he die ..Finally he found Daisy again .. she was working as a famous Ballet dancer and living a dissolute life and ignored him .. she had a terrible accident in Paris and everybody left her except him .. this made her love him in return .. now she was 43 years old while he was in the form of a young man in the middle of 30s of his age .. they lived in a continuous love .. she became pregnant and gave birth ..They realized that time is stronger than them .. Daisy became older and Benjamin became younger and he realized that he can no longer live with her and take care of the baby Caroline .. and so he left them and went away ..At last Benjamin became an old boy and then a baby .. old Daisy took care of him .. at the end of year 2002 .. the old station clock made by Monsieur Gateau was replaced by a new one .. in the year 2003 and in a tragic scene .. between the arms of Daisy, Benjamin dies .. after the end of the story the dying Daisy dies in peace ..Really a great picture and performance and one of the best ever movies I had ever seen to Brad Pitt who reached the top in his performance in performing the different ages of Benjamin Button and also by Cate Blanchett which was in her best roles as Daisy as a teenager girl and a dancer with no sense of responsibility then a lover then a mother and an old lady ..also the makeup, directing and decorations were excellent and returning us back to the days of the 30s, 40s, and 50s with high professionalism .. also the great human meanings and scenes .. You are you .. you are your soul and not only your body .. love has no age or era ..Thanks Braddie !! *** Lo'ay",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"More than anything, Benjamin Button seems like the kind of epic movie made for collecting Oscar nominations.","More than anything, Benjamin Button seems like the kind of epic movie made for collecting Oscar nominations. Nominations, I say, because its merits stop short of allowing it to win the big prize. It wants to be this year's The English Patient but is instead more like The Aviator, which was visually impressive but not emotionally.I hate to use Cate Blanchett as a yardstick because of my bias for her but she really is the consummate actress and any 'big' movie that doesn't score her an Oscar nomination is seriously flawed one way or other. Here, I believe it's the story, which never really touched me. It's told like a fairy tale, with wistful narration and glowy cinematography, but it's a story that is bizarre and distant and thus doesn't invite empathy. How does one empathize with a man who's aging in reverse or a woman who loses the love of her life because he's getting too young for her? Actually, done well, a movie could have me empathizing with any character. But the character of Benjamin Button was played with a sort of detachment by Brad Pitt. With most scenes he was more like an observer, watching the people around him. I don't quite understand his Oscar nomination, seeing as how in most of his scenes he was upstaged by his makeup.It is no surprise though, that Taraji P. Henson too scored an Oscar nomination, since she provides the warmest moments of the movie, though unfortunately they're over too early. She plays a woman who's unable to have children and so adopts the aberrant and abandoned Benjamin Button - a very sympathetic role.Blanchett feels unjustly misused here, as she comes across as more like Button's mirror than love interest, serving to just reflect his aging process through the years.The movie does look impressive though, in terms of cinematography and set. It's hard to comment on the makeup, seeing as how no matter how real it looks, you'd know it's not real. While I think director David Fincher did a good job here considering the span of the work, I still prefer him directing thrillers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"Simply Awesome, So far the Best Movie of 2008","Before seeing The Curious Case of Benjamin Button I wondered how I would react to the story of a man who is born old and gets younger as he grows up. Of all of the stories I have come across, this is by far the most bizarre and intriguing. If i had to pick someone to bring this story to the screen I do no think David Fincher would have been my first choice.This is a beautifully written, acted and directed American Masterpiece.The cinematography, sound design and score are phenomenal. The chemistry between Brad and Cate is off the charts. This is a complex movie that I haven't been able to get my mind or emotions totally around, but it is moving as the elements that keep crashing in and about the characters. It is funny and sad and poignant.We had a few great films this year  from the king of blockbusters (Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"") to a compelling biopic (Gus Van Sant's ""MILK"") to a brilliant movie from India like Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"", Mike Leigh's ""Happy-Go-Lucky"", Thomas McCarthy's ""The Visitor"", Courtney Hunt's ""Frozen River"", Tomas Alfredson's ""Let The Right One In"" and Jonathan Demme's ""Rachel Getting Married"", but I doubt I will see anything as good as David Fincher's masterpiece so soon.

Not as good as I remember but still worth the watch,"I loved this movie when it releases but honestly I didn't really find it so great this time around. It has a great premise but a bit slow and stagnant and doesn't really do much with it.The best way I'd describe it is Forest Gump set a few decades earlier, with less whimsy, and more focus on the romantic relationship than history. I think that worked better in FG bc the story was what was going on around him, but Benjamin Button is about the main character but he's kind of a bland character.Still kept my attention even though it's long and there's enough interesting other characters to keep you invested.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
A fantasy that failed to transport,"For me, a good movie is more than an intriguing premise. It is more than the casting of my favorite actor or actors. It is certainly more than clever, state-of-the-art special effects. A good movie is one that touches my heart and captures my imagination. Benjamin Button was not, for me, a good movie. Quite the contrary, unfortunately.I entered the theater with the certainty that I was about to be delighted and instructed. From the film's premise, I expected to be entertained and moved by a fantasy about life's precious impermanence and the beauty of aging and loss, fueled by great chemistry between the film's lead actors. I adore films that show how our lives struggle against time and mortality, including Ground Hog Day, Eternal Sunshine, and Stranger Than Fiction. It was the transformation of the premise into a movie for flesh-and-blood folks like myself and my husband, who had just shlepped through the snow after a forty-five minute train ride downtown, and, coffee cups in hand, craning our necks in the third row, wanted, needed, dare I say even deserved, to be transported, mesmerized, and awestruck.I'm crushed to say that we weren't.The film was lackluster. I felt no sense of wonder, only repulsion at the gremlin-like infant, and at the mask-like makeup of Pitt and Blanchett at the beginning of the film. And as many have commented, I could not identify emotionally with Pitt's charmless characterization of Benjamin as a youth trapped in the prison of a feeble body. Where was his frustration, his yearning, his emotional roller coaster as he struggled to transcend his condition? I didn't see it or feel it. So I waited to feel something, anything.And I did. I felt increasing annoyance at Blanchett's mumbling on her deathbed, to which scene we returned dozens of times, chopping up the ongoing storyline. I felt worried about my husband, who, despite the caffeine, appeared to be slipping in and out of consciousness. I felt embarrassed by the cheap attempts at slapstick humor: the holy-roller preacher drops dead at his own prayer meeting, Benjamin projectile vomits after his first night of drinking, Benjamin discovers his youthful prowess in the tub while still a wrinkled prune.I am no stranger to the fleeting poignancy of life, the bittersweet sorrow of watching vital and vigorous loved ones dwindle and falter. Yes, there can be beauty in it. When people die, we do realize how much they mean to us, and how much life means, just as the movie states. Unfortunately, this statement is made a cliché uttered by a minor character. I wish that, instead, the movie had simply shown us this universal truth, through the unfolding of a specific tale of characters we feel for, rather than trying to force it down our throats with tedious determination.The movie depresses rather than uplifts. Not because it doesn't try to illuminate, but because it puts all its effort into surface appearance: make-up, clever visuals like the enormous clock or the backwards-running film of doomed soldiers impossibly returning home unscathed from battle. Film is visual, but it is also emotional. I want such visuals to touch my emotions, not my intellect. I don't want to say, ""Oh, I get it, Brad Pitt looking from his wheelchair at some playful kids his own age means that he feels trapped by time and wishes he could break free from his body and play with them."" I want to experience it with him. Instead, all I see is a grotesque mask and the heavy hand of the filmmaker manipulating the ""character"" of Benjamin like a toy soldier, moving him from scene to scene: Benjamin as curious youth, Benjamin as roving young man. Yes, I see, but I never feel with him, let alone for him.The only thing that kept me nudging my husband awake was my interest in watching Brad Pitt's make up evolve. I was so disengaged by the action that the only suspense was waiting for Brad Pitt to revert to hottie. Unfortunately, my husband couldn't wait, and just before Brad's actual physique appeared, we tiptoed out of the theater, feeling older by the minute, but grateful that we had opted to regain what little time we had left.We felt cheated. I had opened my heart and mind, and I felt I had been forcefed tedious, obvious, and morbid chunks of ""wisdom"" and ""poignancy"" that I feel we as humans already get. No one who has experienced youth or advancing age cannot get what it all means, and how bittersweet it all is. What I wanted was to see something magic and true unfold. Fantasy can show us truths in ways that realism cannot. I didn't feel the magic, I didn't feel transported, I didn't learn a lesson of the heart. I whiled away the minutes wondering what was so funny about Benjamin being unfairly mistaken for a pedophile. I wondered what Hurricane Katrina was going to do to the hospital when it hit. I wondered why no one objected to a black woman in those times raising a white son. I wondered whether the concession clerk had mistakenly sold me decaf instead of regular. I truly began to speculate about the nature of the passing of time, and why it was passing so terribly slowly.In reading descriptions of the second half the movie, I realize that, while not getting to see Cate and Brad in their prime was disappointing, to have stayed for the second half would only have been more disappointing. I don't ask for movies to feed me Hallmark sentiments. I am tough; I can take whatever message is delivered. I just don't see how the distracting medium of this film does justice to its message. The artifice fails to take wing. Clearly, others fell under its spell. Wish I could have, but it left me cold and resentful.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

"a really lovely story, but that's about it.","Firstly, is should say that this is a lovely movie. it's one of those films where you come out of the cinema feeling that you got more then your moneys worth or where you have no real second thoughts to buying it in high def blu-ray rather then DVD because you want see the fantastic cinematography in every bit of glory. My main issue with the film is it could have been much more.For a man in such an awkward predicament we really don't see much of what he feels about it, the most we understand his feelings are in the opening 30 minutes of a 2 hour, 45 minute film . It would have been great to feel whether pitt is sad or happy about the whole thing. Rather all we see is a general biography of the man, a narration of events rather than an analysis into the character of benjamin button. Despite pitt being the narrator, it may have well been an outsider. in most case we get told the obvious, what is happening in that scene and the emotion in the characters but it never goes beyond that. we're rarely told how key events impact his core thoughts, whether they are life changing or unimportant, what he thinks of what's going on around him and such. If we got deeper insight into pitt's character this would have been a magnificent filmPerformances are good all round but people who say that this is pitt's finest performance are clearly wrong. not much is demanded of him, other then to look sweet and humble. you cant compare this to him in fight club and se7en.without doubt it's a very good movie. a lovely story that you will get hooked to, and fall in love with (Believe me, DVD sales will me massive) and i can recommend that you really should see it, but it's simplicity in storytelling stops it from crossing from good to great.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
A stylish epic which looks fantastic but lacks punch,"I went to see this recently after wanting to see it for some time when I saw the trailer for it. Firstly, I'm a fan of the director (David Fincher) and love his films such as Se7en and Fight Club etc. Also the story seemed so intriguing and it really pulled me into wanting to see it.The beginning starts off quite promisingly with some lovely photography and slightly quick-paced storytelling after we are thrust into just after the Great War. I loved the small sub-plot of the father who lost his son at war which led to him setting the clock he'd built backwards in hope of the war heroes returning. The make-up/visual effects are also superb when seeing Pitt as the decrepit, ancient young boy. Some of the scenes in which he spends his time at the retirement home he grew up in are too slow and wind on for to long, resulting in interest starting to wane. As the film progresses, Benjamin's body change and maturity follows. As we follow his experiences it starts to pick up and it engages you closely with the character as Pitt narrates continuously. The film holds some effective and intriguing messages in regards to life and growth etc.However, as the film goes on you start to wonder why we should be interested in this man's life. We all know he's going through his life backward but this initial interest starts to fade after some time. The film also kept reminding me of another Eric Roth story (Forrest Gump) in which the central character is narrating us through his story. Also the re-occurring floating feather in Forrest Gump could be compared to the re-occurring Humming Bird in this picture. Another similarity is Benjamin's relationship with Miss Rose (Blanchett) to Forrest's relationship with Jenny (both couples don't quite get together until late on and then something dramatic takes their relationship away) The difference between this film and Forrest Gump is that Gump had a clear and definite idea with what they wanted to achieve in the film. The whole story that Forrest always meets the most famous people of the 21st Century and stumbles across many landmarks in history and unknowingly creates famous brands was a concrete idea. The fantasy aspect in Forrest Gump and him remaining his usual self despite it all was the film's path, idea and message. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button lacks that definite and clear path which results in the audience not knowing exactly why we should be taken across this man's life.Also, unfortunately the acting in the film lacks sincerity and an overall sense of feeling with conviction. I'm not the biggest Brad Pitt fan but I thought he was dignified and showed his experience in this film. He under-played the role and it was the perfect approach. The other main role (Rose) played by Cate Blanchett had a performance from her which was bland, lacking emotion and just not enough urge or feeling in the character. This unfortunately resulted in the chemistry between her and Button to be minimal. I couldn't see the love between them, there was no sign of it anywhere. These aspects normally shape a film and greatly contribute to the power of it, and this film lacked it all.On a more positive note, the cinematography throughout was gorgeous, as was the set design, colour, costume and overall look. The messages and little touches including the man who got struck by lightening seven times and Benjamin taking his father to watch the sunset over the lake as he did when he was a boy were touching and poignant.Overall, I thought the film looked superb including some amazing visual effects and make-up (including when Pitt was made to look about 10 years younger than he is now), was directed nicely with a strong narrative structure, some lovely messages and touches but through the lack of interest in places and lack of acting quality/power it resulted in the film losing some punch and losing the merit of being a great film. Therefore it is a good film but it won't be considered an absolute classic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
A curiosity indeed,"F. Scott Fitzgerald, one of the most innovative literary writers of all time, would have never thought that a brief short story about a man that ages backwards would become an ambitious effort from Se7en director, David Fincher. However, as fascinating as it seems, the implementation of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button wasn't as successful as one would have hoped. It presents itself as a Forrest Gump hopeful which surprisingly enough is written by the same man, Eric Roth.The film stars Brad Pitt in the title role as the curious Benjamin; at first, a young boy with no understanding of his condition or of his future and in the later years, an adventurous, inquisitive man dealing with the changing world and comprehending his love for his childhood friend Daisy played by Cate Blanchett.Fincher's direction is the strongest part of the picture. In control and understanding film-making, Fincher interacts and lives within his film as in his previous works, making his mark and showing his promise from his earlier years. Artistically the film plays like any romantic epic, however, more like a wannabe and never placing a firm hand on the subject matter. The makeup, which one would think to be a strong point, is very disappointing. Pitt, Blanchett, and Taraji P. Henson who plays Benjamin's surrogate mother, Queenie, all go through rapid and extensive age changes. Pitt at the age of 45 going for a 20 year-old looking boy is a bit far-fetched. But proud to say, with the exception of Pitt's performance as Jesse James last year, this is one of his strongest performances to date. Helming the character in the same manor Tom Hanks controlled ""Forrest,"" Pitt holds his own in this tale even though the performance is subdued and doesn't demand too much of him emotionally.Blanchett is always good in anything she's in yet I didn't find her as appealing as I often do. Daisy goes through a lot of changes like ""Jenny"" but unlike Jenny we don't feel for her character. She doesn't hold any emotional value to the viewer to help us engage in a relationship with Daisy. Blanchett doesn't represent herself the way I'd hope she would. Her beauty is as evident as I'd ever seen (especially in a dance belt) but as an older woman she's quite annoying and as a younger woman she's plain obnoxious. This is her weakest performance in years.Henson as the Sally Field-like character, Queenie, is equally affecting as Pitt is but her character is abruptly taken off screen and leaves the viewer disenchanted. The rest of the supporting players put forth valiant efforts especially Julia Ormond who's brief showing gives a needed poignant touch.Overall, Fincher's film is disappointing and with a 2 hour and 47 minute quest, there's a good film that could have been one hour shorter (literally). Oscar may come knocking on the door for Button and Fincher is probably in serious contention for the directing win but as a Best Picture winner, I can't seem to fathom the idea.***/****",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
A life well spent.,"My Take: A sweeping, touching and honestly tear-jerking fable. A future classic?The great Mark Twain once remarked that ""the best part of life was from the beginning and the worst part was the end"". This was soon the inspiration of writer F. Scott Fitzgerald for his short story THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON (which was then retooled by screenwriter Eric Roth for this brilliant screen adaptation), which took Twain's remark as an inspiration, then it contrasts it. Instead of living life from young to old, Fitzgerald questioned what would life be when lived by a man who aged backwards, having it the other way around. What would life be if, while this man was born as an old man then aged backwards into a younger being, all his loved ones aged until their untimely death arrives? And most of all, how would he feel when he slowly witnesses his loved ones grow old and die in front of his very eyes as he slowly ages in reverse? This is the strange alternate reality (the ""curious case"", if you may) of Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt), who was strangely born as an old man, abandoned by his grief-stricken father (Jason Flemyng) and adopted by a nurse in an retirement home (Taraji P. Henson), where he slowly ages from a strangely deformed old man that resembles a gnome to a young, handsome man, then younger. But the in-between moments is what really matters in this ""curious case"", where our odd companion Benjamin discovers love in the eyes of the charming Daisy (Cate Blanchett), experiences pain in plight of the tragic death of his loved ones and basically, life itself as joyous and unpredictable, and spending every moment of it while it lasts.It's hard not to feel a wee bit misty-eyed in such emotionally-powerful moments in the movies, especially if they are as sincere and honestly true-to-the-point as the ones in THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON, a life-affirming tale which is the best of its kind since Roth's own FORREST GUMP. First, I look at ""THE CURIOUS CASE"" as a technical accomplishment that it is. But ""CURIOUS CASE"" proves to be an even deeper experience as a movie. Long after I saw it, I wasn't simply remembering how beautifully detailed and eye-filling it was, I was recalling its message about life and love and how to live them. The excellent screenplay by Mr. Roth is that kind of material that stays with you long after the experience is over, and every bit of it is still dazzling long after the visual experience has gone. Testimonials such as ""Your life is defined by its opportunities... even the ones you miss."" or ""We're meant to lose the people we love. How else would we know how important they are to us?"" are such lines I won't soon forget long after seeing a movie. THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is a curious case indeed, a movie unlike any movie I have ever seen before, at least in this season so far or for a very long time.It's imperfect to be sure. It's a cover-to-cover telling and Roth doesn't afford to leave any remaining details behind, making this the 166 minute long experience that it is. The mid-section is especially long, as well as a few moments earlier that prolong this already long affair even more. But ""CURIOUS CASE"" is that kind of movie that has to be loved, a strong an unique story, that must be judged by the sum of its parts. And to put it lightly, the thing that need to be perfect, are. The performances from the stellar talents meet the intelligence and grace of the characters they portray (especially watchable is Pitt in his age-changing performance as Benjamin and Taraji Henson in her breakthrough role as Benjamin's foster mother Queenie). David Fincher has led a successful career as a director in years, and with ""CURIOUS CASE"", he never lets his successful career astray. He might not have done anything with the slightly overlong run time or the sometimes sedate pace, but he does bring the movie to life on screen, which is all that this tale needs. The special effects and fine make-up job are put to such good purpose that they blend seamlessly into the background. The movie feels and looks like the technical accomplishment that it is and never for once feel like another dazzling special effects movie. Now that's special effects for a very special movie. THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON may be flawed, but it has earned its place in Hollywood history, or if not, it will leave a mark in future major Hollywood efforts that it's not enough that you have a great story to work with (that's a surefire to attract the folks at the Oscars), but that's it's just as important to have a great storyteller who knows how to put it all together on screen. And with THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON, Fincher proves he is.Rating: ***** out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
How we all want more time,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is an interesting tale that attempts to capture the ""big"" things of our own existence. Life, death, love, family, youth, age and the preciousness of time are all put together and to varying degrees examined in this delightful tale of what it would be like if you were born old and aged backwards.Brad Pitt delivers a remarkable performance but it is Cate Blanchett and the supporting cast (especially Taraji Henson as Queenie) that allows Brad Pitt to shine as the central character, Benjamin. Cate is magnificent (and extremely unlucky in my mind to not have received an Oscar nod) and her chemistry with Brad carries the film throughout. Having starred together previously in ""Babel"", there is a believability and realism between Cate and Brad's central characters that allows you to suspend belief at the notion of someone aging in reverse.The most powerful moments occur between these two and for anyone out there who is a parent or grandparent, the ending scenes between Benjamin and Daisy carry a gravitas that will strike at the very core of your being. So much so, you leave the cinema, wanting to do more, making the most of what you have and seeing the ""Big Picture"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Old men and children understand,"I went to see this movie thinking one thing, and came out thinking another. I went in thinking, OK, so this is too long and it will be pretentious and Cate Blanchett is going to be the best thing about it. I came out thinking it's just right, it's both engaging and touching, and Brad Pitt is the best thing about it. By a long shot. I never thought Cate Blanchett could get on my nerves, but she does. Her performance as a young dancer bursting with energy is, predictably, easy on the eye, but downright irritating where personality is concerned. As a dying widower looking back on her wasted life, her mannerism is nearly impossible to stand. Brad Pitt, on the other hand, totally pulls it off as a guy who's different from everybody else (he's aging backwards), yet tries to make the best of it. What really moved me is how he doesn't try to outsmart Fitzgerald, Fincher, or even the audience. His character cannot explain his condition, but he isn't as baffled by it as everybody else, simply because he's had it all his life. Throw in the the killer looks of Pitt in his prime, and you've got everyone's attention. Very nice work by costume designer Jaqueline West for making him look so good, especially in his post-war outfits and as a high-fashion hobo exploring the far east on his Royal Enfield motorcycle. Fine guest appearances by quirky Tilda Swinton and gorgeous Julia Ormond. - ""Benjamin Button"" is so old-fashioned, it looks brand new. Perhaps that sort of sums up David Fincher's art?

Funny and Moving Forrest Gump Type Movie,"After watching this movie, my immediate thoughts were Brad Pitt's performance was excellent and probably a sure bet for Best Actor nomination, but also that the lion's share of the credit for this movie's success belongs to the incredible creative talent behind it production, that is the screen writers, directors, graphic artists, supporting actors, and everyone else involved. I suspect there are many other actors who could have done what Pitt did, as there wasn't much emotional range required for his role. The central figure in the film was Benjamin Button but what really made the movie were all of the backstories, like his adopted mom, the Tug Boat Captain, his biological father, & the various other figures (i.e. - the nursing home resident struck by lightening 7 times). These were what made the movie interesting.I'm sure F. Scott Fitzgerald would have approved of this version of his short story with two very big thumbs up. This is without question the best movie adaptation of any of his works I've ever seen. It more than makes up for Coppola's wretchedly bad ""The Great Gatsby"", perhaps Fitzgerald's best known work with a similar big box office budget.The one weak link was its length, nearly 3 hours. I thought this could have been reduced by at least 1/2 hour. The love interest aspect with Cate Blanchett was a bit overdone, and the Tilda Swinton vignette could have been eliminated entirely, as he'd already lost his virginity in a New Orleans brothel, courtesy of the Tug Boat Captain.But all that aside, this is a really good movie worth checking out on the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Simply amazing,"It is hard to find fitting words but this is one of the best movies I have ever watched. It took me by surprise and soon after understanding the main plot I began wishing the movie would never end - which, I guess.

too long to be loved!,"There are limits to stretching a short story and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" is definitely off its limits. Fitzgerald's brilliant idea turned out to be an endless story in Eric Roth's, Robin Swicord's and David Fincher's hands. If they fall in love with what they are doing, it is hard for the creators to spare some of their work, but I wonder what else was the editor busy with! It's a pity that as the film got longer and longer, even that beautiful story, those wonderful actors and magnificent make ups became harder to appreciate. I really wanted someone to sit at the editing table and trim the excess scenes from the film. Than, I would love it by all means!",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Not entertaining at all,"Unfortunately I'm not a professional movie critic and belong to a small group of people who come to a movie theater to enjoy the movie as a whole. I really don't care about who directed the movie, what are the names of actors, what are the special effects in the movie or how wonderful are costumes or light. I want some entertainment from the show, some story that touches me somehow. And as you can guess this one was not entertaining at all. It was plain boring. Everything was so unnatural and predictable. The original short story was probably indeed too short so it was a challenging task for writers to fill 2+ hours of the movie. Of course they connected the dots and filled the gaps but no, it didn't bring any value to the movie. Everything from this movie was seen so many times before.Of course this is not 1 out of 10 movie - 3 out of 10 is probably a more realistic grade, but I'm sick with the rating distribution so biased toward 10 (check for yourself).And please don't tell me about Gold Globes or Oscars. ""No Country for Old Men"" was also nominated but it didn't make it any better as a movie. And no, I'm not a person enjoying stupid action movies with car races and meaningless violence.The bottom line - it's not a masterpiece but a very average ordinary movie. Not entertaining at all.

Excellent film...,"THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON works best when thought of as a sort of fantasy or fairy tale rather than a complex science fiction about the Chaos Theory and Time. It is essentially a heartwarming and compellingly engrossing Motion Picture that one surely has to see to believe. There is no wonder that comparisons have been made with FORREST GUMP, as they are essentially similar-type movies. THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON takes a life of its own, however, especially after the hour mark, when Brad Pitt appears. FORREST GUMP was perhaps a better film overall, but THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is more thought-provoking, and there are various hidden elements and undertones pervading the wonderful story and script.David Fincher infuses his own dark style of direction that many have come to love (myself included; both FIGHT CLUB and SE7EN feature well in my Top 20) though this may be his most lighthearted film to date. His nomination for Best Director was undoubtedly deserved.Brad Pitt is adequate but not really outstanding, and I can think of a few performances that should have been given the nomination over his. It is not for a lack of effort on his part; it's just that he lacks the requisite range for such a complex character. His portrayal of the young Button is youthful and energetic, but not as an old and experienced man trapped inside a young man's body. Likewise, his portrayal of the old Button is that of a feeble and weakened man, and not that of a young man trapped inside an old man's fragile body. The story of Benjamin Button is supposed to be a melancholy one in hindsight, and Pitt lacks that sense of melancholy that such a unique and difficult character should exhibit. His nomination did not come as a surprise but it is unlikely that it will result in victory.THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON stands a better chance of winning the technical awards rather than the acting, directing, and writing ones. The movie is simply beautiful, and should not be missed. The screenplay is intelligent and well-constructed. THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is an excellent film that warrants discussion. 8/10. 3.5 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 200 at 192. Unreservedly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Best Hollywood production of the decade,"I think this is the best Hollywood production I have seen since King Kong in 2005 and a brave and succeeded attempt to combine visual spectacle with meaning. Finally an America movie that deals with what it means being human; living and growing old, and remembering the ones who crossed our paths. Some of those people were memorable. Even more than the ballet-dancer for me the person of this movie was the wonderful swimming lady with the dreamy eerie voice, who couldn't help but redo her attempt to cross the Channel. That was the moment for me, also in the end when she came back. I love movies with breathtaking ends, and this one had, with a small sum-up of all the people as they were through the ages. Any movie that has memorable moments for us is worth the test of time, isn't it? It all looked great and certainly it was big budget money well spent: the scenery, background was lush and wonderful, like one big art deco hotel through the ages.Of course, this as almost any movie, had its problems, too. I think the beginning was awkward. Somehow due to a clock turning backwards we are supposed to believe it's credible babies are born that way. Also the end, which would normally be interesting  how do you cope with a baby getting younger and younger  was left out to speed thing up. The focus was clearly on the most interesting part; that of our young lives where we do the most things we later remember. From that perspective, the aging backwards would have been an unnecessary element. The movie might have been just as good with Bradd Pitt aging normally. Probably that is a compliment for this flick, since it seems I was also accepting this normally contrived idea of Benjamin aging backwards. Of course, the movie could have been cut here and there, too. I thought it had its best part from the end of the middle on to the title score. That also happened to be the part where Benjamin was an adult in his prime. But then again, maybe the power came from what had been told in earlier parts, so one never really knows. I never really felt this movie had a sagging part. Many reviews call it magical, and sometimes I agree it was. With a price though, since we are never part of the dull ordinary working days of the characters. It truly is the axiom of Hithcock's movies: life with the dull parts taken out. Life as seen from this story seemed like an endless stay in a youth hostel through the years, chatting and meeting interesting people, filled with the nicest pictures as recollection of Benjamin's life. We all know it is not like that. It would also have been interesting to see how this movie would work out showing life how it was with the best parts taken out! I also think telling this story as a flashback from a diary in a hospital was too cliché. It could easily have been solved by maybe interviewing people who directly or indirectly knew him, or something in that style. Sure some Hollywood writers could have come with something better than that. Also the hummingbird was too contrived, too much put in. And maybe after all the CGI and effects, Brad Pitt didn't have to do that much. But Benjamin was still a memorable character, and he happened to be Brad Pitt. So well, an Oscar nomination is deserved, I think. Overall this movie certainly had a great cast, lovely scenery, and a resonance of life being precious and wonderful, themes we all know, but so nice to see again!",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
A Good Story Well Executed - Not For Men,"After watching this film I compared it to 'Big Fish'. The a wholly unrealistic story told through the narrative device of a parent talking about their life to their child on their deathbed. Not to criticise it, after all I did think this was a good movie but as a twenty something male urbanite not really my thing. I don't think that I am the target audience for films that include 'feelings' and 'emotions', my girlfriend however cried at the end and no doubt enjoyed watching Brad Pitt getting (as she put it) younger and fitter throughout the movie. A good date flick as it will show inner depth as you fake your aw-ing and ah-ing sounds to show what a deep emotional guy you are when it comes to love stories. Having said that I was not completely switched off by it, and it was very well executed as a production of a fantastical (as in fantasy not fantastic) movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Phenomenal,"The first time I went to see this film, I was with my whole family, we were about to see a different movie (I forgot what it was, possibly Bedtime Stories...), but I was completely thrown off my feet when I saw it. It was touching, funny, dramatic, told a great story, and had its share of action. The story tells of a man, who is born at around 85 +/-. He grows up in reverse, taking his first steps out of his wheelchair, going for a day downtown, and going on a tugboat, from which he departs the USA when he looks around his late 60's. While in Russia, he meets a woman who he falls in love with. He is put in the war on the tugboat. As he returns to the USA, he finds a girl he had a crush on when he was ""young"", who has since grown up and found a career. After many events, the girl falls in love with Benjamin and they are married. They have a child, and that is where I will stop. I don't believe I have given a spoiler, so I'll sum that up into fewer words. Benjamin is a nice character, he was raised that way. He has amazing adventures, interlaced with others' interesting, sometimes humorous, adventures. I know many people who cried during this movie, and rightfully so, this story will have you thinking about the movie for the rest of the week.It has many memorable quotes, some being ""You can be as mad as a mad dog at the way things went. You could swear, curse the fates, but when it comes to the end, you have to let go.""- Capt. Mike ""Benjamin, we're meant to lose the people we love. How else would we know how important they are to us?""- Mrs. Maple Among others.I can honestly say, without a doubt, this is my favorite movie OF ITS GENRE.

"aims for greatness, but ultimately this is a slight tale blown up","Benjamin Button is a moderately interesting idea for a movie with a few very good scenes and a lot of forgettable ones. The central idea of a man whose body becomes younger as he ages is presented pretty well, and Pitt is quite good in the title role. The movie is occasionally effecting.But there's really not much to this. Take away the central gimmick, and this is just a story about a guy living a fairly ordinary life, growing up, falling in love, getting old, losing his mind. The central gimmick is often irrelevant to the story.Clearly the filmmakers think they have something truly profound; why else would they make it so damn long? But while the odd aging of Button offers a slightly different way to think about growing old, it's not *that* different.This movie reminded me of Forest Gump (which turned out to share the same screenwriter), in that it was just sort of a guy living his life, and in that I found it dull. I liked Benjamin Button better than Gump (in spite of all its admirers I found it quite dull) but I still just never felt there was much to it.

A Nutshell Review: The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"When I was born my mom said I looked like an old man. Like everyone else, I turned out to be pretty normal, unlike The Curious Case of Benjamin Button where he's physically developing in the opposite, suffering from common aged ailments like cataracts, hearing, and arthritis first, but mentally developing in proper chronology. One can imagine the challenges of everyone thinking you'll die soon enough, before a miracle actually happens and you're like having drunk some elixir of life, probably a little too much too.Some would compare David Fincher's movie to Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump. Both have charismatic characters living out a dream of a life despite the challenges that life had unfairly laid out for them, one being mentally slow, the other being physically not quite right. Like Gump, Button (Brad Pitt in various astounding make up and effects) lives an extremely fulfilling life, having their tale peppered with significant ground breaking events, some of which they get involved in, others just serving as bookends in a narrative that span lifetimes. These become wonderful stories to tell, like Tim Burton's Big Fish, and actually, quite inspiring too to live a life seizing any opportunities that come your way.Similarly, Ben Button has a strong mother character to take care of him, and here's where Taraji P. Henson's Queenie gets her supporting Oscar nod. Working in the home for the aged, Ben's father Thomas (Jason Flemyng) abandons the odd looking infant at the footsteps of the home, only for Queenie to show extreme compassion, and to bring up the infant like her own, full of love, blind to the fact that he is physically very different from everyone else. And Love is something Ben isn't falling short of, having to meet and love the very captivating Daisy (Cate Blanchett), where their initial encounter being very much frowned upon, like a dirty old man trying to take advantage of a sweet young thing.It is this love that anchors the bulk of the second act, which makes it touching yet sad as you know of the collision course where this love is heading toward. I recall a scene in another movie, and you may have heard variations of this tale, where a woman asks her husband whom he preferred to meet their Maker first. The man says for his wife to kick the bucket before he does, only so because he wouldn't want her to suffer from a broken heart before her time, and to let him be punished that way instead. It is this nagging feeling that the characters experience, and both Blanchett and Pitt's performances allow the audience to empathize.David Fincher is best known for his darker movies like Panic Room, Fight Glub, Se7en, and Zodiac, and I thought The Curious Case of Benjamin Button continues this trend, in that it's draped in melancholy through and through. There's always a sad tinge to the events in Ben's life, because growing up with older people around you would mean that you experience death a lot more than growing up with peers. But that's not to say it's always doom and gloom. There are certain lighthearted moments thrown in to break the heaviness, and those lightning stories will certainly be fondly remembered way after the end credits roll. Fincher too displays some deft storytelling techniques here in keeping the narrative from turning stale, and one extremely well executed scene involved plenty of What-Ifs that lays out what Fate would have decided for anyone.To some, Benjamin Button may seem boring, but they are totally missing the point. The 166 minutes here were paced fabulously, never wasting any time, and yet providing enough breathing space to pause and appreciate the story, the characters, the art direction, and to soak in the wonderful cinematography. And not forgetting an ensemble supporting cast to prop and pad the central relationship between Ben and Daisy, from parents to friends, to everyone else that pops in and out offering life's lessons through fated encounters.The people that one meets define your life in a certain sense I believe. Through Fate we know each other, and little episodes spice your life up in ways that you cannot imagine, until you look back and wonder just how much had gone by, and how much one had experienced. The latest Facebook meme on 25 Random Things had made me recall some wonderful moments shared with people who have entered my life at various points, and to those who think their lives are not rich, I encourage them to dig deep, and find certain joy in recalling those moments. Here, we journey with Jula Ormond's Caroline as she reads through a diary and co-narrates the story of Benjamin Button, in little episodes that grab your attention throughout.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a delightfully fine film, with an engaging story about life in itself, and deserves every single one of its 13 nominations in this year's Academy Awards. It's up against some stiff competition, but I'm fairly confident it will hold its own and not return empty handed. Definitely highly recommended, and easily an early contender as best film of the year thus far.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Its a curiouse thing...,"As far as directors go, David Fincher ranks among thoses I idolise. His gentle interplay with dark and light, fun and sorrow and most importantly the real and the surreal. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button isn't his greatest movie, his most lavish movie, but not his greatest. What's striking is the way Finchers worst still manages to be better than most director's best attempts. Despite some negative criticisms, Benjamin Button is a beautiful movie, both tender and tremendous. If not overly emotional. It manages to sustain both style and substance where something like ""Australia"" dropped the ball. Finchers movie is well worth the wait and a certainty at this year's Oscars.One thing that resonates wonderfully is the chemistry between Brad Pitt and Kate Blanchett, reunited after starring together in the 2007 movie ""Babel"", there characters show development and while there not all going in the same direction you can feel them growing, learning with age, or youth in this case. It takes a world-class storyteller and a great yarn to rivet your attention for nearly three hours. This very classy, old-school movie -- employing cutting-edge technology that will make your eyes pop -- did it for me.David Fincher's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, an adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's story, re-teams the director with Brad Pitt, who takes on the title role. What makes Button such a curious case is that when he is born in New Orleans just after World War I, he is already in his eighties, and proceeds to live his life aging in reverse. Brad Pitt gives a bravura, Oscar-caliber turn in Fincher's modernist epic yet lyrical tale, which bears resemblance in structure and magical realism to Forrest Gump (both penned by Eric Roth), but without that film's simplistic morality and sentimentality This sweeping film follows the character's unusual life into the 21st century as he experiences joy and sadness, loves lost and found, and the meaning of timelessness. Cate Blanchett co-stars along with Tilda Swinton, Elias Koteas, and Julia Ormond. If there's one thing this films is going to be remembered by its the beautifully subtle yet equally frightening make up effect sued on both Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. The creators blended both visual effect with make-up effect to create some of the most awe inspiring visual effect to dat. You believe in these characters because the actors playing them are shown at every stage of their life. Aptly for a film so concerned with time, Button is 13 minutes shy of three hours and just flies by. If this is Fincher selling out, can he sell out more often please? An epic, melancholic romance that employs a multi-generational cast and groundbreaking visual effects. It's a testament to Fincher's skill as a storyteller that the film actually works, albeit sporadically. There may not be the normal, anticipated dosage of sentiment to latch onto in this film, but in exchange for patience and a little faith, Button presents the exquisite weight of the human experience in a manner the screen rarely witnesses.Verdict: Touching yet never tedious, sensitive yet never overly sentimental. Button balances all of its elements perfectly and while the running time may scare some, the movie flew by in manner of seconds merely due to the charm and charisma of its leads. Tantalizing, touching and timeless - an epic fable revolving around mortality. For my overall rating I give The Curious Case of Benjamin Button 4/5.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"Indulges you to seize the day and live life to its fullest, because you never know when it's going to end","I've waited a long time to see The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and I'm happy to say I was quite happy upon viewing the movie in theaters. Director David Fincher's film follows the story of a man named Benjamin (portrayed by Brad Pitt) that ages backwards: when everyone around him grows older and older, he just keeps growing younger. Cate Blanchett portrays Daisy, his tragic lifelong lover, with Tilda Swinton, Taraji P. Henson and many other talented actors portray various friends, co-workers, love interests and family members he meets along his extraordinary path in life.The movie had lively characters you could relate to, its scenery was breathtaking, and it all came down to its original concept, a concept that made the film so special to me. Its time-twisting elements made you think about how life is fragile and how it keeps slipping away, and how we can never escape our mortality - no matter how far we go. Benjamin Button was growing younger in body but older in heart, and when he faced his aging friends and family, you couldn't escape thinking how lonely he must be (going through the opposite process and all) and how random life is.But instead of taking you to a depressing conclusion, the film wrote itself out like a marvelous feast for life. Even the setback - the story being told to a dying Daisy amidst the upcoming Katrina Hurricane - gives one a new perspective on life, and indulges you to seize the day and live life to its fullest, because you never know when it's going to end.From director Fincher (Fight Club, The Game, Panic Room), I found The Curious Case of Benjamin Button to be a great film with marvelous settings, excellent performances and a versatile cast. It's smart, unique, original, and has an extremely well executed high-concept. After a long wait, I'm happy to see the film get the respect it deserves - both at the box office and by the Academy.I gave it 10 points out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Doesn't live up to the hype,"After the 3 long hours i spent watching The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, I'm afraid I have to conclude I am a bit disappointed.This movie had so much hype surrounding it, and after all those golden globe nominations I thought this movie was really worth-seeing. I was a bit wrong. It is extremely overrated and I honestly expected more from a possibly Oscar-winning movie.The whole movie tells the story of Benjamin Button, a man who ages backwards. We follow him from the moment he was born, and through all his mishaps and adventures and we watch him get younger while everybody else around him gets older.The plot is interesting, and screenplay, I feel was fairly well written but this is NOT best picture material. I feel Doubt should have been substituted with this movie for the best picture golden globe nomination. Even Brad Pitt's performance was fairly average, he has definitely had better. Frank Langella or Leonardo Dicaprio will probably edge him out on the awards. Screenplay and directing do deserve nominations but there are better movies who will probably win. Make-up however was excellent, and they deserve an award for that.As much as I wish the movie goes home empty-handed on January 11th, and on Oscar night, I doubt the Academy will look over this movie, so I'm afraid I will have to endure a disappointing and frustrating Oscar night.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Should Have Been an Amazing Story but Wasn't,"Horrifying self-realization: Heinlein help me, I went to see a Major Motion Picture Event and a Happy Madison Production (Bedtime Stories) on the same day, and I'm giving them both the same rating (6).This is the MMPE. You can tell because it's nearly 3 hours long, is based on Akshwul Litrachoor (F. Scott Fitzgerald's novella), and stars someone (Mr. Pitt) who is among the dozen people known only by 1st name at supermarket checkout counters everywhere. It's ostensibly about a man who, for no explicable reason, grows older mentally and experientially at the same pace as everyone else while growing younger (from about 70ish) physically. The amazing thing about this is that it's so unamazing. Pitt plays his role in the lowest of keys. For such an unusual person, Benjamin leads a pretty dull and ordinary life. The center of that life, and of the film, is when his middle age overlaps with that of Daisy (Cate Blanchett), and they have upwards of a decade of happiness living together before fate draws them apart again. Huge props to the film for originality and creating a tremendous sense of time and place from 1919 to 2005, but really, nothing in it reached right out and grabbed me. This has not stopped it from being touted for multiple Oscars, so I'm probably in the minority here, but I can't in good conscience tell you ""Ya gotta go see it!"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"A Mesmerizing Masterpiece on Life, Love, and Death","It is epic. It is beautiful. It is the best picture of the year. Director David Fincher takes on a new obstacle with The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and succeeds at the highest level. Most of us know what a great director he is, but he's never a Oscar-type movie, but he will finally get his due as I expect him to be taking home the gold. The movie centers on the life of Benjamin Button, who's played by Brad Pitt. As he states throughout the film, he was born under unusual circumstances and ages backwards. With the outside of an old man, but the mind of a new born, Button had quite the obstacle to overcome as a child. He is raised by the loving Queenie, Taraji P. Henson, who runs a nursing home establishment. There he meets an assortment of characters that all effect his life in different way although one person seems to have more of an effect than the rest. Benjamin first meets Daisy, Cate Blanchett, at the home and they instantly become friends and eventually fall for each other. Over the years we watch the epic and fantasy tale of Benjamin and his journey through life.Eric Roth wrote the screenplay and deserves high praise as he will likely be taking home gold as well come this Oscar season. He touches on death, love, and, most of all, life. Life is full of great and bad moments and nothing always lasts are two of the most powerful parts of this picture. Roth creates some incredibly moving and powerful scenes through the deep dialogue. Above all he touches on how such little details and things may have a tremendous affect, whether it's good or bad, on your own life. During one of the most moving scenes of the film, Benjamin Button explains how one small detail of a girl not breaking up with her boyfriend the night before or a man waking up on time, rather than 5 minutes late, would have a drastic affect on Daisy who, as a result, would break her leg from being hit by a car and never be able to dance again. Also, the final scene of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is also powerful and one the greatest scenes of any film I've seen this year or ever in cinema and it is incredibly moving.Such a tremendous story and script is only the beginning to this historic achievement. Brad Pitt gives an Oscar-caliber performance as Benjamin Button creating a perfect character who changes roles along his journey through life and develops his character extraordinarily well. He also creates a tremendous southern-New Orleans accent and isn't over the top at all. If you haven't taken him seriously as an actor as of yet, as a result of not seeing AOJJ or Babel, then you will finally realize that he is one of our finest actors in cinema. Cate Blanchett develops her character just as well, if not better, and is currently the best actress I've seen all year. Both of them have tremendous chemistry together which help to make the love story to this epic tale that much more touching.The visuals to this feature are stunning. Whether it's the submarine scenes, the view of Paris, the lake, or the city itself, Fincher uses his usual lighting as well as brilliant cinematography to create unbelievable scenes. Some say that the film is too visual, while I disagree. Fincher stays close to the characters and story at hand and throws in a beautiful scene every know and then, but it never takes away from the story in my opinion. Fincher's camera work is top-notch and it's extremely well-crafted despite being an ambitious and epic film. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button never drags and goes by in a flash despite the 3 hour running time. In fact, I didn't want this film to end. Alexandre Desplat's memorable score is touching and unforgettable. It helps to create a happy, sad, angry, or depressing mood for the film and is beautifully composed. The costumes, make-up, and set designs are some of the very best of the year and I expect this feature to take home Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Visual Affects, Costume Design, and Make-Up, at the very least, come Oscar season. Overall, this is a historic cinematic feature that is well-crafted and a beautiful film about life. This is a magical and miracle movie and one that is unforgettable.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Epic storytelling falters slightly,"From the beginning there has been much talk and anticipation surrounding The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. The story of a man who is born with the qualities of an octogenarian, and who progressively grows younger, has all the makings of a classic nostalgia fantasy. The film's obviously large budget is masterfully used to create a visually rich tale. However, after all has been said and done, beautiful imagery is the high point of Benjamin Button. Director David Fincher is probably better known for his thrillers like Se7en and Fight Club, and in Benjamin Button he continues to prove how innovative a director he is. But with a budget of over US$150 million, it's easy to see how technique and design triumph over story and ideals. That's not to say the film isn't any good. The story, told in flashbacks, opens with a with a hospital scene in which an elderly woman, in her last few hours, asks her daughter to read the diary of Benjamin Button. The story of how Benjamin (Brad Pitt) came into being and the resulting life he leads follows. The journey is long and visually stunning. Benjamin's humble demeanour, as a result of his unusual circumstances, is believable and engaging. Pitt's Southern accent adds character and mood to this elegiac narrative. Daisy (Cate Blanchett) counterbalances the story by offering a straightforward walk through life. She is a prima donna in all the sense of the term and who brought down after an accident ends her dancing career. Taraji P. Henson stands out from these two Oscar winners as Queenie, Benjamin's ""adoptive"" mother. Her love for her son and his unfortunate situation adds warmth to the gloomy atmosphere of the retirement home. The cinematography wonderfully captures the era of the time and the characters that lived in it. From the retirement home to the docks and the sea to the bitter coldness of Russia and back again, the sets are remarkable and the period costumes are beautiful. All these parts work well individually but they fall short of working cohesively together. Not one particular aspect fails to step up to the hype but there is something lacking. Or maybe, for a 166 minute film, there is too much to keep the story moving smoothly. Benjamin Button is by no means mediocre but it just does not deliver to its full potential.

I life worth forgetting,"Being one of the big Oscar contenders this year i tried not to expected too much from this movie. But what i got was far far less then i could ever have anticipated.It's like the writers sat down and thought of a great idea about a guy, Benjamin, aging backwards. What the writers then forgot to do was think of an interesting life-story for this Benjamin guy. Sure it could be fun to see someone going to school when he already knows everything and having sex with young girls when he's an old guy, but there must be more something more interesting about a life led backwards. Instead what i saw was a 2:45 hour lasting agony. This guy Benjamin has the most boring life ever! He's just born one day and dies another.Don't get me wrong. I love the Fincher movies (Se7en, Fight Club, Zodiac) and I like Brad Pitt in almost all of his movies. But what everyone who's concerned with this movie (director, actors, producers, Oscar-nominators) seems to forget is that a movie has to have a story. And there is non, it's non-existent. It's like making a three hour long movie about John Doe.We don't see that much acting as for a woman who's in a near-death state of living all the time and we hear a semi-emotional narration by Pitt which reminds too much of Forest Gump, except that he had a life worth telling. OK i do admit, Cat Blanchett does act, but it's outrageous over the top annoying with some phony accent without any emotional depth whatsoever.Benjamin Button's dad is a guy who made a fortune making buttons, you believe that? Now that's a story worth telling! He has a big house, his whole family was in the business of making buttons and he owns a boat etc. But no... the story about his son's boring life is what's shown instead.I guess the point i'm trying to make is that i didn't like the movie and don't understand why the life story of Benjamin Button is worth telling with mediocre acting all the way. No wonder most reviews lack any basis for a high rating or Oscar nomination.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Beautiful outstanding movie,"I am not a huge Brad Pitt fan but after this movie, I am now. It is his best by far.I have never seen a movie like this. Interesting yet simple storyline.

The make up and special effects in this movie are great.This movie made me think about things and made me think of my own children especially by infant son.It is long, but I liked the premise of examining a life lived backwards.I am totally in awe of this fantastic movie.

After watcing the Golden Globes I'm compelled to object!,"Fincher and Pitt and should have been accorded a great deal more acclaim than they were. This is an impossible, illogical premise and story, and yet they made it into something poignant and entertaining. Its extra length zipped by effortlessly. My only quibble is that the reverse aging was sometimes somewhat distracting and therefore not quite successful. And then there's Ms Blanchett's performance. Somehow after successfully traversing most of the script, she manages to overdo her part in some inexplicable way. It broke up the flow of the piece and I found myself annoyed with someone I usually love to watch and wonder about. Pitt, however, did a magnificent job, I thought. He was this little man as convincingly as any character actor has ever inhabited someone as far removed from themselves as Benjamin is from the real Pitt.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Masterpiece,"This movie is in my top 10 movie list in life. It is a cinema achievement that may never be outdone by 'anyone'. Considering that this masterpiece was shot digitally in 2007, it is miles above any CG effort since.For those of you that haven't seen it: ""SEE IT"". Besides a great story (with one flaw), this film makes illusion and simulation become reality.The one flaw: I have great respect for David Fincher, and I am going to go out on a limb and say that he must have been aware of this discrepancy, but went ahead with the story-line as written anyway. ( I hope that's the case). Benjamin Button was born ""old"", and regressed backwards to die an infant. The flaw in the story-line (and it's a big one), is that as he regresses to youth, he begins to have dementia (Alzheimer's symptoms), along with all of the arthritic pains and problems an old man gets as he ages. At the end, before he dies he loses his memory completely.Logically, since he was born an old man, those illnesses should have evolved from birth, and improved as he regressed in age. Strangely in the film, he is born with severe arthritis, and can't even walk until he is 7. Why then would he again experience these same symptoms as a child on the way to his death bed (or crib)? He should be in perfect health as a child, and regress to a ""fetus"", and then disappear.Other than that major flaw, this movie is a 10. Unfortunately because of the illogical way he dies, I had to give it a 9 out of 10 stars.One other issue with the plot: If we were to take this movie scenario and try to place it in the real world, Benjamin would have to have been born a ""full sized"", old man, and then after 70 or 80 years, he would have begun to shrink. Since the idea of a woman giving birth to a full sized man is physically impossible, our Benjamin had to be born old and ""tiny"". This of course is another contradiction in the plot, since Benjamin is small ""twice in his life"". We can't dwell on this flaw at all, because if we did we would never get passed it. To enjoy this movie, we must put all the facts and logistics of this scenario aside, and when we do, this movie takes us on a journey unlike any other ever filmed.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
A true gem in and of itself.,"I just came back from seeing The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button and never once did it feel dragged down or contrived; like so many other dramas that came out last year. Never has a film been so original, so groundbreaking, so touching and heartfelt at the same time while giving best performances all around from Cate Blanchett and of course, most of all, Brad Pitt. The most remarkable thing about this film is the progression of events that flow so naturally, from different time periods and the ""aging"" of the main character. But none of these things would matter had it not been for David Fincher's taut, ingenuity, masterful direction with a first rate screenplay by Eric Roth. For once, special effects don't overshadow the story and drama; they mainly serve them. And they are indeed wonderful. A true gem in and of itself. This film teaches us to value life and the time that we are given in this harsh, cruel world. But most of all, it tells us that no matter how old we get, love is forever boundless.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Here's what I can say:,"I enjoyed this film quite a lot, but I have a lot of complaints. I felt the beginning was top notch, interesting, and made me think the whole film was going to be great. However, the film slowly eased off and got progressively worse as it went on. I noticed this when the person I was sitting next to (who originally looked quite engaged) was asleep. One of the strengths of the beginning was the amount of fantastic characters with interesting stories. As the film went on, the minor characters slowly disappeared, until all that remained were the two leads. At the end of the film it shows all of the characters, and NONE of them were introduced after the second half, they were all from the beginning. That was a clear sign of weakness. The second half seemed to be more of a quick explanation on what happened to Benjamin. It was frustrating that the second half was quick and didn't do anything more, and after choosing to go to a long film, you would expect for a good finish. But it wasn't. Another part of the film I thought that weakened it was the lack of purpose. No real message was gotten out of the film. Nothing to leave you with. It was a pretty simple story, and it was entertaining, but moving - no way. And for a heavy Oscar favorite, I would expect a bit better. Not to mention it's insane similarity to Forrest Gump, but that's another story.A generous 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
It Was Ok,"It is a very interesting story to tell but The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button sadly made to the same old cases of a romance story, nothing's wrong with that as long as it's convincing, but for me personally it's kinda a rare case for a convincing couples that they do it rightly, Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett already became a couple in one of their previous film Babel which i love and they play husband and wife on that film and it works, they have some great chemistry on that film, and i think particularly for this one the way they portray their relationship is somehow did not work for me, they're both doing just fine as they're self but not together, so that's my main problem of the film, the second is i think the phase of the second act of the film which i found not bad but way too slow and i did got quite a lot of yawn during the second act, and for the first act it works just completely fine, so overall The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button is quite a problematic film in terms of a phasing and main character relationsip with a very interesting basic story that ended in still quite a nice way and i also still mostly enjoyed it for a 2 hours and 45 minutes film and that's one of the big pros of the film, it is quite a disappoinment of a movie coming from someone like David Fincher but as a movie itself overall it was just ok.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

An epic love story rich in visuals and insight,"Rarely does a film like ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" tell such a basic human story with such visual prowess. There's not a whole lot of action or imaginative settings, yet director David Fincher makes New Orleans and New York between 1920-1970 feel like a fantasy world of sorts. This is the kind of a film that will likely get a slew of nominations at the Academy Awards and clean up many of them.""Benjamin Button"" is sort of an epic love story, the kind of film that we haven't really seen since ""Forrest Gump."" At nearly 3 hours long, it gives us the life of Benjamin (Pitt), who physically ages backward from an old man to an infant, while his brain ages like that of a normal person. While the film could be about how his life is different from everyone else, the emphasis is more on how this affects his perspective on aging, dying and the fleeting nature of life, as seen through his love for Daisy (Blanchett) who he meets when they're both children, but she of course ages normally.The visual rendering of Benjamin as an old man (his younger years) is absolutely astounding and could press some other CGI-loaded films at the Oscars. The make-up as well, which is forced to capture a large span of aging because the film doesn't jump very far ahead in years at any point in time, is incredible.What is most surprising about ""Button"" is the cinematography. Between the contrast of light and dark around faces and a couple beautiful sunrise scenes, what is just plain old America has a distinct beauty to it that really captures the epic nature of the story. It's long and really quite slow at times, but it could have been worse without some of the imagery.The acting was also very impressive. Pitt manages to pull off the concept of looking one way and feeling another. He's particularly strong when he's 20 or so, when his character appears in his late 50s. He gives Benjamin a gentle nature that comes off as mature, though his naiveté in terms of love and loss is apparent. Blanchett is also very strong, proving triple-fold already how talented of an actress she is in any role. Several other supporting roles played by lesser known actors were also impressive, including Queenie, Benjamin's adoptive mother.Though tedious in length, ""Button"" is a film that someone of nearly any age can appreciate. Eric Roth's screenplay is genuine in both its comedic and dramatic aspects, though no matter which, always has something to say about aging, death and loss. Ultimately, it manages to say a lot more about how similar Benjamin is to us, though he appears so radically different.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"Charming film, though treads far too much familiar ground.","The Curious Case of Benjamin Button - Directed by David Fincher (Se7en, Fight Club), this chronicles the life of a man named Benjamin (Brad Pitt) who ages physically in reverse. A fairly original premise that touches lightly on messages of life and death, this is a charming, often touching little movie.Brad Pitt gives a quiet somewhat subdued performance. His character of Benjamin is always quite reserved, presumably to the inevitability of death. His introspect is mostly limited to the notes he makes in a journal, which is unfortunate. Cate Blanchett plays his main romantic interest Daisy. They have a sweet and (at the end) absolutely heart-breaking relationship. Yes, this is a tear-jerker, and your liking of the film depends on your taste for having your emotions manipulated. Personally I have no problems with that.This film is strongly reminiscent of Big Fish, Edward Scissorhands, and Forrest Gump. With the same writer of the wonderful Forrest Gump, Benjamin Button treads a lot of known ground. It's told in the ""hospital bed"" manner that most of these films share. This is lovely to people that enjoy more of the same, but annoying to this reviewer given the uniqueness of the film's premise. The beginning and end of this film are very interesting. The middle could be picked from any number of biopics. No one outside of his immediate relations ever seems to notice that Brad Pitt's character ages in reverse. It would be an interesting twist if Ben was grabbed and experimented on. It would be interesting to explore how a 20 year old in appearance would be with a 55 year old's personality. Alas, the film does the Hollywood thing, takes an original premise and sees how close it can get back to the usual thing people expect.This is disappointing considering it's David Fincher, whose previous films look nothing like this. It's a pretty good film, whatever my misgivings might indicate. Fincher has the taste for sentimentality, but his inexperience with this sort of film has made him toe the line to retain the box office and a chance at the Oscars.

Should have been best picture,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is basically about a boy who is born old and as he grows up reverses in age until he is a newborn. During this reverse aging process he lives an extraordinary life traveling the world and seeing many different sights but he always keeps coming back to his child hood love, Daisy. The theme of this movie is actually expressed by Benjamin himself, nothing ever last. Throughout his entire life Benjamin is always dealing with loss. The theme of this movie is shown over and over as Benjamin deals with loss as others around him keep getting older and he keeps getting younger. When I first saw this film in the theaters I thought it was a masterpiece. The story is so well written and played out of the course of the movie that you get instantly sucked in. Benjamin meets many characters over the course of this film but few other than Daisy really stick with you as memorable. The many scenes and activities of his life can get forgotten if you were to retell this movie to someone but the overall movie can really stick with you. I honestly felt like this should have been best picture the year it released. The overall story and message of the film just seemed to stick more than any other film that year. Another underlining theme of this movie is, opportunities that you take or miss make up your entire life. David Fincher is a fantastic director and this film just adds to his resume. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett both put on amazing performances however most of the supporting cast is easily forgettable. I like that they used the real events of Hurricane Katrina as a back drop and even including the storm hitting and the floods washing away some of the memory of Benjamin at the end of the movie. The only complaint I have about this movie is the run time is a little long for the film to be enjoyed multiple times. This movie will really make you think about your life, where you've been and where you plan on going",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
A movie that succeeds purely from its concept,"The Curious Case of Benjamin ButtonDirected by David FincherStarring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett.Plot Overview: Born under unusual circumstances, Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) springs into being as an elderly man in a New Orleans nursing home and ages in reverse. Twelve years after his birth, he meets Daisy, a child who flickers in and out of his life as she grows up to be a dancer (Cate Blanchett). Though he has all sorts of unusual adventures over the course of his life, it is his relationship with Daisy, and the hope that they will come together at the right time, that drives Benjamin forward.The concept of this movie is fascinating to me. It is probably the strongest point of the movie and is easily what is most talked about. In many respects, it is a gimmick movie but it does carry a lot of weight behind it, elevating it to the status of 'movie'. For a movie that approaches the 3 hour mark, it is undeniably entertaining. I will give it credit.As far as the core story goes, this movie is actually really weak. The concept was great and it is genuinely intriguing but without that concept, the movie is exceptionally weak. It's just a boring, conventional love story. Granted, the movie is built around the concept but that doesn't excuse a pretty by-the-numbers plot. Without the gimmick of ageing backward, I have no doubt this movie would be towing the line of average/awful. I do, however, like the way they concluded the story but I think it would have been a little more poetic if they concluded it a tad bit before, age wise.I do admire the storytelling but the intersections in the modern day were just boring and incredibly uninteresting to me. It sorta reminds me of Memento due to the whole concept of telling a story(in some form) in reverse. I think Memento handled it better but they are very different films so it is kinda unfair to compare them.Brad Pitt is one of my favourite living actors. As far as I know, the man can do no wrong acting wise. And that is no different in this spectacular performance. I cannot commend him enough for this role; it is truly incredible. Button is a fascinating and interesting character, and is quirky enough to make him likable. He is appropriately weird and never overstayed his welcome for me.Cate Blanchett was pretty good in the movie as Daisy but she is far overshadowed by Pitt. As for Daisy as a character, I personally just see her as a generic love interest with no real defining qualities that set her apart. I did buy the relationship between her and Button but it was hard for me to be fully supportive when I felt nothing for her character.I am of the firm belief that David Fincher is incapable of making one of his movies look bad. Every single one of his movies is perfectly shot and edited. They all look fantastic and the atmosphere he creates is one of a kind. The effects and makeup in this movie are also exceptional and look fantastic. They really portray the changing in age for a character.I recommend this movie for the sheer spectacle, effects and performances. It definitely lacks in story but considering it is near 3 hours long, it doesn't feel like it in the slightest. I would definitely watch this movie; I'll rate this movie 8 Voldermort Babies out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Satisfying if somewhat affected,"Just the premise, a man aging backwards, should warrant this one a shot. In its execution though, it reminded me more then a little of Forest Gump. For instance, the narrative with its humor (some are made to get struck by lightning) and the ongoing love-story. Maybe its a few shades darker, but its overall tone, is largely the same. Its sentimental, episodic, nostalgic, looks beautiful, and reminds engrossing through most parts of the picture, but fails to accomplish anything significant.I though the way they made the character change throughout the film was quite amazing. Brad Pit turns in another good performance, but is clearly out-shined by Cate Blanchett. Likewise, the way the times changes are handled nicely, mostly just hinted at in the background with different trends (just one little misstep in this department: The parts with The Beatles on television).I wish they wouldn't have to resort to the bookending parts where they read his diary on her deathbed. Its length also wore me out and i felt my interest fading for the last hour, but i probably weren't on the right frame of mind, after all, this is the kind of film you watch with your whole family during Christmas and in that context its probably great. So, all in all, this is a typical Oscar winner. For better and worse.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
A Heart lifting and wonderful film,"THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON is a magical film with performances from Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett and Taraji P. Henson that light up the screen with a story that never seems almost three hours long, but one in which you never want the film to end. I have never seen Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett look more beautiful, as they both give a wondrous luxe look to their characters that make them seem almost ""ageless"". The sets, the supporting cast, the technical aspects of the production, all add up to a story and film that make you say, ""Oscar!"" The last time I saw Pitt and Blanchett was in BABEL, and there is a great chemistry between these two actors that jumps off the screen in BENJAMIN BUTTON. The way the story is told and the introduction of the film in the beginning scenes so beautifully set up the journey of the characters that follows. And, the fact that love takes no face, nor color, to make one say, ""you're my mother"", is one that shall stay with me forever. BUTTON is a film you want to go back to see, to cherish the tenderness of scenes of old and young, black and white, living, and dying, together as family. Magical is the only word that I can describe is the ride the audience takes during their time with BENJAMIN BUTTON.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"A curious creation, to be sure.","This is strictly an adult film, and extremely LONG. Quite a feat for this day and age. So first, prepare yourself for a long slog, it's 3-hours, plus. It was a different kind of movie, based upon an equally dubious tenet. But if you're willing to take that large leap of faith, the film has it's moments. First, a tour de force performance by Brad Pitt. He's much more than just a pretty face, and this part must have taken a physical toll (oh, the makeup!) on him. He played the role with uncommon subtly and grace. And naturally, the luminous Kate Blanchette is always a joy to behold, revealing emotions on a level hardly seen today. That said, to base an entire, epic-length feature film on such a flimsy premise and glacial pace kind of left me gasping for air at the end, although there were some thoughtful and memorable moments. I'll give it an ""A"" for effort, but this isn't box office magic, to be sure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
The truly boring case of Benjamin button,"Is it me or is this the most overrated film ever! It started off o.k but boy was the story drawn out over what felt like an eternity, I can honestly say I couldn't wait for the ordeal to be over! The short story was a strange concept that probably belongs in the domain of the TV production, but as an almost 3 hour film it just didn't work. The visuals, locations and make-up used in the were good but all these were let down by a story that should never have been made into a film in the first place! You never get an true insight into the feelings of the main characters, now come on, a guy who was born as an old baby and is ""growing"" younger, surely he would have faced some deep rooted internal hardships, but all the viewer gets is what's on the surface.All in all a film that starts well, but goes on and on and on, with the viewer waiting, even hoping for something vaguely interesting, or even funny to happen.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
A story you can believe...,"I think anything is believable; it's all in the way the story is told. 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is just such a story. And besides, we want to believe in that which touches the heart, scares us half to death or brings sidesplitting laughter. This is why we love to watch movies. It is why the best of them appear to be timeless.This film is excellent on every level. The story was handled perfectly. It is a rich and expansive tale. One might think that time is the subject here, but in truth, it is nothing more than another great love story. 'Nothing more' because it doesn't get lost in it's circumstances. The direction of David Fincher wrings every bit of energy and emotion from the cast that allows this story to thrive.Brad Pitt crafts an unforgettable performance as 'Benjamin Button'. It is perhaps, his finest work to date. He creates an even-tempered, and sophisticated man. A man who thirsts for a knowledge and understanding of a world that seems upside down, but that also has dropped great compassion on his doorstep.Taraji Henson is outstanding as the mother that recognizes beauty, the future and the hand of god in her son's disposition. Mahershalalhashbaz Ali compliments Hensen's 'Queenie' as 'Tizzy', the other man in her life. Jared Harris is 'Captain Mike' who in the proverbial split-second decision becomes Benjamin's mentor in the ways of the world.Menageries of characters pass through 'Benjamin's' world. It is they who are rambunctious and animated. They show Benjamin the aspects of life that can easily be missed, and thus bypass the great experiences that life offers. It is Benjamin who realizes that one must be brave enough to grasp these opportunities.'Benjamin Button' was a movie I had read about, seen the trailers for and was convinced I shouldn't see. I thought I knew pretty much all there was to know already. It wasn't long into the film that I knew I was wrong.

Simply awesome...,"I loved it. Although the pace of the movie is little bit slow but a masterpiece movie.Every moment of the movie is simply perfect. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are outstanding character actors, though they're invariably positioned as Hollywood glamour figures.I watched the movie alone and thinking that it's not a movie for mass at home. But i was wrong at the end ..and i have seen it second time with my bro.

"Imperfect, Weird, and Entertaining Drama","This movie is a weird one for me. I love Brad Pitt's interpretation of Benjamin, but I feel like David Fincher focused too much on the scenery, which is beautiful, and the characters.

One of the finest movies in a long time.,"""Dear Mr. Fincher. You have proved to me that humanity is a species worth saving. I will return in a thousand years to test you again. Fare thee well, earthmen.""The above might very well have been an alien watching this movie. It certainly sums up many of my feelings after having watched it.I won't go into details about the actual plot, most of you know the deal with Benjamin Button being born old and dying young. What you might not know yet, is that in between those two events, you'll experience numerous moments of awe, despair, sorrow, sadness, humor and sheer enjoyment.The story is adapted from a short story and is one of the most engrossing I've watched in a long time. Clocking in at about 160 minutes, you'd forgive the movie for having a few dead periods. But it never does. It's as if not a single second could have been shaved off it. Respect to Eric Roth for the story, but with movies like Forrest Gump, Munich and The Good Shepherd, it's no surprise.As for the much discussed effects, they are plentiful. But none of them gets in the way. On the contrary. They are added with graceful subtlety, making for wonderful and fantastic pictures. I am not quite sure what it is about the sceneries in the movie that is so wonderful. But they are thick full of atmosphere and everything ooze detail and handicraft at its best.Much credit should also be paid to the soundtrack. The story stretches over a long period and the music is matched to every period, as well as the wonderful score.Brad Pitt narrates and plays Benjamin Button - save for the end. Special effects was applied to make him older and younger. With marvelous results. He acts - as always - strikingly well. I'm not a particularly big fan of him, but a performance like this deserves recognition. And he does have a pleasing voice.Lastly, I must point towards the always enchanting Cate Blanchett who is absolutely wonderful in this movie. It is rare to see a woman of such classical beauty. As she gets older in the movie, she just seems more and more graceful.In the end, I felt like reversing time and watch the movie all over again, getting more of the beautiful details and dialog.Thanks for a wonderful viewing experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Impeccably produced but a little syrupy for my taste.  A bit Forest Gumpy.,"I expected to see a great movie and saw a good one. Brad Pitt was effective, Kate Blanchet, as usual, impressive. The supporting cast also acquitted itself well. However, even within the context of implausibility, which I, as a viewer, easily accept, some of it was a little too convenient for me. Even within the realm of so-called magical realism I need something a little more concrete.No plot summary necessary here - most of us know, when we go (from the previews) where the movie is headed. Perhaps the film could have been a little less self-consciously philosophical. Anyone who doesn't get the message after 2+ hours of watching this... I don't know, there can't be anyone! Nothing to be ashamed of here. I just prefer something with a little more teeth.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Kill count,"If you like to see people dying you won't be disappointed with this film. You get the privilege to see someone die every few minutes for almost 3 hours. In total almost 1400 people die in this film.According to this site (http://www.geekstir.com/rambos-kill-stats) all four Rambo flicks combined had only 438 kills so this one is a treasure trove.Despite demanding nearly three hours of the viewer's life, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button makes every last second more than worth it, its power and incredibly uniform quality made all the more appealing by its lack of pretension and vehement avoidance of cliché. While the story or length may not appeal to every last audience member, it is all the more of a shame, as such unanticipated cinematic mastery deserves to be enjoyed and reflected upon by as many as possible.Excellent stuff, heavily recommended. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Backwards,"On a technical level this movie is amazing. David Fincher tries new boundaries and he succeeds. I haven't seen the making of yet, but people have told me about some things, that they have seen and it sounds amazing.Unfortunately I don't feel as ""touched"" by the complete story. It does have a strong beginning and the acting is great. But at the end it seems more like bits and parts and not as a whole movie experience. Of course that symbolizes our life as it is (also bits and pieces and many different chapters, with different characters in them). But although I do like this aspect, I feel there could've been more.Maybe Mr. Fincher spoiled us with the movies he makes and I expected more. But whatever it is and although I do like the movie, I couldn't bear to give it more than 7/10 (which isn't bad at all in my book either).",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Great.... but I can't help but feel there was something missing...,"It's difficult to talk about this movie, because it frustrates me. I loved this movie, and I wanted to love it. It was a gorgeous film, with a well developed story. Cinematography, music, art direction, editing, costume design, EVERYTHING was of the highest quality. And the acting was great throughout. Cate Blanchett played a woman torn between choosing for love or choosing for eventual convenience. She effectively conveys her feelings using her voice and every single look. Brad Pitt clocks in a performance that, though mostly digital, turns out to be surprisingly clever, funny, and well nuanced. He injects just the right amount of comedy into the film without being too subtle or too over the top, and he holds the message to the movie: live now. Don't take any chances. Don't hold back. Though he is headed through life in the opposite direction as Daisy, Benjamin must still find ways to appreciate his situation. He must also decide whether or not he is the right thing for Daisy.And yet.... though all of these things were very very well done, it STILL felt like something was missing. It's not often I come across a movie that I know has an element missing but I can't pinpoint what it is. Sadly, I don't think I will ever figure it out. Maybe after many repeated viewings I will come to discover it, but for now, I will leave that assessment up to the viewer.So, with that being said, a 9 out of 10 (for that missing elusive element which makes for a truly great film).",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"Enjoyable, interesting but too long.","It seems that people are divided into 2 camps-they either love this or hate it. Some find it pointless.Simply put; the film is about our fear of what we will become. What the future holds for us. For the young, they see old people and some probably fear the idea they will become old. In this case, things are different for Benjamin Button. The film also seems to be about timing. How we sometimes meet the love of our life but perhaps aren't ready for it or too immature to realize what is in front of us. I think it's also about caring for the ones we love when they can no longer care for themselves.The film is very well acted by everyone. The photography is beautiful. I think the film could have been shorter though. It does seem to be a bit too long. I can think of a couple of scenes that could have been shortened without affecting the film.I didn't find it depressing and it certainly is a unique idea for a film.

A Fantasy Movie Built In The Real World,"A Baby is born with a strange disease where his body ages in reverse and he experiences the world uniquely as he grows younger while everyone else arounds him grow older.Benjamin Button is a story pulled out of a fantasy movie but set in the real world. To be more precise, the character Benjamin Button seems like someone that was plucked from fantasy world but thrust into the real world. That in itself, makes it such a unique and satisfying story. Benjamin is bound by real world laws except his body which mysteriously de-ages itself. Through his eyes we see the world as he experiences it. He is an actual baby, child, young adult when we watch him grow up and his mental age reflects that. But visually, we see an old invalid man, gradually gain vitality and youth.The adventures he goes on as he experiences the world and life are exciting. But he is grounded by his love for his childhood sweetheart Daisy, played by the beautiful Cate Blanchett, (She truly is the definition of beauty) and his mama, a maid who became his foster mother at a nursing home where he was abandoned.Benjamin's weakness is plainly his disease of being born old and growing young. But as luck would have it, he fit right in the nursing home where he was abandoned, filled with other old people. His need is to experience life, in all of its beauty and ugliness and learn about it. But his desire has always been Daisy.It was really cool to see Benjamin grow into a dashing young man when his real age is 40-50. But i feel the story has a beautifully sad and poetic twinge to it. On first glance you'd think having the ability to grow young is desirable and anyone would want that. But nobody would want the baggage that comes with that.I have to give credit to the performances by all the cast members. Taraji P. Henson, Maharshala Ali before he was given the chance and was still playing minor characters, and of course, Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. I wouldnt say that Brad Pitt is great Actor. Of course not when comparing him to actors like Viggo Mortensen, Tom Hanks, even Leonardo Di Caprio. He is best compared with Tom Cruise. Because Brad Pitt brings a certain Brad Pitt charm to all his characters. Similar to how Tom Cruise brings his Tom Cruise charms. I'd give him props for playing characters of different nationality like Irish and Austrian in his other movies. But the Brad Pitt here is just right. Quiet, calm confidence.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
David Fincher is no Ingmar Bergman,"A film with the protagonist aging backwards is going to be about what?... Can you guess?... Life, of course. The life of a man with a rare disease of being born old, first, and he grows down, instead of up, so to speak. The man is Benjamin Button, played by different actors, but particularly Brad Pitt, who also narrates the story.Benjamin is born the day World War I ends, with people celebrating in the streets. His mother dies in childbirth, and his father, frightened by the baby's bizarre wrinkles, abandons him by leaving him on the stairway of an old folks home. (What a coincidence.) From there, he's taken into care by a young Black woman, who works as a servant.Over the years, Benjamin does, indeed, grow down. He learns about love, death, friendship, and, oh yeah, life... or at least this is what Brad Pitt's narration goes on and on about. Even though Benjamin is an ordinary man, the narration makes his life (there's that word, again) appear to be grandiose. Why? If there's going to be narration in a story like this, can't it at least be subtle? Actually, the reason there's narration is because it's being read from a book Benjamin wrote. Read by a young woman in a hospital, with her dying mother, who was Benjamin's lover. (No surprise, there.)The acting is not the problem. Everyone here gives good performances, but it doesn't save the film, except for the first hour, which I *did* like. Also, the film is not predictable, but there are definitely no surprises along the way. OK, the scene about chaos theory with the taxi is clever, but that's it. After the hour mark, the story just feels like blah, blah, blah. So what if Benjamin's an ordinary man, except for his aging disorder? To be fair, it's good that he *is* this ordinary person, because making him as some kind of superhero would've probably been way too hamfisted.I mentioned Ingmar Bergman in the summary. He was a famous Swedish director, who passed away a couple of years ago. I've only seen two of his films, (""The Seventh Seal"" and his epic ""Fanny and Alexander"") but they work much better than this film, in my opinion, as they deal with similar themes. Well, at least ""Fanny and Alexander"" does.Maybe this film would've worked better without Brad's narration. Again, it became too much for me. The length of this film is another problem. Since it's almost three hours long, and Benjamin's life is only so interesting, why not cut the film down by, say, an hour and a half? How much harm would it do? I like David Fincher's films, but this one, frankly, feels like pap.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Decent,"The idea of a boy aging backwards is as simple as genius. We are brought up saying that it is the aging that is the pain: so is growing. We also are taught that it is primarily the aging of the body we need to cope with as we grow old: this movie proves us wrong. Growing up mentally can be as hard as growing up physically. And growing ""young"" is apparently tied to as many consequences and sacrifices as growing old. The movie IS long, and more than once it becomes a problem as the scenes borderline on boredom. What gets you through, however, is the curiosity about the ending, which is not disappointing by any means. There are so many good movies out there and out of all the Oscar nominees this one would be my #2, right after Doubt, which I found far more captivating. The acting is great and that's obviously no surprise. Pitt gives a very good performance, but it's Blanchett who steals the moments with her mastered skills and stoic beauty. Even the smaller parts do not disappoint. Altogether it is a movie worth watching, as long as you're prepared and willing to lose interest in the story once or twice.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Best movie of 2008.,"a couple of weeks ago i went to the movies to see this. my expectations wasn't that high because i could imagine Brad Pitt in such an emotional, smart and funny character.

The Soundtracks is made by a french guy named Alexandre desplat. without a doubt the best soundtracks of 2008. Finally i have to give much credit to Mr. David Fincher. Another great film by this guy.

Life Runs the Direction it is Meant To,"I was quite impressed with the movie because it had such a positive message about getting older and death. For instance when Daisy was dying (during Hurricane Katrina) she said to her daughter *(not much of a spoiler here because it happens at the beginning of the movie) that she was 'curious to see what came next'. Benjamin was old and grew younger, which most of us can relate to wanting to be younger not older, but since he began his life old he said that being old wasn't so bad because he had experienced it. Other things, like not being able to be a father to a child because he was growing younger...etc. really helped you put things into perspective that life goes the direction it is supposed to. *(Still trying not to spoil anything)But mostly, the main thing I came away with was the feeling that it's never too late and getting older is no excuse for not wanting to do what you want to do. I left the theater feeling younger than ever. And darn it if I don't want the same make-up & lighting that made Brad look like he did in Thelma and Louise!However, Benjamin is right, ""There is nothing wrong with getting older"".Not much like F Scott Fitzgerald's story, but a very good improvement I believe. Really liked the clock maker's backward running clock addition.Spoiler here...beware... *Now, someone did point out, and I do agree, that if Benjamin was born an old looking baby and the size of a baby then he should die the same size as an adult that only had the features, actions etc. of a baby. He shouldn't have turned back into a baby.Cate Blanchett's wardrobe in this movie was awesome as was all the background pieces that took you back in time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Good but this could get old.,Very professional little fictional biopic in the vain of Forrest Gump or big fish.One really gets the feeling of a persons life and all the twists and meetings that made into something.The whole reverse ageing thing is really just a gimmick and has little to do with what you see except in sort of fits and starts.A bit too sentimental and sugary for its own good. It's easy to get caught up in the mystique of the adventure.The romance just kind of goes through the motions and some of the character motivations can seem kind of abstract.Overall enjoyable if you're willing to just open yourself up for it.,7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
The best storytelling of all...,"I won't mention anything except the story, I mean the visual effects, sound editing, cinematography, directing, editing and the acting are for sure off the charts, but the story itself is the one that got stuck in the mind all these years. Every movie represents questions at the beginning and in the middle tries to make these questions hard to be answered and then at the end gives you the answers. Except this one where you will get the answers first and then you try to find out what the questions were. I love this movie because the idea of it was a one simple question ""what if""?.

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is an excellent movie,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was about a young boy Benjamin, played by (Brad Pitt) who was born with a rare disease that made him age backwards. He started out as a baby but as time grew longer, he aged really quickly. During his childhood, he fell in love with an older girl played by (Cate Blanchett). Although he was much younger than her, no one could tell because of the disease making him look older than what he was. As time grew further, his time went backwards. For a while it was nice being with the girl, but then he started to go back into the stage of an elderly man until one day he died. Although his true age was young, the disease made him older than what he was until he turned old, dying, and leaving his love behind. The theme of the Curious Case of Benjamin Button is to allow someone the opportunity to view life in a different aspect. This movie shows how, even though you are born with a disease that you may or may not live through, you still can have a chance at living life as much as you can as well as finding someone to love and to love you back. It shows that people of all walks of life experience hardships but have the opportunity and ability to move past their problems and into a peaceful place in their world. This movie also shows the viewer that love does not see images, and can be found through the eyes of the beholder. Brad Pitt played the part so well in allowing the viewers to see the challenges people can face and the opportunity to overcome those challenges to live as normal life as possible. You felt like you were in the scene with the Benjamin Button and watched his life blossom and then wither away, all in the same film. I watched this movie in total awe. It was very interested and gave me a new outlook on life. Another film that this story reminds me of is The Titanic. In that movie, you find one rich person and one poor person; both from different walks of life, but still found each other and fell in love. It didn't matter to them what type of life they had or where they were going. But through the film, although her parents didn't want her to so much as talk to him, they still fell in love, and she remember the day that she met and fell in love with him, until the day she died. She told the story through her love for the person. In the movie the curious Case of Benjamin Button, the lighting showed various ways of feelings that the young boy was having. When he was in pain from the disease or angry about what he was going through, the lights were dim. When he was with his love, it was very bright in light; almost portraying they were feeling for each other. Another technique I recognized was the angle of the film. In different parts of the film, when Benjamin was a young boy living with the maid, the space was very small. The camera was zoomed in at some points showing how small the room was in which they lived. It gave it a sense of togetherness. As if that were their room or living quarters and no one else's. She took care of Benjamin even in the smallest of spaces, and loves him as he was. This movie was one of the best movie's I've seen in a while. I like how it told the story of the boy with the disease, falling in love, and what their lives were like and pulled you into character while doing such. If more movies could be like this, it would show the creativity of one's mind and what you can do while just telling a story.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

"A brilliant film, Fincher and Pitt do it again!","Let me start off by saying I am a big fan I am a big fan of the David Fincher/Brad Pitt combo. Se7en was outstanding. Fight Club is on my personal top 10 list. I was going to see this movie, regardless of what it was about. Those two films alone were enough to make that decision for me.When I first saw the trailer, it was obviously very far removed from the aforementioned films. It was a very different concept for the dynamic duo to tackle. However, I was not terribly worried for two reasons. One, I think that both are masters of their craft. And two, I thought the concept of the film was fascinating. A man who is born old and ages backward. I had never heard of anything remotely like that. It was instantly thought provoking. I was going to see this movie, with high hopes.I had heard from certain sources that had seen the film prior to its release that the film turned out quite boring, and that there were better options out there. I had also heard that the film was brilliant, and would cement Fincher's legacy and be a serious Best Picture Contender. I was very pleased, that upon viewing the film, it turned out to be very much the latter.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button was genuinely captivating throughout every one of the 168 minutes that it was on screen. Every shot was beautifully done. The effects were so seamless and stunning. It can not be easy to make portray a 7-year-old you looks 85 on screen. The special effects and makeup department deserve to be commended.But even more praise should go to the cast of the film. Each actor owned their character. Each one playing a role in Benjamin's life, keeping the story fresh, at times humorous and never boring, a rare feat in a film this long. Brad Pitt, who I believe is one of the most under-rated actors working today, proved to me once again how great he is. There are too many characters to mention here, but I simply must mention the terrific job done by Taraji P. Henson in the role of Queenie, the mother who took Benjamin in on the night of his birth. It was her role that made the film move me from the very beginning.The story itself unfolds as a lesson in love and loss, from the very beginning. It does a brilliant job of portraying its theme that we will suffer losses throughout our lives, they will be very difficult, and we must press on. This film will captivate your mind. It will not be soon forgotten once you have left the theater. I am still mesmerized. As I sit here and write down my feelings toward the movie itself, I can't help but think about the deeper meaning, the issues that the film brings up. I know a lot of people that feel like a movie can't be great unless it makes you feel like this after you see it. I am certainly not one of those people, because not every film aims to do this. However, after seeing this film, I can see where they are coming from.I strongly urge you to see this film. It is one of the five best I have seen this year. I would certainly call it a must see. I feel so much better off for having seen this film. David Fincher tackles an unfamiliar genre with ease and completely knocks it out of the park. If The Dark Knight does not win the Oscar for Best Picture (and I assume it will not), I would have no problem with seeing this film be recognized as this year's best picture winner. It was that good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"The most slow moving, pretentious sci-fi movie in history.  Benjamin is nice but he is BORING!","Yawn .... Zzzzzzzzz.... (movie's still playing) .... Yawn .... Zzzzzzzzz .... Benjamin's how old now? WHO CARES? AND WHY IS HE GETTING YOUNGER?In the Picture of Dorian Gray with Hurd Hatfield, Donna Reed, Angela Landsbury and George Sanders, Dorian NEVER gets old. Beat that, Benny. At least in Dorian the movie offers an explanation for why Dorian does not become old. With Benny ... NOTHING! NO EXPLANATION! Ya gotta give the audience an explanation.After giving the matter some thought and avoiding a rush to judgment, let it be known that this celluloid mess is a truly bad movie. This movie contains all the elements found in a clunker: boring characters, pretentious story, implausible situations, laughable dialog, unoriginality and unnecessarily long. Why oh why was this movie made? What was its purpose? It could not have been to entertain because in that regard the movie fails abysmally.How bad is this movie? There are no words that can fully answer this question. For one thing, this movie is long. For another, this movie is boring. For yet another, this movie is slow ... is ponderous ... is pretentious. An old man who gets young? Okay, what's next? A tall man who gets short? (Oh, that was done in the Incredible Shrinking Man.) A man who becomes an animal? (Oh, that was done in The Werewolf and other similar movies) A intellectually challenged man who becomes a genius? (Oh, that was done in Charly) A man who creates another man (Oh, that was done in Frankenstein). Ugh.First, in which genre does this movie belong? Science fiction or whimsical drama? For a drama, including a work of fiction, to work the story has to have plausibility, and in this movie the lack of plausibility is glaring. Now if the movie was presented as a science fiction drama then maybe the story could be accepted at face value and judged accordingly. But for this incredibly boring, ponderous, pretentious, and LONG movie, that is not the case. Okay, a man is born old and grows younger. That is a crucial element of the story that demands, indeed cries out for, further explanation. That cannot be accepted as a given because of its fantastic nature. Yet this movie offers no explanation whatsoever, relying instead on the audience accepting it despite it's obvious implausibility. This would be like watching the movie King Kong (any of one of the movies) with no explanation of King Kong's origin (Kong came from an island). Or this would be like watching the movie Predator with no reference as to where the creature originated (the creature came from outer space). Then the movie is so lacking in any kind of dynamism or conflict as to render it stale to the point of being annoying. The main character Benjamin is liked by everybody, even his father who not unreasonably panics when he sees his strange progeny. Also, the use of repeated flashbacks chopped up the story, interfering with its continuity, and starting the movie with an dying elderly woman who could barely talk didn't help the movie either. And by the time the main character has devolved into a child it was way past his bed time, for him and for this over hyped, over baked, overly long and very boring movie.Actually this movie does have some (unintentionally) memorable scenes. Like when the Benjamin's father is told that he has a new baby son, sees the infant, is absolutely horrified, grabs the baby and then is running all over the place with the baby while being chased by the police. Or when Benjamin is working on a tug boat and throws garbage overboard - into a head wind - and gets covered with garbage. Or when Benjamin has his first sexual experience - with a whore. Ugh.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"Some things last, as the film proves testament to","Just when it increasingly appears the wells of Hollywood's creativity have dried up, continually resorting to reworking tired cinematic and narrative clichés, films like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button emerge to unexpectedly rekindle faith in the industry. Intriguing enough by its mere storyline core (a man is born a senior citizen, and 'ages' backwards throughout his life), what could have resulted in an overly gimmicky excuse for a melodrama is seemingly effortlessly transformed by the delicate directorial touch of David Fincher into something far less contentious and volumes more poignant and lyrical. A haunting, resonant exploration of time, life, death and the transition from one to the other, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button miraculously manages to be sombre and emotionally draining without once becoming excessively dour, with sublime bits of charm, humour and hope peppering the profundity and making it a true cinematic experience for the ages.To call The Curious Case of Benjamin Button close to a contemporary masterpiece would hardly be overstating things, and yet such praise feels out of place, not because the film is not deserving of it (far from it) but that it makes no claims as to aiming for such heights - were it not for the enormous budget and stars, the film could easily have been a small, independent production. Few films prove so enormously ambitious and yet ultimately unassuming, with such vast scopes, and yet such simple aims all things considered, and Fincher toes the line between the grand and the intimate with remarkable precision. Moreover, it is interesting to see perennial cynic Fincher tap into such unbridled emotional resonance (the film is unlikely to leave a single dry eye in the house), and yet such moments are pure sentiment trimmed of all sap and Hollywood tear-jerking cliché, making them all the more gently genuine and lasting. If his past films such as Fight Club and Seven appeared to be expunging hidden depths of suppressed rage and bitterness, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button appears an attempt to tap into more tender feelings, and the result is in no way less magnificent.While on very first impression the film might be sized up as overlong, rambling and full of extraneous subplots, over time it becomes increasingly clear the film's intent is not merely to tell the story of Button, but, to the best of Fincher's considerable ability, to live alongside him, complete with all the highs, lows, and little bits in between. This not only provides incredible empathy and pathos for Button's unconventional situation, but allows the story through the character to extrapolate and explore deeper existential themes, reflecting upon the notions of time and its fleeting potential, the overlap of life and death and the importance of living life to the fullest regardless of adversity. While it can be argued that despite this the script still has the occasional clunky bit of exposition, with storytelling so operatic yet paradoxically quiet and unassuming, such concerns only register as rare minute breaches in the film's incredible quality.Fincher's flair for stunning visuals also carries through in fully force, from the luscious period costuming and sets to the bold visual contrast between the exhilarating (a tense second world war sea battle) to the amusing (boyhood/elderly man Benjamin discovering alcohol) to the heartbreakingly dramatic (Benjamin's quietly horrified meeting with his father) and the seamless flow between them. Alexandre Desplat's luminous musical score and Claudio Miranda's grandiose cinematography ably reinforce the lyrical content. This all, of course goes without even mentioning the film's most central hook, the visual effects and prosthetic 'reverse aging' effects. At first startlingly convincing, the greatest testament to the incredible visual talent on display is how near immediately the viewer forgets about it, remaining so engrossed in Button's bizarre story to extract one's self from the narrative enough to properly appraise the incredible work put into it - a sign, if any, of masterful film-making.As the titular Button, Brad Pitt is simply a marvel, delivering a performance which is quiet, ego-less, unshowy and all the more supremely effective and credible for it, perfectly convincing no matter what age or contrasting physical appearance. Infusing unassuming heart and unspoken pathos into a character stoically resigned to 'unusual' circumstances rather than milking them for all their emotional worth, Pitt's Benjamin Button becomes an unforgettable underdog for the ages, all the more effective from Pitt's continual refusal to adhere to cliché or Hollywood showboating. Cate Blanchett proves just as marvellous, also essaying a character over the course of over 70 years of her life and proving completely convincing and heartwarming every step of the way while delivering a tremendously emotional performance with the utmost precision and grounded care. Rather than delivering a typical female romantic lead type, Blanchett's Daisy is a fleshed out, enormously credible human being, making her romantic struggle with Button all the more achingly affecting. Supporting the lead duo and their simultaneously heartwarming and heartbreaking relationship, Taraji P. Henson gives an enormously powerful yet understated performance as Button's surrogate orphanage mother, and Jason Flemyng proves a perfect combination of quirky and hauntingly credible as Button's estranged father. Finally, Tilda Swinton delivers a performance layered with emotional volumes and nuance as a fleeting romantic interest of Button's, managing to both capture the audience's heart and contempt simultaneously.Despite demanding nearly three hours of the viewer's life, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button makes every last second more than worth it, its power and incredibly uniform quality made all the more appealing by its lack of pretension and vehement avoidance of cliché. While the story or length may not appeal to every last audience member, it is all the more of a shame, as such unanticipated cinematic mastery deserves to be enjoyed and reflected upon by as many as possible.-9.5/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
David Fincher and co. made something magical,"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is one of those truly great movies that i've had the fortune of seeing when released, not 10 years later.Brad Pitt plays Button, an individual who was born under unusual circumstances, being born as an old man and growing younger. While Cate Blanchett plays Daisy, a young girl growing older and older.The movie deals heavily with loss and time, which are executed brilliantly. It also has a few interesting characters that break the movie up and give some humour to the story (The Dingy Captain, The Man who was struck 7 times by lightning).I left the theatre feeling good that i had seen a movie of this calibre.Extremely recommended 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
The film from start to finish does not let up,"This film is by far one of the best if not the best of 2008. Fincher's direction is flawless! The film from start to finish does not let up. There are moments of joy and ecstasy followed by sorrow and understanding. Brad Pitt stars as Benjamin, a boy born an old man who must live his life in reverse. His friend from childhood, Daisy, is played by Cate Blanchett. The story is narrated from Benjamin's point of view with some particular highlights from Daisy.The cast does nothing wrong. Pitt leads with Blanchett and a strong performance from Taraji P. Henson as Benjamin's surrogate mother Queenie, the only person in the world who seems to understand and truly love him from the start. Other cameos along the way bring a large array of characters, including Tilda Swinton, one of Benjamin's early love interests.The film spans from the end of World War I to the the arrival of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. The transitions from life stage to life stage and decade to decade are seamless. Fincher does a tremendous job at maintaining a steady flow of action and dialogue. There is not a dull moment in the film. The cinematography is superb and couples nicely with Fincher's style of accentuating certain colors to enhance a mood or moment.There really is nothing wrong with this film. Even with a runtime of about 160 minutes, time just flies by, much like it does for Benjamin, only we are going forward. This is a tender and meaningful film you do not want to wish.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Enchanting,"Any good critic will tell you that when you write a review you should start by introducing the plot, examine the overarching themes of the film, and then reveal your personal opinion which of course will be grounded in cinematic theory, and I would normally go along with this But if Benjamin Button has taught me anything it is that life is too short, so I'm just going to come right out and say it. I loved this film! From the intriguing beginning to the heart breaking end I was enchanted.Based on an F Scott Fitzgerald short story The Curious Case of Benjamin Button sweeps you up and carries you on an epically intimate portrayal of a life lived backwards. The film follows Benjamin as he makes his way from birth as an old man through middle age to youth. Along the way he meets a fantastical array of characters, he triumphs and he encounters tragedy, he finds love, loses it and finds it again. Like Forrest Gump (also written by Eric Roth) Benjamin Button dances through a life touched by extraordinary events with wide-eyed innocence and naive charm, he meets his 'jenny' in the form of Daisy and their love story is intricately weaved through the history of the 20th Century.It is to David Fincher's complete credit and talent as a filmmaker that the comparisons to Forrest Gump stop there. It would have been very easy to take this film down a path of bombarding imagery and obvious song choices but instead Fincher serves up a film swimming in warmth, sentimentality and whimsical reality. But let's not forget, this is still a David Fincher film; along with the romance we have unforgiving melancholy. Fincher takes his time getting his two love interests together, for the first half of the film both characters flit in and out of each others lives all the while the audience are astutely aware that time will catch up on them. Finally Fincher allows us to enjoy them together by presenting a montage of chocolate box moments but the idealism is soon replaced by reality, their love always will be fleeting. Indeed this is the heartbeat of the film, love in all forms, whether it is a mother's love or friendship, comes and goes. Time does not allow us to hold on and it doesn't matter which way we move through life, we can't rewind it.The visual imagery is spectacular, from the faux 1920s shutter camera to the techniques used to age the actors; Benjamin Button is a feast for the eyes. What is even more impressive is the ability of the actors to make the special effects seem so natural, no more so than Brad Pitt. Is this Brad Pitt's finest performance? No, but I do think it is he's most accomplished. He carries the film with such subtlety and restraint that it would be simple to overlook his character as nothing more than a passive observer, however there are scenes where through Pitt's acting skills Benjamin Button personality shines. The supporting cast are also top notch, leading the charge are the ever wonderful Cate Blancett and scene stealing Taraji P. Henson.So as I said, I loved this film. With Awards season upon us it is becoming apparent that The Curious Case of Benjamin Button will not be winning as many awards as it has been nominated for which isn't a surprise if Brad Pitt and David Fincher's awards CVs are anything to go by. I don't think it much matters; this film already feels like a classic for the ages. Unlike Benjamin and Daisy's love for each other The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is timeless and we as an audience will be able to rewind it and enjoy it forever.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Great? Not really...,"It's pretty obvious that an enormous amount of work went into making this film (just considering how looooong it is and how many well made-up life stages its title character covers). However, Art is not judged by quantity, but by quality. To me, this film felt dull and pointless. OK, so Benjamin ages in reverse with all the complications such a phenomenon would generate, and travels a lot. So? What exactly is the film supposed to tell us besides this particular thing? There's a lot of attention to detail, but it feels so minutious that the film appears rigid and uptight, like a soft fabric stitched too tight. It seems to me this film was supposed to bee a bit deeper, maybe a bit whimsical with a touch of wonder, or SOMETHING that would make it more than a pointless story, and would get us ponder for a while afterward. Maybe if Mr. Fincher would have remembered this was not a ""who done it"" movie and it requires a softer touch and a more relaxed approach, and mostly, more freedom in its creation, the film would've had that airy quality that makes us smile with our hearts and truly remember it for a while.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

Button up or Button down ?,"There have been films that have had their protagonists relive the defining moments of their lives on their deathbeds. 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' adds a fresh clause to the aphorism that 'lives reflected upon are lives fully lived'. Would the experience be more fulfilling if relived by a person aging backwards ? David Fincher and Brad Pitt team up for the third time (Se7en, Fight Club) for this loose adaptation of Scott Fitzgerald's short story. As with the earlier films, the result is nothing short of brilliant. Using the ingenious device of a recollection within a recollection to enhance the rapport the audience has with the characters, the movie traces vignettes from the lives of Daisy (Cate Blanchett) and Benjamin (Brad Pitt), two people whose lives are inter-twined in a manner that has them in nearly every conceivable facet of love. It helps then that this is a pair that genuinely understand each other as actors and that their previous outing - Babel, featured a harrowing journey for the couple that eventually strengthened their bond. Their screen vibes form the crux of the film. Through them, the film examines a number of themes ranging from the human obsession with physical appearances to the idea that some bonds defy the most long-standing establishments. In that regard, the casting of Pitt and Blanchett with their matchless lines and physical grace makes perfect sense. Pitt, in particular, leaves no doubt as to why it has to be him as Benjamin and nobody else. With a deserved Oscar nod, his no-hassles acceptance of his peculiar condition is the highlight of the film. That it holds its own amidst the fantastic work by the make-up department is testimony to the performance.Giving them great company are Taraji Henson as Queenie, Tilda Swinton as Elizabeth Abbott and Jared Harris as Captain Mike. Many performances, short albeit, deserve a mention but these are the three that stick with you. Straddling the performances is technical wizardry of a kind and degree that doesn't come as a surprise to anyone who is familiar with Fincher's style. So much so that some of his fervent critics have pointed out that this aspect of his films often takes priority over the human concerns that the script raises. His work here is a triumphant no. There is style but it never glosses over substance. If anything, the former accentuates the latter, be it the montage demonstrating the purpose of the 'anticlockwise' clock, the sepia drenched visuals or the narrative technique for the Paris segment.The sheer variety of visuals lingers long after the viewing. Theodore Roosevelt (""I wish I had had a war to fight during my presidency"") taking his hat off at the stated purpose of the 'anticlockwise' clock, Daisy's ballet performance in New York, the U-boat sequence, the Hummingbird fluttering on the hospital window. Ultimately, it's the fact that a film that could so easily have become what the title suggests, merely a curious case, instead goes on to strike a chord with audiences. That is its biggest triumph.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
The best movie of 2008!,"You can always count on Hollywood to turn even a silly sounding concept into a masterpiece of a movie. For me, Button is the movie to beat in 2008. It succeeds on many fronts and is a pure best picture contender.The movie is filled with good performances, most notably Brad Pitt. His was not a performance of explosive dialog but one that required expressions that told us what he was experiencing; and he did an excellent job. The characters brought alive the various emotions in the story, which built its way to become a poignant tragedy.David Fincher took the movie to another level using a fantastic storytelling technique, and he can be thankful to the spectacular cinematography which made the movie look so rich and alive.

An undeniable achievement,"The film ""the curious case of Benjamin Button"" is without question THE must see epic of 2008. At just under three hours this movie presents everything (all the highs and lows) that life has to offer. With the interesting concept of growing in the opposite direction.No movie has more successfully looked at the old belief of ""youth being wasted on the young"" in such a unique way and David Fincher manages to surpass all previous work with this amazingly brilliant looking film, successfully representing the time period to unbelievable detail. And the main stars, Brad Pitt as Benjamin and Cate Blanchett as Daisy, provides some of the best performances not only of the year but of their own respective careers. It also must be noted the amazing SFX that are seen in this movie, usually films of this genre don't tend to need any CGI but this film uses it to achieve staggeringly unbelievable effects.In a year of spectacular surprises (WALL-E and The Dark Knight) and lackluster disappointments (Australia and Quantum of solace) it is good to go to the cinema one last time before 09 and see one of , if not the best, films of the last twelve months.Expect this to dominate every awards ceremony in the new year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
A delightful treat,"It certainly is a curious case. David Fincher, known for putting killers and nihilistic terrorists centre-stage, brings us an Oscar-baiting, love epic. Centring on Benjamin Button, a lovable character who finds himself born into a body that ages backwards, the film travels the globe, spans decades and takes into a wide range of characters and emotions as it explores exactly what it is to be human.Brad Pitt, well-hidden CG and top-class prosthetics combine to form Button, a man always struggling to fit in. Not much is asked of Pitt's acting ability. All he really needs to do is maintain an air of loneliness and look solemnly into the middle distance from time to time. It is his interactions, even the most minor ones, which really do the work, from his love for Cate Blanchett's Daisy, to his relationships with the crew of the tugboat 'Chelsea' on which he works and his feelings for his family, both adopted and biological. It is these small relations that do the real work, connecting with the audience and maintaining a pull on their emotions at all times.These background characters, each intended to be quirky and memorable, too often slip into cliché. For every irreverent old man at the retirement home, there is an Irish sailor straight out the book of Irish sailors. Enjoyable characters yes, but an extra dimension to their personality is expected.The film immerses itself in quirky detail, which despite being largely unnecessary to the plot, are rarely a distraction. In one scene, Fincher creates a whirling ode to chaos theory, climaxing in a major plot event. Most films would simply show the event itself, after all, that is all that's integral to the plot, but seeing the way that tiny occurrences come together to create a significant moment makes it feel neither forced nor unimportant, despite its irrelevance.But amongst these asides and whimsical distractions, what really is the main point of this film? It is a billed as a film about life, in its entirety, with no emotion or experience left unchecked. The truth is, it is really about old age, or at least the facade of old age. It concerns itself far more regularly with how Button deals with being a young person in an old body than the other way around. Button's later life is shown mostly in montages, and his feelings about being old but appearing young are never really addressed properly.The centrepiece of the plot, although not the entirety of it, concerns itself with the love between Daisy and Benjamin, but there is too much going on to call it a love story. It is designed to portray human emotion on a grand scale, which sometimes tends towards the pretentious, but more often than not leaves a sincere mark on the audience.Despite the length it is never tedious, and the bevy of interesting characters makes up for the films faults. Curious Case will delight and entertain audiences more for the intriguing and memorable asides than for the core of the film, but it is nevertheless a treat.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"Great make up, cinematography, poor direction, casting and horrible editing","Firstly, it was brilliant to see set design and make-up of the highest class and that should be applauded but the actual film was a short story padded out for around 3 hours such that much of the movie is in fact, very boring. Before I take the positives in the movie itself, there are two aspects that both ruin the film and more importantly, increase the running time by around an hour.Firstly, the casting of Tilda Swinton is just awful. I can appreciate the reasons why the director wanted her in the movie, she's beautiful, and a great actress, but, after likely rejecting her in favour of Cate Blanchett, should have waited for another film before hiring Swinton instead of giving her a completely inconsequential part that has no substance and has no impact on the story.Secondly, the constant reverting back to the lead in the hospital re-counting the story. This kind of scenario has been played out hundreds of times before, and much better. In these sequences, the film simply meanders to nowhere in particular before you are transported back in time. The meandering sequences in the hospital conservatively last around 20 minutes which could easily have been done in 2 or 3 minutes with better dialogue.Both of these facets of the film almost completely ruined the film for me but that is not to say the film doesn't have its redeeming features.Firstly, the film does a very nice job of approaching Hurricane Katrina in a way that is oblique but at the same time handles the upcoming devastation with some very good handiwork from the camera.Secondly, Brad Pitt's performance is great. He loves his accents (a la Snatch) and he's up for it here too, but as someone said earlier, his character simply isn't likable enough to be overly sympathetic with him although there are some real comedic moments and these are done well.To sum up, it's an overly long film with several great moments, it's not Oscar winning material by any means (as a picture, it is Oscar-material as far as a costume drama goes) but it is reasonable and that is well above the Hollywood average.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"""Your life is defined by its opportunities... even the ones you miss""","Mankind has always been fascinated by his own mortality. Death has been a prevailing motif in art throughout the centuries, most of the contributing artists and authors now deceased, having been outlived by the work borne from their passions and uncertainties. Author F. Scott Fitzgerald died prematurely in 1940. There will come a time when director David Fincher passes on (hopefully not for a long time yet), and so 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008)' will serve as his own wistful essay on the nature of life and death, love and loss. Fitzgerald's short story was adapted by Eric Roth, who also wrote 'Forrest Gump (1994)' {itself inspired by the likes of 'Little Big Man (1970)' and 'Being There (1979)'}, and so comparisons between the two films are certainly not unfounded. Both films  and I love 'Forrest Gump,' by the way  trace the lives of sympathetic characters who are forced to experience the world through unusual circumstances, thus giving them a unique outlook on life. Also brought to mind is Tim Burton's 'Big Fish (2003),' particularly with its elements of fantasy.Though almost three hours in length, every shot of Fincher's film is a sumptuous feast for the eyes, with computer-generated imagery integrated seamlessly into the plot, enhancing the fantastical atmosphere rather than distracting from it. Extensive make-up is used to add decades to many of the supporting characters, but what I found even more astonishing was the visual trickery used to ""age down"" star Brad Pitt to a striking youth in his twenties. The effect is marvellously disconcerting, and really drives home the sheer eeriness of Benjamin Button's circumstances. The film's somewhat-gimmicky premise is played surprisingly lightly during the film's first half, but gradually transforms into a melancholy tragedy when Benjamin begins to comprehend that his current ""normal"" lifestyle is only temporary. There's little emotional pay-off to the film, perhaps because the protagonist is himself incapable of finding any lasting satisfaction. Though we follow Benjamin's years to their logical conclusion, there's disappointingly little pathos in his final moments; as soon as Brad Pitt is removed from the equation, the audience loses its emotional anchor with the character.Despite its inconsistent tone and occasionally lazy storytelling, 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is probably Fincher's most mature film to date, certainly more so than the highly enjoyable but superficial 'Se7en (1995)' and 'Fight Club (1999),' though 'Zodiac (2007)' first signalled the arrival of an intelligent filmmaker. For viewers in search of action-packed thrills, they'd best look elsewhere, for 'Benjamin Button' is a film in which nothing much happens. This remark is obviously hyperbole, but I don't mean it as a criticism; the film is a subtle and elegiac meditation on human mortality, and it basks for 166 minutes in this simple but powerful premise. For Benjamin Button, we can't sit back and muse, as we might for Forrest Gump or Edward Bloom, ""this man has had a great life."" When it comes down to it, exactly what has Benjamin done with his life? He's just lived it, and, really, that's all that anyone can expect out of life. Some people were born to sit by a river; some get struck by lightning; some are artists; some swim; some dance. Benjamin Button lived.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
It's a treat to watch.,"I finally got around to watching this movie yesterday. Going into the theater what I had mostly heard from people was that it was one of those movies that induce deep slumber.

I enjoyed the movie. It was beautifully shot and acted in with restraint and intelligence. At about 3 hours,it is a tad too long but then how can you do justice to an epic saga in less time? Adapted from a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, this is the story of a man who was 'born under unusual circumstances'. There is wit,humor and an element of mystique in the movie that makes it a treat to watch. Watch out for the vignette involving a man who claims to have been struck by lightening seven times in his lifetime.

An ambitious and beautiful piece of storytelling from Fincher - 8/10 ⭐,"Wow, this was such a breath of fresh air and such a different vibe than we're used to getting from Fincher. The visual effects and production design were incredible; no surprise the film picked up the Oscar for both categories. Brad Pitt is just sublime in the role, displaying a sensitivity and vulnerability well beyond his years (no pun intended). Every performance is wonderful and the message at its core of seizing opportunities while we still can surely resonated.

Superior Story and Acting,"Reviewers here either love it or hate it. Well, I cannot say that I loved it. I certainly did not hate it, but I liked it a great deal. I found it a superior story with equally superior acting from all involved. The makeup was extraordinary. The tale of a man who goes from old to young rather than from young to old. Really no difference, or is there. I thought Brad Pitt did a fabulous job in the role, and I was really into the story or plot. I do have one thing I thought was rather unnecessary---that was the whole sequence of how things went amiss so as to cause the car to hit Daisy--that whole thing how one was late, one had a fight with a boyfriend, a shoe lace broke----all that, I felt, was unnecessary. Just show her getting hit by a car; that whole sequencing thing should have been cut. In any case, I enjoyed this movie, found it entertaining to watch and behold. The acting was excellent and a fabulous story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
One of the best movies of 2008,"Since this was a Best Picture contender for 2008, my natural reaction was to compare it to Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire. Although they are both completely different kinds of movies, they do share a common theme of a lifelong romance. However, whereas Slumdog Millionaire starts out dark & gritty and leads up to a fairy-tale conclusion, David Fincher's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is quite consistent throughout and doesn't try to be too dark or too bright.It was very intriguing just observing Benjamin's growth (or rather, backwards growth) and at times I could really feel for the characters. This is probably the best performance I've seen from Brad Pitt to date, although I thought Taraji P. Henson gave the best performance in the movie as his foster mother. Overall, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is definitely one of the best movies of 2008 I've seen.8/10",,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
The modern scenes ruin it - so just skip them!,"The worst part of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is the non-linear storyline. On paper, it makes sense to film a movie about a man who ages backwards by cutting back and forth between the past and present, but this movie is chopped up with lengthy scenes of a dying, old woman, Julia Ormond, in a hospital bed talking to her granddaughter. These scenes do not advance the story, and all they serve to do is severely depress the audience as it's revealed the hospital is also a hurricane shelter as its inhabitants await Hurricane Katrina. The actual story has absolutely nothing to do with Hurricane Katrina, and I'll never understand why these sections were included. The running time of the film is quite long, clocking in at nearly three hours. Had all the modern scenes been cut, nothing would have been lost but the audience's boredom and propensity to look at their watches.The great parts of this movie are, of course, Brad Pitt's performance and the special effects team that helped transform him from an elder to a teenaged boy. When given the chance to act, he's always very good, and catching him between Ocean's Eleven movies is a treat. The premise of a man's entire life being robbed from him is tragic, but as he's abandoned by his family and raised by Taraji P. Henson, he's forced to make the best of things and take what he can from his unusual life. As a younger man (looking older), he meets a little girl. She grows up to be Cate Blanchett, and when they meet again when they're closer in age, they fall in love.If anyone's actually read F. Scott Fitzgerald's original short story, they'll realize this movie only took the title and the main character's strange aging affliction in its adaptation. The actual story is completely different. Cate Blanchett's character doesn't even exist - and neither do the modern hospital room scenes! Benjamin Button is not left on anyone's doorstop, but instead lives out as much of a normal life as he can and bonds with his father. However, screenwriter Eric Roth tried to pay homage to the classic author by naming the love interest Daisy, and by using language that sounded like Fitzgerald might write. The sequence that traces a car's tires all the way back to an inferior rubber batch at the factory sounds exactly like it came out of an F. Scott Fitzgerald story. Don't know what part of the movie I'm talking about? Then go rent it and find out. But keep your remote handy. Those modern scenes are so unnecessary.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Well worth my time,"Prior to viewing, I was mildly curious if I would be able to suspend reality enough to buy the premise of this movie. Soon into the movie, however, this became a non-issue, as I was mesmerized by the acting and the story. There is a sense of ease in this movie, both in the viewer's sense of time passing and in the story itself.The casting is perfect. Brad Pitt skilfully underplays his role in much the same way as in Mr. Black. Cate Blanchett is nothing short of superb as Daisy. The remainder of the characters are also richly cast, with notable performances by Tilda Swinton, Taraji P. Henson, and Jared Harris.If I had to sum up the theme of this movie, I would say that it is an unusual study in mortality. It is a very easy movie to watch - a richly told story that never drags. It is so rich with characters and events that I wondered if the entire story would wrap up in the long runtime of 2 hours 47 minutes.In summary, I wholeheartedly recommend this movie. I will probably view it again at some later date.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"A little long, reminds me of Forest Gump","The idea for the story is alright. Benjamin Button is born old and grows younger. Mentally, he ages normally, like any boy would. Physically he grows up from an infant to a full grown man, while growing younger in appearance. The acting is good as well. However, the show is about three hours long and a feels drug-out. I was getting restless for it to end. The movie reminds me of Forest Gump; the story of a unique person's life and experiences over the years. But, it's not quite Forest Gump caliber. There is more plot to the story than the simple narration of Benjamin's life, however. His story is told through his diary, as read to an old lady on her death bed in the hospital, by her daughter. What her connection to Benjamin is the story that slowly unfolds over the course of the movie. It becomes pretty clear where it's going halfway through.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"A bit slow moving at parts, but overall phenomenal film.","I'll start by saying this isn't a movie that will be liked by everyone. If you're a person who generally enjoys feel-good films that will cause you to leave the theater smiling, this isn't the one for you. Not to say the movie is bad; in fact, I'd almost say it's one of the best I've seen all year. Long, yes, but truly captivating.The movie's length may be a bit hard on a lot of people. It did get a little boring around parts, and some things could have been edited out, but the superb acting kept my attention. All the actors had good performances. The script was well written, and the cinematography was beautiful.This movie is very, very similar to Forrest Gump, or at least that's what I couldn't stop thinking as I watched it. If you liked that, you will probably like this. The premises are entirely different, but the sequence of events and storyline are noticeably similar.In conclusion, if you want a good movie that doesn't sanitize reality to make it seem better than it actually is, with an interesting story and good actors, this is the one for you. It does get a little tragic, but never depressing enough to make you break down and sob. I'd say more, but can't in fear I'd give something away.See this movie on a day when you're ready for something more than a lighthearted comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Fascinating trailer and emotional final scenes but....,"The performances are good and the aging effects impressive but I don't get what the film is about thematically. Passage of time? Irrelevance of age? How people enter and exit our lives? If the film were kept the same and the backwards aging gimmick removed, it really wouldn't change all that much. And the film would be completely forgettable really. But it's beautifully shot and Pitt and Blanchett are just as beautiful as its production values. One feels that with the right script tweaking it could have been something special.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
The Epic Bore of Benjamin Button ...,"My eyes have beheld TV episodes with much richer plots concentrated in less than sixty minutes of thrills or hilarity, sometimes dramas, sometimes comedies, always entertainments. But when they had to endure David Fincher's ""The Curious Case if Benjamin Button"" in the movie theater, I wished my popcorn box was a remote control so I could have the power to change the channel. Like Benjamin Button, I was doomed, forced to watch a fantasy biopic drama whose genre-bending atmosphere succeeded in elevating boredom to epic proportions.""Benjamin Button"" is the kind of films whose publicity relies on respectable arguments that turn out to be fallacious when you grasp the true content of the film. The film features Brad Pitt, who proved to make a great tandem with Fincher in the second half of the 90's. It starts with a creative concept, adapted from a short farce written by F. Scott Fitzgerald: a man whose life goes in reverse, born as an old person and getting younger as time goes by, talk about a 'wowing' concept, promising if it wasn't so scary. And the film is very long and is made like the kind of epic dramas that satisfy the tastes of the Academy members. But after watching ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" (damn, even the title is long), I found something distastefully pretentious not while watching the film, but after finishing it, as a second thought that never left me.I consciously use the word 'pretentious' because of the following dilemma: I wonder if the film overestimates our patience or underestimates our intelligence. Granted it has some qualities: the acting does justice to the believability of the story, with a honorable mention to the members of the nursing home where Button grew up, Brad Pitt takes his role seriously and does his best trying to convey the illusoriness of a life whose direction is in total opposition with all the other persons. And there is no doubt that the cinematography, photography, editing and directing, although not transcending, correctly serve their purpose to improve the awards nominations' statistics. But even the most appetizing plates can have an insipid taste, ""Button"" looks, sounds and feels great but it lacks something vital when it comes to movie making: writing. Eric Roth, who won the Oscar for ""Forrest Gump"", wrote the screenplay. When I learned that, another dilemma started teasing my mind: is it accidental or logical that the script here didn't work?I vote for logical. As original as the plot is, it needed a less ambitious format, yet Fincher stretches it for three endless hours starting the story from a deathbed flashback set right before the Hurricane Erika events, just to put the story in a chronological map and trace a clever parallel between Benjamin Button's life and history. It worked for ""Forrest Gump"", because he was a fitting character for that kind of narrative while Button's condition is a story in itself and can never distract from whatever happens in his life. Roth tried to rewrite the typical picaresque story like ""Forrest Gump"", I could also have mentioned ""Barry Lyndon"" or ""Little Big Man"" but in the case of Button, it quite simply doesn't work. I don't know if it could have worked anyway, maybe the film was victim of its own concept, after all: how can we possibly sense the profound effect the course of events has on us when our very conscience evolves from a sort of precocious wisdom to amnesia. Or maybe this is the key of Button's torment but since when does a handicap build empathy or cement a heroic status?The script tries to exploit Button's unique condition by framing it in a romance with a little girl who grew up to become the love of his life, Cate Blanchett as Daisy, an ambitious dancer, but Daisy is not Jenny, there was something quite unlikable in the way her ambition flirted with a sort of bitchy cockiness. Anyway, she never did it to me, although she inspired a very cleverly written sequence that seemed to belong to another film, if only half of ""Button"" shared this quality. But no, the rest of the film was a bunch of redundancies enrobed with boring existential torments stretched like a chewing gum until it loses its taste. While it could have been adapted in an entertaining way, the film is just an assemblage of many little episodes deprived from emotions and scream for Oscar nominations  did I use the word 'pretentious'?I couldn't escape from the uncomfortable feeling that ""Benjamin Button"" was just a wannabe Forrest Gump, that recycled many plot clichés that would have been unnoticed if the movie found the time to be entertaining, instead of filling it with pointless gimmicks and situations that don't go anywhere, damn even the encounter with the father who abandoned him left me cold, when I expected an emotional Himalaya, I got a hill. No seriously, ""Benjamin Button"" could have been subtitled ""How to Make Best Picture nominees for Dummies"", in terms of casting, of story, of writing, of cinematography, of editing, everything is handled with a remarkable marketed precision, but at the end, all you have is an empty creation whose emotional core again required less than one hour and half to grab the interest, ""Memento"" or ""Groundhog Day"", movies based on similar concepts, had the common decency to be short.And the film features probably the most badly written concluding lines in recent history, with the whole ""Some people do this and some people do that"" when it finished with the sight of Blanchett dancing and the monologue ended with "" and some people just dance."" I was like ""give me a break"", if that is the punch line of the whole thing, it means that just because we watched characters talking and acting during three hours, Fincher took our empathy for granted, and that also is pretentious.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
One of the best narration based film I have seen,"There are movies which would make you laugh. There are movies which would make you cry. There are also movies, which would inspire, there are some which would raise your hidden romanticism for a while. But there are certain movies, which, however hard one tries to qualify, would feel that the effort keeps falling short of what it deserves and makes you feel that if you hadn't watched it, your life would be a failure. I had a few such movies in my personal and recommended list, Shawshank Redemption, Forrest Gump, Crash and others. After watching this movie, I had no doubt that the list is going to be increased by a unit.One of the key strong points, I felt about this movie, is the way it has been narrated. Shawshank Redemption was one such movie, which had produced such brilliant narration skills. Certain events were shown in the film, and along with that via narration analogies were drawn and often conclusions were derived, an add-on feature that enriched those particular sequence of events and makes you remember them for a long time. This combination of scene and narration was observed on several occasions in the course of the movie. One such occasion was the description of the accident of Daisy Williams ( Cate Blanchett) which describes a full sequence of events leading to the outcome. Another was the narration that followed when Benjamin carried his dying father to the porch to see the the rising sun. I feel that after this film, Brad Pitt has joined the group of elite actor narrators of the Hollywood industry which includes Morgan Freeman, Robin Williams and Tom Hanks.A very unique aspect of the film is that, it moves along according to a description as provided in a diary written by one person, but often that is intersected by a few comments or description of another person who is an important subject of the description provided by the first. While Daisy was being read to by her daughter, the event in which Benjamin had come all the way to France to meet her in hospital, Daisy throws her own comments saying that she was very rude to him; the scene continues where her daughter reads from the diary that Benjamin didn't immediately fly back, but used to visit the hospital without informing Daisy, hearing which Daisy said that she didn't know that fact. So, as it could be seen, Daisy, an important subject of the contents of the diary, adds values to the main theme of the movie by providing certain information not present in the diary, simultaneously realizing certain facts she didn't quite know earlier.The movie begins with a short event description by Daisy, about a clock, that was made by a person, a clock where the time moves backwards. This becomes the central theme of the entire movie. The movie ends showing how one fine day, that clock got replaced signifying that the story about the subject who was born old and died young has finally come to an end. The powerful and unique script of this movie, the very concept of age decreasing with time is of its own an enigmatic one. One of the many reasons, a film is liked by the audience is that they wish to see something new out of it, something that is quite unique, intriguing, something they have never seen before and keeps them riveted to the seat. The movie with its core concept of age reversal with time provides the audience with that exact recipe, it's taste enhanced with the spice of brilliant narration, dialogs and a better as usual performance by two most talented actors in Hollywood. One point however, in the movie, which might steal a few points from its credit is the pace or movement of its event sequences. At times it did appear that the movie is actually going slow, and that it's duration should have been lesser by 20-25 mins. Also the effect of the storm, didn't actually add to any significance of any kind and was something vestigial.I would suggest people watch this movie at least twice in order to extract the complete effect it has to offer. Such films happen after long time, and eventually does turn into a classic because it touches the human heart, goes deep inside it and brings out the emotions thereby making the audience feel for it, remember it and make them think that in a busy life, a two hour forty min was not wasted.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"

"Great cinematography, bit length though","The first time I saw the trailer for this I was reeled in. In fact this is so totally the kind of story I love I am surprised I waited until it came out on DVD.Starring Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt, the film starts with Daisy (Blanchett) on her death bed while her daughter (Julia Ormond) reads from Benjamin's diary. In this we learn of Benjamin's life, loves and travels while Daisy desperately holds on to the end.Amidst the Armitice Days celebrations Benjamin's mother dies while giving birth to him. Thinking his son is a monster his father a wealthy Button factory owner abandons him on the doorstep where Queenie, a kind woman who is unable to have children of her own takes him in and loves him as her own. Despite being born in the body of a dying old man Benjamin defies the odds and grows younger while all of his loved ones grow older around him.We learn of how Daisy and Benjamin came to meet for the first time at the retirement home where Benjamin lived. Daisy as a child visiting her Grandmother sees Benjamin as an old man and instantly they take to each other. While the idea is that he is a child in an old mans body it is still a little creepy that they fall in love on their first meeting. She is still a child and he is essentially an old man.Based on the short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald the film has a touch of other films such Forest Gump, Jack and Forever Young, 3 films that really work for me and I loved. The only thing that let the film down was it's length. At nearly 3 hours I found myself getting distracted from the story a little and looking at the time. Despite this I watched the entire film, gladly at home and not in the cinema!

entertains while being surprisingly relevant and unshallow,"""Life isn't measured in minutes, but in moments"" is the exacting tagline of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and while the fantastic story of a man that ages backwards (the titular character played by Brad Pitt) is hard to swallow, it entertains while being surprisingly relevant and unshallow.The versatile David Fincher, who also directed Pitt in Fight Club and Se7en, made Benjamin Button as lengthy as his other fab film Zodiac, but he keeps you occupied with the sumptuous visual design and smoothly executed special effects that don't steal the characters' thunder. After all, it's the cast that not only assured box-office draw but also made sure that you are emotionally engaged.It's difficult not to feel for each one of them. As his life is played all throughout, you will share in Benjamin's curiosity and innocence. You will feel the frustration, heartbreak and devotion of his lifelong love Daisy (played by the marvelously chameleonic Cate Blanchett). Julia Ormond's thespic skills didn't seem necessary though as Daisy's daughter Caroline, but Taraji P. Henson deserves a best supporting actress nod for her moving portrayal as Queenie. Also praiseworthy is Tilda Swinton's short but impactful performance as Benjamin's first lover Elizabeth.You will watch it for the commercial appeal but you will come out of the theater hopefully more aware and grateful for each moment you have with your loved ones.

Great Movie,"I just got back from watching this with myself and a few friends as the second of six movies I was seeing for my birthday (This follows the Disney film ""Bedtime Stories"") and I was amazed at the skill and heart put into the film.First of all, this is based of the incredible short story of the same name written by F. Scott Fitsgerald written in the 1920's and the movie follows his words so well and makes them into one of the finest movies (I would say it was in the top 10) of the year and possible the decade.

They share a great on screen presence and I would certainly like if they teamed up again in a future picture.The storyline is a big one, they all take defining moments of ones life and what one can expect to go through in life and really look at this through the eyes of another, who, by chance cant witness things like he would want to.Overall, this is a fantastic film and I will definitely watch it again.

Beautifully Enchanting Epic,"'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is, in every sense of the word, a devastatingly beautiful epic. Inspired by the F. Scott Fitzgerald story and brought to life by the masterful David Fincher, this majestic tale of a man who travels through life aging backwards strikes a special note. With a hint of wonderment and magic, 'Benjamin Button' quietly becomes one of the year's best films. A bizarre but entrancing look at life, death, and everything in between.The beauty of 'Benjamin Button' is far-reaching. Technically, it's practically flawless. Fincher has constructed a film so visually arresting and aesthetically pleasing. The film leaps from the screen like a vivid, colorful dream. It takes us on a journey through time, understood through the eyes of a man who was born under rather extraordinary circumstances. Despite his curious nature, Benjamin is not a hero. His uniqueness does not offer any groundbreaking insights into the gift of life. He is, like you and me, an imperfect being. Living life the best way he knows how, head-on. Quite literally, actually.Though the film tops nearly three hours, 'Benjamin Button' feels anything but. Though it builds gradually, Fincher's ability to tell a story is like few others. With an excellent pace, this sprawling ode to life will captivate you even if you have to sit in the very front row of a sold-out theater. Glued to your seat, you'll simply stare in wonder at this beautiful picture. As it progresses, the life of Benjamin Button sweeps us off our feet as we follow him around the world. Never staying anywhere for too long, but always touched by individuals walking - sometimes swimming - on their own path of life.If there's one aspect of 'Benjamin Button' that keeps it from being a heartfelt masterpiece, it's that it does come off cold and distant at times. It's hard to say why, but it's as if we're only allowed to watch at arm's length. It may just be that Fincher has never dared to tackle a film of this magnitude. Like so many, he may still be learning. But one thing is certain, the film never manages to be anything less than richly enchanting and wonderfully told. Adapted for the screen by Eric Roth, 'Button' never falls victim to melodrama, which may have very well rendered this picture as one hot mess. And if you find the resemblance to 'Forest Gump' striking, Roth also wrote the script for that sprawling journey, but remember that Fitzgerald penned his short story back in 1921.Every performance found here is, of course, fantastic. Brad Pitt delivers one of the best performances of the career, a challenging and thought-provoking role. His transformation throughout the film is so well-done and convincing. Cate Blanchett is beautifully cast, and though her character is not always likable, her involvement benefits the film greatly. The performance, however, doesn't come from either of these two leads. Taraji P. Henson, who plays the woman who raises Benjamin as his own, delivers a strikingly passionate performance that's profoundly touching.Ultimately, 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' comes full circle to transcend convention and rises as a lyrical celebration of life. It leaves us with a touching and - finally - emotional exitlude. It affirms imperfect nature of us all, the individual quirks that make us who we are. It confronts death, not as the enemy, but so we appreciate how important those people were to us. We're told that it's never too late to be who we were meant to be. If we're not happy, start over. If we fail, try again. Life is what you make of it, the choices you make and what you choose to do with the time that's been given. Live with no regrets, and embrace the magic and of it all.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
"A Brilliant, Powerful, Unforgettable Masterpiece Of A Film","The premise seemed hollow and I'd heard that the film was very L O N G. Wow -- was I surprised. I was transfixed by the richness of the imagery and the resonance of the characterizations. Every performance in the film -- right down to each and every bit player - flawless! I haven't seen that in a long, long time. We expect Cate Blanchett to be brilliant but I was amazed to find Brad Pitt in the zone as well. He does the most amazing job of playing this unusual, demanding role with quiet understatement ... subtle yet so completely ""present"". It becomes clear fairly soon that the odd premise is a clever device for examining some of the deepest reflections about what life is ... and what it is not. And it works completely -- the reverse aging novelty allows for a fresh take on just about everything we might have previously thought -- about living and dying -- and about deep personal relationships.There is so much here! I feel like I've gotten to see four or five great films for the price of one! It didn't seem at all long to me - - in fact, I'd look forward to an even more fabulous directors cut, if there is one. The story line is dazzling -- it's a wonderful ride, full of the highest and lowest adventures of youth and age. And the images are unforgettable: a scarred leg slipped inside a silk stocking ... a mysterious female face shaded by a wide-brimmed hat ... and on and on. There's naval battle scene that's incredibly short -- yet I have never felt such pure, dark, deadly evil -- and such physical vulnerability as I did in that scene. Everything works -- all the wardrobe -- every set -- superbly designed and visually managed. For years David Fincher has been in high demand for directing high-class commercials, where every frame is routinely produced to perfection. No one ever thought you could hold to such standards in a 2 to 3 hour feature film but Fincher seems to do it routinely now.I would imagine the director happened to read this great novel and wanted to take on the daunting challenge of transforming it into a great film. Most would say ""impossible"". In the past, movies that follow a character over a lifetime have usually broken the part down for three different actors -- one plays the child, one plays the youth, and one more plays the adult. And there is invariably a huge jolt when the actors changeover. Well, being so focused on the aging process, this story obviously required a lot more than three versions of the character. Reportedly the film took a year to shoot -- and two more years to get the face of Brad Pitt onto all the other Benjamins. For me it works seamlessly.This is not your feel-good movie of the year. This is not your latest thrills and spills blockbuster. If that's your thing, look elsewhere. But if you enjoy and appreciate meaningful, memorable, epic motion pictures -- in the tradition of The English Patient, Lawrence Of Arabia, and Citizen Kane -- you will be challenged and you will be moved. Great films stay with you forever -- this is a great film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Exactly like Forrest Gump in every way,"They were written by the SAME PERSON!!! So, each being similar in subject matter and theme, the two films play out almost identically.The overall plot structure in Benjamin Button is the same as in Gump. The film opens with a very old woman in the hospital telling her life story to her daughter, in the same way that Forrest sits on the bench and tells his. She has in her possession the journal of Benjamin Button and when the daughter starts reading each section the action cuts back to then, the overall story being one about one humble man experiencing the 20th Century in the United States while he and his heart's desire cross paths over and over again. I guess it works well enough as a framing device, but in terms of entertainment, Button is just not as fun and Forrest Gump. Both films try to add humor with a bunch of non-sequitur stuff, like, for example, an old man describing all the times he was struck by lightning (accompanied by intentionally ghetto film of it, because apparently someone followed him around his whole life and filmed him and just HAPPENED to film him when he was struck), and its just not funny after a while. This film is more intent on moving you with images and movement than Forrest Gump was.This is a really long movie, and its mostly enjoyable but MAN it drags in certain spots. Also, it spends its greatest moment 5 minutes in, in which a scene from WWI is played backwards (you've probably seen this in the trailers). When i saw that i thought that nothing could possibly be better, and i was right.The effects and the films look are great though. They did a great job making brad pitt look really old, but also making him look 15 years younger. The same goes for cate blanchett but i think that was just traditional makeup on her, instead of the fancy computer stuff on brad.Overall, it was OK. I felt really weird being there in the theater because the last hour is a pure brad pitt ogling-fest, but looking back the effects and detail in the movie are really great and make it worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
Definitely not for everybody...,"I must say that I really enjoyed this movie. While I most certainly didn't like it as much as Slumdog Millionaire (which was a definite crowd pleaser), Button carried with it a great message about love and death that will resonate with me. The story in its entirety is good although I might revise a few scenes to create an alternate ending. While watching it, I truly didn't realize that it was nearly 3 hours long because the story engaged me. There's no doubt that the audience knows and can somewhat predict how the story ends yet, for some reason, I was compelled to sit back and watch the true outcome of Benjamin's life. There is no doubt that movie was somewhat over-hyped due to it's A-list cast. Cate Blanchett does gives a great performance and so does Brad Pitt and even Tilda Swinton yet it didn't move me in any particular way. Button reminded me of a Forest Gump combined with Big Fish and if you didn't like either one of those movies, I suggest that you stay clear away from this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Fantasy, Romance"
