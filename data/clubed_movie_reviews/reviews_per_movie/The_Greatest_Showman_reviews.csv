"Initially avoided this movie, but when I watched it I felt like an idiot.","To start off this review I'd like to say that before I ever watched this movie I had the opinion that it was going to be rubbish, solely because of how blown up the movie was. Everywhere I went it was ""The Greatest Showman"". I thought that perhaps it would be a mediocre film at best, blown out of proportion by a craze.Boy was I wrong. Even at the beginning of the movie you are thrown straight into the extravagance of what the movie was about to become. What is basically the story of a simple man becoming a legend in the show-business, is the most flamboyant and breath-taken musical movie I've seen. The soundtrack for this movie is beyond brilliant. Having been impressed by Hugh Jackman's vocals in Les Miserable I was not surprised he pulls it out of the bag in this movie yet again. But Zac Efron really stood out in this movie and that truly surprised me.When you finish this movie you will have the great songs stuck in your head, and you will be fully satisfied having finished the movie, your next plan will likely be getting the soundtrack and reliving the magic all over again.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Better than I expected.,This was the perfect family night movie. I loved the music although at first I thought it would be annoying. I enjoyed the scenes and the costumes and everything about this magical film. I would definitely watch it again.,8.0,Anonymous,Biography
This is ... me/you/it,"I'm not a fan of musicals in general. Really I mostly can't see their appeal, but from time to time, I do find myself really enjoying one of them, especially if they are as well done as this. And the mid piece/song ""This is me"" is so good .. excellent! Superb! Any other great word you can think of. I had goosebumps listening to it.Every song has its purpose (still of course you can question the why people would start just sing and dance as if they had choreographed it in advance - well they have, but you know what I mean) and it works. Be it the comedy numbers (Hugh and Zac in one instance in a bar just to name one example) or as dramatic pieces. Hugh has so much fun it transcends the screen ... if you are way worse with Musicals than me, maybe don't watch it .. otherwise give it a shot! But most definitely do listen to the song ""This is me"" ... phenomenal!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"As Soon As It Was Over, I Wanted to See It Again","I love the circus. I love quality cinema. Not since Billy Rose's Jumbo (1962) has a motion picture so successfully combined these two elements. I wouldn't be surprised if it won the same awards as Cecil B. DeMille's The Greatest Show on Earth (1952). Michael Gracey skillfully brought together the best music, choreography, cast, cinematography, visual effects, costumes, and set decoration I have seen in recent years, all fresh and original, and integrated them into nothing short of a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Critics are Wrong,"I have never written a movie review but I couldn't let this jewel of a movie be slammed by the cynical critics without saying how much I loved it. This was the perfect movie for our family on Christmas Day. Don't pay attention to the ""professional"" reviews; judge by the moviegoers who are praising the movie. It was moving, upbeat, and romantic. Can't say enough good things about it. Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, and Zendaya are all so talented. Go see it in the theater to really appreciate how magical this movie is.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Birthday Surprise,"Sunday was my niece's birthday. 16. I invited her and two of her friends to do whatever they wanted. They chose to stay home, eat cake and watch The Greatest Showman on HBO and I thought Oh no. But, I had cake with them and sat to watch this Michael Gracy, who? Michael Gracy to see the story of PT Barnum with Hugh Jackman. Sentimental and pretty, yes but also, engrossing, moving, beautiful and structured in such a way that doesn't fall into the usual biopic traps. It moves at a breathless pace with smart and unexpected transitions. Hugh Jackman is great and Michelle Williams truthful to a fault. She's never less than that. What a wonderful actress. Zac Effron gives, what it may very well be, his most convincing performance and the Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson was a revelation to me. The script by Jenny Bicks and the remarkable Bill Condon tells a classic tale with contemporary rhythms and contemporary pace. Needless to say, I enjoyed it much more that I could possibly had imagine. So, thank you Lilli, happy 16!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Forget the critics - Just enjoy the movie,"As usual, the critics fail to grasp the obvious. Does the movie entertain? Yes, it does. Absolutely. Sure, it may not match the real story, and many things are not based in reality, but that's the point! It's a movie! It is a fun musical, very well done and enjoyable.If it was a made up story about John G. Pigglestack, then the critics would have nothing to complain about. I actually likes this much better than La La Land. Guess it's more upbeat. Musicals are a rare breed. Enjoy them while you can.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Unique Presentation Befitting Barnum Himself,"The success of ""La La Land"" opened Hollywood up to the musical again, and ""The Greatest Showman"" is able to take full advantage. While traditionally the story of P.T. Barnum would be told as a biopic, here it is given a flourish that perhaps the old ringmaster himself would appreciate.For a basic plot summary, ""Greatest Showman"" tells the story of how P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman) built his circus empire. This was largely accomplished by using ""freaks"" (bearded lady, dog-faced boy, etc.) to draw curiosity to his museum and later shows. Though initially deemed as catering to the ""lowest common denominator"", Barnum's shows eventually won over the hearts of people (especially children) around the world. Also focused on in this flick is Barnum's marriage to Charity (Michelle Williams) and partnership with Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron).By positioning itself in the way that it does, ""Greatest Showman"" only deflects any criticism that can be thrown at it. Not entirely indicative of Barnum's life? The man himself would revel in the drama! Too over-the-top or schmaltzy? Have you ever been to the circus?! In this sense, the film is practically immune to harsh takes.In terms of execution, the music is wonderful and the visuals are stunning and always offering something new. The tone is a good mix between relentless energy, but also being able to slow down and appreciate the softer moments when needed. The ability to accomplish this makes for high emotion with every song.The cast is about as diverse as a circus show itself, what with the eclectic mix of Jackman, Williams Efron, Zendaya, & Rebecca Ferguson. They all perform very well and create a great chemistry on the screen.Personally, ""Greatest Showman"" will never be among my favorite films of all-time. I actually prefer a more straightforward, character-drama biopic approach. However, I can very easily see the appeal of the musical tact here, and enjoyed it enjoy to be thoroughly entertained. If you are more open to this crazier approach than I, the star ranking will likely tick even higher.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Surpassed My Expectations,"This is possibly one of the best films I have ever seen in this genre.
From the start to finish, I felt that there was some inaudible and invisible metronome setting the overall pace of the film, a consistent rhythm within many rhythms, if that makes sense. Everything about this film had perfect timing. Editing was seamless. Attention to detail was mind blowing, costumes outstanding. Special effects... whoa. Acting was flawless. I really can't find anything to criticize. 
To summarize in a sentence, first class family entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A work of art,"I love, love, love the movie/musical genre, so I really do want to rate this high. There should be so much more of this. I appreciate that this movie feels like a carefully planned artwork of image, song and dance choreography, and that it dares to be little theatrical. Storywise it's admittedly a bit flimsy, but still fun to watch. Would have been even better if I felt more drawn into the story and if that second song (with the young boy singing) wasn't so cringe worthy. The effects where the movie had a theatre-like vibe made this movie especially fun to watch, just wish they added that even more consistently throughout. All and all fun for movie/musical fanatics, and probably not so much if you dislike cheesy song and dance.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!,"It has been SO long since a movie/musical made me feel so...HAPPY!
This movie is absolutely FANTASTIC! Everything from the incredible, toe-tapping, music to the heartfelt, dream-filled, story-line! I was so immersed in the movie that at some point I totally forgot I was sitting in a packed theater on Christmas Night! I'll even admit that I broke the cardinal rule and actually turned on my cell phone to download the the ENTIRE soundtrack while still in the theater...and I was only two songs in!! I will also admit that I am a 42yr old who left that theater feeling like a little kid again, wishing that I can twirl my way to the car without being looked at as crazy! LOL!! I've already seen it twice in as many days, and I plan on seeing it TONS more until I can own it for myself! It is DEFINITELY a movie that you have to experience in a theater though, so PLEASE ignore the snub-nosed critics and go see this magical film! You won't regret it!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good Choreography but Sloppy Story,"A musical movie about P.T. Barnum told with all great reverence to P.T. Barnum, featuring P.T. Barnum's Museum of Curiosities...so why not just make ""Barnum"" the stage musical? The answer to that question seems to be because then they couldn't get the guys from La La Land to do the music; fair enough. But if director Michael Gracey and screenwriter Jenny Bicks were set on custom making this celebration of glitz, chicanery and humbug they could have at least opted for a little more connective tissue.The Greatest Showman is a movie in moments, many of them great many more of them flaccid and empty. We're whisked through P.T.'s (Jackman) impoverished childhood in a single bound before settling on his happy marriage with wife Charity (Williams), and his two daughters (Johnson and Seely) who have grown to see their father as a hero. Tired of working to scrounge up a meager living, Barnum embarks on a risky entertainment venture and in due time, recruits his circus of curiosities and freaks.From that point on, the film's narrative relies heavily on its skin-deep celebration of acceptance and diversity. This is while it chugs along through Barnum's life from his start as a full-time huckster, to his falling out with Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind (Ferguson). And while it would have been nice to say that the movie does a good job of linking theme with plot, I'm sorry to say none of it becomes a cohesive whole.This is not entirely the fault of the filmmakers. I mean turning P.T. Barnum's life into a celebration of kindness and humanity is like using William 'Boss' Tweed as a symbol for New York pride. This film being a musical, I was not expecting something exacting, but I was expecting at the very least a keen acknowledgement that the legacy of P.T. Barnum isn't all razzle-dazzle. Yet this film makes him out to look like a saint; a man of untold potential who uses ""truthful hyperbole"" to provide for his loving family - A man of conviction, of love and of just wanting to put a smile on your face.Framed in virtually any other way, Barnum would be the villain - enticing his young protégé Phillip (Efron) to ""live a little,"" and abandon his family to come join the circus. Belittling a theater critic with insults masquerading as flaccid, fortune cookie, self-help wisdom and enticing circus ""freaks"" to stand out and express themselves while closing the door on them the moment he's among the rich and famous. The film's show-stopping tune ""This is Me"" takes place at this moment but because the film is too scared to make its hero anything more complicated than a fancily folded cocktail napkin, the moment feels like the side characters are just letting off steam.What ultimately saves this movie from being a complete waste of a Saturday night is the choreography. Every poppy show tune and love ballad brings with it entire body shots of twirling, leaping perfection, conjuring memories of the physical feats of the cast of West Side Story (1961). Not satisfied with the traditional, the film continues to build its momentum with incredibly fancy footwork and some truly death defying trapeze choreography on the part of Zendaya and Zac Efron.There's imagination in the frame and a lot of it, but largely due to the film's complete inability to marry subject with tone, The Greatest Showman is far from great. Rather than being a worthy successor to Moulin Rouge! (2001) this picture winds up feeling like Newsies (1992) without a Crutchy. And let's face it; the only thing we really remember about that movie was there was a character named Crutchy.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A sugar rush,"Quite a frustrating film. The musical numbers are far and away its strongest attribute, which is obviously what any good musical should strive for. Although they aren't all showstoppers, there are some genuinely excellent sequences with tight, kinetic editing, great rhythmic camera movements, and vibrant choreography. The first proper musical number that acts as a prologue to Barnum's life was quite impressive with its fluid execution and ability to convey a large amount of information in a short period of time (which ironically is a quality that ends up being to the film's detriment when viewed as a whole... more on that later). Jackman's and Efron's bar duet is another fun and energetic sequence with a lot of cool camerawork and infectious energy. Essentially all of the songs are pleasant, catchy, and memorable as well, if a bit vanilla.The strength of these musical sequences is enough to save the film from being bad, and is even almost enough to outweigh the many, many flaws... but not quite. Firstly, the film is attractive to look at to be sure, but it is at times so incredibly glossy that it feels like you're watching a shampoo or jewelry commercial. Sure, it's going for that fairy tale feel, but at times the sheen and shimmer is a little too blinding. And that high-gloss polish is a symptom of a much deeper problem: the incredibly superficial quality of the story and its characters. It's disappointing because this story is genuinely interesting and has the potential for a lot of moral exploration that is completely passed over. Again, I get that this is a musical and a family film, but that doesn't mean it has to be vapid and stupid (see: La La Land). I found it extremely troubling that the film completely ignored the moral quandary of whether Barnum was helping these ""unique"" people, or exploiting them for his own fame and fortune. These characters never even question his intent, viewing the situation as Barnum helping to ""put them out there"", gain them social acceptance, and create a ""family"", where in reality they're quite clearly being taken advantage of in a way that is arguably more reprehensible morally than the protesters who mock them. It's a truly glaring omission from the film that saps so much potential substance from the story.Contributing to the superficial feeling of the film is another all-to common problem that modern American family films suffer from: the pacing is way too fast. It's like the studios are afraid people will be bored by their films, and thus they design them to speed through plot points and character development in a way that ends up suffocating the life from it. Sure this approach makes the film feel lively and exciting, but it also robs it of actual, meaningful character interactions and development. The result is a film that feels like all dessert and no main course - a bowl of chocolate ice cream sure tastes great but it's no substitute for a satiating meal.Another nitpick that bothered me enough that I have to mention it: why is a renowned 19th Century opera singer belting out a Celine Dion-esque pop tune for an adoring ""high brow"" audience in a classic theater? That scene was almost laughable in its absurdity. And although it was by far the worst offender, I would say in general the music in the film, while catchy, did clash somewhat with the period.Honestly, I really should be giving this film a lower score. Somehow I enjoyed it quite a bit even in the face of the many fundamental issues, which is a testament to the strength of the best sequences. Still this is a deeply flawed film that, for all its visual splendor and admittedly intoxicating energy, amounts to little more than a sugar rush.Strong 2.5/5",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hugh Jackman Singing and Dancing. Need I say more?,"I have watched this film approximately twenty or more times. That is in no way an exaggeration and I may be low-calling it. Sometimes, I just have it on in the background while I work out or in the morning or while getting ready for work or I play it while cooking in the evening.On a couple of occasions, I've even caught my boyfriend humming the tunes. To say the songs stick with you, is an understatement.In fact, we've listened and watched it so much, that on every 20th Century Fox Movie ""opening"" sequence on any and all other subsequent 20th Century Fox movies we've watched, I automatically think of this one, and I am half expecting to see and hear the ""Ah, ah, ahhh, ahh ..."" and Hugh Jackman with his low ""Ladies and Gents . . . "". 
 
Besides having a catchy and moving soundtrack, the film itself is a wonder to look at. The cinematography is beautiful, the costumes are well-done, and again, come on: HUGH JACKMAN singing and dancing. What could be better?Well, for one, not better, but almost as great, is Rebecca Ferguson as Jenny Lind. The lady is gorgeous, and while she actually doesn't sing her rendition of ""Never Enough"" (Loren Allred does), the passion and zeal she brings to her onstage performance, is one for the books. I could literally (and have) replay that one scene over and over. Zac Efron and Hugh Jackman also have a duet which is fun and witty and very creatively done.The only reason I did not give it a ""10"", is probably an unpopular view, and I know I will amass a hugh (not a typo :)) number of thumbs down, but oh well: I did not care for Zendaya AT ALL. I think she was so very miscast. I do not think she looked pretty in the film (although after filming, I saw her giving a couple of interviews and she looked beautiful); I thought she had absolutely zero chemistry with Zac Efron; and lastly, both her acting and her voice are like chalk grating on a blackboard to me. I think Logan Browning would have been cuter in the role. That's just me though, although it did affect my thoughts on the film and my score.All in all, WATCH IT if you have not yet done so. It is beautiful to look at and a (modern) masterpiece to the ears.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

too little variety in the music,"The Greatest Showman is fast-moving, well-paced, colorful, and easy to follow. It's worth seeing, but its faults are significant. The songs are all in just one musical style, and it's the same style as in La La Land, and I found the lack of variety tiring. (OTOH, if you like the breathy style of current pop music, you will like the movie a lot more than I did.)I knew it was a fictional takeoff on Barnum's life, so I didn't mind hearing Jenny Lind singing songs composed for the movie. But giving her a weak and breathy voice, instead of the clear and brilliant voice that helped make her so famous, was a step too far. Over 300 credits in Special Effects speaks to an over-reliance on FX at the expense of performance, and that fits my overall impression.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Never Enough,"Same lyricists as La La Land (one of my favorite films of all time)? Hugh Jackman going back to his musical roots? A musical surrounding around a circus with plenty of bombastic visuals and acts? Count me in. My interest in The Greatest Showman kept growing with every trailer and TV spot I saw. The final product is a crowd pleasing but ultimately disappointingly bland and cheesy musical loosely based on the infamous P.T. Barnum.Let me start off by talking about the things I liked. The music is fantastic and nothing short of inspirational and surprisingly moving. Everything from the opening number which sees Barnum as a young boy imagining a ""Greatest Show"", to the jaw-dropping ballad ""Never Enough"", to the likely Oscar winner ""This is Me"", and to my favorite track ""A Million Dreams"". The music is undeniably catchy and exactly what a movie like this needs. In fact, I could have used the film to have more numbers and be closer to a traditional all-sung musical rather than a musical number every scenes. So even though I didn't care for the rest of the film, the numbers are worth the price of admission alone.My main problem with the film, which seems to be a lot of people's issue, is that every single problem that comes up gets solved within minutes. This film is all about struggle and coming from nothing to achieve your dreams. A universal and worthy theme in any type of movie, but it only works if you can experience the struggle along with the triumph. Unfortunately, the story is muddied with plenty of character struggles that create obstacles for the protagonists, but are merely brushed aside a few minutes later with a quick scene.It's also worth noting just how cheesy this film is. I don't like using that term loosely, especially since I usually appreciate ""good cheesiness in films"". Heck there's plenty of musicals I've seen that have a charming cheese to them. But when a film has inconsequential struggles and contrived plot points, it's hard to get passed moments of pure unnecessary cheese. The film has grown on me a little bit since I saw it a few days back, with the soundtrack being the overwhelming reason for me rating this is as a positive review. If I could watch only the musical numbers and skip past every other scene, I think I would buy it on blu-ray.6.0/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A mediocre, forgettable film!","The Greatest Showman, directed by Michael Gracey, is a star-studded musical which blesses our eyes with Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Zendaya
The movie starts with the character of Hugh Jackman, P.T Barnum, as a poor child who dreams of making it big to marry the girl of his dreams, Charity - the daughter of the man that he works for
As it progresses, we see P.T marry Charity and have two wonderful daughters all the while trying to make it big to prove Charity's father that he's a husband worthy of having. P.T has an idea of opening a museum, which fails but her daughters suggest that his museum needs more life and ""alive"" things. So, P.T auditions for people with unique characteristics that will attract audiences and sees his museum transform into a circus. 
Now there are some technical and narrative problems in the overall film. To begin with, there is a clear lack of depth in plot and story. For instance, the film ditches exploring various characters' lives. For instance, it barely skims over the main plot points to give us a summarised, not to mention historically inaccurate, view of P.T Barnum's life. So what could have been an adventure of a film, the writers instead chose to make it appeal to a mass-audience and in the process gave us a hardly memoriable story. 
Secondly, I can't help but say it, that the movie uses its songs only to tighten it grip on the audiences' attention. The musical numbers were forgettable, loud and for the most part glossy. Although, the choreography was decent if not brilliant. 
The fact that most of the acting performances were too sweet-mouthed and cringy also never helped TGS's cause. Zac Efron managed to shine, Zendaya as well, but Hugh Jackman gave a very ordinary performance and relied on his star power for the most part. Most dialogues were melodramatic and the presence of the extras struggled to contribute to the feel-goody nature of the film. The screenplay had some cliched plot points: a love triangle; the rise, fall and eventual rise of P.T Barnum. The predictability created disinterest and caused the film to fall flat on its wheels by the time the painfully long third act even began.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Musical for the Masses,"It's hard to come up with something that hasn't already been said. Are critics are wrong? Yes. Does it have great music? Absolutely. Will you want to watch it again and again? Almost certainly. The entire cast does phenomenally well singing and dancing and for many, this achievement will be the first line in their biographies. It's a musical that is generally inspiring and evokes good feelings, but still takes you on an emotional journey. It's far from a documentary on P.T. Barnum, but that's not it's purpose. As someone obsessed with Hamilton to the point where I listened to the soundtrack everyday for 2 years before seeing it live on Broadway, I avoided watching this one because I just assumed it couldn't even come close. I was wrong. I'm not saying it's better than Hamilton or even as good because I don't think anything will ever be, but The Greatest Showman is definitely a modern classic that earns a place on the list of must-see musicals. Despite its 19th century setting, the songs are fresh, modern, up-beat numbers that can only be described as instant classics. Just try NOT singing along, I dare you. This is not an old school musical like West Side Story or The Sound of Music; it's very modern in the best sense of the word. The choreography and dancing are also first rate and the movie engages you and sweeps you along so well that by the end, you won't even believe it's been an hour and forty-five minutes. I could watch this weekly and never tire of it. Rather than the critics, trust the viewer reviews, the box office numbers, and the fact that it stayed popular in theaters for so long, they had to forcibly pull it before it's popularity waned because the DVD was about to drop and the streaming deals were about to kick in. If you've ever seen a single musical you liked, you're sure to love this one. If you've never enjoyed a musical before, the. this may be the one to bring you into the fold.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant moments but incoherent storytelling,"I truly feel that there was a missed opportunity here with the greatest showman, it had great talent, music, costume design and an overall aura that feels like an extravaganza yet somehow it still falls short.If you have seen the trailer you have likely already seen the film, there were brilliant songs and likeable characters for sure but at the end of the day the storytelling was horrendously lacking. Which is as I have said a terrible shame seeing as there was a brilliant story about acceptance and prejudice right there yet the film never seems to fully capitalize. Much like Barnum's circus was described by the characters in this film this film is definitely likeable but at the end of the day, a cheesy, popcorn shoving flick.This film can also be described as a series of single moments of brilliance, when the film really utilized the musical aspects it really presents these visually stunning scenes yet, outside of those moments this is a very spotty film with an incoherent narrative. Indeed, the film seems to jump from scene to scene, moment to moment without any worthwhile character development or motive and without establishing much story points.While the movie had characters that were physically fleshed out and unique they weren't given much time for characterization except for few individual characters, as a result many of the characters seem more like caricatures then characters with personality and heart, which is something that the film truly needs. It almost seems like because the characters were so individually stylized physically they didn't see a need to narratively build their characters.Then again, those moments and bursts of energy in the film were just so well done that makes the film something that cannot be simply dismissed, a true shame. The greatest showman thrives at depicting the human spirit and tenacity yet fails to deliver a story with a coherent story and focus. But in there somewhere is a great film that sadly was not what the end result was. If the greatest showman could better build to character revelations and the main romance story with meatier character motives that truly connects those individually great moments I believe we do have something great here.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

big broad Broadway,"Charity Hallett (Michelle Williams) and P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman) are childhood sweethearts and loving parents to two girls. As a child, his father worked as a lowly tailor for her wealthy family. After his father's death, he struggled to survive on the streets of New York. When they reached adulthood, Charity leaves the comforts of her family home for his love. He lies to a banker for the money to buy a wax museum. Eventually, he turns it into a circus of oddities. He recruits successful black sheep playwright Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron) who falls in love with trapeze artist Anne Wheeler (Zendaya). He is desperate for high society approval and promotes high class singing sensation Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson).This is a brash and broadest of Broadway musical. It is big and melodramatic. Obviously, Hugh is the perfect man for the job. This is a movie that knows what it is and is happy to play it to the fullest. Coming into this, my biggest fear is an easy lackadaisical treatment of historical facts. How big and broad this is actually helps to alleviating that fear. Nobody will mistake this for a documentary. It is to be taken as the lightest of entertainment with the broadest of emotions. I would have liked a reference to ""There's a sucker born every minute"" even if it's not from P.T.'s mouth. Maybe I missed that in the movie. I like all the actors especially Jackman. It hits some great notes. I especially like the trapeze dance between Anne and Phillip. Mostly, I'm disappointed with the wooden acting from Ferguson. The most compelling part of her role is the on stage singing. I wonder if an actual singer would be infinitely more fitting. I simply don't believe her singing and the role doesn't ask much in terms of acting. Overall, it's a big musical and it doesn't want to be anything else.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Wonderful Holiday Present,"As is evidenced on this site, critical reviews of ""The Greatest Showman"" have been lackluster - at best. Sadly, it seems that unless a film features mind-numbing special effects, anguished characters and/or ""a real thinker"" of an ending, the critical community doesn't feel the film is worth your time. This time, they got it wrong...""The Greatest Showman"" is an uplifting, joyous experience that we all need, now more than ever. The musical numbers are glorious and the plot, while not historically accurate (if you want a history lesson, rent ""Dunkirk"",) is heartfelt and engrossing. It is a film that families can enjoy together, devoid of the sappiness and goofy grownups that infest most family fare. And, the greatest present of all: you feel wonderful at the end!Within the film, an entertainment critic who describes Mr. Barnum's offerings as ""a circus of humbug"" asks whether it bothers him that all he offers is fake. Barnum, referring to his customers, replies, ""Do their smiles look fake?"" No, they don't - nor do the ones in the theater. And those smiles are reaffirmed through the round of applause that many audiences bestow upon the film at its conclusion.Gather the family, enjoy the music and leave the theater feeling better than when you came in. Happy Holidays.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A show for the ages - and all ages,"As cinematic musicals experience a sort of renaissance, it can't be expected that every film will be equally beloved by critics and audiences alike. 'The Greatest Showman' is a prime example of this.The conflicted, unorthodox life story of one of this country's most prolific entertainers - P.T. Barnum - is set against a full soundtrack of rising numbers featuring full choruses and classic-meets-new age music. While the public - including families - more or less fell in love with this ensemble, leading to an over-performance at the box office, the Rotten Tomatoes crowd were less impressed.For one, 'Showman' features an identifiable pop culture icon (Barnum), bankable stars (Jackman, Efron, Williams, Zendaya) and catchy songs written by the same cast of characters responsible for the music in another crowd-pleaser, 'La La Land.' All of these elements make a film that can connect with audiences unlike more sophisticated, elaborate films. Sure, it can be argued that Barnum's life is simplified to the point that it almost feels as trivial as the beard on Keala Settle's bearded woman. But this isn't intended to be a biographical drama.Again, it's the music the is the glue that holds 'Showman' together. Kicking off with the energetic 'The Greatest Show' and ending on the rousing finale of 'From Now On,' there are plenty of hits in here that are enough to keep audiences humming along long after the curtains close. Perhaps the standout, though, is Rebecca Ferguson's portrayal of the operatic vocalist Jenny Lind, who's voiced by Loren Allred on the power ballad ""Never Enough,"" which is sure to become a classic to be sung in singing competitions all over the world.Sure, 'The Greatest Showman' is a bit cheesy at times, and would be a shell of itself if it was not a musical. But the final result stands on its own as an impressive, memorable entry in the 20th Century Fox catalogue.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Extremely underrated movie.,"It's a movie that is gonna be remembered for it's message that no dream is too small or too big. This movie is ahead of it's time, made with passion and every part of it is nothing less than perfection. It pushes the ideology that if you want your dream to come true, then do anything that you can for your dreams and goals even if it means going against the society or your own relatives or parents. Because you have this one life and it's your responsibility to give it a meaning that would make this life worth living for you. Don't be afraid to disappoint people, cause in the end, if you succeed then nothing else would matter.
It should get Atleast 9 stars so it gets viewed by future generations and this will fill them with hope and guts to build their own world that they dream of. I would recommend this movie to youth cause while REALISM might break your hope, optimism and faith in yourself will always give you strength to fight for what you want for yourself.
Someone said: ""faith sees best in dark"". I hope this movie will give you that faith in your life.It will be counted as one of those classic movies that will be remembered for decades to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
It's Pretty Good,"This movie is pretty good. The storytelling is mediocre at best, but where this movie shines is the visuals and music. With the talented songwriting duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (Dear Evan Hansen, La La Land) and Alex Lacamoire (Hamilton, Dear Evan Hansen) behind the wheel on the musical front, every single song in the movie is a blast to listen to. The visuals are also well thought out, and while a lot of it is obviously computer generated, it doesn't detract from thee viewing experience too much. This may not be a great movie, but it sure is an entertaining one. Some of the most fun I've had in the theater all year.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"See this movie, do not listen to the critics.","I loved this movie. I have already pre-ordered the blue ray and I am planning to see the movie again in the theatre. I am writing a review mainly because I am so annoyed by all of the negative reviews by the critics. One point was that it is not completely accurate to how P. T. Barnum was. Well it is a musical, not a documentary. It still was a well written story. One critic complained that the movie turned Barnum into a saint. Not true! He was flawed in the movie, at times uncaring or selfish. The scenes of the circus were just amazing. The choreography was very well done. The songs also are excellent and performed by very talented singers. Listen to the songs on youtube. Try ""Never Enough"" and ""The Greatest Showman."" The movie also shows the importance of having compassion for those who are different, and the effects of racism, and standing up to racism. The songs are very catchy, and will stay in your head, and the movie is uplifting. This movie was Hugh Jackman's dream, it took 7.5 years to make. Each actor held their own and fit well into their role. This movie has so much talent and effort put into it and deserves to become a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

I think it may have to do with too many characters worth exploring, and failing to explore deep enough the two main characters. Should it had been longer? Maybe that would have made it better.

The circus comes to town,"The Greatest Showman gives Hugh Jackman another chance to do a movie musical in a somewhat sanitised story of P T Barnum who conceived a circus of freaks, the bizarre and misfits. More importantly he was driven by self promotion and making money.First time director Michael Gracey does well with the musical sequences, giving it a modern sensibility. However his lack of experience shows in the dramatic moments and with the narrative. The songs are rather bland apart from the Oscar nominated, This is Me that has a barnstorming performance from Keala Settle.The story is a little thin but zips along in an entertaining fashion. It is dazzling yet curiously empty, Maybe a bit like Barnum's showmanship. The best performances are from Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Choreography is Astounding,"I was absolutely astonished by how well this movie pulled together messages that are particularly relevant today as then. The film melded exceptional cast, script, vocals, acting and....dancing. We raised two daughters who dreamed of dancing professionally and took classes with the Rockettes and other professional companies. So, we are attained to great dancing and were astounded by the choreography and numbers in ""The Greatest Showmen."" Choreography in musicals are often ignored, but great choreography with talented dancers and main actors and actresses who are willing to put in the effort to focus as much on movements as they invest in their acting and vocals. Several of the back up actors were amazing and should have been featured included in extras on extended DVDs. I wish award organizations included categories for choreography and performance.Asa side note, a rumor circulates that those working for the Disney Channel are cursed and don't go far. I am always happy to see Disney alumni like Zac Efronand Zendaya showcasing their skills. The aerial dance training accomplished by Zendaya is very difficult and causes considerable injury. Our eldest took aerial dance movement while at the University and our youngest, experiencing dance injuries that were not properly treated, is waiting to enter a Doctorate of Physical Therapy where she plans to build a training program for dance teachers, choreographers and studio owners to treat injuries immediately and advise parents on what specialists to see.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Toe-tapping fun.,"Hugh Jackman is as complete a package as you can get in Hollywood. Not only can he dance, sing and act, but he also possesses levels of nice-guy charisma most A-listers can only dream of. It's no shock then that this glitzy musical employs him to play the eponymous circus pioneer P.T. Barnum, an ambitious dreamer who pushes social boundaries to deliver a theatrical extravaganza others couldn't even imagine. Centring around Barnum's use of outcasts and ""oddities"" to draw in crowds, the film has a quirky edge to its otherwise mainstream appeal; the traditional song-and-dance numbers are smattered with colourful characters (and a smidge of offbeat humour) to keep it fresh. The musical sequences are impressively choreographed and often very affecting, the most memorable being the show stopping ""This Is Me"" led by Keala Settle as Bearded Lady Lettie Lutz, closely followed by ""The Other Side"", a clever two-hander between Jackman and Zac Efron. Jackman is clearly in his element belting out tunes and dancing up a storm, but he's also given wonderful support from all involved, including Efron as his plucky apprentice, Michelle Williams as his super-patient wife, and Zendaya as a racially vilified trapeze artist. The movie succeeds a lot less as a biography though; Barnum's rise amidst risky business ventures and family sacrifices is touched upon but never explored, missing an opportunity to delve deep into the life of a clearly intriguing person. It might be a little too conventional to convert those who aren't fans of the genre, but with a charming cast, splendid set pieces and sweet-natured vibe, The Greatest Showman is a pleasingly fun and accessible musical.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Fun Spectacle with the Potential for So Much More,"On the one hand, this movie is a fun and entertaining spectacle. The songs are catchy and the choreography is amazing to watch. This movie would be perfect as a stage performance. I will be listening to the soundtrack on repeat, for sure.On the other hand, it comes across as too heavy-handed in its themes and was so fast-paced that you barely have any time to register the emotions in any of the scenes. This movie also does a lot of ""telling"" (or rather, singing) rather than showing. The characters will say how they feel, but the movie has no time to stop and really show it. In this way, the songs may come across as insincere and cheesy a lot of the time. But, like I said, it's mostly a pacing issue. If this movie was given more time to slow down in between songs, it could've made a huge emotional impact.I also think this movie was a missed opportunity to explore the interesting, complicated personality of the real P.T. Barnum. Instead, the movie turned him into a Walt Disney-esque figure with a dream, who grows up to make that dream come true. The real Barnum was a shady, savvy businessman who was also a creative innovator, a genius entrepreneur, an anti-slavery politician, and an overall controversial public figure. A lot more interesting than the watered-down version we get from this movie.Still, it's a fun watch. And if you're a fan of musicals, you won't be disappointed for sure. It's a spectacle, but it's not exactly the ""greatest show.""",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another Musical Classic: Don't Mind the Critics!,"I think critics are missing the whole premise of the film. I never really saw this as a biography to begin with, but a fun, upbeat historical fiction musical. Each musical number had a fitting mood for the scene, especially the opening number where it was especially satisfying to see the visual aspects of the film. I saw this film as a mixture of the pop-style mood of Hamilton, mixed with the visual joyride that was Pippin. It works for me perfectly. I never really felt the runtime at all because the musical parts of the show were enough to keep me satisfied. Zac Efron and Hugh Jackman definitely brought my favorite performances, with Waitress actress Keala Settle delivering some satisfying vocal delivery. You can definitely feel the La La Land levels of genius lyrics here. As for story, I found myself telling the characters ""NO DON'T DO THAT"" or ""YESSS"" very softly in the theater. There were even a few moments where I smiled and laughed out loud.
In the words of Rachel Bloom, ""the modern musical is an American invention, and it is still alive and well."" It's rare that we get to see wonderfully crafted theatrical musicals such as this and La La Land. This is also something I think many critics fail to see. This is definitely one of my favorite films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Musical Hokum,"JIM'S REVIEW: The Greatest Showman has its heart in the right place, but it unfortunately never achieves its musical goal. It invests a lot, and I mean a lot, of talent and hard work with very little dividend.The songs are foot-stomping, uplifting, and hummable tunes, but become derivative imitations of themselves. Every musical number sounds and looks alike with no modulation. Even the ballads are slow-downed versions of other songs in the film. The original score by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul lacks range, a deliberate sameness creeps in for most musical moments, but their music definitely delivers in energetic peppiness with toe-tapping ""feel-good"" form. They are experts in writing clever ""hooks"". The modern choreography is more 2017 variety than 1917 period but is very well done. Kudos to Ashley Wallen and his accomplished dancers for stomping their way into your hearts.Nathan's Crowley's lovely production design sings out, as does the costumes created by Ellen Mirojnick. Michael Gracey's solid direction is fluid and successfully captures the nostalgic musical origins of the big Hollywood musicals of yore (although think what these filmmakers could have done with Cy Coleman's far superior Broadway musical gem, Barnum!).The major problem with the film, and it is a major issue, is the paper thin plot that follows the most predictable of story-lines. Whenever the singing and dancing stops, so does the film. The screenplay by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon is a real letdown, with underwritten characters and petty conflicts all under the big top in a very conventional way. Their script is mostly an outline to serve the musical moments and rarely advances the plot. The relationships are all strained beyond reality and each character seems to be a mere prop device to lead into the next musical interlude.The casting is a mixed bag also. Hugh Jackman is really the greatest showman, more so than Barnum himself. He is a natural song and dance man. Watching him move with such grace and charisma is almost worth the price of admission (but there is that awful script, remember). Michelle Williams is his loving wife, Charity, and she is given so little to do to showcase her musical talents. Zac Efron as rich playboy, Phillip Carlyle, tries hard, but just doesn't have the musical ability, no matter how they edit the movie. Zendaya plays his love interest and their love story seems like a second thought. Their romance may convince a giddy twelve-year-old girl about the things we do for love, but it left me questioning the things they did for a paycheck.Perhaps the weakest link is the usually dependable Rebecca Ferguson, totally miscast as the operatic Jenny Lind. Supposedly this world renown singer and crowd-pleasing attraction to Barnum's circus of oddities, wowed the patrons back then. However, the singing on the screen could never come near a high C. Ms. Ferguson's performance is more like a B-flat. (In creating such an important supporting role, it is beyond me why the filmmakers couldn't find an attractive and trained opera singer to fill the bill. Go to the Met and take your pick.)So, even though the movie is entertaining on a musical level, The Greatest Showman is plain hokum, albeit nice-looking hokum. There is plenty of razzle-dazzle on display although it is just painted cardboard and glitter that remains. As Barnum would say, ""There is one born every minute."" (Even though Ms. Lind could not hit that high C, the film's earned that grade from this critic.)",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Showy, Forgettable CG Musical","The Greatest Showman is a flashy biopic of circus pioneer PT Barnum. Unfortunately, PT Barnum gets the Hollywood treatment and it is a shallow movie that portrays Barnum as a champion of the downtrodden just as much as the profiteer that he was. Hugh Jackman's version of Barnum would never say ""There's a sucker born every minute.""Of even greater disappointment was the music. The writers of La La Land's incredible soundtrack follow it up with a disappointing set of songs that all sound the same. If you shuffled the songs around in this movie, I'm not sure anyone would really notice. The only song I can remember much of is The Greatest Show, and that's just because they repeatedly come back to it. Even Golden Globe nominated This Is Me sounds like the rest of them. It was also clear that for the most part the actors are not the ones singing, and those that are recorded in a studio and then lip synced, which while understandable, should not be noticeable.There is a solid cast and they all do fine, particularly Jackman and Rebecca Ferguson. The dance numbers definitely feel like they are from a 60s musical like West Side Story or Mary Poppins rather than a modern musical. It is also shot and constructed reasonably well, but it just not gripping.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Great job, if not quite the truth","The movie starts with this pounding. Oh, the noise, noise, noise! If this movie was set in the 19th century, why couldn't it also have 19th century music?But some people, maybe most people, will enjoy the spectacular opening scene, even if it's not the kind of music I would choose. Very talented dancers and acrobats. And they do it again, several times.The story of young P. T. Barnum is hard to watch but it explains a lot, and once the unpleasantness is over, there's a really cute romantic story and whoever does his singing does a really good job.It's pretty amazing to watch what Barnum does as an adult, and Hugh Jackman does a great job with the role, though he doesn't quite have the kind of range that would be expected of an Oscar-worthy performance. That's partly due to the writing, I suppose. Barnum experiences a lot of tragedy but there's not a really powerful scene where he has to react to that. Mostly Jackman just shows how wonderful a showman Barnum was.I didn't know how much of this was the truth, and so much is different, but then this was a man known for deception.And once again, music is NOT from the century where the action took place. But everyone besides me is enjoying it. Barnum's little daughters in particular are having such a good time.A memorable scene involves General Tom Thumb. And Queen Victoria. Knowing how proper that woman was, I expected a disaster. Things went quite well. And no, apparently that scene never happened.What a shame Barnum didn't truly respect his ""freaks"", even though he seemed to think he did. At least that's the way it is depicted. But he can't very well have them associating with dignified, proper people. And they do react.I found one brief scene involving Yahya Abdul-Mateen II to be memorable. His performance there, though brief, was so different, and something about the camera angle made him look dignified, as a proud man of African descent.Knowing the truth, I'd like to have seen more of the relationship with General Tom Thumb, and how he truly contributed to making Barnum a success. How he was discovered here was so different, but it was an interesting way to do it. It just wasn't the truth.Yes, he was The Greatest Showman. Flawed, but very good at what he did.",,Anonymous,Biography
Jackman's talent propels the show but the songs are weak,It's great that Hugh Jackman has another chance to fill the screen with his singing and dancing talent. And he is truly the star of this interesting biopic of PT Barnum. His strong vocals and energy propel the show on and the story keeps you wanting to see what happens. Michelle Williams plays his wife. Her voice seems thin and weak compared to his and she should have been dubbed. Rebecca Fergusson looks good as the diva Jenny Lind and even though she is lip syncing she moves you when her character is singing. Her face with it's old fashioned beauty is just right for the period. Zac Efron is alright if a bit small sized compared to the rest of the cast. At least he can sing and dance. Not much chemistry with Zendaya.The weak part of this movie is the music itself. The songs are derivative and the lyrics are banal relying on repetition of simplistic tunes and lyrics over and over again. The composing team is tragically untalented. The style of the music and songs are totally out of place with the setting. What a waste of such singing talent.Things slow down during the rather forced dramatic climax.Worth watching for Hugh,6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A great show,"Love musicals, always have from a very young age seeing the likes of 'The Wizard of Oz', 'West Side Story', 'The Sound of Music', 'Calamity Jane', 'Singin in the Rain' and Disney musicals. So there is absolutely no bias against musicals, though there are bad ones out there and ones that are still enjoyable or mixed where stories, scripts or both are not strong suits.Went to see 'The Greatest Showman' yesterday with my sister, having been blown away by the trailer (one of the best of the year to me). Both of us found ourselves loving it, it actually is one of my favourites of the year and loved it just as much as 'La La Land'. Like was said with another 2017 favourite 'Paddington 2' it was a breath of fresh air after a variable year seeing my fair share of overblown big-budget blockbusters with little soul, films that waste great premises and films that attempted laugh-a-minute laughs and doing it in a way that came at the expense of heart as well of course some gems.Am not sure where the critic bashing (which has been blown out of proportion for some time now for a lot of films, acclaimed and panned, and is getting incredibly annoying and abused) is coming from. Despite the low Metacritic score and the average one for Rotten Tomatoes, actually personally have seen a lot of positive reviews and word of mouth even from people hard to please.Is 'The Greatest Showman' perfect? Not quite. Some secondary roles are sketchy at best and only serve as ones getting in the way of the troupe overcoming obstacles and adversity and providing conflict. A few of the dramatic parts, like the fire, veer on the slightly melodramatic. Those are my only real complaints.Anybody who has heard of Jenny Lind will need to suspend disbelief at how she would never have sung like she does here. No record survives of her singing (apart from a rumoured cylinder recording, recordings that often didn't do justice to singing voices, particularly in later life and when they were past prime, and nothing like how they are documented as), but from what has been read about her personally her vocal production and technique is too perfect for a voice that has been described as an acquired taste voice despite immense popularity and admiration. Can overlook that, because ""Never Enough"" was so brilliantly performed and it is hard to match what Jenny Lind sounded like when you don't have the audible evidence and only have documentation on critical reception to go by. 'The Greatest Showman' is also not that sort of film to do that.Honestly feel however that the historical inaccuracy, as a biographical drama 'The Greatest Showman' is heavily fictionalised, can, and should be, easily ignored. It is so easy to be captivated by the incredible dazzle and delights of the spectacle, and not many 2017 films left me feeling charmed, with my heart fully warmed, fully entertained, uplifted and with tears welling up in my eyes. 'The Greatest Showman' did all those things, from as early as ""A Million Dreams"" and never let go.'The Greatest Showman' looks amazing, one of the best-looking films of the year. It is one vibrant and classy shot and frame after another, the colours are eye-popping without ever being garish or exhausting and the period detail is as sumptuous as they come. The editing is dazzling and if this is a directorial feature film debut honestly can't wait to see where 'Michael Gracey's directing career takes him.Was wholly captivated by the song and dance numbers. To me the songs were truly infectious and catchy. ""A Million Dreams"", ""Never Enough"" and ""This is Me"" are the particularly memorable standouts. The choreography is a sheer delight in its energy, class and verve, ""This Is Me"", ""From Now On"" and ""Rewrite the Stars"" are just jaw-dropping. The cast do them justice. Vocally, Loren Alfred in ""Never Enough"" and Keala Settle in ""This Is Me"" are brilliant and the aforementioned songs for the choreography are especially well danced.Personally don't agree that 'The Greatest Showman' lacks substance or that the dramatic parts are empty. Sure the more dramatic sections are not as memorable, as well done or as entertaining as the song and dance numbers. Some of it is melodramatic. However the family scenes do have a lot of heart and charm, are sympathetically and touchingly played and the girls are adorable. The themes and values are not hammered home too much and are relevant and as relatable today as they were then.Couldn't have asked for better performances, especially the pitch-perfect one of Hugh Jackman, showing that he is fully at ease in musicals as he is as Wolverine. Despite loving him as Valjean in 'Les Miserables', the role of P. T. Barnum suits him much better particularly in the singing, he sounds incredible with a more even and attractive tone. He is as light-on-his-feet as the great dancers of the Golden Age classic musicals were (capturing the spirit of this era was another thing 'The Greatest Showman' excelled at) and he handles the dramatic/family moments with nuance.Zac Efron not only sounds wonderful and dances a dream (especially in ""Rewrite the Stars"") but shows that he can act, he has come on such a long way and this is the direction he should be taking. Michelle Williams is sympathetic and touching and Rebecca Ferguson is every inch the operatic diva. Keala Settle and Zendaya are especially good of the troupe and the singing voice of young Barnum is beautiful.Overall, really is a great show. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Actually, do listen to the critics on this one... unwatchable pablum.","I love musicals, and went to The Greatest Showman on the strong recommendation of my girlfriend, who'd seen it and loved every bit of it. She was shocked that my reaction was so negative.The sins of this movie are numerous, but to begin with, as a musical, you have to consider the music above all else. If you like generic, bland, pop mixes, you'll probably like the music in this. If on the other hand, you like thematically appropriate, well-timed, plot-based, interesting compositions like those in Chicago or Moulin Rouge, give this a pass. Choreography was similarly uninspiring, from opening scene to closing credits. Literally not a single memorable number.Character development: there is none. Prepare for the most cursory archetypes that aren't explored or developed in any real way. In no way did I ever care about a single character in this film.Overall direction: I'm sorry, but this was godawful. People do not SMILE like this all the time. They don't LAUGH at pedestrian dialogue. Whenever the pacing seemed to grind to a halt, hey, why not liven it up with a song? Truly painful.Even from a technical perspective, this one flopped: costumes were lackluster, makeup was shockingly uneven (you could see the glue lines of the bearded woman), CGI (thankfully sparse) was flat and not composited very well (eg, most shots with elephants). Early on, it seemed as though the filmmaker was shooting for a Moulin Rouge-style fantasy world. That didn't succeed, and then was dropped abruptly for more conventional presentation.Do I sound angry? Well, I am; I was prepared to love this movie. I wanted to love this movie. My girlfriend and I discussed for hours afterwards, as it seriously affected her - several scenes caused her to tear up, she loved the music and dance, she thought Hugh Jackman was fabulous. I was flabbergasted, as I was merely trying to get to the end so I could escape and do something more entertaining.

A Faux Biography of a Flawed Man,"This movie does not present itself as a factual biography of PT Barnum, instead it is an overly idealized accounting of the life of a deeply flawed man.In the movie PT Barnum seeks fame and fortune while overlooking that what he really wants/needs in life has been his for decades.If the movie presents a celebration of anything it is the:diversity of the human condition (in the form of the Oddities)acceptance (in the forms of a then scandalous interracial romance)self-acceptance & perseverance (in the form of the Oddities celebrating their uniqueness in the face of bigotry)rejection of institutional privilege (in the form of Phillip Carlisle)the redemptive power of love (in the form of Charity's forgiveness)With musical numbers that are rich and vibrant that highlight the impressive skills of stars Hugh Jackman, Zac Effron, and Keala Settle, it is definitely a feel good musical.Are there parts that require a degree of willing suspension of reality/belief?

The Greatest Showman,"My favourite musical movie for ever and ever! Hugh Jackman is absolutely amazing, storyline, music... i don't have enough words to describe it. ❤",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The Greatest Showman promises a lot, but ultimately disappoints in many areas.","I walked out of this film disappointed. What was advertised as a brilliant musical with unforgettable performances and catchy tunes with lyrics written by none other than the academy award winning lyricists for La La Land, Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, did not feel as 'great' as it was clearly intended to be. This is due to a number of reasons that I felt prevented this film from being one of the best of 2017, one of which being the overuse of CGI in some places, particulary with Sam Humphrey's character, Tom Thumb. Sam Humphrey is 4'2"" according to his IMDb page, and so naturally is very small, however the geniuses behind this movie thought it a great idea to add CGI to make him even smaller. To add to this point, the CGI in this movie is atrocious, leading to an unnecessarily strange, unpleasant looking character which the audience is forced to spend a good it of time with in the movie. In my opinion, this was very distracting and really impacted some of his scenes in the movie, making them very hard to take as seriously as they were meant to be.Another problem this movie faced was it's development, or lack thereof, of many of it's characters. All of the 'oddities' in PT Barnums' troupe are criminally underdeveloped, which made their arc in the film far less compelling, as there are given no personalities or defining features apart from what made them 'odd'. PT Barnum and Zac Efron's character feel like the only developed characters in the film, and have some really great scenes together, including a musical number in a bar, in which I felt they bounced off each other very well. If this same level of development had been spread throughout all of the main character's we were supposed to care for, and not just the two main characters, the movie would have fared a lot better.While the beginning and end of this movie are very fast paced and interesting, with lots of great songs that I really did enjoy, including the aforementioned bar scene, the middle felt quite lacklustre, with many forgettable songs all jammed in together, and a romantic subplot between Zac Efron and Zendaya's characters, which I felt was very unnecessary and forced. The music in this section, and throughout the entire movie, is very different from the music heard in La La Land, which was a film I very much enjoyed for it's jazzy soundtrack. The music in the greatest showman is a lot more modern and poppy, which, while some people may enjoy it, I felt was a huge step down from the music in La La Land, and really let down the film as a whole.Aside from the many negatives I have mentioned, there are quite a few positive aspects that really save this movie from being bad by my standards. As I have mentioned before, the beginning and end are fantastic with regards to their visuals, and really give the movie a broadway musical feel, which I really loved. Again, Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron really shine here, and bounce off each other penomanally, especially in the previously mentioned bar scene. Performance-wise, this movie is solid, with some great singing, dancing and acting, which really adds to the movie's showy atmosphere. If you enjoy musicals, you will probably enjoy this movie for what it is.With regards to improvements, I feel that this movie would have worked much better if it was told from the perspective of the 'oddities', giving them the spotlight and letting PT Barnum take a backseat as a villainous but sympathetic character. This would have avoided a lot of controversy as it would have shown PT Barnum for who he was, and would have offered a slightly different take on his legacy, which I believe would have been very interesting to see. It would also have reinforced the film's message of acceptance, which I feel wasn't done as good as it could have been.In conclusion, The Greatest Showman promises a lot in it's opening number, with stunning visuals and incredible performances, however it ultimately fails to deliver in many areas, making it feel like a mediocre stage show written by an far too ambitious amateur composer, which is a shame, as the concepts shown in the film are quite unique and, if properly executed, could have ended up being a landmark achievement within the film industry.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Showman,"Feel like I should kick this off by saying I know next to nothing about the real P.T. Barnum. I've heard that the movie portrays him in a much kinder light than he deserves but I'm not a historian and frankly don't care enough to research so purely basing this review on the film and not on any historical (in)accuracy.Speaking of the movie, this was pretty underwhelming for me. During the film, Barnum's act is referred to as being without substance and I feel that holds true for the majority of the movie itself. Yeah, it hits the tropes and checks the boxes but it's too rare that it bares its soul. The two big songs that found radio play are both moving, touching pieces but aside from that there's just not much here.What may change on future viewing, should there be any, is the efficacy of the songs. Musicals are tricky. The music has to be good, very good, while the actors are often performing crazy dance numbers and not every actor is capable of that. Voice overs are fine, but this felt off to me the whole time. It was too polished, to pristine, it didn't track at all with what the actors were doing and that bugged me the whole time. Might not in the future, but it did here and a musical with poor sound work is going to fail, despite how good some elements may be.I was able to stream this and I think anyone curious should do the same. I can't say I give this a strong recommend but some people obviously like it so if you can stream it give it a shot, maybe even just as background noise.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

I'm only taking a point away because it was so utterly contrived. But I thought Jackman and Ephron did yeoman duty as the leads. The circus bits were great. The ""freaks"" were engaging and fun. I wished it had a slightly sharper edge and a little more internal conflict, but the message put forth was just fine. Go see it because it is great fun.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

All the other musical numbers are superior, especially freaks This is me is outstanding. Over all everything seems to be in right place in this movie, but... Dramaturgy of movie is too straightforward. Everything seems to happen too easy. From rags to riches, getting arrogant, back to the bottom and get up again just happen, without any drama. Movie could be little longer and added more drama to feel more realistic.After all it is not a bad movie at all. It is visual, speedy and rhythmical movie. It sounds and looks great.

A Strange Attempt at Inclusivity,"I don't mean to discourage anyone from finding joy or meaning in The Greatest Showman, but as someone who values truthful screen adaptations and authentic intersectional representation in the media, I have some fundamental issues with this film.The Greatest Showman--even with its big budget, great cast, and good intentions on the surface--fails to come across as genuine to me. If I have to put aside the historical inaccuracies, I will, but not before saying that it was incredibly pointless to have this based on a real person. This film has nothing to do with P.T. Barnum--a man who grossly exploited the ""oddities"" of marginalized people to make himself rich--and I think it's in extremely poor taste to make a sensationalized, sugar-coated version of his story.But even after putting all of that aside, on its own, the film is generic and lacking a genuine commitment to it's message of acceptance and inclusivity. This has everything to do with its framing. At it's core, the film frames the white male protagonist as the hero of marginalized people, using the diverse cast of ""freak"" characters as a collective plot device to further Barnum's development. This is a problem for me because Barnum is framed to be without the prejudice others are so filled with towards the ""freaks,"" but never in the story does he actually defend their humanity or say anything to prove that he sees them as more than meal tickets. This is even more apparent by the fact that he never apologizes for having ignored and abandoned them. Furthermore, the majority of the ""freaks"" are lumped together as a whole, giving me no impression of their individual characters, their individual motivations, or any real impression that they have a working relationship with Barnum at all.Because of this, I can't help but feel that the ultimately inclusive message of ""be proud of who you are"" stems from a purely systematic view of the audience. Or, they wanted to make money, and so they hopped on the ""diversity is good"" train without really caring about writing a deeper, more meaningful story.Which begs the question, does this family film have to be more deep and meaningful? I guess not, it could be seen as harmless, but I, for one, have little tolerance for films that glorify reckless men like Barnum. I know its a simple rags-to-riches story, but if we're going to play around with empowering those who feel othered by society, I'd like something that doesn't revolve around a simplistic version of a historically problematic man that does the absolute minimum amount of work to represent people of various minorities.I think the people who were helming this project thought--maybe even subconsciously--that generic would be fine, relatable, and free of controversy. If you don't think about it too hard, it's a fun movie for the whole family, but I personally find this kind of storytelling irresponsible and in poor taste, especially today.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography

Making anyone happy is a art.......",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
They meant well,"The creators of ""The Greatest Showman"" meant well - to give us an uplifting film about inclusiveness, loyalty, true love, high principles, spreading happiness and making dreams come true. They chose to flesh out these notions by distilling the multifaceted life of P.T. Barnum into a 105-minute musical, sort of an ""essence of Barnum"" or, as it turns out, ""Barnum Syrup."" Sometimes their abridgments work splendidly as cinema, as in the early song-and-dance sequence that takes us from Barnum's childhood in rags to shipping clerk in business suit. At other times they asphyxiate us with musically inert anthems of victimhood or declarations of pride. Not one song is memorable. Some are okay while they're being sung, helped by swooping camera movement, acrobatic choreography and some excellent vocals, but you won't be humming them on the way home. Some are cringe-inducing, particularly the weirdly misconceived presentation of the famous Swedish soprano Jenny Lind, whom Barnum famously made even more famous by bringing her to America. For one thing, she is played by Rebecca Ferguson who despite being half Swedish speaks with a British accent even though the script clearly points out that she is Swedish. For another thing, the song she sings to an enraptured crowd of New York society swells is dreary, monotonous early 21st-century power-pop. If you're going to ignore historical context, even musically (as did the execrable ""Moulin Rouge"" in 2001), at least give the audience some indication of Lind's actual appeal (a vocal purity, as legend has it, but definitely not belting and other pyrotechnics).Regarding historical context, it goes without saying that the scenario ignores every 19th century reality except, to some degree, sets, costumes and of course the social and racial prejudices of the time, but only to score identity politics points. Of course, with writers like Jenny Bicks (very much at home in the 1990's world of ""Sex and the City"") and Bill Condon (whose uneven depiction of James Whale in ""Gods and Monsters"" was made bearable by Ian MacKellan's inspired acting and whose ""Kinsey"" was a bore) you're not going to get much of a feel for past eras.The score by the ""La La Land"" team of Justin Paul and Benj Pasek is almost entirely forgettable. The previous film had one catchy tune (""City of Stars""). The music here is boilerplate, the lyrics only very occasionally above banal (if you can hear them; most of the songs begin clearly and softly and intimately but quickly expand into heavily orchestrated extravaganzas which mask the paltry musical and lyrical substance).As for casting, you can hardly miss with the charismatic and multi-talented Hugh Jackman. Michelle Williams as his wife is largely wasted and gets stuck with some of the most embarrassingly obvious dialogue. Zac Ephron, who seems to be thickening in his middle age, plays an invented character, a high-society playwright who is miserable and empty until he teams up with Barnum, exchanges the pen for the emcee's baton and falls in love with an African-American trapeze artist (Zendaya).The film is reminiscent of some of the low-budget, episodic but energetic biopics that rolled off the Hollywood assembly line in the 1930s except here the spending is lavish and the song-and-dance sequences, which at their best advance the narrative rather than overstate the obvious, are eye-poppingly elaborate. There seems to be a deliberate attempt to recapture the sentimentalism and syrupiness that was commonplace in many old-time movies, but mixed with the 21st century mindset of the writers and director, it becomes self-parody.The main message seems to be the old reliable one: love is the most important thing of all, even more important than material success and it's better to put love first, and that we all, no matter what we look like or where we come from, are valuable individuals worthy of respect.",,Anonymous,Biography

Furthermore, the sets and costumes are beautiful. Truly capturing the style of the film.However, sometimes I feel the moral is quite heavy handed.

"Not a masterpiece, but brilliant and a must watch","If you're a fan of musicals, get out your tissues, because this movie will have you crying ugly tears of joy. The real genius of The Greatest Showman, however, is the very currently relevant themes of diversity and class.In P.T. Barnum's day, class was something one was born into, with no escape, though the idea of class mobility was on the rise, thanks to the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment. After the French and American revolutions, culture was on it's way to modern democracies. This movie is a nod to how entertainment began to reflect these changes. Today, classical entertainment like ballet and theater combines with the liberal and diverse entertainment of fringe ideas like the circus, to make what we consider modern entertainment, movies and television.We don't quite take for granted the diversity and acceptance we enjoy in our contemporary world (evident in ongoing racism and other discrimination like against LGBTQ people), but we are still a world away from the 19th century. But, Barnum was clearly ahead of his time, thanks to being an upwardly mobile individual himself (a rarity for the time), and having a bold and somewhat narcissistic personality.I think what is most striking about this story in this moment in history is that Barnum embraced and promoted an inevitable cultural phenomenon, even though he himself might not have been fully aware of its impact. His main motivation, after all, was to be a legitimate upper class person, not to unite the masses. He was simply a vessel through which that occurred. But, what happened with the circus in his time was really a precursor to what today is civil rights and modern democracy.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great Music and Likable Leads, but This Show Is Not the Greatest","I will admit, I'm a sucker for movie musicals. Give me genial, upbeat stories set to catchy music and I'm willing to forgive a lot of flaws. Generally speaking, musicals are easy to enjoy, no matter who is behind the camera. The Greatest Showman, Hugh Jackman's musical biopic of circus pioneer P.T. Barnum, is indeed likable. Jackman makes a great ring leader, for the circus as well as the film, and the songs are undeniably appealing, but with banal, clichéd, uninteresting stuff going on between the music, The Greatest Showman is barely worth the two-hour investment.The film is very light on story. The narrative is your standard biographical retelling of an unlikely rise to fame. In this case, it's P.T, Barnum, who had an interesting real life, but whose circus' rise to prominence is rendered pretty well drama-free, here. The Greatest Showman pays lip service to ideas of self-worth and confidence, and it admirably creates a sense of camaraderie among the circus' entertainers, but whatever interest I took in the story was fleeting. The manufactured conflicts, including an interracial love affair between Zac Efron and Zendaya's characters, or a sub-plot concerning circus protestors, wear thin as they go along. The best musicals not only have great music and colorful dance numbers but a powerful central narrative. That aspect is clearly lacking in this script.Despite feeling like an old-fashioned Hollywood musical, The Greatest Showman is actually rather unorthodox when it comes to its music. The songs are all modern pop, which is initially rather odd considering the film is set in the 19th Century, but before the first number was over, I had warmed to the notion. Now I don't consider myself a fan of modern pop music, but these songs impressed me. There's a brassy mix of acoustic and electronic to nearly every song, and as a result, they all sound kind of similar, but I couldn't help tapping my toes to most of them. These are great songs. If I had one complaint, it's that the best songs seem to be loaded at the front.There is a subset of 30-40-year-old women who will absolutely adore The Greatest Showman. It is rooted in classic Hollywood, with a charismatic lead actor, a feel-good story, and wholesome themes. Yet, it's hip enough in its music to feel fresh. For that subset and others, that is all they will see. They won't be bothered by the lack of a compelling narrative or the shopworn clichés about letting your freak flag fly. They won't mind the grinding pacing or the chopped-up dance numbers that never linger long enough. There is a lot you have to overlook in The Greatest Showman to really enjoy it, but it is possible.63/100",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

I looked up the actual history of P.T. Barnum, and this movie wasn't far off from the basic story of his life. Sure they added drama to the story, but I don't even care. It's not like this was a pivotal story in World History. He was an entertainer, and guess what, a movie in his name just got made that was completely entertaining.

Hugh Jackman was wonderful as were most of the cast and I wish they had been given a better story to tell. Was it made because it epitomises the ""American dream"", poor boy makes good and becomes famous and wealthy - at any cost - then finds his heart again?

Insanely good musical tribute to the life of P.T. Barnum.,"My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. The music, the choreography, the singing, the story, all in all one of the most enjoyable movies in recent memory. It isn't a documentary, it is a musical inspired by P.T. Barnum's early life and start as great showman.It is strange that many of us first encountered Hugh Jackman, the actor, as Wolverine. That got him known but in fact he is one of the best modern song-and-dance performers. In fact when he was host of a TV awards program a few years back, in recognition of his ""great showmanship"" the idea of a ""Greatest Showman"" movie musical with him playing thre lead role was conceived.Most of the story here takes place in the mid 1800s as P.T. Barnum (Jackman), a natural showman, first developed his Manhattan museum of oddities, then eventually ""The Greatest Show On Earth"" with his circus.Michelle Williams plays his wife Charity Barnum and to my pleasant surprise she is an excellent singer. The only major character that did not do her own singing was Rebecca Ferguson as the Swedish Nightingale, Jenny Lind.Lots of good performances, too many to mention in a brief review, but for anyone who enjoys a good musical this one is a real winner. I plan to watch it again before I return the DVD.January 2019: I watched it a second time on BluRay, I came away with an even better impression. Plus the ""extras"" on how this movie came to be and how the songs were written are among the best I have seen for any movie.",,Anonymous,Biography
Strong Showmanship and vocal performances - help back by a limited script,"The greatest showman allows Hugh Jackman to be at his Broadway best. And the musical sequences are some of the most fun the whole family to singalong (especially in 2nd and 3rd viewings). Although like many semi-biographical movies, after the first act it feels like the writers are just trying to think up conflict that ultimately wasn't unnecessary.The compelling story is the protagonists ability to come from nothing himself and rise whilst empowering the less privileged circus performers.The plot leads the lead character down a path of simply using the ""freaks"" for his own self benefit and when a ""better option"" presents itself he takes it - only somewhat redeeming himself once his ""better option falls through.Whilst it's an ordinary at best script - this shouldn't takeaway from the casts musical and performing excellence.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Movie Review: The Greatest Showman,"First things first this movie is extremely entertaining as a family friendly musical but I have the same problem with it that I've had since its inception, casting P. T. Barnum as an underdog hero undermines the horrors of the true story. Leave the real accounts of these characters to one side however and I don't have all too much of an issue with the greatest showman. The musical numbers are all pretty good and are accompanied by fantastic choreography. The cast are also great, Hugh Jackman and Michelle Williams turn in performances you would expect from actors of their talent and Zendaya and Zac Efron really hold their own in challenging roles. I think there is a more interesting P. T. Barnum biopic to be made but this works fine as a family movie with a good message. With a string of lazy and annoying kids movies in recent years this is a film I would highly recommend to any parent. It Doesn't fully sugarcoat it's source martial but it also still wants you to route for Barnum, depending on how that makes you feel, this movie ain't half bad.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Highly Entertaining Musical,"""The Greatest Showman"" is a highly entertaining musical based on highlights of the life of the American entertainer P.T. Barnum, but never in his biography. The dramatization, art direction, cast and the choreography are excellent and the result may be not what the ""professional critics"" expect to see (like the snobbish character in the film), but certainly will be very pleasant for the audiences where I include myself. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""O Rei do Show"" (""The King of the Show"")",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
It's a good entertaining movie that doesn't try to pretend to be something more,"This film can be classified as: Let's spoil everything with dancing and dancing every 15 minutes.We could have limited ourselves to the musical numbers on stage, and not touch the rest of the scenes, but what happened, it happened.I rarely like musicals, and this one doesn't belong to my favorites. As a movie, it's just wonderful. And the actors are all beautiful, they play well, and the plot, despite its simplicity, is fascinating, so why not.

Paint-by-numbers movie,"The Greatest Showman is an example of lazy storytelling. 
Colourful and bright with some big songs, the movi is actually just a conflicted mess. Whilst they see it fit to use language of the time to describe the ""freaks"" drafted to PT Barnum's show (all done in a quaint medley so we barely get any depth or interesting story), the music utilises a far more modern tone. There's be no issue with this (look how incredibly Lin-Manuel Miranda's 'Hamilton' mixes up historical period & musical style) but here the intention is totally unclear.Returning to the story, the main rags-to-riches-story of PT Barnum is poorly told. It's wholly unoriginal with huge story elements missed out (when he's told that his family is to be evicted from their home, we've had no proper indication as to how or why. His interest in 'incredible' singer Jenny Lind (she most certainly is not an 'incredible' singer) is dull and obvious, even though she proves a highly unlikeable character.As for Zac Efron's part in this big mess, it's hard to understand what his character's even doing there. Again, unlikeable and 2-dimentional, there's no originality in the telling of his and Anne Wheeler's mixed-race relationship story.This is a terrible movie which fails to tell an interesting story (a true story!). Entertaining only due to Jackman and Keala Settle's talent and some bright colours. Don't let the smiles and music deceive you - this is a poor film.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
The art of promotion,"It's ironic that this musical celebration of the life of Phineas Taylor Barnum comes
out just when the last tangible legacy of his life comes to an end. The plot of
The Greatest Showman ends just when Barnum gets the idea that he just needs
a large tent to house his attractions. We never see Barnum&Bailey's circus come
to fruition, we never even meet James P. Bailey in this film.. Their circus merged
with that of the Ringling family and it was Ringling Brothers&Barnum&Bailey
circus that traveled the world for over a century. Last year the troupe finally
broke up as the circus became an institution confined to history. Still Phineas
Taylor Barnum is still a name that set a standard for promotion.The Greatest Showman looks a whole lot like in style and substance with the
Cole Porter tribute film It's DeLovely. But that film had a library of a song catalog to score that film from its subject. Benj Pasek and Justin Paul wrote the songs for The Greatest Showman and This Is Me gained an Oscar nomination for Best Song, one of the very few now written for that rarest of
film lately, the original screen musical.A lot of people have brought P.T. Barnum to the screen and Hugh Jackman in 
his performance joins such folks as Wallace Beery, Burt Lancaster, and Michael
Crawford among others. Jackman doesn't take a back seat to any of these.
Two refugees from the Disney Studio, Zac Efron and Zendaya have great parts
to exhibit their musical talents. Rebecca Ferguson plays The Swedish Nightingale Jenny Lind who represented Barnum's successful bid for respectability. She has a nice song to sing dubbed by Loren Allred in Never 
Enough. But it might have been wiser and more accurate to have gotten some
soprano to sing a familiar public domain aria instead. What you see here is
most definitely not an authentic Jenny Lind.There's no more Scudder's Museum where Barnum exhibited his sideshow acts.
Jenny Lind arrived too soon for her voice to be captured on Mr. Edison's new
phonograph, and now the circus is of the past. But The Greatest Showman is
still quite a tribute to the one who really invented the concept of show business, P.T. Barnum.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
This is a GOOF!,"Absolutely love this movie. However, I don't know how to add to the goof column. Whenever Barnum is interviewing candidates for the circus, he gives one of them a high-ten. High-fives were not invented until October, 1977.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Rather enjoyable movie musical.,"The Greatest Showman is one of those rare movies where the soundtrack actually transcends the movie it came from; now what about the film itself? The film is spectacularly pretty and vibrant in its activity and cast, though the story is rather familiar but welcome territory. It's an underdog who risks everything and there are PLENTY of hurdles along the way to get to the top, and Hugh Jackman is a great leading man in any role he's given.The best song in the film is easily 'This Is Me'; and all the other goodies are still memorable too. But it's that one song that truly shines: like a pop-song you first listen to and it feels like it's always been there, waiting to be discovered.The Greatest Showman; give it a watch and ignore Rotten Tomatoes on this one.

The Greatest Showman (2017),"Alas, the holiday season is upon us and with that the holiday season of films. A nice mix of buzzworthy films and Oscar hopefuls, this time of year is wonderful for cinephiles. I was mildly interested in checking this film out because it looked like a capable musical. After La La Land, you had to expect more musicals attempting to emulate that film's success. I have no problem with that, I have plenty of time for all times of films. The Greatest Showman stumbles on problems with its script and storytelling but make no mistake about this film having a glorious soundtrack and fantastic production and set design.The film is (apparently a rather loose) telling of the story of P.T. Barnum and his struggle to make something for himself and his family. His initial idea of a museum isn't a success but he get's the idea of an innovative form of entertainment involving unique individuals with rare talents formerly shunned as outcasts of society. Yes, this becomes the modern day circus. I don't know exactly how truthful this is to the original story but I sensed that this film is heavy on dramatization and made things more peachy and roses than they might have been.The plot is thin, there isn't a whole lot of development of side characters and you will feel like this film falls short ass a well written musical, like that of La La Land. It's well written in the sense that the songs in the film are quite excellent. Catchy, elegant, and near impeccable in sound , the soundtrack roars and impresses. The same has to be said about the choreography, the dance numbers, costume design, and the glitz and glamor of the early 90's and the grand circus theme. Its honestly a visual and sonic experience that's worth the watch alone.I also liked the fact that this film doesn't overstay its welcome with an under two hour running length. It sort of zooms by and perhaps could have added more meat to its bare story but I'll take that over a long and dreary musical that becomes dull because of its length. The Greatest Showman may get lost in the award season shuffle but it does its job of being a fun time.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

An entertaining drama and musical of how show business came about.,"""The Greatest Showman"" is one film that has themes of drama, doubt, struggle, and love and yet most of all it's a historical musical drama about how the legendary P.T. Barnum came about. As a kid you enjoy animals and the circus and enjoy sideshow attractions, well with this film you see how all of the makings and sideshow discovery things came about from one P.T. Barnum(Hugh Jackman).The movie despite having struggles of doubt, money concerns, and love drama is moved along just fine with great sounds of music as it's entertaining on the ears. And the growth along the way is seen of P.T. and his relationship with wife Charity(Michelle Williams).Overall this film is entertaining a good mix of sound with story that features drama and love and the performances from Jackman and Michelle is in top notch form as their screen chemistry makes this film a watch!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

The soundtrack is an absolute revelation and makes me feel happy every time I listen to it in the bus or go out for a walk.It's not meant to be taken seriously.

There was no creativity whatsoever. If you were you listen to the songs back to back, you couldn't tell the difference. All used the same 4 chords, all used the same cheesy ""we can fix it!"" *fist bump the sky* chorus. I expected so much more out of this cast.

The Essence of P. T. Barnum,"From the beginning, cinema has always been about the magic of entertainment. Telling living stories, they are able portray events, moments, people, and show so many things that can never be seen anywhere else. This in essence was everything P.T. Barnum could have wished for.Now, I'm writing this review mainly do to the recent divisiveness this movie created among critics (Look no further than the 53% rating on Rotten Tomatoes) with the main critique among them all being the portrayal of the main character himself P.T. Barnum. They claim the showman to be a watered down version of the real Barnum and say even more so that the film glosses over much of the real life events that show him to be a much more complicated figure, than seen in the movie. Now this is a fair critique, character is portrayal is one of the key aspects when making a biographical picture, but in this case I think a more cheerful watered down version may have benefited it. Now I hate to sound condensing, knowing that I am not a professional critic myself, but I feel many of whom have missed the point. Barnum would not have wanted a serious, 60 year old, dialogue heavy portrayal of himself, if anything he would have loved Hugh Jackman's performance. He's excitable, happy, energetic and just like his ideas you could even call him magical. Same with the rest of the characters (Many of whom did not exist in real life) like the Anne Wheeler, the trapeze artist played by Zendaya, who has to deal with racism along with bigotry do to a romance. She too is in love with performance and has the same magical quality to her. Characters like these capture the scope of Barnum's ideas along with the imagination. If portraying real life versions of some the characters the movie (As Barnum would have hated) would have become grounded in realism taking away much of the wonder that Barnum thought was necessary for entertainment.The movie also goes for a stylistic choreographed style seen in many musicals. This style is especially apparent during the musical numbers, full of lights, stunts dancing and complex camera movement. The movie looks great during these scenes and even when there isn't music or dancing it's still present by having great set design and mesmerizing colors. Everybody behind the scenes must have worked incredibly hard and it it really shows. This is movie reliant on these set pieces in which it definitely holds up. There is a part in the movie where someone tries to convince him that drama/plays are a definitive form of entertainment, in which (From what I remember) Barnum says something along the lines of ""Who would want to watch people talk for 2 hours"". Views such of these from Barnum is why I believe the filmmakers decided to make the movie such a flashy, cinematic, musical instead of a drama it could have easily been. This I believe captures what his shows meant and exactly the way Barnum would have wanted a adaptation such as this to be.In conclusion, this movie did a great a great job capturing Barnum, not in sense of character, but more of sense of spirit and gives a grand cinematic retelling of his life. The movie is not perfect, it can be cliche at time and it's fast pacing can seem a bit sudden many times. However, this movie entertained me and memorized me many time and I would recommend a viewing (Especially while it still is in theaters). But be warned if you don't like musicals I doubt you'll like this.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Forget the critics just go have fun.,I'm not much for musicals but love the history of the circus which we no longer have because of political correctness. Anyway I really enjoyed this movie. I'm sure historians can find fault and the dance numbers obviously are more in tune with these days than the early 1900's.

Odd little film,"After loving La La Land, I thought, maybe I'd give this a try. Nope! Not for me. The songs are unmemorable, and everything else was okay. The story has a few plot lines that keep it going but it all feels very surface level? As in the main plot never really took off. It wasn't building towards a climax, it's just events that follow each other but in a film that wasn't slice of life. The characters were also ok. It could have been spectacular, but for me it missed the mark.IMO they needed a better composer, less subtly with the plots (i mean, it's a CIRCUS! Give PT more PERSONALITY. He's a New York Businessman with a dream and determination (and had controversies with workers). You have the stories of the performers too- everyone in NYC (to this day) has a story of where they came from where they're going but they made it so....bland (to me).The positives: cinematography and camera work was really good. The way they planned the camera angles or whatnot was excellent. The sets were great (except the CGI animals- seemed hokey to me). The acting was...okay. The characters were...mediocre. The pacing was okay. The music was okay. It honestly made me want to watch a documentary of the fellow cuz he's an interesting person and this film alluded to that (inaccurately) and didn't make it their own.

Grittily determined to entertain,"The Greatest Showman wants every musical number to be a showstopper. If it were Music Man there would be no ""Til There Was You""; there would just be Ya Got Trouble over and over. Everything is big, flashy, building up to a crescendo that wants the audience to leap to their feet.For the most part, I wasn't leaping to my feet. A few songs rise above the noise, like the anthem-y ""This is Me"" and the zippy ""The Other Side,"" but often my reaction was, oh, this again.Still, the first time I saw this movie was on an airplane, and when I watched it again on TV it seemed better than I'd thought and I raised the score from 6 to 7. Yes, there's heavy doses of auto-tune, a tendency towards pyrotechnical high notes, and a preference for rhythm over melody, all reflective of top 40 radio. But at the same time, the film has some lovely visual ideas, like glittering stars on a ceiling or hung sheets blowing on clotheslines, and the sheer constant hurly burly of big moments and empty flash means that if you don't like what's happening right now, you might well like the thing that's going to happen in 30 seconds.Call it empty-headed fun.

Much more interesting was the relationship of Barnum and his wife - and the threat posed to it by Jenny Lind.This movie should have focused on the most interesting characters, the Barnum family and P.T.'s performers - especially the Bearded Lady, played to perfection by Keala Settle.Well worth the time investment to see this movie, but the script needed a good editor.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

I saw someone say on their review that Zendaya wasn't pretty in this. Honestly they need to go to Specsavers!

Is best viewed in cinema for its non-stop razzle-dazzle and period opulence,"To accord validation to a biopic of the American showman P.T. Barnum (1810-1891), the creator of he Barnum & Bailey Circus (which was closed in May 2017 after 146 years), one cannot bypass its subject's money-seeking avarice and unethical modus operandi, above all, the exploitation of his dysmorphia-scourged menagerie from which he made fame and fortune in the first place, by that yardstick, Australian Visual Effect craftsman Michael Gracey's directorial feature debut is a deep-fried shirker, whitewashing contentions and generalizing conflicts in servile service of a dazzling holiday fare, THE GREATEST SHOWMAN, its star Hugh Jackman's passion project for years, is still a spectacular crowdpleaser even crippled by its craven artistic slant.Gliding smoothly through its slavish rags-to-riches template, the film wallows in its old-fashioned flair and punctuated by eleven anachronistic music numbers fashioned by the songwriting team behind LA LA LAND (2016), as a result they are robustly modern, infectiously hooky and choreographed with a modish MV-style sleekness.Jackman is a real trouper as Barnum and simply amazing to behold and listen to with his virtuoso showmanship (alas, this couldn't be his career-crowning achievement), Michelle Williams is magnanimously given a solo piece to belt out as the benign, perspicacious but neglected wife Charity, yet for my money, the goosebumps-inducing earworms are Efron and Zendaya's trapeze-enhanced REWRITE THE STARS, the impact is more visual than aural though, and the belter NEVER ENOUGH (a pop standard instead of the usual opera piece treatment), from the Swedish Nightingale Jenny Lind (Ferguson), voice provided by Loren Allred. Ferguson, again certifies herself as the most stunning star today who is still endowed with the rarefied classical glamor and poise, we almost immediately forgive Barnum's infatuation with her just because she is that irresistible, who wouldn't capitulate under her spell, which conversely, makes Barnum's resolution to go back to his family nigh on apropos of nothing.That said, THE GREATEST SHOWMAN is best viewed in cinema for its non-stop razzle-dazzle and period opulence, last but not the least, as a picture whose protagonist is patently heralded as a man who promulgates diversity and pluralism, the glaring remiss is that none of the members of Barnum's freak show is vouchsafed even a subplot of their own (the sensational Keala Settle as the bearded lady for instance, deserves her own tale of woe before triumphantly lead the center piece THIS IS ME), a lip service well paid thanks very much!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Listen to the critics, they know what they're talking about","First off, I feel I need to preface this by saying I am not some heartless jockish type who violently hates musicals or spectacular movies. I am a great lover of musicals because of their potential to strengthen the emotional beats of any story through the majesty of song. Moments like ""City of Stars"" in La La Land, which beautifully depicts Seb's resignation in falling for Mia. Or Les Miserables ""I dreamed a dreamed"" that could melt even the coldest heart due to the plight of the completely defeated Flautine. My all time favorite musical, Fiddler on the Roof, is jammed packed with these moments, right from the start and the incredibly delicate yet spectacular world building opening of ""TRADITION!"" These musical moments were God damn earned by their story's plots and that is what is surely missing from The Great Showman.I honestly do not think it is possible to tell the back story of your protagonist as quickly as this movie does! It is a troubling trend nowadays to gloss over the set up of a films hero's life as quickly as possible just to get to the explosive dramatic action of the story, but telling us who and why we should care about a character is absolutely vital for the problems faced by that character to fully hit home. From the little I know about P.T Barnum he seemed to be this incredibly complex and interesting historical figure, so why not explore this in-depth? Do the film makers expect me to do my own deep dive into research into the man, inspired by their superficial exploration of him? I'm not out here looking to get homework after watching a movie, YOU DO THE HOMEWORK! And give me an authentic recollection of his life. It really is not hard and there will still be time for the musical numbers.And this is not only true for Barnum but so so many characters in this movie. You know you are lying to yourself if you did not feel like you wanted to know more about Zendaya's character? Where in the universe did this this incredible trapezes brother-sister duo come from? Indeed all the performers in Barnums circus were such wasted opportunities to help drive the message of the film home. At the very least they could have homed in on one, the bearded lady perhaps? I know those among you who love this movie are going to say that that would have slowed the ""hip and happening"" spectacle of this movie down but for the love of God its not hard work to script in same pieces of dialogue (or I don't know even possibly A SONG perhaps?) That gave us a feel for who these damn people are. But no f-that right? Who cares who they were, I mean its pretty obvious the type of life a bearded lady had, right?Now, you reading this may perceive me of being completely full of shit and some sort of film student, and you would be right! I am still very early on in my studies but the little I have learnt on crafting a story has taught me that every story needs to have an underlying meaning, a lesson the filmmaker wants to teach their audience and indeed themselves through a journey in the lives of characters. As my lecturer says to us, ""Tell the audience that two plus two equals eleven, then prove it to them!"" Writing stories that can inspire change in the world takes a ton of introspection, research, and diving deep into your own understanding and consciousness of a topic and then presenting your findings to the world and this is what annoys me the most with The Great Showman! If you were to take out the songs in this film it would honestly be the filmic equivalent of reading a Wikipedia page and that is such a shame because of the possibilities presented by the topic it was trying to explore. They could have explored race, the entertainment industry, exploitation, ambition, and presented us with an honest and educational finding on these universal issues, but instead they gave us a series of beautiful music videos.I am not making my point well here, but if you want to have a look at what true artistry in storytelling can lead to, check out this ""Lessons from a screenplay"" video about ""UP"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulm7bcB2xvYBut I am done complaining about this movie and I didn't mean to rain on all your parades but as a hopefully future filmmaker is worries me that such an artificial story-line can fly under the radar so easily by just adding heaps and heaps of spectacle. If you truly are a lover of films, you should demand with all you have that the men and woman who are charges to creating the scripts are forced to be as accountable as the incredible work done by cinematographers, sound designers, editors, colourists, visual effects artists, production and costume designers, music composers, and ofcourse the actors; all of whom completely and utterly killed the game in The Great Showman, it just a shame the writer put in such a shitty effort.And go easy on the critics, they love movies just as much as you do...",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Amazing movie, amazing songs, didn't see such a great movie in years!","This was magnificent piece of art, music and deep story. The actors did a perfect job. The songs were so amazing. I really liked that not every sentence was delivered by singing, but that there were just regular speaking parts and songs between. So even if you are not into musicals its very good movie for you. The songs and the energy in them were just awesome. There was not even a second where I would feel bored or not entertained. The story is amazing as well. Although some people may say the main character is in real life not as amazing as in the movie or was just selling not a real truth, well I am here not to judge, everyone has his opinion and no matter how it was, I just take it as it was inspired by some person with a great idea and its not documentary about his life so as a movie if its totally true or not, I dont think it matters. As a movie the story was amazing and very deep. I think everyone should see this movie. I wanted to watch it again right away after it finished.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Roll up, roll up...","It's funny but about this time last year my wife and I watched ""La La Land"", the acclaimed, multi Oscar winning feature which was proclaimed as the great throwback celebration of the Hollywood musical and we were sorely disappointed. This latest movie features a soundtrack by the same songwriting team and of course is likewise a popular hit, both at the box office and the music charts but still we were trepidatious to watch it, but happily this time we got it.Maybe it helped that the characters in this film were easier to like and relate to or maybe it's just that the staging, acting, singing and just the songs themselves were better but whatever the reasons this really was everything we'd expected. Both the title and the story hark back to 50's blockbuster ""The Greatest Show On Earth"" but even if there's occasionally a bit of a culture clash as modern musical stylings rub up sometimes a little incongruously against mid 19th Century Americana, the sheer energy of the piece carries it through.The rise and fall and rise again story of barnstorming circus entrepreneur P.T. Barnum is naturally exciting, evocative and exotic with the viewer rooting for him and his band of underdog misfits all the way. The songs are terrific, the uptempo ones rhythmic and engaging, the power ballads moving and involving. The choreography and cinematography make excellent use of the circus backdrop, while the cast sell it for all its worth, especially the dashing and energetic Hugh Jackman in the title role.In summary then, a wonderful old / new-fashioned musical family entertainment which will have you singing along and tapping your toes to from first to last.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Absolutely marvelous,"This movie is fantastic. I've just saw this movie at the cinema 30 minutes ago and I felt compelled to leave a comment. I'm not a critic and definitely not a fan of musical movies, but this one is just mesmerizing. The music and the acting make you live all the intense emotions, that pass off so easily and naturally from the big screen to the audience, leaving it breathless. Honestly, it has been a long time since I haven't seen such a good movie and for sure I will go to see it the second time.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
19th-century X-Factor,"This musical extravaganza on the life of P.T. Barnum is pitched at the X-Factor audience, much as MOULIN ROUGE was a few years ago. Don't expect to hear Hugh Jackman singing 'Oh What a Beautiful Morning' (which he has sung on-stage). It's not that kind of show. The songs are loud, with repetitious lyrics, staged like pop videos. P.T. Barnum was a 19th-century showman, but this is a decidedly 21st-century show.Zac Efron provides eye-candy for teenage viewers, but the movie totally belongs to Jackman, sounding better than he did in LES MIS and dancing like an Olympic athlete. Political correctness has diluted the 'freak show' with which Barnum begins his circus career - there's a bearded lady (with a fine belting voice), Tom Thumb and dancing Siamese twins, even a 'Wolf Boy', but nothing as grotesque as the Elephant Man, who, with other tragically deformed people, provided the 'lure' for punters into Barnum's circus.

The greatest showman could've been greater,"I can't give this movie a bad rating because of the amazing performances and songs. I'm a musical junkie, and music and presentation-wise, this did not disappoint me at all. I've listened to the songs over and over again.But... I have to explain what bothers me about this movie. I was first introduced to it when a friend of mine showed me the song ""This is me"" - a song where all the misfits of the circus sing about not feeling ashamed of who they are. My friend (and many other people) saw themselves in it, it inspired them not to hide themselves from the world because it's okay to be different.So... Obviously, I was expecting to see more from these characters in the show. I wanted to see them tell their own story, and I couldn't care less about Hugh Jackman's character or Zack Efron and Zendaya. Of course, it was still beautiful, but, from all the stories they could tell, why this one? Why did they choose to focus the story on two white men with nothing unusual about them and their relationship with women, when, in the movie itself, it says people want to see what's unusual? I kept seeing the bearded woman (the most vocal of the ""unique persons"") and wondering when I would get to know her story better. Spoiler: I never did.The message of ""this is me"" falls flat when the movie itself gives the misfits almost no focus and no depth of character, leaving them to be defined by stereotypes.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very good songs and movie,"Though it can be related to Moulin Rouge and La la land but this movie has it own story and hope it deliver a good message to viewers to treat 'freaks' ( well, LGBT people use to be called freaks by some people ) as the same as other 'normal' human being and to accept people no matter who they are. The lady with beard reminds me of Conchita who won the eurovision. Overall i enjoyed watching this movie and not even a second i feel bored. Lovely songs as well. Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Should never have had biography as a description,"This movie was entertaining and reminded me of the circus. The dancing, the animals, the costumes and of course Hugh Jackman singing his heart out. Unfortunately him singing his heart out isn't on good songs. There are some positive lyrics, but overall the music doesn't even remotely fit with the movie if they're going to call it a biography. How it could be called a biography amazes me. Using a couple historical figures doesn't mean biography. On top of that I don't think they could make an historically accurate movie about P.T. Barnum in these pc over charged days anyway.Other than the entirely false misrepresentation of how P.T. Barnum became P.T. Barnum.The other biggest lie is Jenny Lind. Why they would want to tarnish the name of an actual iconic historical figure who was a champion of charity is beyond me. She donated the equivalent of millions to charity in part because of the tour with P.T. Barnum. She never broke contract, leaving of her own accord due to her uncomfortableness with his aggressive promotional techniques. She didn't bring financial ruin to him, he did that several bad investments. But most importantly, she neither loved nor had any romantic feelings for him, never causing the photo that nearly ruined his marriage. She was a hero for charities, basically funding public schooling in Sweden amongst other things and they cheapen her while making him seem even more heroic. All for the sake of a story. Don't use her name then if you're going to fabricate everything else.What this movie should have strove for is not what it tried for. It should have just stuck with a fun movie based on circus life circa now. But wait that's all gone now. So now we just have a sub par circus ""biography.""",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Boring music boring movie lacklustre inaccurate plot,"I cannot fathom why people are giving this a 10/10. This film is astoundingly bad.

The special effects are distracting and pointless. Characters are undeveloped. It's like a family friendly Moulin Rouge covered in icing just conceived to sell a pre-programmed soundtrack designed by a computer to be as inoffensive and unsurprising as possible. If you like musicals and want to watch a modern take, watch Moulin Rouge, Les Miserables, even Beauty and the Beast!

"Humbug Spectacle, Rather Appropriately","""People come to my show for the pleasure of being hoodwinked. Just once, I'd love to give them something real.""The great, self-serving irony of ""The Greatest Showman"" is that supposedly being hoodwinked is what's real, whereas that purported as real is a classist fraud perpetuated by snobs and joyless critics--perhaps, like the very ones who panned this movie (checking as of this writing, it holds a poor 56% score on Rotten Tomatoes). As opposed to the depiction here of the historical figure of P.T. Barnum, however, whose humbuggery hardly extends any further than padding the weight of a fat man or selling a tall guy, for whatever reason, as Irish, the movie itself is largely a fiction debased from the historical record. Nevertheless, ""The Greatest Showman"" is an immense, musical spectacle, and I can appreciate the symmetry of a movie that lies about a showman who likewise deceived. This reflexivity, however, is, again, self-serving and nothing along the lines of, say, ""F for Fake"" (1973) is done with the illusion beyond the preservation of it.I learned a bit about the historical Barnum as ancillary to my studies of itinerant exhibitors of early cinema, who would incorporate some of the same sort of variety acts and showmanship into their entertainments. The scene in ""The Greatest Showman"" of the light-and-shadows show Barnum gifts his daughters is a nice touch in this regard, alluding to the future spectacle and novelty of motion pictures. My favorite scene, too, might be the rebuke of Disney, with a young Barnum stealing a loaf of bread as though he were Aladdin, then, being offered an apple by a woman recalling Disney's typical association of ugliness with villainry in ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937), which makes it kind of ironic that I viewed ""The Greatest Showman,"" originally distributed by 20th Century Fox--a studio since acquired by Disney, on Disney+.I also appreciate the analogy here of racial discrimination with that against the so-called ""freaks"" of Barnum's show, although the fictional interracial romance between two fictional characters hardly rises above an ancestry commercial. And, before turning Barnum into some handsome white savior and although he reportedly became an abolitionist, his start in showbiz wasn't offering dignity to a dwarf; he purchased a person and touted her as the 161-year-old slave of George Washington--later exposing the hoax, too, by charging admission to an autopsy. That doesn't make for a fluffy, sometimes-repetitive musical, though.Since they fictionalized history, however, I still would've hoped they wouldn't do so as to make some of the women in the story less compelling and, in the case of the real singer Jenny Lind, into a libelous homewrecker trope. Michelle Williams, too, as the housewife is wasted. A talented actress, she's proven that she can do well even with small roles (""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005), ""Manchester by the Sea"" (2016), e.g.), but there needs to be some promise to the part--something more than being required to smile and stand by the Hugh Jackman song-and-dance show. Yet, ""The Greatest Showman"" is admittedly spectacular eye candy, with pleasant dancing and musical numbers, including the Oscar-nominated ""This Is Me."" Sometimes it may, indeed, be a pleasure to be hoodwinked.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Greatest Showman is a spectacular film,"This film was truely spectacular, with an amazing plot line, and memorable soundtrack, which successfully tied the story together. This film explains the story without making it a continuous past story, and incorporates the idea of standing up for what you believe in, and chase your dreams as well as the idea that you have to work for success. Hugh Jackson successfully expresses this idea, conveying the idea of never giving up, and how anything is possible if you work for it, and although people may judge you, there will always be a place for you in the world, and how you should stand up for yourself, and not let the way people view you stop you from living the life you dreamed of; and how although you may fail, you have to pick yourself up from the ground and show the people who didn't believe in you, and judged you that everyone has the chance to create something spectacular.

Ending the year on a high note,"O, my god! I knew I was a sucker for musicals but The Greatest Showman just exceeds all my expectations. The songs are catchy, the dance numbers are hypnotic, all the performers look and sound fantastic, and they're all such great singers. None of them fumbles, none of them sound dreadful like Russell Crowe in Les Miserables because almost all of the ensemble in The Greatest Showman can carry a tune. The story is a bit basic but that's ok, it was always designed to be a feel-good movie that's triumphant, extravagant and joyous.Written by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon and directed by Michael Gracey, Hugh Jackman plays P.T. Barnum who came from nothing and marries the love of his life, Charity, played by Michelle Williams. Charity comes from a privileged family, while P.T. Barnum grew up poor. So now comes a chance where P.T. can finally prove that he's more than just some dirt kid from the street, he opens up a circus spectacle that became a big sensation but his ambitions and his desperate need for approval makes him unable to see the joy and happiness that are already there right in front of him.First of all, what you need to know is that this is not a straight up biopic of the actual P.T. Barnum because the actual P.T. Barnum had his controversies. So what THE GREATEST SHOWMAN basically does is take the character P.T. Barnum and put a spin on his story, including his touring with opera singer, Jenny Lind. Zac Efron and Zendaya's roles are that of a young love but their subplot also ties nicely with the drama of Hugh Jackman and Michelle William's characters.And I freakin 'love all the songs featured in this film, I have the soundtrack by the way and I kept listening to it for hours on end, put them on repeat and listen to them again the next day. So addictive. Written by the same songwriting team behind ""La La Land"" but I must say that ""The Greatest Showman"" songs are way better, they stay in your head for days. Kudos on the dance choreographies too, everything about this film's music is so in sync harmoniously, the songs match what is going on at that moment in the story, they compliment the characters' emotions. Another thing that you need to know is that even though the story is set in the '1800s, the music is not meant to sound like it comes from that era, the style is more contemporary or hip-hop, it's meant to give you that grand majestic impression, more like Las Vegas rather than Broadway, if that comparison helps.This of course is not Hugh Jackman's first rodeo in the world of musical, Zac Efron and Zendaya are talented in that department too, so what you have here is a group of talents that are highly skilled at dazzling you with their moves and vocal chords, it helps that easy on the eyes as well. Jackman in particular has that bravado presence about him. But don't be mistaken, this is not some Oscar worthy achievement ala Les Miserables, although.. if it does get nominated, it deserves to be recognized for at least the costumes and the production design, but THE GREATEST SHOWMAN is all about entertaining you with bright colors and it's all about making your foot tap while at the same time celebrating entrepreneurial spirit and celebrating diversity which are something I can definitely relate to. THE GREATEST SHOWMAN is charming, it's uplifting, it makes you smile, it's a great way to end the year on a high note.-- Rama's Screen --",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A fantastic musical,"The Greatest Showman is a celebrative film about P. T. Barnum's knack of showmanship and his relentless drive as an opportunist and a businessman that started with the presentation of the out-of-ordinary as the extraordinary to his establishment of the spectacular spectacles of the Big Top circus. Along the way, as a side line to the story he tackles and crosses the boundary of social and cultural snobbery with himself becoming victimized for a brief moment in his chase to social climbing. The film comes as an upbeat musical that never dwells too deeply into the sociology of class distinction and the acceptance of society's outcasts by the norm. Instead it brings together in my mind the best evocation of ""Moulin Rouge"" in terms of its music which is footstompingly good. The music is boisterous, melodic, assertive and full of life that makes you want to stand up and join the dancing chorus on screen. The other thing it evokes is cirque du soleil.

The taps of his foot and the ease of his movements, combined with his charismatic voice and dapper appearance, are almost mesmerizing. Zac Efron has the same effect on the audience, appealing especially to viewers under 30, and adds a likeability Bring in the rest of the circus squad, as well as the fun dancing of, yes, even Barnum's young daughters, and the film makes a viewer want to get up and dance. If I am being honest, I came home from the showing, found ""The Greatest Show"" and ""This is Me"" on Spotify, and attempted to recreate the dance pieces in my room. The music runs through your body and gives rhythm to the rhythmless. 
The music and dance are not the only parts of the show to be applauded; the storyline and delivery are gripping and memorable. Based on a true story, this film transports the audience into a time that is so distant and almost forgotten, but pulls on the heart and reminds viewers of the hardships of our predecessors and the ingenuity required to rise up from the bottom.

I just loved watching Hugh Jackman sing and dance,"I thought this was an incredible movie, so I was also curious about the overload of criticism. I understand viewers having frustrations about the ""historical accuracy"" of the movie. I knew nothing about PT Barnum's life when I saw this, so I was able to enjoy it as an independent creative piece--which, to me, is what it was meant to be.In and of itself, the movie was altogether captivating from the filming aesthetic, to the music, to the creative dialogue, to the storyline. I finished the film feeling inspired and motivated. It hit the nail on the head, for me, to motivate adults and children's' imagination--reminding humanity of what's most important: love, hope, family, friends, spreading joy, fighting for what you believe in amidst criticism, etc. It shines a light on flawed societal standards of happiness (the American dream) by using unexpected people, methods, and situations to open others' minds, and break them away from fixed, mainstream thinking patterns of materialistic success. Its message sparks excitement and enthusiasm, especially towards those of us who feel inadequate, or ""in the shadows"". It's a motivating and inspiring breath of fresh air.I would hope that all movie makers' of this genre have the goal is to create a story/artwork that invigorates a similar kind of audience response to the one that I had to The Greatest Showman. If I were looking for a biographical movie, expecting a completely accurate historical recounting, I'd go see a documentary.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Greatest Showman: One of the Year's Greatest Films!,"I remember seeing the trailer for this film around Christmastime and while I dug some of the actors I wasn't that impressed with it. A movie musical about the life of circus impresario P. T. Barnum?Cut to the aftermath of this film's opening weekend. It was written off as a box office bomb. Then slowly audiences made it a worldwide sleeper hit. Finally I saw it at a matinee and found it doesn't just grab you by the opening scene, it grabs you by the opening credits. The first of ten incredible songs takes you on this whirlwind musical journey that doesn't stop. Plus it's literally a highly colorful film that lights up the screen.Hugh Jackman as P. T. Barnum is perfectly cast a romanticized version of the flawed, controversial showman. This film was a true labor of love for Jackman, taking him over seven years to get it to the big screen. And much like the critics in Barnum's day, the stuffed shirt critics didn't get or like this film. One critics's review I read actually complained about the treatment of the animals in the film! When any astute viewer could tell all the animals were CGI! Another described the newspaper critic character in the film played by Paul Sparks as a weaselly little move by the screenwriters, guess that character hit too close to home for that douchebag extraordinaire critic! Those who can't do teach, those who can't teach, review.Hugh Jackman and Zack Efron have incredible chemistry in this film and the rest of the supporting cast including Michelle Williams, Rebecca Ferguson, Zendaya, Keala Settle and Sam Humphrey all give fantastic performances. Though I would have liked have heard actor Sam Humphrey's real voice in the film and not dubbing they used.Musicals are all about the music and that's the catalyst that makes this great, albeit imperfect, movie musical great. That and great direction by first timer Michael Gracey.Here's one movie musical headed for its own Broadway show.",,Anonymous,Biography

Good,"The plot for this movie is fine. It takes us on a journey through Barnum's life, from a young boy having to steal to eat, to a confident man blessed with a beautiful family and a successful production. It had humour as well as drama and painted a majestic picture of a man who wasn't afraid to dream big. The soundtrack is good; One song in particular - This is Me, is a stunning song with an amazing vocal. Even though I didn't like the song, In the context of the movie it was very powerful and emotional. The ensemble cast was very good. To be frank nobody particularly stood out as excellent but I think that was largely because the movie was very fair in allowing all the major characters their opportunity to be in the spotlight. It was one of those rare movies where there were no bad performances and the film as a whole benefitted from spreading the songs around. I thought the production design was great as well as the costumes. On the whole, The Greatest Showman is a very good film and is certainly worth a watch if you enjoy musicals.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

The songs were really good.

Thankful it was at the end of the movie before the credits. Personal a can stand a song doing some repeat but when you have My Birds who love repetitive song get mad at it then there's a problem.

Seriously the music was like seven words just changed around throughout the entire movie. It was two hours of looping of a really bad song with a few lines of horrible dialogue sprinkled in there. The dancing was lots of spinning and arm-waving.You get to know NO characters in the movie other than Barnum. Every other character is just filler, fodder, empty actors with no story development, who are just there to wave their arms in garish makeup.I feel like a lot of people were just maybe fooled by the poppy, upbeat tune and the constant spinning and swirling going on that they failed to notice how bad this movie is!The slap in the face here is that I LOVE musicals.

The World of Entertainment as it's Supposed to be,"I am not into musicals, it's not my favorite genre but i can find one enjoyable if it's not full singing and resembles a movie and not just theater.
The Greatest Showman is a combination of the two and it delivers exactly what it's supposed to. Entertainment. It entertains the audience in the movie and at the same time it entertains us.The birth of the world of Showmanship appears difficult with high risk but also high reward. The struggles of visionary and ambitious mister Barnum seem pretty realistic. He does everything he can and goes all in to fullfill his dreams 
against all obstacles allong the way. The enemies are there, and they come in the shape of Fame, Envy, and most importantly Acceptance. As most people he would fall into the trap of fame getting in his head but as soon as he learns his 
lesson he will get out a bigger man. The Circus will bring together all kinds of people for the audience's pleasure. Sure, money and fame are involved but it's larger than that. It's a new kind of show that would only continue to grow in 
the future.Jackman is passionate, Williams is emotional and Effron is cheerfull but also serious in a way we are not used to see him, without relying on his abs and obvious comedy. A great cast and total result in general by everyone involved, and a theme 
that pairs nicely with the music and singing.A nice and positive-mood-bringing watch. ✍8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Look Out Cause Here Comes A Great Film!,"P.T Barnum became orphaned at a young age, left all alone in the world and poor. But that never stopped him from being creative and full of imagination, or a desire to become something memorable in the world.After marrying his childhood sweetheart and being a proud father of two daughters, Barnum (Hugh Jackson) loses his job and struggles once again to make ends meet. Barnum soon gets a creative spark and risks it all with the dream of becoming a Great Showman who presents the odd, the strange and the unique to the world.In case you're not aware, this film is a musical. Being a musical, this will normally scare away many movie goers as the film promises some singing and dancing. But, I'm happy to admit that The Greatest Showman is far more than just another musical film. This film had a great story and fantastic acting.Hugh Jackman (no surprise) is solid as the leading character, once again giving audience members chills and watery eyes from his performance alone. From the opening act it didn't take long for his character to become someone rather fun and likeable. Other acting performances from both Michelle Williams and Zac Efron were also well cast and provided outstanding supportive roles. Going into this movie, I never thought I would come out saying that one of my favorite musical numbers would be a number between Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron.Another point of praise is the film's pacing. Let it be known on social media that I am not a major fan of musical films (more so when they are very sad musicals ...), but this is a musical film that is fast pace and well timed. Even during the Musical numbers, I never felt bored with the musical scene, nor did I ever roll my eyes and think 'oh man not another damn song'. Each song tells a story and that story moves quickly, full of excitement and without feeling dull or uninteresting. All the musical tracks of this movie are new and have many creative elements to them. Combining this with the film's great story, you have film that can be enjoyed by all ages. I enjoyed the film's positive message and I would easily recommend this film be viewed by many.It should have came as no surprise that this film's success has come heavily from another outstanding performance from Hugh Jackman. There is so much praise to be given to the many other cast members such as actress Michelle Williams. I also feel this was an excellent choice for the actor Zac Efron as he took a break from doing crude comedy films. Even if you're not a fan of musical films (like me), this is film that really shouldn't be missed. There is more to enjoy than just musical numbers here- this is film that carries amazing cinema elements and will leave you joyful.8.8/10

"What a waste of celluloid, padon disk space","Sooo producers started paying bots to post early praises by the pound ? Seriously ? :-))))) The ""industry"" has gotten THAT desperate ???? I had to sort by time since ""most helpful"" reviews looked so ridiculous. And then everything became clear.Musicals are usually stupid, pretty much by definition, but the genre manages do produce something good once in a decade. Needless to say that this thing is not in that group. One shouldn't expect anything from a flick that Zac Efron is attached to anyway. And that girl named ""Zendaya"" ?? They should do cartoons with them - to save on ink and labor for frame drawing :-)Hugh Jackman apparently got a water running through his ears after ""Les Misérables"" and ""conveniently forgot"" that Anne Hathaway actually carried that one on her back, together with several equally brilliant actors, and that he was really not much more that a furniture there. Or should we say mise en scène ? :-)Thank god for for the skip button.",,Anonymous,Biography
The worst thing about the Greatest Showman...,"...is the imbalanced audio. Seriously, who did the sound for this film and soundtrack. It doesn't matter if it's the move or the album, you cannot listen to this at a normal level. You'll always have to turn it up for the quiet parts and down for the louder parts. This isn't normal. I watch plenty of shows and movies where you can set a level and just enjoy it even if it's softer or louder without such variation.Okay, complaint aside, I like this movie. I wish we didn't live in a time where Hollywood agendas added annoying context to certain story points, but even aside from that, it's still a great film. No it's not historically accurate but very few films are. There's the difference between ""based on actual events"" and ""inspired by actual events"" and even still they'll take many, many artistic liberties with the truth. But even still this was an enjoyable film. And despite the sound level issues, the music is really powerful too.Hugh Jackman proves once again he's got an incredible range in talent. Not many actors can cross genres as well as he can, especially when it comes to musicals. But he does it with incredible style.The rest of the cast does very well too. Zendaya was wonderful, it was great to see Zac Efron back in the musical scene, and the girl from Dawson's Creek (I'm sorry I don't recall her name), I hardly recognized her but she did amazing too.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

I loved The Greatest Showman,"My birthday was this week and one of the things my wife gave me was a copy of The Greatest Showman. I've heard many of the songs but I've never seen the movie. Is this the greatest show?First off, the music is amazing. They got a great cast with a lot of musical talent. Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, and Zendaya really knock it out of the park. I've heard most of the songs already. (They come up a lot on one of my Pandora stations.) They are great there but seeing them in context takes them to the next level. ""This is Me"", in particular gave me chills when it came up.The Greatest Showman tells a highly fictionalized story of the life of P. T. Barnum and the creation of his famous circus. The story isn't particularly deep but it's well told. Most of the depth comes through the music. To be fair, that's pretty much par for the course with a musical. That's not to say the rest is bad. Far from it. The music just so amazing that the time between songs becomes a nice break before we're hit with the next powerhouse musical number. It's kinda like an action movie except of epic car chases and explosions, we get epic music.Zendaya's non-singing performance really stood out to me. She can portray so much emotion with out saying anything. She practically stole every scene she was in.There are a couple of weaknesses. The effects were serviceable but not amazing. Nearly every animal in the movie looked fake. They don't show up often but they pulled me out of the movie just a bit every time they showed up.The Greatest Showman also glossed over the more ""colorful"" parts of Barnum. For example, one of his most famous quotes is ""There's a sucker born every minute."" He was a conman and a hustler who frequently played on the ignorance of his audience. (Not unlike politicians today. 😉) While he is frequently called a conman and worse by his detractors, you never really see it.Overall, I loved The Greatest Showman. As soon as it ended, I wanted to watch it again. My youngest daughters (who are in their early teens) both really enjoyed it, too. I can wholeheartedly recommend The Greatest Showman to one and all.",,Anonymous,Biography
Greatest Showman is quite simply the greatest modern musical,Like many other reviewers I avoided this movie because of the hype but then found it was one of the films available during a long flight so decided to give it a go. Loved it! The way the music and songs weave so impeccably into the narrative of the film is fantastic and they are just fantastic foot stomping singalongs that you just can't help but sing. Yes there are bits that are a bit cheesy but that makes it all the better. I eventually managed to persuade my hubby to watch it and now he is hooked too!,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Not a bad movie, but there are definitely problems","Decided to give this movie a watch because while critics didn't seem to care for it too much, a lot of moviegoers were all like ""THIS IS THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME"". Do I think this the best movie ever made? Not really, no. Would I go out of my way to watch it again? Nope. That said, though, this movie was pretty decent and I can definitely see why so many people seemed to like it as much as they did.First things first, the high point of this movie was definitely the visuals. Lots of bright colors, smooth scene transitions, great editing and special effects. The movie is really nice to look at throughout, nothing looks bad or out of place.Secondly, I'm not the biggest fan of musicals, but for the most part, I thought the songs in this movie were pretty good! That being said, though, I think the songs that wound up becoming overplayed in other places (A Million Dreams, Never Enough, and ESPECIALLY This Is Me) are the worse ones in the movie. My personal favorites were Come Alive and The Other Side, but I still thought the soundtrack was good overall. There aren't any songs that I would outright call bad.With the positives out of the way, time for the negatives...honestly, most of this movie's issues come from its plot. To put it bluntly, this movie has one of the most contrived storylines I've ever seen. From pretty much the second this movie starts, you'll know how it ends; most conflicts are resolved within like 15 minutes, and the character of P.T. Barnum goes through a very predictable arc of ""guy is poor and ridiculed by everybody -> guy works hard and becomes successful -> guy's success goes to his head and he turns his back on everyone that helped him -> everyone that was wronged by guy turns on him -> guy realizes he was wrong and makes amends and/or goes back to his old life"". Additionally, the beginning of this movie is VERY slow (it's basically one long montage) and up until around the part you hear Come Alive, it's pretty boring. In contrast, the last few scenes of the movie happen so quickly that the ending almost feels abrupt. Despite the movie being over an hour and 40 minutes long, I was definitely left with a feeling of ""wait, that's it?!"".Other problems I had with this movie were more minor. For one, the dubbing's not great. There were a few times where a character's mouth didn't match their voice and it was EXTREMELY visible. The other problem I have is the historical inaccuracy. I get that movies can take creative liberties with these kinds of stories, but come on...major plot points in this movie are things that never even happened in real life. I looked into P.T. Barnum's actual life, and it's so much more interesting and complex than what this movie offers (and he was also a horrible person, something only barely touched on in the movie). Finally (and this is the most minor problem of all), one of the protesters in the middle of the movie was such a horrible actor that it was actually hilarious, even moreso because of this movie's otherwise strong performances.All of the aforementioned problems aside, though, I did like this movie. The visuals were AMAZING, the performances were very good, the songs were catchy, and watching it was a solid experience. It has a nice (if not overdone) message about embracing diversity and overcoming obstacles. You'll leave feeling better than when you came in. Overall, I don't think The Greatest Showman comes anywhere close to being a 10/10 movie, but I DO think the movie is better than critics are giving it credit for. That said, it's not anywhere near as good as most moviegoers say it is, at least in my opinion. It's a lighthearted, enjoyable, family-friendly experience, but it's no cinematic masterpiece. If you're into musicals and ""feel good"" movies, I would absolutely recommend this. If you aren't, I'd say to skip this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Fun Musical With Many Issues,"I've never been over-the-moon about musicals per-say, but any musical that has catchy songs will always have a special place in my heart. If a movie can make me smile through its music, regardless of the quality of the story at hand, then it's definitely doing something right. The Greatest Showman is one of the most recent musicals to hit the big screen and while I don't consider this one a masterpiece by any means, I can definitely see why so many people have hyped up the soundtrack. This is the pinnacle example of a film that works very well, solely due to the fact that it has fantastic musical numbers throughout its entire duration. If you haven't seen this film yet and you're not a fan of the musical style, then I would warn you to stay away, but if you're the opposite of that, then you may have found a new favorite to sing along to.The Greatest Showman follows P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman) as his family suffers from him not being able to hold a job. Promising his wife a magnificent life at a young age, he hasn't given up on that yet. He decides to buy a museum that he would eventually turn into a musical circus, filled with people of all shapes, sizes, colors, and attitudes. This sparks a huge interest in the town and his rise to fame is quite rapid. Yes, I know the story is altered to suit a film because the actual P.T. Barnum wasn't such a nice person, but it works as a movie and that's all that matters when watching. Having said all that, this particular story has been told to death already, so if you're going in for something fresh, I wouldn't bother, unless you're able to ignore that aspect as I surely did.This is a film that you go to for the spectacle of the shows and visual storytelling (albeit brief) because the music is so well-written and catchy you honestly forget about the core story completely. Yes, that's a man to cover up something mediocre, but I would be lying if I didn't call this film remarkable in terms of choreography and music. I've only seen this film once, so I wasn't singing along with any of the music, but when the cues occur, I must admit that I had a few goosebumps appearing.As far as the performances go, everyone here was hired for their stardom. They can both sing and act very well. From Hugh Jackman to Michelle Williams, to the very likable chemistry between Zac Efron and Zendaya, I was grinning from ear to ear whenever any of them were singing on-screen together. Even though the story is basic, it put a huge smile on my face through the ways it let the music tell the story. Even though mediocre at its core, I had an absolute blast watching The Greatest Showman.In the end, this movie won't be remembered as one of the greatest musicals of all time, or even the last ten years, but this is a soundtrack that music lovers will be playing for many years to come, and that alone is a tough feat to accomplish. No, I didn't care all that much about the outcome of the story, but the music itself made me care enough to put a smile on my face, and there is a lot of music, so I was distracted into liking this movie enough to warrant a decent recommendation. Please take this recommendation with a massive grain of salt, though, because if you're not into musicals, this movie will probably have the exact opposite effect for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

I was blown away. Not only did this film hold my attention, but there were parts I caught myself actually leaning forward in anticipation of what would happen next. The cast was well suited, and offered an array of personality and talent. Zac Efron is not my favorite actor, but I felt he outdid himself in this film musically and theatrically. Hugh Jackman was believable, irritating, irresistable and entertaining all the same time. I did not go to this film looking for historically correct tidbits. I did not go to this film because I thought it would be oscar worthy. I went to be entertained.

Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"The first and original story musical telling of the great P.T. Barnum. P.T. Barnum was always a big dreamer, from being homeless and hardly eating anything as a kid he never stopped believing in dreaming big. He lays his eyes on the most beautiful girl by the name of Charity (played by Michelle Williams) and wanted to share with her his dream and wanted her to be part of it every step of the way no matter the cost. P.T. Barnum then has the perfect idea of starting up his own show/circus and hiring different people of different talent. But what he looks for is them being different or is the low life locals in the town call them ""freaks."" Hugh Jackman plays P.T. Barnum extremely well, nothing Oscar Worthy, but definitely the best cast person in the film. His singing, his acting, his dancing..all very unique. The rest of the cast is fine as well..Michelle Williams is beautiful and really good at her acting and singing. Zac Efron plays Phillip Carlyle, a man who also dreams to make it big, but is very cautious of who he works with and what might ruin his career. Efron has his good moments in the film, one highlight in particular was when Efron and Jackman are drinking, singing and dancing in a bar. That was very cleverly executed and set most of the tone to the entire movie. Rebecca Ferguson plays Jenny Lind, a very jealous, spoilt, vicious yet the most perfect singing person! Her singing is definitely a highlight of the film as well.The singing, the dancing the songs, the sets, the designs are pretty much perfect. it really can't get any better. The biggest problem with the film is that halfway into the movie we see P.T. Barnum going through a mid life crisis and stuff that could potentially ruin his career and create break up with his family, it was a very deep subject, and that we would have loved to have seen more of. It lacks so much of story depth and character development which is a shame, because it was so close to perfection! But there is one big scene in the movie where P.T. Barnum says to a vicious, miserable critic ""It's not about the critics...its not aimed for you...it's aimed for audiences."" That was a highlight of the film. 3/5 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Overrated movie with linear plot,"Well, we've seen this movie because of all the good ratings. After About 30 minutest you'll know everything that's coming. The plot is linear, no surprises and no one really tried to take us into the characters. The coming -problems- are constructed and obvious. Actually where is the moral about the people who do really bad things? The story obly leads to a soft-washed moral.Well, of course they tried to create and to motivate and to tell that every person is worth and that you shouldn't care about what people are talking about you. Only the people you love matter... well, that's the whole story. it might mix great films like -lala land- or -finding neverland- or -big fish- but it doesn't reach you emotionally.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

One of the best musical films and best picture in Christmas,"My review is simple. This movie is just great and the best present in holiday.The music and song is one of the best. 
Some of the scenes could be the best with dancing and special sounds created by the glass, wood and chairs - which is rarely found in other musicals.This is one of the few movies that can make me so impressed and sit on the chair to watch the entire credit scene because I just don't want to leave the cinema so early.The box office may be a bit disappointed due to reputation or the film type. But I am sure a good product will have good results. This movie is perfect for children and family to watch and enjoy. The content is so positive and change your feeling from scene to scene.I 100% recommend to whom may like watching La La Land. La La land is a great movie. This Showman is even better from my point of view.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Why do people like this movie ?,"Who on earth said it's a good idea to romanticize the life of the greatest conman / hack P.T. Barnum ? I think what has me even more bitter with this movie is the fact that so many little kids have bought into it because of the soundtrack, which granted has 2 good songs and that's it. The movie tries to make you feel for him, which you probably do if you don't know anything about the guy beforehand, and root for him - cringe. I think Zac Efron does good here, Hugh Jackman sings wonderfully and gives a wasted good performance for a character. The woman who plays the bearded lady has a fantastic voice.The thing is, this movie could be so much better if it was from the perspective of the true victims of Barnum's story, his players. They're the ones who got the worst end of the bit, they're the ones who got one of the two best decent songs on the soundtrack, they deserved to have the movie be about them and tell their story. No idea why they thought it was such a good idea to sympathize with P.T Barnum. Cheesy, annoying, inaccurate film.",,Anonymous,Biography
Enjoyable film,"Out of all the films to come out I was most excited to see the greatest showman.The film was entertaining and showcased some great singing but this was at the expense of a plot which felt a bit thin. There were a bit too many musical numbers that took away precious time from a plot, a deep plot even that this film was capable of. Also the side plot with P T and his affair with the American singer was unnecessary and took the film in different directions. One could not tell whether this was about P.T or the perils of introducing the first circus itself. Nevertheless, it somewhat undermined the perils of the circus and its unique performers. This I feel was the films main attraction. Some creative and careful rewriting and directing could have made this an iconic film. Lost potential but still a treat to watch.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Solid,"A pretty good film, suitable for anyone, any age. The fact that I like it and this is not a genre of film that I usually would, was a pleasant surprise.The signing, acting, characters, plot are all fine, no gripes with them.The morality is never completely clear as to what way you should be feeling, or who you should be siding with, which is a good thing, as there isn't necessarily a right or wrong and it lets the viewer decide.This could have been better though, one or two of songs towards the end, became a little bit of a chore to get through and dragged out a plot which was developing well at the time. They seemed to be included as they had gone ten minutes without one, rather than it adding to the film.The character time could have been distributed better. The Zac Efron relationship was not given anywhere near enough time.All in all though, well worth a watch. You won't find much better at the cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Average: The Musical,"I can understand why people enjoy this film. Ill start this reviews with the positives. This film does successfully make you feel good. The actors seem to be having a great time during this film and some moments between characters are heartfelt. The dancing is great and the excellent cinematography emphasises this. The director also uses lighting brilliantly. It's hard to describe, but you will notice it during this film and like it. The music is good, and although some weaker than others, and another nitpick that I'll get to later, you will have most of these songs stuck on repeat in your head, ""This is me"" definitely deserved the nomination.However when there isn't singing and dancing the film is bland and generic. The characters are very one dimensional and lack character arcs. This was a problem with every character in this film, including the nameless characters. It was very black and white, people either hated the circus or loved it. The director also presented every single rich person as 'snobby and hateful' to the circus. The story of P.T Barnum is an interesting one, however the film didn't do well presenting the struggles of getting a circus, infact, glossed over an entire section of him and the circus late in the film! When it came to the music, it was good, no doubt, however it sounded very present-day for a film set in the 19th century.To summarise, I wouldn't call it one of the great films of the year, however a fan of musicals will adore this film, and the story will deliver for any casual movie goer. I WOULD recommend this film",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

A musical biopic(-like) similar to Disney animations,"Right from the start till the end this movie is mostly narrated through musical performances. Very similar to Disney animation or live action movies. Its very similar that you would want double check whether it is produced by Disney Studios? Apart disney movies, musicals are released very less now. 'La La Land' was good one in recent musicals.Circus performances coupled with VFX is splendid and good visuals. Cinema-photography and video editing was very well executed. All tracks are beautifully composed and synced perfectly to performances. Hugh Jackman has much of the screen time which is not surprising for the titular role. Rebecca Ferguson as Jenny Lind deliver good performance for the role of legendary singer. Keala Settle as the bearded lady had good amount of screen time. She performed it very well. Rest of the casts were wonderful as well.Overall a good family entertainer.

"Modern, overproduced garbage","I don't write many reviews. I have to be really compelled to do and this time I had to in the hope I'll save one poor sod from this tripe.I love music, I love film and I like the odd musical, not as much as opera albeit. This fails on all fronts. All the songs are that overly glossy, auto-tune ridden, derivative, glee-style trash that's so uninspiring. Just like the subject matter itself, there's loads of high production staging, choreography, CGI, etc. to make up for the lack of song writing skill. The big ""never never"" song cones close to decent (notice zero choreography) and the bearded lady's big number is ok but that's just because of proper vocal talent.It's so bad my interest waned after the 2nd song but I forced myself to see it through for a fair judgement. I've watched all of Cats for pity's sake! This is almost as bad. The pitiful story wraps up super fast with no real character development and I couldn't look past it was such a glossing of PT Barnum who was known to be of an unpleasant personality.Do yourself a favour and skip this.

The Singing Duette Trapeze Is A Highlight,"A musical that has overcome the biggest problem that all musicals face, it has to have good songs right? The Greatest Showman overcomes this by having one good song and then repeating it over and over throughout the movie.I would have appreciated more tunes but they really are quite limited.The tale of P. T was really well presented, filled with lots of light and colour. Its also really well acted by the leads and the many co stars.The other issue I had with the audio was the quality was so good that you 'hear' it as a dub rather than fall into the illusion that they are singing it directly to you if that makes sense. The human elements of the singing were missing. It sounds weird but that's how it came across.Look overall everyone but your average teenage boy will like it :)",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Entertaining musical, if you like musicals.","'THE GREATEST SHOWMAN': Three Stars (Out of Five)A period musical about how P.T. Barnum started the Barnum and Bailey Circus. The movie stars Hugh Jackman as Barnum, and it costars Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, Zendaya and Rebecca Ferguson. It was directed by debut feature filmmaker Michael Gracey, and it was scripted by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon (Condon is also well known for his writing on musicals like 'DREAMGIRLS', 'CHICAGO' and the 81st Annual Academy Awards). The film has performed modestly at the Box Office, and it's only gotten mixed to negative reviews from critics, but it was nominated for three major Golden Globe Awards (including Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, Best Actor - Comedy or Musical, and Best Original Song). I like how the movie deals with making outcasts into heroes (of course), but I always take offense to animal cruelty (like a circus is obviously guilty of). The film as a whole is a decently made musical, but nothing more.The story revolves around the immensely ambitious entertainer, and showman, P.T. Barnum (Jackman), and how he convinced a bunch of outcasts to be a part of his show. Which famously became the first circus (later becoming the traveling 'Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus'). The movie of course deals with all of the hardships he faced, and opposition from society. It also deals with Barnum's romantic and family issues at the time.The film is an entertaining musical, if you like musicals, and it's packed with colorful musical performances. Jackman, Efron, and others, are of course talented entertainers, and musical performers as well, so you can't argue that they weren't well cast in the movie. I also (of course) always find stories about making outcasts into heroes inspiring. The film doesn't introduce animals into the circus act, until the very end of the movie, but I (of course) have issues with that, and circuses in general too. The movie as a whole is decently made, and a mildly amusing musical.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pleasantly surprised,"Let me start by saying that I am not typically a musical fan. I actually can only think of one other musical that I really enjoyed enough to see more than once. Zac Efron is the common denominator in my taste in musicals because the version of Hairspray that he stars in is the only musical I can think of that I really love, or even like. I can't wait to see the Greatest Showman again. The storyline made me really want to know more about PT Barnum but also makes me fear learning more. I loved his character and don't want to be disappointed with facts especially if they shed him in a less flattering light.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Energetic entertainment,"I had to find out what the fuss was all about, so I finally sat down today and gave The Greatest Showman a try. My expectations were not too high, but I've always loved musicals and I did like this one, though it's certainly not a classic and could have been much better. I do see why this has become a big audience hit - It has such energy and commitment, the musical numbers are well staged and the songs are mediocre but a couple are quite good. It's all directed with economy and is frantically energetic, with Hugh Jackman and the cast excellent, however, the film is let down a bit by a cheesy script and story, using a rather shallow and contrived plot rather than a bit more of the real story of Barnum, which could have given the film a bit more substance. All considered, if you are looking for wholesome musical entertainment with family appeal, energy and engagement, this might be it, but it is far from a classic.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Mixed basket of very good, ordinary and the slightly unoriginal","I love music, so as this is a musical, I will begin here. I have seen comparisons to LA LA Land. Totally different films, but where they can be compared, the music in this film is no comparison. Simplistic, unoriginal and repetitive, it borrows from many already tired pop riffs. In terms of acting and the show, Jackman brings this to life. Williams and Efron also do a solid job. Although not a fan of her music, Zendaya brought energy and grace to her role. Yes there were very good, nigh excellent elements. But the drought of originality, not of the concept, but of the delivery, totally underwhelmed me. Also, although the script was not dry, it did lack mystique, as many of the events and interactions were reasonably foreseeable. That all said, aside from the music and the simple script, the better elements bring this show up to a level of entertainment worthy of not regretting the watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

The story is focused on Hugh Jackman's character 90% of the time. 10% is given to Zac Efron and Zendaya. I was a bit skeptical at the previous actor's I mentioned duet but seeing it and hearing it in the movie makes complete sense, plus remember this takes place before the Civil War in America.

The Greatest Showman,"Like many other folks, I have a sort of allergy to hype: particularly when it is built on power ballads and an actor who just doesn't ""belong"" in the role. I also saw Michael Crawford doing his ""Barnum"" thing on stage in 1982 - so to be fair, my expectations of this were not especially high. I was pleasantly surprised! Jackman as the street urchin son of an itinerant tailor with grand dreams is really pretty good. He brings oodles of charisma to the part of P. T. Barnum determined to win the love of ""Charity"" (Michelle Williams), despite her being from a wealthy family living well beyond his meagre means. The chronology of his actual achievements - his marriage, family and his American Museum of Curiosities morphing into a circus of all things diverse from the human race - including Sam Humphrey as ""Gen. Tom Thumb"" and a super Keala Settle as the ""Bearded Lady"" - is well enough documented and this musical version pretty much follows the rags to riches tale of this inspirational and aspirational man as he taps into the lucrative vein of giving the public what they want. That public is, however, not the one he wants - he wants the toffs, too - so enlisting the help of debonaire, bored, theatre producer Zac Efron ""Philip Carlyle"" they head to the UK for an audience with Queen Victoria - the epitome of ""acceptable society"" at which he meets Jenny Lind - the legendary Swedish singer and his fortunes seem to be unstoppable... Efron is good, too - you are reminded of just how far he has come since his ""High School Musical"" (2006) days; as is Rebecca Ferguson in the role of ""Lind"". I have to say that I found the songs a little bland; the film lacks a killer song - ""A Million Dreams"", ""Come Alive"" and ""Rewrite the Stars"" do get the toes tapping, but they meld into each other leaving a pleasing, but unmemorable soundtrack to this charming family drama. It's good, not great - and far better than I was expecting.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Most of the negative reviews focus on it's disparity with the real story of PT Barnum. Granted, he was the worst, but this is not ""based on a true story"" but ""based on the imagination of PT Barnum"". They also complain about it lacking depth or realism. Come on, guys. Can we not enjoy happy entertainment now? The movie's message is about acceptance and embracing what makes you unique.

It's not just a movie but a fine story.,"Yes this doesn't follow the Negatives with P.T Barnum as people will be ready to tell you. However this movie needs to be focused on the story it tells and it's powerful vocals. The Tony nominated song ""This Is Me"" is one of my favorite musical pieces in the film where the choreography to ""The Other Side"" is a fun watching experience. This film highlights the high and some of the low points of Barnum's career, but like most things in Hollywood the tale should be taken with a grain of salt.I might get flack for saying this but because of the imagination, music score, and overall unique feel to the movie it is probably my favorite film of the year.If you, like me, are tired of Super Hero movies, Star Wars movies (I said it), or feeling overall let down by lack of imagination, and feeling like movies just want to focus on showing off technology. This movie is your saving grace. I am making plans to see it at least 1 more time while it's in theaters because it did an amazing job of catching my emotions and holding on.I have seen musicals dating back to the 1930's and this ranks up in the top 10 of that list, and it's a big damn list. Loren Allred (singing voice of Jenny Lind), Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron and Zendaya have amazing vocals. However, personally I think Keala Settle who plays the Bearded Lady deserves as much praise as the others. I would like to hear more of this Broadway talents vocals. Like LaLa Land, The Greatest Showman feels like it takes you back in time to when Musicals dominated the market. The two in charge are going to greatly usher in a new age of amazing music composition for musicals.

The number of 10/10 reviews on this website were enough to get me excited.However, what a mighty letdown. For once the critics git it right. This was a movie that wanted to be a musical masterpiece, but instead turned up with songs that were simply painted by numbers, nothing original here. I was hoping for another La La Land, but instead got High School Musical in a tent!Cringingly melodramatic set pieces designed to manipulate the viewer into empathising with its characters, The Greatest Showman pretends to be a solid ode to showbusiness, but offers up no real depth at all. Poor old Hugh Jackman tried, but with the script and music he was stuck with, and the way the musical pieces were introduced within the action, it was just too twee for even he to overcome.From a cinematography point of view, the production values were high, but that was it. Very little insight into any of the cutout characters, poor delivery of the musical component which never matched the period setting, manipulative set pieces designed to tell a character's backstory quickly without spending any time to pull away the layers,... OMG this was cynical moneygrabbing filmmaking 101.Yeah, I really wanted to like this movie. But what I got was a glitzy, noisy, pseudo jolly but ultimately hollow rendition of a Hollywood musical. Even the ending was contrived and rushed.Go and see a real musical, like La La Land or Nine... they had style too, but importantly they also possessed substance. Much like Barnum's business model, The Greatest Showman movie is a fake... ""people know they are seeing a fake, but they'll still come!"" I'm sad, but it's a fact.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
I hate musicals - but I loved this one!,"I also don't see movies at the theater more than once, but will be seeing this one again and perhaps again! This movie gains from a big screen and a great sound system.Don't think of this as a movie and certainly not a period historical piece, but rather as a very entertaining and well done Broadway Show with songs that will happily stick in your head that just happens to be at your local theater.The choreography was amazing! From the glass tapping bar scene to the utterly amazing high wire duet, this has unique moments.This is also a great film for all ages which can't often be said these days, and I do mean all ages.I usually like the independent style films with good critic and user reviews and this one I almost skipped because of that 50 percent critic rating. But sometimes when the critics either hate it or love it and the users mostly love it, we get to the sad situation, much like the critic portrayed in this film that the critic has lost the ability to just go have fun at a movie!To have so much visual effect all beating to the same music and almost magically meshing and with all the directional sounds of a good theater sound system being put to good use speaks to suburb post movie editing and crafting.There is not a lot of history hear but a message of joy, acceptance, imagine, and achieve your own dream.I loved it!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Good Musical. Inaccurate History,"I both loved and disliked this movie for completely different reasons. I loved this movie in part because it's enjoyable, entertaining and for the most part it delivers on what is promises. The songs were fun, they were catchy. The acting was pretty good. It is a feel good movie with a lot of touching scenes. However, the story is meant to be loosely based on the life of PT Barnum and the story in the movie bares little resemblance to the actual life of the real PT Barnum, whatever is based on reality is very mundane and vague that the movie producers could have easily made this film about a fictional character that had ambitions to kickstart a circus and it would have been completely fine. Most of the story here is fictional anyways and for good reason. The producers have took liberties in sugarcoating this movie from the actual exploitive nature of its history and turning it into a fun loving and for the most part family friendly musical. Gotta give them props for making a bleak and unpleasant experience joyous but nonetheless that doesn't completely eradicate the fact that this story is meant to be based on PT Barnum who isn't a very lovable character.Anyways, just thought I'd throw this trivia out there for anyone thinking of watching this movie. For the most part this is still a good movie to watch with touching emotional scenes. I do recommend you watch it, but bear in mind that it has very little links to actual reality of what PT Barnum was like as a person.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Much style, little substance","The story of PT Barnum, famous for founding Barnum and Bailey Circus and revolutionising entertainment.Much style, little substance. Some of this is to be expected, as you can't have a movie on a showman extraordinaire and one of the most significant figures in entertainment history without a large amount of pizzazz.However, the movie doesn't really give us much of Barnum's history or motivations. The main focus seems to be on cramming as many song and dance numbers into the movie as possible, at the expense of any plot. For every minute of plot or character development you have four minutes of musical numbers.To crown it all, the music is poor and irritating. Every musical number sounds like something from a made-for-kids animated Disney movie, rather than a biopic. The movie is set in the mid-1800s yet we have ultra-contemporary numbers. It is quite jarring and negates any semblance of historical accuracy, credibility or substance.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gave me goosebumps the minute the movie started.,"This movie was so beautifully put together. The music and choreography was so colorful and entertaining; probably my all-time favorite thing of this movie. The overall story line was fantastic as well. I promise you that you will never be bored watching this movie. However, I would have liked to see more character in Zendaya's character Ann, but her scenes were still pretty refined as she makes up for this since she had performed many of her stunts in the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

I just dont know how anyone could not love this film,I was extremely tired the night I saw this after a hard week and told my friends just bump me away if I fall asleep and start snoring. From the opening moment I was riveted and in awe. Its fast paced. The music and singing was amazing. Hugh was incredible along with all the other actors (I single him out for his enthusiasm in the movie and he is the lead after all). On leaving I said 'this time next week we see that one again'. That movie is the best movie I have ever seen and believe me I have seen a lot. Interesting the movies the critics love are absolute snoozefests and they criticize this one? Its not meant to be accurate to the real story or the opera singer would have been singing opera and the songs wouldn't be modern. What an absolute delight this movie was.

A Vibrant Celebration of Dreams and Individuality,"The Greatest Showman is a vibrant, emotionally charged musical that celebrates individuality, ambition, and the power of dreams. As someone who loves musicals, I found it to be an absolute joy to watch, and my appreciation for the genre made me enjoy it even more. While it may not be a perfect film, its strong emotional impact and uplifting message make it a memorable experience. The film's themes of acceptance, perseverance, and self-belief strike a deep chord, and songs like ""This Is Me"" and ""Never Enough"" are powerful anthems that leave a lasting impression. Hugh Jackman shines as P. T. Barnum, bringing charisma and depth to the role, while the supporting cast, including Zac Efron, Zendaya, and Keala Settle, deliver heartfelt performances that enhance the emotional weight of the story. That said, while the film is emotionally impactful, the story occasionally leans into clichés and lacks deeper exploration of its themes. Still, as a musical lover, I was swept away by its energy, music, and spectacle, making it a thoroughly enjoyable experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A SPECTICLE,"A fantastic film, with wonderful, uplifting music by incredibly talented songwriters. I had goosebumps within the first two minutes of the film. I had a hard time finding something to dislike about the movie, I couldn't stop smiling throughout the whole thing - which I suppose would be the only criticism I had. It seemed to take a long time for their to be any major conflict in the film, and the ultimate problem never occurred until the last act. I related the film very much to a stage musical, both in structure and content, it was build build build positively for more than half the film, then a brief problem was quickly resolved towards the ending.Overall, I loved this film, as I said I couldn't stop smiling. Beautiful music by Pasek and Paul, and a wonderful, artistic, and theatrical story told.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Greatest Showman works better as a musical then telling the story of P.T. Barnum,"Ladies and gentleman! Boys and girls of all ages! Welcome to the circus! This was a statement that I heard at least once a year whenever the circus came to town. I'm not talking about the more artistic acrobatics of Cirque du Soleil, but the three ring shows that come with a tent, clowns, animals, and the rest of the entertainers who have chosen to use that to showcase their talents. As a child, seeing all these elements together was magical. As an adult, I do question their place in today's bigger world of mixed media. How can a circus that comes once a year compete with specific shows, film, Internet, and zoos?People have to understand that before all of that was created, the circus was often the only place to see the clowns, elephants, and such. True, there was a darker element to the factor on just how far the people behind the scenes would push themselves and others. But if they were good at something, they knew how to entertain. They've built businesses out of it, including those of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Baily (both now closed). The story of one of the originators, P.T. Barnum, is now showcased in The Greatest Showman.We learn that as a child, P.T. Barnum grew up with a tailor father, but liked to make others smile...including a young Charity Hallett. Years later, P.T. (played by Hugh Jackman) meets with Charity (played by Michelle Williams), they marry, have two daughters, and try to make something of their lives. Though everyone is content with their lives, P.T. is let go from an accounting job while he dreams of something better for his family. While entertaining his children, he gets an idea to bring the world of the mysterious and unknown to everyone.He gets a loan and opens Barnum's American Museum, to showcase wax figures, odd exhibits, and anything he can make to invoke a greater wonder within the world. The public is resistant. Lower ticket sales gets P.T. to start hiring live performers including midget ""Tom Thumb"", a bearded lady, and acrobat Anne (played by Zendaya). This brings in more people, but local critics are unimpressed. The museum (later named a circus) becomes popular enough that P.T. hires a famous playwright Phillip (played by Zac Efron) to try to help run the show and make it appealing for everyone...including the upper class.The Greatest Showman is trying to do a lot of things. It tries to make P.T. Barnum likable and conflicted, it tries to show the merits of the circus, it tries to make you sympathize with his freak show, and it tries to be historically accurate. Oh, and it's also a musical. Does it all come together? Not all the time, but I can't deny that I enjoyed myself. Seeing this is a lot like a real circus; it's full of talent and has a lot of effort put into it, but what is it leaving behind?My problem with The Greatest Showman is that we only get glimpses at the real P.T. Barnum. Hugh Jackman does great with the material given to him, but given how the real life figure was a debunker, a salesman, and even a representative of Connecticut, I got more of an edited version. The same goes for Zac Efron, Zendaya, and the others that work in the circus. There's a lot you could have done to show the conflict of exploiting their ""specialty"" while finding a home. I'm glad we do get the conflict of a man who wants to climb socially, yet isn't sure if his show can come with him.How is it as a musical? It's probably the best element. I'm sure that the overall intention of this movie was to make it as such. What's interesting is that all the songs and music have more of a modern sound (trying in replicate what Hamilton did on Broadway). It does work in it's favor, though not all the songs are memorable. The one I liked the most was ""This is me"", which I'm sure will get a lot of song nominations.I'll give this six circus elephants out of ten. The story of the real P.T. Barnum is fascinating, but The Greatest Showman only scratches the surface. I can't say it was for nothing, as the musical sequences are fun and I did care about parts of the story. If you like musicals, you'll get into this. Families are more or less the target, so I might as well say to check it out if you like the circus.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Critics Begone! The Greatest Showman is the Greatest Musical...,"Just came back from a showing and am simply buzzing, simply the best musical I've ever seen in all my days, and by far one of my favourite films in general! 
Hugh Jackman shook free of his ""Wolverine"" association with his breathtaking performance with such ease, it'd make both Daniel Radcliffe and Elijah Wood green with envy.
Best known for angrily shouting and tearing people limb from limb, Hugh Jackman proved he's far more than a single character actor, emitting such a joyful smile onscreen that it was impossible NOT to smile back at him. 
While the critics poke at the historical accuracy and attempt to pick apart the plot and choreography, I for one was enthralled with this excellent production. 
This movie was designed to entertain, dazzle, and bring smiles to the viewers, and that's EXACTLY what this movie did.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
First viewing: hated it. Second viewing? Loved it.,"I first came across P.T. Barnum while doing some research for a project I was working on about Wunderkammer, or cabinets of curiosities. Barnum was many things - certainly complex - but he was not a nice man, and an egotist to the extreme.Being at least vaguely familiar with Barnum tempered my initial viewing of the film, though it's hard not to like the songs and set pieces. Barnum here is a sympathetic, though flawed figure, and we're supposed to believe he was a benevolent employer and all-round good guy.The Greatest Showman is best described as a historical fantasy. (Most of) the characters were real and some of the events depicted were real, but that's more or less it. It's best to approach it as fantasy rather than a historical, rather like 300. The artistic license has been taken to new extremes - it's a rather politically correct history.This irritated me on my initial viewing. The film ignores - completely - some of Barnum's more shady enterprises, including slavery. While it makes some attempt to look at other issues, including an interracial relationship and the promotion of 'freaks' for money-making purposes, it's puddle deep. Character development is thin on the ground (at one point, Hugh Jackman's Barnum makes it clear his 'freaks' are unwelcome to a swanky reception, which prompts Keala Settle's Lettie Lutz to sing 'This is Me' - the film's signature anti-bullying song - but all seems to be forgiven immediately)There's definitely a place in the film market for a biopic of Barnum's life and works, because that would be fantastic. This is not it. Nevertheless, I watched it again recently and just let myself relax and enjoy it. Do this, and it's an extremely enjoyable film. It's beautifully filmed. You could pause it at any point and print out the still and you'd be happy to have it framed on your wall. Performances are all-round spectacular. If you're like me and you're more used to seeing Jackman murdering people with adamantium claws then you'll be seriously impressed by this man's extraordinary talent. He can sing. Really, really well.Songs like A Million Dreams, This is Me and The Greatest Show will bring a smile to your face - you'll have to really fight it from forming if you're determined to be a cynic.It's a little corny and in places overly sentimental. I wish they'd added just a little more depth to it and given some of Barnum's performers proper subplots, as opposed to Zac Effron's mostly forgettable Philip Carlyle.All in all, it's just fun, and that's absolutely fine. You're allowed to have fun and just enjoy a show. After all, this is what Barnum did: he was a showman. It didn't matter if that show was based upon fakery, lies and exploitation - he entertained people who wanted to be entertained, and that was all he pretended to do. That, probably, is the essence of this film, and honestly I don't care.So if you're like me and tend to be a bit pedantic and naturally critical, treat yourself to a bottle of wine, let your brain stew a little in the alcohol and let yourself be entertained.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Barnum Was Not A Hero,"Hugh Jackman WAYYY over glamorizes PT Barnum in this film. They should have just changed the names and some of the facts to make it total fiction, but they didn't. PT Barnum was responsible for COUNTLESS intentional & horrific deaths to circus animals starting from his circus's inception.
This film also gives saint-like motivations to PT Barnum for his using conjoined humans and animals and other ""oddities"" for financial gain.
Just google it to see for yourself as there are many, many reputable articles from the last few days telling the truth about this opportunistic man.
It's all very sad that Mr. Jackman didn't think this through because the cast and crew are obviously very talented and turn in some fantastic performances.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

My 23 year old brother said this was one of top 3 movies he's seen in his life and he's not a huge fan of musicals, and one of only two movies he's gotten a tear from. It's a beautiful movie in every way and extremely well made! The choreography is great, the dancing is phenomenal, everyone's voices were incredible and the story was extremely inspirational!Yes, there were some things I didn't like about the movie, like how they twisted the story of the Swedish nightingale Jenny Lind (maybe I got offended by that because I'm from Sweden, haha) but even though it wasn't all true it did make for good screen time and that's also important in movies, so I'm OK with them changing certain things from the real story to make a good movie and musical on screen!After having had really high expectations for only to get really disappointed by La La Land last year, it was amazing to be able to see a truly good musical on screen again!

In the end I enjoyed the film, but at times I wanted it to be over.The directing is great, the choreography is awesome, but I felt like many of the scenes didn't need singing and music. A story like this can be told musically, but the lyrics have to be important and meaningful, because without that, it's unnecessary.

However it was a Christmas present for a dear friend of mine and her son so I was under contract!Being a bit of a romantic I was hoping it would be entertaining. I didn't expect too much and frankly was more interested in my vanilla ice cream coated in butterscotch sauce and topped with nuts.Suddenly I was a wash with the opening song. Before you could say popcorn I looked up from my tub of Ben and Jerry's and suddenly found myself totally taken by the young boy singing. That was probably at about one minute and five seconds into the movie.From then on I forgot I had an ice cream. I could hardly hold my breathe.So let's just say it's worth seeing. If you want to be lifted and inspired by heart tugging lyrics. Show stopping music and eye popping visuals then go and see this movie.I haven't left a movie with the feeling 'anything is possible' for a long time. I have had a few hard painful years recently, but this movie put a spring in my step. That's saying a lot.So yeah I would say it's very possibly 'The Greatest Show on Earth'.Anything that can make a person feel that good has to be worth talking about right?

If people want to view him that way, fine, but being a businessman and self-promoter is not heroic in itself. It feels like the film's story was unduly influenced by politically correct revisionism.The film has plenty of energy, which reminds me of Baz Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge"", but in comparison it falls short.I recommend this film for anyone who enjoys musicals, but it could have been better If it had tracked closer to historic truth, making Barnum more human, less heroic.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"An Immensely entertaining, if unfocused, musical","I can easily imagine this film being an issue for some people. It takes a controversial historical figure, and invents an almost entirely fictional version of his life that portrays him not as the flawed capitalist who exploited people to make his riches that he was in real life, but as a passionate entertainer that gives the 'freaks' in his show an opportunity to express themselves.Also, the music is very separated from the tone and the setting of the story itself. The film is set in the mid 1800's, but all of the music is post-2010's pop anthems. Every song feels out of place within a true historical world, and most of the music feels more like Top 40 stuff you hear on the radio.But...I still like it. It's fun. It's really fun. It's a movie motivated not by plot or history or character, but by pure emotion. The music especially portrays this incredibly well. Songs like Rewrite the Stars, The Other Side and For Now On are just fun to watch and listen to.If you don't like the music, there's nothing for you here.

Behind the Popcorn with Jacob Mello,"A movie that proves, once and for all, it doesn't matter if you're tall or short, fat or thin, black or white, bearded or shaved - ANYONE has the power to become mediocre.Heading into this one, I felt the same way as most people, I assume - pissed at my lack of options this close to Christmas. The good news is: it was much better than I thought it would be! The bad news is: that's still not that great.Look, I don't claim to be an expert in the musical genre (a strategy I'd recommend to most) but it seems pretty apparent to me that when making a movie set in the 1870's, you should write your soundtrack around traditional folk music - or hell even big band stuff, we're willing to work with you here - that way, you immerse your audience in the times and set the scene a little. Instead (and I get why, but that doesn't make it anymore forgivable) this group decided the move was to go as 2010's era pop ballad heavy as possible. I can practically hear the KIDZ BOP version already (that's still a thing, right?).The music wasn't bad, it just didn't fit. Not only in genre, but in terms of the lyrics coinciding with the characters actions. The sideshow performers constantly sang about dancing to the beat of their own drum and telling the world to look out. ""I make no apologies, this is me!"" they would boast. this all of course until the slightest glance darted their way from the Hhhwhite, patriarchal, one percenters. Cue in The Greatest Showman himself - Mr. P.T. Barnum. The creator and controller of said sideshow. We first meet him as but a humble man with a dream - and a handful of dance numbers to go along with his songs about being a humble man with a dream. The problem is, as the first act ends, it becomes more and more clear that his big ""dream"" is pretty much just to somehow get filthy rich to spite his father in law. Believe me, I get it. I mean, damn it, do I get it! But that's not exactly as inspiring a journey as the songs would have us believe.The real acrobatics in this film were in how they managed to contort the P.T. Barnum story to fit this cutesy 'we're all the same, yet unique' narrative. That being said, even after ignoring the fact that they omitted some seriously appalling details from the real-life story in order to carve out this vibrant wholesome circus tale, the plot was still iffy at best (a man realizes he can profit off the talent, sweat and spectacle of a minority of people who are seen, in their own time, as being subhuman). It was Hugh Jackman's powerful performance as Oskar Schindl-P.T. Barnum that kept this circus alive. A performance I dare say is easily in the running for his second best musical performance in which his characters life trajectory changes after stealing a loaf of bread. 
This film won't stand the test of time and only got as far as it did by juggling around some low hanging fruit, but if you don't care about historical accuracy and are just looking to see some fun dance numbers, eh, it'll do for now.Prescriptions

Music is ridiculously out of place,"I asked my friends if they had suggestions for musicals similar to Moulin Rouge or Phantom of the Opera, one suggested this, this is not that.The songs are all this airy, 2010's pop and the voices and music are just so bizarrely out of place from the rest of the movie.

Wow!!! Did NOT expect this to be so GOOD!!!,"We just saw The Greatest Showman tonight and it was simply one of the best movies we've seen in a long time! We didn't see it during the holidays and were surprised to find it's still at all the theaters since the movie critics reviews were so-so at best. We actually had to go to our second choice theater because our first choice was sold out. From the very opening scene you know this is a special movie. The sets, costumes, acting choreography and the MUSIC are magnificent!!! It is extremely entertaining and just makes you feel good. Our second choice theatre was sold out as well with people of all ages - including a LOT of young 20's and teenagers - and at the end the entire audience applauded. That's something I haven't experienced very often. And people were walking out after the movie smiling and talking about how much they loved the movie. Ignore the ""professional"" critics - they forget we go to movies to be entertained and escape the cruel reality of our current days and this movie does that!!!",,Anonymous,Biography
The Perfectly Adequate Showman,"The Greatest Showman, despite being a huge hit, is not anything great. It's just perfectly adequate. I mean, there's definitely some really cool things about it, it's very energetic, but other than that, it's just... adequate!What's the story? Inspired by the imagination of P. T. Barnum, The Greatest Showman is an original musical that celebrates the birth of show business & tells of a visionary who rose from nothing to create a spectacle that became a worldwide sensation.Now, don't get me wrong, I LOVE Hugh Jackman. He's very good at playing the Wolverine in the X-Men movies, and he's also very good in The Fountain. In this film, however, you can definitely tell he's giving it his all, but his performance isn't quite as good as what he had to offer from the other films he was in. He seems to show not much emotion in certain scenes, often affecting his fired up nature and ambitious personality. The rest of the acting is pretty good, especially when it's time for them to sing. The musical numbers in this film are FANTASTIC! Well, most of them. Tightrope wasn't really that good and they overplayed A Million Dreams by a million. Fortunately, the rest of the songs, especially Rewrite the Stars, This is Me, and The Greatest Show are very good songs filled with energy, and are also a lot of fun to watch. The choreography is very well done, even if it can get a bit silly sometimes, and make the musical numbers both a spectacle for the eyes and the ears. However, not everything is so good about the film. For instance, the movie is extremely historically inaccurate, an example being P.T. Barnum's character is more brighthearted despite not being that kind of person in real life, there's all of these unnecessary matches that didn't happen in real life, and it's played to be more of a fantasy than a historical film. Which isn't that bad, I mean, it's worked in a lot of Disney films, but in a live-action retelling of a famous showman, it doesn't work here, making the writing feel rough, inconsistent, and even terrible at times. Another thing I'd like to point out is that the characters themselves aren't very interesting nor compelling, and I feel like their sole purpose is to create unnecessary subplots that don't go anywhere in the story.In conclusion, The Greatest Showman has got some good things, as well as having some bad things, and in the end, it's nothing short of adequate. It makes a good family film, but that's about it. If you REALLY wanna see a movie about the story of P.T. Barnum's career taken into a more sugar-coated Disney-esque fashion, then go all in for it. But for those looking for a top-notch musical film that also serves as a historical film, no offense but this DEFINITELY isn't for you. Watch it once, maybe again, and that's all you need with this film. Not exactly the best movie to see, but it's not the absolute WORST film ever. Critics hated it, audiences loved it, I'm... sort of in the middle. What can I say but, P.T. Barnum has never felt this average before.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Unbearable, commercial shmaltz.","From the very outset, I should have known what I was in for.The movie begins with a pounding, stomping, stadium-chant, done in ""We Will Rock You""-esque fashion.And this chant doesn't stop. Over and over and over and over and over....and OVER until I wanted to claw my eyes out! And certainly would have if it were not for the fact that I actually rented it on Amazon for a $2.00. discount. Thank goodness I got it in SD and not springing for HD. But it's my own fault. I should have read the critic's reviews beforehand. Mea Culpa.But back to the agony. True to form, this film delivered on every emotionally-manipulative, late 2000's trope I expected-and with that darn, soppy, mind melting song to match. A song the producers were darn sure would work it's way into our National conscience like, ""My Heart Will Go On"" ( which is a heck of a great tune and performance!)In short, if you blubber in proud, heartfelt, joyful tears to shows like ""The Voice"" and ""American Idol"", this movie will have you cheering, as it's a modern interpretation of old-time movies. But that comparison isn't quite fair. Those movies had a genuine character to them. There was an honesty in many of those homespun tales. It was hard to be cynical about them because they spoke of genuine shared values- no matter how dated they might seem by today's standards.But here, I simply found the whole thing unbearable. And now to wash this commercial shmaltz out of my mind, I'm going to watch, ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" a few more, blessed times.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Give It To Me Now, This is the Greatest Show!","Dang, The Greatest Showman had us in our deepest feelings. Sure, it careened off its tracks with a generic closing act that featured quite a drop-off in novel entertainment & storytelling. It was as well a mind-boggling miss that PT Barnum's indifference towards his band of attractions was overlooked. Oh, and Hugh Jackman's vocal performance leaves less to be desired. Nevertheless, its crowd pleasing magic overwhelms its shortcomings, fostering a captivating musical that demands to be seen more than once.The Greatest Showman's entertaining feats explodes through its musical performances. The songs from the OST are some of the catchiest & passionate tunes ever put on a visual medium, choreographed impressively for our viewing pleasure. In amazing fashion, these remarkably staged sequences resounds, as the film's overall poignant sentiments & reflections seep through these addictive melodies. For instance, This Is Me, was an inspiring & affecting number that deserved more than the Oscar nod, as it speaks about acceptance & courage. These earnest messages extend even to the narrative, that touches on inclusiveness & refusal to conform.Overall, The Greatest Showman is one solid, piece of creative spectacle that boasts of sensory dazzle and sincere themes.

The Greatest Showman was unable to rewrite the stars with its formulaic story.,"Every year there is a ""crowd pleaser"", a film that has garnered criticism from industry experts but received overwhelming popularity from audiences. This was that film in 2017. An infectiously joyous musical that was hailed to be a monumental rejuvenation of the genre (because apparently 'La La Land' failed to do that, despite being perfect). But beneath the showstoppers and audacious musical numbers, lies a predictably formulaic story that feels weaker than Efron's 'High School Musical' days. Loosely based on P.T. Barnum's life, this musical chronicles his showmanship years as he recruits a band of ""oddities"" to perform in his new show. However fame and fortune corrupts him as he succumbs to greed and...well, you can guess the rest. You may have noticed the supreme reign of the soundtrack throughout this year, as radio stations constantly blast out ""This Is Me"". That's because, and I'm starting off bold, this is one of the best musical soundtracks ever. Literally every track is memorable, both melodically and lyrically. From the powerhouse ""This Is Me"" to the gorgeously romantic ""Rewrite The Stars"". Each song has its own vibe and suits the situation they are performed in. It's just a shame the film itself doesn't complement the excellence of its soundtrack.The rags-to-riches plot has been executed countless times, and is quite frankly becoming dull. Aside from the delicate (albeit forced) romance between Efron and Zendaya, the story lacks substance. Barnum remains unlikeable throughout, including at the very end when he encounters redemption. The wrong choices he obviously decides to take prevent him from being relatable. There's a fine margin between representing greed (whilst justifying it) and creating an inhumane character. The theme of acceptance that should've been flailing on the circus floor is unfortunately sidelined. Nearly every supporting character is underused. I mean Barnum's wife forgives him almost immediately, consequently diluting the much needed drama. Williams' fragility and delicate nature was severely misplaced, which frustrates me. It's clear that this is the ""Hugh Jackman Show"" and he does deliver on almost everything. He dives into the routines, brings naivety to Barnum and is most certainly having a good time. Efron and Zendaya were also excellent, and would love to have seen more of them. In fact, I would go as far as saying that the film could've benefited from adding an extra thirty minutes to the runtime. Spacing out the dialogue and drama between songs instead of feeling like a collection of music videos strung together with a lack of imaginative storytelling.This review may sound negative, but that's only because I wanted more. In all honesty I enjoyed it. I was smiling, tapping my feet to the songs and even belting out ""never enoughhhhhhhh for me...for meee...for MEEEEE"". It's a joyous pleasing film that will appeal to the masses, with the numerous showstoppers disguising what is essentially a weak story.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Les miserable this is NOT,"Look, I didn't need this to be Les Mis ofcourse I didn't- two completely different stories for a start BUT what I'm trying to say is that the beauty and magic and gut-wrenching emotion of past successful musicals is completely missing from this one.
A musical is a story with musical interludes and this film had the musical interludes but no real story- you know- I didn't care about a single character, least of all Barnham.Thinking about it, this may have come across better on stage, with real, live performances rather than a whole lot of auto-tune- the songs are ok but they all sound the same, like they are all different sections of the same song; crappy pop-tunes in falsetto- no substance, no 'real' voices like Moulin Rouge for example- at least that was actually Kidman and McGregor's singing voices.Not great, won't stick in my memory at all- could have been so much more.

T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman) finally finds his calling under the big top.

There are many problems but it reaches its objective that of entertaining and fun,"It is trivial, it is glossy and it is also predictable but it is also extremely funny, spectacular, pop, engaging, in some moments emotional, in others genuinely grotesque and above the lines, in short, there are defects and are also many but I would lie to myself if I did not say that I spent an hour and forty in absolute lightness and that I would look it again and again.
At the same time, however, I would have loved it if only it had pushed itself slightly further, if it had tried just a little more to make the story a little 'more substantial, full bodied and less as it was, because the feeling of seeing only a long video clip of a beautiful song is very strong especially in some points that are too pulled away, it seems that everything happens in a single day.
But as I have already said, however, it reaches its objective, that of entertaining, thanks to electrifying and pressing music, suggestive and often absurd but very well contextualized choreography, excellent scenography, great both vocal and acting performances, and enveloping and turned on cinematography and directed perfectly functional.

Whole does not add up to the sum of it's parts,"Have you ever heard of the phrase ""The whole does not equal the sum of it's parts""? If you need evidence of what this phrase means, check out THE GREATEST SHOWMAN.Starring Hugh Jackman, THE GREATEST SHOWMAN follows the life of PT Barnum, who brought himself up from nothing to become one of the most famous (if not THE most famous) promoter (some would say huckster) of all time. This film is a musical and I couldn't think of a better subject matter for a musical than this.And it starts off promising - the Opening number is fun and upbeat...and then the plot (what there is of it) kicks in...and then there's another ""show-stopper"" musical number...and then there's more weak plot...and ANOTHER show-stopper musical number and then...You get the picture.Let's start with what works - the songs. Written by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (LA LA LAND, Broadway's DEAR EVAN HANSON), the songs are catchy and show-stoppery, the perfect building blocks for eye-catching, fast-paced, quick cutting, movie spectaculars. And that's part of the problem. This film jumps from ""show-stopper"" to ""show-stopper"" - there was no variety. It's kind of like eating cupcakes. The first one is really good and tasty. The 2nd one - still good, but a little less so, and so on. By the time you get to your fifth cupcake, you're sick of cupcakes and are yearning for a carrot. Such is the case here. If you take any one of these songs on their own, you'll be entertained. But - after awhile - I was just yearning for some variety.Unfortunately...I couldn't find the variety that I was looking for in the plot. Calling the script by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon slight would be doing a disservice to the word slight. It clearly is just an excuse to get us to the next ""show-stopper"" song. None of the characters are really fleshed out (including Barnum) they are all pretty one note, with one goal (respect) and one obstacle (she has a beard! his parents don't approve of him! she married beneath her!) that all get resolved in a song.As for the performances, they are all pretty one-note as well. Hugh Jackman is all bravado as Barnum, never wavering in his appetites, his panache and his cockiness. Jackman has a million dollar smile and he flashes it constantly. The usually reliable Michelle Williams is acting in another movie than Jackman. Her scenes with Jackman as Barnum's wife don't really hit the mark and only at the end does her true acting chops show (and shows just how far better of an actress she is than everyone else in the film).To be honest, I kind of found myself rooting for the Zac Efron/Zendaya love story part of this film. These are two very photgenic, charismatic performers - with strong song and dance chops - and when they're love song came on screen I was into it - except it was the 5th cupcake I had by that time. I really found myself wishing that their song was the dessert and not served as part of the main meal.Special notice should be given to Rebecca Ferguson's performance as Jenny Lind. Her number, NEVER ENOUGH, had me engaged throughout. It was only later that I discovered that the singing was done by Loren Allred. That disappointed me until my wife pointed out that I was ""fooled"" by this and should just roll with it. I gotta admit that Ferguson acted the heck out of the role (and the song), so I'll give this one a pass.As for the ""freaks"" in Barnum's show - there is a reason I haven't mentioned them. Keala Settle has the lead in the ""show-stopper"" number ""This is Me"" (a lock to win the Oscar for best song), but none of these characters are fleshed out and are even less than one-note (if this is even possible).Ultimately, I lay the blame for this film on Director Michael Gracey. This is his theatrical film debut as a Director, and maybe that is why this film,is disjointed. Perhaps with a stronger, more experienced director of motion picture musicals like Rob Marshall or Damien Chazelle, there would have been some nuance and some change of pace and mood. We'll never know...and that's too bad, for the pieces of a good film musical were there.They just didn't add up.Letter Grade: B-6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

I especially liked the duet of Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron singing and dancing in the bar -- talent, talent and then some.Passing off the story of PT Barnum as a tribute to diversity and acceptance of differences is a bit of a stretch -- that's a true Hollywood treatment, and frankly a little old these days. It's been done and done. But I'm nitpicking, because the performances in the supporting roles (the so-called freaks) were so authentic and guaranteed audience buy-in.However, unfortunately I found the music and lyrics just okay.

The Greatest Showman capitvated me (and many others by the sounds of things) to such an extent that the 95 minute running time went by in the blink of an eye. The soundtrack is brilliant in its originality and use of mood/sentimentaility which neatly fits in with the movie itself. As the theatre/show critic says in the film itself, this movie can be a considered 'a celebration of humanity' due to its innovative approach/casting. If the critics cannot find joy in this movie, then maybe they should be doing something else with their lives.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Superb, this is entertainment at its best","8 January 2018Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Greatest Showman. Wow, I can say from the outset I loved this film. Hugh Grant and Zac Ephron combine with many other talents to bring this all singing, all dancing, all judgemental, all emotional, all round entertaining film to the screen. This film tells the story of Phineous Taylor Barnum, the man who brought together a very special collection of people to enable him to bring his 'freak show' to the public. Shunned by society in life this group of people become a family and the circus becomes their home. However some so called normal members of society cannot accept this and they are challenged at every level, from the working man up to the rich and powerful. At the heart of this film is the story of a man trying to do the best for his family, the love he has for his wife and his children is what spurs him on and even when he makes bad judgement calls you know that he is always trying to do the right thing by them. There are some great song and dance scenes and the soundtrack is loud and catchy. The characters draw you into the film and the bright colours of the circus clash gloriously with the sometimes drab city around. If you don't like musicals then this film is not for you but if you love a good old theatrical performance with singing and dancing then this is definitely is one to see. I need to see it agin!!!!",,Anonymous,Biography
The Movie for all Hearts,The most amazing musical I've ever witnessed. I m so impressed with the whole movie. It definitely opens your heart and mind to things other than yourself and the norm.

The Greatest Cinematic Musical for Children?,"My daughter loved this movie, not so much for the story itself, but for the lively music and choreography, especially the song at the beginning, ""Greatest Show,"" and ""This is Me."" It revived her interest in musical theater, though she was quickly let down with Into the Woods, which we watched next. I knew (and know) next to nothing about P. T. Barnum, and was surprised to see the emphasis on the display of disabled people in his museum and then circus. The movie (Controversially? Wikipedia says little about this) depicts Barnum's efforts at recruiting them as a means of celebrating diversity, and his protection of them (despite one key rejection before high society) is contrasted with the drunken mob that attacks them and burns the circus down. An interesting perspective, and I wonder where it comes from. My children sympathized with these performers, at least, and loved the movie for them more than the Showman himself.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"I understand the critics, but it depends what you're looking for.","I can fully understand why the critics gave this film poor ratings, as there is a lot to criticise if you are looking to do so. On the flip side, The Greatest Showman can be viewed as entertaining and uplifting if you aren't after perfect writing.Although the songs are well written, generally their style and delivery are completely wrong for the setting of the film. The majority of the musical numbers come with modern choreography and musical style. Some may like this, but it does detract from the overall ""lost in the film"" feeling.The story itself was entertaining, although I am sure doesn't follow the true history of Barnum's life, which again opens itself up to criticism from those who feel it should. I didn't feel this an issue.Sweeney Todd (2007) is the only musical I can say i really like, and it did much more to use the music to bring the audience into the movie. In the Greatest Showman, it seemed like an unnecessary added extra, done only to attract fans of musicals. There were a few points where I enjoyed it's musical nature (the bar scene where Phillip joins Barnum), but generally could take it or leave it.Despite all this, I still rate this film fairly highly, as it is entertaining. Anyone who likes modern dance troupes (not me), and that kind of ""Britain's got Talent"" style entertainment would love this film. Although, most people will be able to get some joy out of it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Meta,"The Greatest Showman is a 2017 film starring Hugh Jackman about the creation of Barnum and Bailey Circus. It's a musical, which I'm really not a big fan of, and that applies here. The music was hit or miss, some songs were better than others, but most of the time the music just felt unnatural. One thing that bothered me is that we never actually get to see the circus and how it goes down, we don't get the tension that could be used in these moments, instead we get song and dance numbers in place of this. For the most part they are choreographed well, but once again it's just not my thing. The cinematography is also hit or miss, there are some shots that look really good and other shots that look really bad. I feel like the ideas the movie presents about Barnum loving his work more than anything else could've really been expanded on instead of being quickly resolved the way it was. There was a lot of potential for a really great study, something similar to The Prestige (which ironically also stars Hugh Jackman as a lead), but it goes the easy route. The film is entertaining, and it basically just aims to be fun. After watching this, I realized the whole thing was basically a parallel to Barnum's circus. The movie ends by showing a quote by PT Barnum, ""The noblest art is that of making others happy."" This quote basically sums up what this movie is, it just aims to be fun and put a smile on your face. It could be a lot darker but it doesn't decide to go that route. That's incredibly fascinating to me, and even if that other route had more potential, I actually admire what this movie did and that it's really what the character of Barnum believed. 6/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

The greatest show,"This movie is based on the story of P. T. Barnum, which could get you interested in seeing it, but despite it having a PG rating and not being as accurate to the story as it could be, it is still an enjoyable musical with a great cast and very good songs; do not expect this movie to be completely accurate to the person's story if you decide to watch this. The movie The Greatest Showman (2017) is an enjoyable musical with incredibly good songs, exceptionally good performances, and it is lighthearted enough to be a family movie in a way; those who want the movie to be accurate to the story of P. T. Barnum, you might not like this movie because it will be different than what you thought the movie would be portray this real story, so you would have to look past that fact to like the movie.Hugh Jackman gives a satisfactory performance as P. T. Barnum, starting out as someone who does not have everything in the start of the movie to following his dreams with putting on a circus with support from his wife played by Michelle Williams, who is also good in the movie; I do like that he is trying to see the bright side of certain things involving how his circus is treated from regular people and how there are certain people who will try to take down what he is doing, which is why he is standing up for the performers he gets for his circus who are called freaks or laughed at. The person P. T. Barnum gets to work with him is Phillip Carlyle played very well by Zac Efron, he starts out just drinking and working on plays then P. T. Barnum encourages Phillip Carlyle to join him and go half and half on working in the show; I do like that he tries to get better at being an entertainer while also having a romance between him and one of the performers played by Zendaya. The last thing I will add here is that the performances of the circus performers are well done with good actors playing them, like Zendaya, and that the characters are given a chance to stop hiding in the shadows away from people.Though the movie is not completely exact to the person's story, there are occasional moments in the movie that is exact to the story, but the rest of the movie is fictional for the movie so only people who want it to be just like the story will be disappointed; it did not bother that much as other people. The songs are well done with the actors like Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, and Zendaya having great singing voices, with the dance choreography being well done, the visuals being nice to look at, and songs that are catchy and nice to listen to; there are some slight issues involving how easily characters are brought to P. T. Barnum's side or how they forgive him for certain mistakes he has made, but the emotional scenes in the movie were effective which made them only slight issues.The movie is not perfect, but it is just a simple enjoyable musical with great performances, catchy songs, nice visuals, and a simple lighthearted tone to it; if you wanted the movie to be an accurate depiction of the true story, then you might not like this movie, but if you can look past the fact that the movie is not accurate, then you will enjoy and like the movie. I liked The Greatest Showman (2017), I know this movie did not do well critically with lots of critics, but I just wanted to see an enjoyable simple musical, and if you want that, then I would recommend giving this a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

It uplifitng to see how those who are different can overcome their disadvantages and achieve fame and fortune. Of course the real story is much MUCH darker and the real PT Barnum was a real monster of a man who often treated his performers like animals, but I like to think of this movie as a story Barnum would have told about himself.

"Not My Cup of Tea, O So I Thought.","I'm not a big fan of musicals and to be honest I just put it on for my mother to pass the: instead of reading my book as planned. I began to watch it and lo and behold instead of it being totally rotten as the critics painted it. I discovered instead a totally captivating and wonderfully entertaining movies.
To be honest I'm not bothered in the slightest by any lack of historical authenticity. Frankly, if I wanted historical authenticity I'd have read a book by an eminent historian and certainly wouldn't expect a Hollywood
Musical to provide me a definitive guide to the past.
I found this movie to provide an all- round fantastic evening of family entertainment and would heartily recommend this movie: to anyone happy simply with a nice film with brilliant singing and dancing. The latter integrated seamlessly into the plot.

Magnetic Hugh,"Hugh Jackman is one of the most charismatic performers in existence, and he proves it again as P.T. Barnum in ""The Greatest Showman."" The film also stars Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, Zendaya, and Rebecca Ferguson.The film is a 98 percent fictionalized story of the rise of P.T. Barnum. Barnum was a fascinating and somewhat controversial character. He was part of the government of Bridgeport, Connecticut, and made many improvements there. The film touches on few of his accomplishments, concentrating on his circus.I've heard the music described as having ""High School Musical"" type tunes. Were they awful? No. Pleasant and well-sung? Definitely. The film is a huge spectacle and intended to be seen on the big screen. The choreography is wonderful, too.My only gripe in this otherwise enjoyable film is that Jenny Lind sang pop songs. I realize that was done because it would have been too jarring with the other music in the film, but at the very least, she should have sung something in a soprano voice, even if it was Carry Me Back to Old Virginny.I've seen Hugh Jackman on stage three times - he's always sensational. Zac Efron sang and danced well and exhibits a new maturity.Anyone interested should read about the fascinating and varied accomplishments of P.T. Barnum. This is no biopic.

The acting and action is top class.
Where it lacked was the story. Sure it shows his rise and fall and rise again, but it was missing something. I cannot really put my finger on it but, yes, felt something could have been more.

A Fun Movie,"The Greatest Showman is a fun movie to watch. It's a feel good movie that it suitable for the family to watch. The soundtrack is great, the cast is talented and it's pleasing to the eyes. However, it does bother me that unlike a lot of musicals set in the past, the music does not fit the era. The choreography and the music is not something you would see in the late 1800s. The film itself is strictly ok, a bit too fast paced in places so we don't get to see much character development, the plot is standard and entirely predictable. A bit lacklustre. It's not Oscar worthy but it is a really enjoyable film, a total guilty pleasure. This is a great film to watch after a bad day!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Don't care what the critics say or whether the story lives up the actual real life events of PT Barnum's Circus.

A beautiful and colorful film with impressive scenes and gorgeous musical numbers,"The surprising story of the circus entrepreneur (and many more things) P. T. Barnum, a dreamer who, from the most humble poverty, continued to become rich by creating what we today call mass entertainment. The film opens with Phineas Taylor ""P. T."" Barnum (Hugh Jackman) joining his circus troupe in a song (""The Greatest Show""), playing to an enthusiastic crowd as he and his performers put on a dazzling show. We cut to Barnum as a young boy (Ellis Rubin) in the 1800's, working with his tailor father Philo (Will Swenson). They arrive at the home of Mr. Hallett (Fred Lehne) and his daughter Charity (Skylar Dunn). The son of a tailor arranges to open a wax museum; however, he soon shifts focus to the unique and the peculiar, introducing extraordinary, never-seen-before live acts on the circus stage. Barnum married to Charity (Michelle Williams) and two little daughters Caroline Barnum( Austyn Johnson) and Helen Barnum (Cameron Seely) , later meets a playwright named Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron). He approaches Philip with the opportunity to join his circus and finance it.A high-budget musical film with glamour where the greatness does not lack even a moment, here gets to make a nice tribute to the circus world and its surroundings. This hugely agreeable film is a faithful reflection of the title. Hugh Jackman plays the American circus businessman P. T. Barnum, he is the father of show business with his peculiar troupe, in this musical in which they also take part the greatest show in the world. The story is fine, wrought with romance, love stories , and impressive scenes with enormous pedigree. This colorful and dramatic flick packs amazing shows and exciting final. Extraordinary cast and good performances, especially from the agreable protagonists as Hugh Jackman, Michelle Williams, Zac Efron, Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson. Along with a stunning support cast, such as: Austyn Johnson, Cameron Seely, Keala Settle, Sam Humphrey, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Eric Anderson, among others.It contains a brilliant and glamorous cinematography by Seamus McGarvey . As well as a senitive and lively muical score by John Debney and Joseph Trapanese. The film's nine-year development process from conception to completion was, in part, due to studios' unwillingness to take a risk on an original musical. Directed by newcomer Michael Gracey, the film won the Golden Globe for best song: This is Me by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, previously winners of the Oscar for the song ""City of Stars"" from the film La La Land. The song ""This is me"" was also nominated for an Oscar. Michael Gracey explains the following: ¨the main idea of the film is that your true wealth is the people you surround yourself with and the people who love you. Barnum brought people together that the world might otherwise have ignored. By bringing each of these people to light, I created a family that would always be there to help each other. In the course of the film Barnum is about to lose his blood family and his showbiz family, but he soon discovers that the most important thing he can do is reunite them. As the film explains at its end, the best art is that of entertaining people¨. Rating: 7.5/10. Better than average. Well worth watching. The pictire will appeal to Hugh Jackman and Zack Efron fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
here's why the critics are wrong !,"I've seen TGS six times - about every 2 weeks since it opened. To me the film was an imaginative take on the man who created one of the most enduring forms of entertainment the world has ever seen. But the critical comments were not part of my experience. The following points seem to be the most repeated among the critics:HISTORICAL ACCURACY: This criticism is easy to dismiss. Unless the film is a documentary, the ""facts"" are subject to interpretation. A long list of movies based on real people or events bears this out. Consider this: If a film (non-documentary) were made about Donald Trump, wouldn't there be very different versions, depending on who's telling the story?THE REAL PT BARNUM: This can be addressed with my comment above. But I'll go ahead and answer those who feel that the man who was famous for having said ""There's a sucker born every minute"" had his character sugar-coated in the film. Those critics say he was portrayed as a saintly family man who championed inclusiveness. I don't know how they didn't see the same film I did. At a young age PT learns that honesty may not be the best policy when he is punished for admitting he made young Charity laugh. He subsequently steals, obtains a loan with false collateral, and embellishes his ""circus freaks"" to his liking. He even admits to being a fraud to the highbrow theater critic. And when he gains entry to high society via his partner Phillip Carlyle, he has hesitations about appearing in public with his human menagerie. I'm leaving out a few, but how many more character flaws do the critics need to see in a 2-hour film?NO BACKSTORY: A few critics lamented that the secondary characters (the circus crew) were not given full backgrounds. I can only shake my head and wonder how they could expect to pull this off with a dozen or so characters. Would they have liked a 3-hour movie better?THE SONGS ARE TRITE: Simple answer - one of the most revered songs in a film musical is about rainbows and bluebirds.NO REAL DRAMA: Sure, it wasn't APOCALYPSE NOW, but PT faced enough challenges in the film to dismiss that criticism.WEAK SCRIPT: Always a matter of taste, but I found it intelligent, engaging and very often humorous. I've laughed every time, particularly at the exchanges between PT and Phillip as they are trying to make the acquaintance of Jenny Lind in London. And the audiences I've been with laughed along with Queen V at the ""reaching the top shelf"" retort by Tom Thumb!SUB-PAR CHOREOGRAPHY/MUSICAL STAGING: Again a matter of taste, but after 6 times seeing the film, the musical numbers still give me goose bumps. The Other Side number, staged in a bar, is no less impressive than anything from a Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly film.TOO LITTLE/TOO MUCH: The Village Voice critic wrote that it was boring and exhausting - in the same sentence! So which one was it?!I personally feel that a clinical dissection of the movie misses the point. Maya Angelou said something to the effect that people don't always remember what you do or say, but they will remember how you make them feel. I'm glad I'm one of the many viewers who got such an incredibly wonderful feeling from THE GREATEST SHOWMAN.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Critics are Right! Quelle Dreck!,"I see about a hundred movies a year, and this is the first one I have walked out on in recent memory. Rather than ""magical"" I found the songs to be mediocre and so repetitive that I wanted to tear my hair out. Singing ""A million dreams is all it's gonna take"" over and over and over again is no substitute for a plot. I left the second time I saw the same collection of ""human oddities"" performing what seemed to be the exact same out-of-place modern song and dance routine for the second time in a circus ring, to the delight of an audience dressed in period costume, but rocking out like no 19th century audience ever had.It's not that I'm not totally averse to modern song and dance in a story that takes place in the 19th century. I enjoyed Moulin Rouge, a movie whose anachronistic music seemed jarring in 2001. But although that movie wasn't exactly ""Citizen Kane"", at least it had Nicole Kidman to look at.It may be that I know a bit too much about American history to let all the absurd inaccuracies past. Maybe the audience that loved this movie had no idea that Jenny Lind was an opera singer, not a contestant on ""The Voice."" Maybe they had no idea that she was a philanthropist who gave away the vast sums she earned to her favorite charities, not a hootchie momma homewrecker. Maybe they have no idea that Barnum lured his ""human oddities"" to his shows with the promise of steady pay and not human dignity.

BUT I was bored through the first segment with the kids singing, I found most of the songs to be forgettable, the dance numbers all looked like a Glee production and seemed totally out of place for the historical context. 
Jenny Lind was renowned for her angelic voice, not for being a pop diva, although her song was amazing. 
I found it annoying that huge plot progress took place while the daughters didn't grow up. 
This movie had all the ingredients to be a classic, but by trying to appeal to current music taste, it becomes a freakish thing with people in period costume ""gettin' down"" to 21st century tunes. I still stuck with it and enjoyed parts of it immensely, like the Bearded Lady solo (even though, once again, the dancing went all Glee.)

The Greatest Showman Review,"The film 'The Greatest Showman' is a bright, colorful, classic rags to riches story. The music and choreography were good, especially the trapeze choreography with Zac Efron and Zendaya. The music wasn't quite what I was expecting, specifically the song ""Never Enough"" that was sung by Jenny Lind who was known as an opera singer, but if you like catchy, pop music, you will enjoy the sound track. The film is visually pleasing with many bright colors and good costumes. It also conveys a very important message of acceptance, diversity, and the importance of family. However, I think it was too fast paced, glossing over some of the important plot lines and leaving some events a little unexplained. It results in many of the characters to be under developed when I think their backstories and relating to them should be really important to the story. Overall, I thought it was a little predictable and not really extraordinary, but it was entertaining which should be expected from an over-the-top circus musical.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Favorite movie of the year - Best musical in decades,"I love Star Wars, enjoyed Jumanji and am basically a guy who likes a good PG-13 action movie that makes you think. When I hear that a movie is a musical, I usually avoid it. However, my wife and kids talked me into watching this one (kids saw it a second time with me) and I was pleasantly surprised. It is so much more than a movie about a guy and his circus dreams. It lifts your spirits and tells a story about people overcoming hardships. The music is above and beyond anything that I've experienced in a single movie. My kids keep listening to it over and over and its been a week since they saw it the first time and I still enjoy hearing the songs. Looking forward to seeing it again. Yes, the critics got it wrong on this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Pretty Bad,"Saying that this movie is a terrible representation of the real P.T. Barnum is a huge understatement. It would be like if they made a movie about Robert E Lee treating his slaves like family. However, setting that aside, this movie is just bad. It's filled with tons of unintentionally funny moments that are supposed to be taken seriously. It fails to make me feel anything for these characters. I'd say the best scenes in this movie are the musical ones, and even then I only enjoyed one of these scenes out of the multiple the movie offers. The scenes themselves aren't that bad, but the music is such cold, calculated, paint-by-numbers garbage that I really can't fully enjoy any of them. The acting is pretty bad, mainly from the children and side characters. This movie did NOT ""bring back the musical"" and I wouldn't pay to see it again(or even at all, but I did so oh well).",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Just go and see this! Best musical of the last 10 yrs,"I just returned home from watching the movie for the second time with the family.

La La Land + Circus = The Greatest Showman,"I'm going to start on a positive note -- the music was absolutely terrific. As I'm writing this, I'm actually listening to the soundtrack. But overall, I'm severely disappointed in the film. P. T. Barnum's story is truly fascinating, but the plot of The Greatest Showman was so over-dramatized and romanticized that I find myself doubting whether any part of the plot was based on real events (except the actual circus). The plot was all over the place, trying to be too many things. But if you enjoyed La La Land's random dance/spectacle numbers and want to ""escape"" and zone out for two hours, you'll probably enjoy this movie. Honestly, I'm really disappointed.

A Refreshing Abstraction of History,"This was one of those films that hasn't gotten the publicity it deserves. It was a very refreshing and new concept in the world of film, which isn't an easy thing to manage in the 21st century. The Greatest Showman evoked a sense of euphoria, especially in the musical numbers. I appreciated how they chose Hugh Jackman as the protagonist; it displays Jackman's flexibility and abilities as an actor. Additionally, it was refreshing that the film included non-mainstream actors for the majority of the cast. I love seeing non-familiar faces in successful films such as the Greatest Showman. I cannot express enough how much I adore this movie! I'm in love with musicals that have eloquent stories.

The worst film I think I Have ever part seen,"This is the worst film I have ever had the misfortune to try and watch. The film starts with promise but then the pop music starts and that's the end of it. Every song sounds like it's ripped off from a mixture of Rihanna and frozen. Pitch perfect is better than this. At least it's honest about what it is. The sound mix is awful because of side chain compression on the bass you can't hear most of the vocals. The majority of the dialog is also dubbed, I'm assuming to make the post processing on everything sound less weird. My wife and i work on theatrical shows, including the Chichester production of Barnam, and it sits very close to our heart but this is rubbish and should be put in the bin. Go watch it live. It's much better than this pap.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Not great but definitely not bad - a big swing that gives Jackman and the cast enough to do,"Of all the things I decided I should throw on after Deadpool & Wolverine to get some more of a Hugh Jackman fix, it's this smash (original) Musical that I somehow avoided in theaters at a time when Movie-Pass was at its peak. Lo and behold, it is indeed such a giant bowl of corn that is so thick and sticky need 500 miles of dental floss to get it out of my teeth after the fact. Maybe I wanted to remind myself of not simply Jackman's talent but his versatility (and it wasn't exactly a Les Mis day for a weekend matinee at home while waiting for a big home delivery so this was a lighter serving of the corn plucked by Broadway, I digress), this did the trick at any rate even if it is entertaining on a largely shallow level.From even a cursory reading of trivia on Imdb the film is not exactly, uh, faithful to the life and work of PT Barnum (or to at least several of the actual stars of his show that are seen adapted here, more or less). At the same time it finds itself at an intersection of the slick and *almost* cynical-cum-skeptical showbiz dramatics of like The Great Ziegfeld and the sincerity of those unrelentingly chipper Hollywood musicals of the 1950s and 60s, which should be more awkward than this... not to say this doesn't find beats where you just shake your head and do the Steve Bruhl ""huh"" meme (not least of which what leads into the most recognizable number ""This is Me"" which is... why would those performers even really *want* to go be in that high society party at all?)It is a story full of romance and very light (as in this is PG after all) infidelity and marriage woes, but I actually did like how the film treated the relationship between Barnum and Jenny Lind as this split between aiming for something higher in art and performance and whether Barnum sees the person in that art or just is blown away too much by the performance (why I thought of Ziegfeld was how that had Powell and Myrna Loy, though in that case it was much longer and more details about her vs Louise Rainer's long suffering character).Where the film is less good is in the musical numbers that are not the bit at the bar between Jackman and Efron, or the one between Efron and Zendaya - easily the highlights for me, albeit I'm not fully the audience for this bubble-gum modern Hot 100 radio pop - and how, frankly, the Stars who make up the bulk of the circus characters are sort of sidelined for the Jenny Lind and Zendaya subplots (and some brief ""how dare you question my relationship with a light skinned black lady in....1850?) And it is also just so jam-packed with good cheer and spirit that it can get dangerously close to insincerity, like ""this puppy definitely wants to lick my face... but is this good boy also trying trying sell me ear-buds to go with the soundtrack?""But Jackman is a fine actor here and surrounds himself with good people to play off of with Williams and Efron and to an extent Ferguson, and I do appreciate that the film doesn't over-extend itself like a Ziegeld or the countless dirge 60s Musicals (though I still prefer that now obscure Oscar winner for best picture a little more than this). It is slick, upbeat, a little confused at times about the POV it should lean into, but it is a Guilty Pleasure of the highest order; this isn't something I even rushed to see at the time, and I had heard a couple of reviews that steered me away (one by Jenny Nicholson that is still among her very best). But it is entertaining, if sort of bizarre and slight and airy all at oncr.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Rewriting the History of A Pretty Terrible Guy,"Where to start? Sure, the songs are catchy, and the acting is great with a stellar cast. Doesn't negate the fact that Barnum was a conman who didn't really care about the people in his charge except to exploit them, not just in life, but in death as well.One of his most egregious acts was when he bought an enslaved woman and pretended that she was once owned by George Washington. When she died, rather than let her go in peace, Barnum hosted her autopsy in a New York saloon where spectators paid 50 cents to see the dead woman cut up. Didn't see that in the movie!Hugh Jackman tries to portray Barnum as a kindly smooth-talking Harold Hill-type when he was really just a cynical grifter.

The Art of Entertainment,"A fun movie that combines comedy, romance and music to a good sound editing, reasonable acting and a cool storyline. Telling the story of what was once called ""The Circus of Horrors,"" debutant director Michael Gracey sought to show people with a disability by another prism, rather than the traditional terror, as aborted in the film Freaks (1932) for example, he seeks to show the humanity, talent and willpower of these people, even if in the final balance, it's a gum lesson. The script is well worked out, telling the story of a man of vision, who seeks to win in life through entertainment, and finds a niche little explored, in the background is a film about vision with a dressing overcoming cute. We have a good photo, a very sharp direction and with good light and camera angles (taking into account mainly that it is a beginner director), the editing and mixing of sound are good, although at times it is clear the voice overlap , we also feel the slight variation of the trail, but even so, it is pleasant. Nemhuma's acting comes to be noticeable, but Hugh Jackman is very well, and plays a role that combines too much with him. Finally ""The King of Show"" is no masterpiece, but it amuses, and is far from displeasing.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
An entertaining musical that hits all the Hollywood clichés.,"I can honestly say there aren't nearly enough musicals in Hollywood anymore. The Greatest Showman (2017) certainly helps to fill in the gaps between these occurrences, and with a subject that easily lends itself to the musical format. I really enjoyed the songs and choreography, as well as its message of inclusion and being unashamed of who we are. All that being said, there was still something a little off when infusing pop music and modern dance moves with the 1800's. It kind of works, but it also doesn't immerse the audience in the historical aesthetic.While the story of P.T. Barnum's (Hugh Jackman) rise to wealth and fame (or infamy, depending on the viewpoint) was entertaining enough, so much of its presentation seemed to have the ""Hollywood coincidence"" to it. Events lined up in such a way that I wondered if they really happened or if it was artistic license. This is also not to mention the number of clichés present in the film as well, most of which I can't get into without spoiling the plot. At the very least, Barnum's story seemed realistic due to his motivations, and not necessarily due to his humanitarianism.It might seem like I'm bashing this movie for being too ""Hollywood,"" but by that same mark, it is an entertaining film. There are enough humor and heartfelt moments to keep the proceedings lighthearted. If anything, the fact that it's entertaining is merely linked to Barnum's rise as an entertainer and showman. The songs are catchy enough to get stuck in your head, and the dancing (especially the bit in the bar) was dazzling to watch and would be fun to imitate. The Greatest Showman isn't your traditional biopic, but it is good for a brief escape from reality.An entertaining musical that hits all the Hollywood clichés, I give The Greatest Showman 4.0 stars out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

My favorite movie,"Hi everyone, I saw the ""The Greatest Showman"" the last week, and I very like the movie. In my opinion, this movie is the best movie about circus LOL.The movie is very rich but in a nutshell, the movie is a musical.It takes place in a old USA and in the movie the main character is called P. T Barnum.The movie deals with the subject of inclusion of person with oddities. P. T Barnum launch a circus with the gaol to get money and to include unique person in our society.In my opinion, the movie is incredible. I find the choice of actors, dancers, and musicians is excellent.I also like the songs because they are unforgettable and fascinating.Decors and costumes are very worked. And the work post-production is incredible too, we can notice the effort accomplished by the studio on each frame of the movie.After I saw the movie, I was obsessed by the story so I do some research about the true of P. T Barnum. And I learnt some atrocities did by the original P. T Barnum.And the real story is very dark.But in spite of I like the movie, and I find very sad the fact which the scenarist don't do a full fictive movie.But I don't care because the movie deals with important subjects like the self-confidence, the acceptance, the determination and the benevolence.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A movie crafted by executives without heart or vision,"The Greatest Showman is the most painful cinematic experience I can recall. I heard this is one ""the critics got wrong"" and with some skepticism watched it in its entirety. Had I not watched it in a group I would have turned it off after 30 minutes.The Greatest Showman is not a creative endeavor like any good art production should be. It's a movie made in a factory assembly line by a group of people who know what a movie LOOKS like, but lack any heart or imagination to cobble it together into anything but the most bland, generic pablum to turn a profit before heading back to the line to hammer out another one. It takes no risks and fails in almost all aspects of movie-making save costume design.This is the not-so-true story of PT Barnum, a public figure no one was interested in learning about and certainly not this sanitized version. It's a rags to riches story with some moralizing about tolerance and family that we've all heard a hundred times. But even these most basic of Hollywood sentiments they can't get right. It's supposed to be about acceptance and tolerance of people that are different, and simultaneously be about a spectacle of bearded women, extremely tall & fat men, and black acrobats. The black love interest may be the most offensive character, as I honestly didn't even know she was black until it was suggested as much by another character. They don't even have the gumption to cast a character whose skin tone is more than 2 shades darker than Hugh Jackman. The actual black actor has no speaking parts whatever and is more a prop than a character, as is the fat man and the tall guy. You know what would have been interesting? Making the love interest the bearded lady. But this is Hollywood and the factory specs called for just a teaspoon of diversity and nothing more.The story is a bore. The movie is scarcely 100 minutes but it feels like it goes on forever. It's squirm inducing from pillar to post, always threatening to end but never doing so. It's a risk-less, trite affair with passable acting performances and no stand outs.Oh but it's a musical you say, so it's really about the songs and choreography, right? Fine, but these echo the production ethos of the rest of the movie. Every song could have been ripped straight from the top ten pop hits and no one would know. And in fact that's exactly what they did, there are at least 2-3 songs that I recognize from top 40 radio. It is the most boring, milquetoast music available, made in a boardroom. Every song sounds the same and none are memorable. The choreography could have been pulled straight from any MTV music video - with the addition of a few CGI elephants, lions, and the odd flaming hoop. The most offensive moment is when an opera singer performs. Finally! Something that won't sound like a pop song. But what follows is more Celine Dion or Barbara Streisand than anything even remotely operatic. It was that moment I knew the movie was beyond redemption and would have turned it off there if I wasn't watching in a group.I am not a musical hater. You can make creative musicals like The Little Barber Shop of Horrors, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, I don't even mind the classic 90s Disney movies or the new Les Miserables. But this? There is exactly one song number that was at least mildly entertaining because it helped with characterization and had a glimpse of novelty: Jackman's duet in the bar room.Some people will argue this movie shouldn't have to take risks, it's a PG feel-good movie! But I didn't feel good. I felt a mixture of anger, boredom, irritation, and frustration. This should offend the sensibilities of any cinema-goer over the age of 15. The Greatest Showman is the worst kind of movie out there; so bland and produced it offers absolutely nothing new or interesting and the only thing worth discussing is how painfully mediocre it is before shoving it down the memory-hole never to be spoken of again.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Spectacular writing and excellent songs,"This movie tells the true story of PT Barnum, interesting to learn about the story of a kid who had nothing and grew an entertainment empire.
Unbelievable parts which in fact were true that I discovered after watching the movie such as paying the opera singer $1000 a show in 1850 and committing to 150 shows millions in today's money he risked it all and lost often but carried on.
His love for embracing the unusual and left behind was inspiring and learning that he was a major proponent of abolishing slavery when the trend was against made me like him more.
Music was fantastic, well written, seamlessly incorporated into the movie and ""never again"" played on surround sound was a moment to cherish.

A Boxing Day treat..... from 2017 to present day.,"I grew up with musical greats such as Calamity Jane and West Side Story. I groaned as a child.

If you like Musicals; give this film a shot.,"The Greatest Showman, directed by Michael Gracey and written by Bill Condon and Jenny Bicks and is about P.T. Barnum, the founder of Barnum and Bailey's Circus, and his upbringing of the circus into American culture and stars the extremely talented Hugh Jackman as P.T. Barnum, Zac Efron as his assistant named Phillip Carlyle and Zendaya as Anne Wheeler with Michelle Williams as Charity Barnum. Before I get into my review, was I greatly impressed by this film; no. It was mediocre at best. But, I gave it a seven so I do think this move is average so here's why I think that. The first thing I look at is Cinematography. This movie looks undoubtedly beautiful. The shots where there is close ups on certain characters shows their emotion very well. Also, when there are characters who are sitting or standing in a location that is vital to the story or the story's progression it shows pretty much the whole area with the actor/actress which shows how miniscule they are compared to the scenery. All in all, it's a beautifully shots film with virtually no errors, as compared to the cinematography. However, the film's writing/dialogue/story in opinion was extremely poor. I did not care for the film's dialogue as I found it to be very forced and even awkward at times. Especially one scene where young Barnum and Charity are on the beach and as they're talking, you get a sense of that the child actors, Ellis Ruban and Skylar Dunn, aren't trying very well to make their scenes authentic. I also feel as if they romanticized the story of P.T. Barnum. They made being a poor teenager living on the street as a glorious entity. This was also a one hour and forty five minute long film, which I believed to be way to short. This film should've at least have been two hours and fifteen minutes. There was much material that the writers could've elaborated on and made his childhood more in depth and detail that the writers didn't care to do. The acting in this film was good but had some issues with it, that's why I only took off one point for the acting. First, were the poor aspects of the acting. Again, referring back to my statement on the child actors, they feel short in here too. I do believe that these child actors are good, but they were not given the substantial source material from the writers. However, Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Zendaya, and Michelle Williams all give fantastic performances! Especially Hugh Jackman as P.T. Barnum in which he completely steals the show. As well as his incredible acting, he is also a surprisingly really good singer. With that statement, let me now talk about the music. It was phenomenal; every minute of it. I prefer La La Land's music over this but that music was considered to be a musical fan's dream, this definitely follows that route. The opening song is absolutely my favorite from the film; it honestly gave me some chills. I would consider buying the whole album on your phone I think it's that good. My last category to go over is the design of the film; this means the sets/locations throughout the film and the costumes. First off, the costumes are and look extraordinary especially Barnum's Ringmaster outfit. These outfits for all of the characters look so real. The dresses that the women in the film wear especially those who the higher class look absolutely amazing and the top hatted suits that the men wear look so classy. Now to my final point; the sets and locations where the film was shot. The sets look so colorful and gorgeous. The sets that contain the circus scenes are full of color and excitement!

Nostalgia is everything,"I fell in love with this musical when I saw the 'A Million Dreams.' music video in class after all my classmates begged my teacher to put it on. This was literally the same month it came out and I could see it was going to be a highly successful musical even though it had it's competition of Hamilton on Broadway which yes I love Hamilton more than any musical but I want to judge this movie in a fair way. Anyway,now I am older one thing I'm a bit off on about this musical is that who it is based on,apon some research I was quite puzzled why people would make something about the story of the man that was P. T Barnham and just to make it sugarcoated and happy,besides the actual historical factor of it the songs and visual imagery are such beautiful wonders.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"I'm not a musical person, but i kind of liked this one.","I didn't know that this Movie was a musical. If I had known that it was a musical I wouldn't of watched it because I don't like musicals. I mean I like high school musical as a kid and I think that was because it was more my age. But I don't like any other musicals other then that. I have been trying to get into them for years and its just not for me. I found them cringe and boring. I'm thinking about trying again as it might just be the Movie storylines that I'm not into. So I'm going to keep trying to see if there are any I like.I kind of liked the music in this one but it had update songs so it didn't really fit the story's time zone. but I did like the songs and as soon as I came home I listened to a bit of the soundtrack. This Movie looked interesting when I first saw the poster and it popping up everywhere and I liked the decisions of the Movie. I just found it interesting. I like to see how people overcome their struggles by turning their problems into opportunities.In the Movie a lot of the time an interesting twist was about to bring the story or a character some depth, but they broke into a forced song and everything was forgotten. The one thing that I really didn't like was the fact that This Movie tells a cleaned-up story of Barnum & Bailey Circus creator P.T. Barnum. The truth is that They were responsible for captured, beaten, and deprived animals and this Movie leaves out some important information while romanticizing a person who used any living beings he could get his hands on. animals that he kept in cages and trained through pain and fear. I'm a big person when it comes to animals, I love them, and I don't eat meat.I think it would be a good family Movie if a few things changed like if they didn't use animals, if it wasn't based of P.T. Barnum and if P.T was nice and caring. anyway I think the acting was good, I liked the cast. and the dancing. I liked the costumes, the imagination and the creatively used in the A Million Dreams song scene. I thought that because It was a musical it would be boring but it wasn't really,I was worried about how the Movie would show the importance's of having compassion for those who are different, and the effects of racism, and standing up to racism. I think it was Okayish but I really didn't like how P.T asked them to join the show. I liked the senses were they played ''this is me'' song, I find it uplifting and I'm happy they used it.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

A masterpiece!,"This film has everything you could possibly hope for in a movie musical: a good story, a fantastic soundtrack, magical dancing scenes, and, hey, Hugh Jackman definitely isn't hard on the eyes.It surprises many to learn that long before he was Wolverine, Jackman was a staple in musical theater and has the acting, singing and dancing chops to carry a major musical.I was surprised by Michelle Williams, and my respect for Zac Efron and Zendeya really grew watching their performances. Williams especially shines in ""A Million Dreams,"" and Zac and Zendeya perform what I think is the most beautiful scene in the film, with ""Rewrite the Stars.""To be honest, I didn't expect much from Efron. But he, along with the rest of the cast, held their own when working with a musical theater legend. I was particularly impressed with ""The Other Side."" Watching that scene, I thought, ""Wow.

As a music video? Definitely 11/10.,"As a movie though? Not quite sure.Musical is one of the most popular genre in the film industry. Some people don't like it and I have no problem with it. I totally won't bash you with a furious rant on Twitter. I, however, am a very big fan of it. Tap dancing, catchy tunes, gleeful choreographies, those things make my eyes tear up with fascination. Last year we got an almost perfect musical with Damien Chazelle's La La Land. An original musical that caught attention of both viewers and critics alike and was rewarded with the seven Oscar nods for that year. In spirit of La La Land's success, Fox decided to go ahead with their own take on an original musical. They decided to cast Hugh Jackman as its lead. Hugh Jackman was also known for his portrayal of Jean Valjean in the musical Les Miserables, which I also adored. Add up all that factors and you could see that I am really anticipating this movie.
 Is this movie bad? Not at all. In fact, it was very entertaining, and a lot of people liked it. Am I disappointed though? Well, a wee bit. As a movie, I thought it had plenty of flaws. Especially the writing. I felt that it was very sloppy. Every scene felt as though it was only a mean as to get to another musical scene. I couldn't really connect with the characters because only glimpses are seen. Just when we are introduced to a character, the movie abruptly chops their development and suddenly shows us the same character but with a wholly different personality. And I'm just left questioning where it came from. However, it is a musical. And what's a musical without a good musical scene. And when those scenes do come, boy oh boy were they fantastic.
 Every musical scene in this movie is just fantastic. It's pretty much why I love musicals. It's epic, it's romantic and it's emotional. It is very well directed. Knowing that the director came from a background of music videos, no wonder he nailed this down. Every scene was pitch perfect a la 50's musicals. The singing was also great, most of the actors recorded with their own voice and they did not disappoint. And most importantly, the song was really good. This is really important because in the end, the thing that makes musicals so damn memorable, is its fantastic songs. I listened to the album for weeks on end, and apparently, other people do too. In Indonesia's Apple Music top five tracks, apparently four of them were tracks from The Greatest Showman. I also want to point out that the movie's songwriters, were the guys from La La Land, which won an Oscar. That explains why the music's so damn good.
 In the end, it wasn't the La La Land I expected it to be, nor was it the Les Miserables I expected it to be. However, as a musical, it is a damn good musical and an extravagant entertainment for families to enjoy. Yes, take your kids to see this movie because this movie actually has a really good message buried inside it. Especially now, in the age where tolerance is an utmost requirement. Turn off your worries, and let the movie work its magic.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Beautiful,"The Greatest Showman is the story of a man's successes and failures in life. The film's most important feature is its music. There are a lot of songs in this film. All of these songs express the emotions of each scene, and the emotions are expressed to the fullest. What I also find most interesting about the film is that I feel that the main character's emotional transitions are well portrayed as his successes and failures are depicted. As the main character becomes more and more successful, he loses sight of what is important to him. It only takes a moment to lose everything from there. This leads me to believe that it is good to seek success, but we must be careful not to lose sight of ourselves. And I am learning that it takes time to build up, but only a moment to break down.I recommend this film. I have two reasons. First, You can hear songs of great power. There are many different types of songs to enjoy throughout the film. Second, we can learn about the rise and fall of human life. For these reasons, the film is worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

WHAT A SURPRISE!,"I start off by saying I'm not much into the newer musicals, I like a good drama but don't like characters breaking out into song at crucial moments! That's just too corny for my tastes.So on 12/30/17 in the early evening I had a couple of hours to kill...I decided to see Hugh Jackman in The Greatest Showman. I sat down prepared to see a great drama about PT Barnum when all of a sudden a song breaks out. I was bummed at first but then like the song and it ""fit"" into the scene. I was disappointed that it was a musical but oh well. OH WELL NOTHING! This is one of the most entertaining, happy, great acting movies I've seen in a long, long time. (And I see a lot of movies).Hugh Jackman is a great song/dance man. He's right up there with the likes of one of my favs, Gene Kelly, imo. His timing, his acting is spot on. To the point of I may like him better in musicals than dramas...not sure yet.And what can I say about Zac Efron? This man was made for song/dance. That is where he shines. The stupid comedies he's made should be the very, very last resort, if at all. They are a waste of his time and talent. I was entertained by his acting and singing all through the movie. I found a new love for Zac.The MUSIC is FABULOUS. I love every song...the melodies and lyrics were really good and totally fit the scenes they were in. I can't say that about any other musical that comes to mind. The choreographing was spot on, too. Every kind of body type got a good chance to shine, it wasn't just the tall or slim or pretty. Good job on that point.I loved this movie...the colors, the costumes, the songs, the dance sequences all were perfect and exciting.

Eeeeh... reality check...,"I hate musicals. Can't stand the damn things. I switched off La La Land when the second song began and never went back to it. A pox on A-list actors trying to sing, I recall saying at the time. So it came as a bit of a shock, then, when I not only sat through The Greatest Showman (because my kids wanted to watch it), but tolerated it in decent humour and even, when it finished, found that I'd actually enjoyed it.The cinematography is simply outstanding. Every scene is a little work of art, clearly very well thought through and meticulously planned and co-ordinated. The story - while probably slightly shy of the actual historical events - is entertaining and keeps the viewer interested throughout. Even the songs (bane of my life when musicals are mentioned, let it end, let it ennnnnnnnnd!!) were rather good.All in all, the film didn't suck. I wanted it to, but it didn't.

A wonderful instant classic hated by the snobbish critics!,"I, myself is not much of a writer, but often come to IMDB admire all the great writing in the review sections by other. After watching this film three times in the theaters, and reading the biased and pretentious review by the so called professional critics (completely opposite of user reviews), I just feel compelled to write an review while I don't even like musical.Like many other user's review, ignore the critics, go see this instant classics! if you enjoy musicals (I'm not even a fan to normal musical), watching/listening to this would be heaven on Earth experience. Not only the songs are catch, but the lyrics are beautifully written specifically for every scene in the movie.If you enjoy great cinematography like I do, you can appreciate every detail of the director's vision, and the editing of the film are so perfectly put together. I was awed from begging to the end even watching for the 3rd time.If you enjoy a good romance or drama, you will not be disappointed. The story is quite simple, but there are differences when a good story teller vs a bad one. Even though this is considered a musical, the director made this movie's transition from beginning to the end seemingly smooth, you almost forget its a musical. Every song or speech starts naturally. Casting and acting are perfect in every way. From the first second of the film, you can feel the intensity and passion from Hugh Jackman. Every supporting actors are equally good.In summary, it doesn't matter if you are a man or woman, old or young, every one can truly enjoy this! Every time I watched this, I hear voices behind me say this was the best movie they've seen in a long time. It is just too underrated.

Impressively overblown (in a good way?),"I was pretty sure I wasn't going to like this which is why I left it 7 years before actually consuming it.First thing I noticed is it was very BIG, the songs were huge, the cinematography like wise, and very notably the performances, no subtlety here. Dancing like their lives depended on it even though it's only the number where they order a cup of coffee, type thing.The songs were really good, no denying that, although a couple of them sounded the same, mined directly from the same high emotion seam.You'd think this was the story of a world leader who saved millions and not a con-artist showman with a very dubious record
His first exhibition (which this film conveniently 'glossed' over, in that they completely left it out!! Was he rented 80 year old slave woman to exhibit her as a 160 year old, the renting was to get around the anti slavery rules in his state that didn't exist in the state he was renting her from, and she looked 160 cos she was blind and very unwell. So there's that rewriting of reality to make an over simplistic, jingoistic chest thumper. Even knowing all that it was hard to not get sucked into it all, it was very well 'crafted' if that's the right word. Manipulated?What ever it was I found myself conflicted, knowing the reality and seeing the overblown bombast of the result which does land, mostly due to those really good songs, that sing passionately about things that are not real for this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Do these smiles seem fake? It doesnt matter where they come from if the joy is real.""","Musical movies normally aren't my thing. But after seeing a YouTube clip of Hugh Jackman and the cast, singing their hearts out to the 20th Century Fox executives, trying to get this movie the green light, I was sold.Hugh had undergone skin cancer surgery for his nose, just the day before he and all the other singers would get together in New York for their big day. And his doctor told him firmly, that he was NOT supposed to sing, or the stitches would come loose. He went anyway for support and being the showman that he is, tried to rally the troops for their battle, without phrasing a single note (with none other than Jeremy Jordan being his voice). All went as expected until the end, where he couldn't hold himself anymore, the whole room exploded and magic....true magic happened. (search for ""Hugh Jackman From Now On"" on YouTube)That same magic shined throughout the whole movie, giving me a grin from ear to ear and (probably due to me not getting enough sleep during New Years Eve) a trembling lip and moisty tears. You know, the tears that stay with your forever. The good kind.That's the impact The Greatest Showman had on me. All the songs were stunning, catchy and upbeat. The cast was phenomenal and their colorful costumes together with their infectious joy made me forget I was sitting in a theater.

"love the destination, cant say the same about the journey","""The Greatest Showman"" is a musical with great music, great cast, and leaves you feeling the true beauty of humanity. Unfortunately, it is also WAY too fast paced and has a couple unnecessary conflicts and dramas.Lets start with the positives. The movie has an absolutely INSANE music production. EVERY SINGLE song serves a purpose, it just works so wonderfully well, from the singers even to the choreography (kinda funny if you imagine people doing it in real life though). Talking about the singers, lets. Talk. Cast. I don't know any other way to say this, the cast makes the movie. Without the cast it wont be ""The Greatest Showman,"" they show, tell, deliver, and obivously sing the main message of the movie. It's beautiful.Now lets talk the negatives. The movie has a little too many stories it wants to tell, which causes 2 main problems. Firstly, the stories - except the main one - aren't told very well, and often fel rushed and way too fast. Secondly, the characters in them are kind of picked up and then just dropped like that, but this isn't AS BIG as the first problem.

A Visual Treat but Narratively Weak,"PT Barnum is the greatest carny to have ever lived. This is the undeniable truth every Connecticut resident should have drilled into them from cradle to the grave. This film, it doesn't seem to capture his greatness, his autobiography makes a far more interesting tale, but it at least provides for an interesting diversion. The music is good and the choreography is excellent, the story while watered down at least flows well so as to keep your interest. Its just that instead of the greatest showman they present an unnecessarily family friendly imitation.This needs repeating, the choreography is top notch. There is so much going on in every song and dance it can't all be caught in a single viewing. Their timing is perfect, the bar scene where shots are being slid, caught, and downed is so fluid its like watching the waves crashing into the shore. Everything is perfectly natural, like going to an actual Barnum & Bailey show (RIP). That is until they bring in the animals. Its hard to believe that they couldn't find any animal trainers for this movie, I know quite a few that could use the work, but the CGI is an abomination. Tom Thumb riding the horse looks like hot garbage, the elephants in the musical number look faker than if it was a man in a mask,. and the horses in the final number... they are a three frame gif. Considering everything else they had shown throughout the film, its just unacceptable.The writing is the weakest point of the movie, there is no conflict. Disregarding how it strayed from the actual life of PT Barnum, the caricature they give has no real trouble. He goes from being laid off when his employer goes belly up to success in half of the first act. He goes from shunned by high society to well respectable impressario in two scenes. He loses everything an rebuilds in one scene. Everything he does is trivialized by his immediate success so soon afterward to such a degree that nothing seems to matter. And the way they solve these problems are infuriating. A struggling business venture solved by his daughter with one line as he tucks her in the very next scene after the only person he could sell tickets to was his family. There is no build, the answer is given to him plain as day by a literal plot device. Its impossible to write a review with spoilers, there is absolutely nothing here to spoil.The major flaw with Barnum is simply this, he has no flaws. This could be said somewhat about the real man, he was an otherwise upright man who supported emancipation, charity, and family friendly entertainment, but to his core he was a carny. His early career was rife with trickery, from the Feejee Mermaid to exit signs written in other languages so that visitors had to pay to get back in. He was a great talker never to be left outside arm's reach. The film never goes into that. They say he is the King of Humbuggery, but he does little to warrant the title. In fact, they even go to great lengths to over up his exploits. Tom Thumb is introduced at 25, a dwarf hidden away by his mother. He was adopted by the real Barnum at 4 and started performing at 5. It gets to the point that the only real connection between the two is a name and a gift of gab.I don't think this is a terrible movie. Reading the 11 questions from EW and some of the professional reviews really makes it sound worse than it is. Its just a lacking movie. A movie about the man who watered down his stage play of Uncle Tom's Cabin to make it family friendly, its only fitting they do the same to him. I just have to question why they chose to put a trailer for The Commuter with a scene of a man being pushed in front of a bus before it. Right after the Gnome sequel too. In fact, I question why most of the trailers were included when only one seemed age appropriate.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Awful and inaccurate!,"Awful movie so far from the truth. Barnum is portrayed as a likeable, skilled businessman with high morals. But in truth he was a conman and tyrant.
Hugh Jackman, has been wanting to make and star in this movie for years as an epic rags-to-riches romantic musical movie celebrating Barnum's extraordinary life.But the movie paints such a false picture of Barnum, it should be a comedy. There is no mention of Barnum's endless failed business ventures, or his hasty second marriage, after his first wife's death, to a girl 40 years his junior, or his horrific mistreatment of his human and animal exhibits?Tom Thumb (real name, Charles Sherwood Stratton), was someone who suffered from dwarfism and stood just 25in high. Barnum had him dressed him in military uniform and billed him as the 'world's smallest general'.But Barnum first used him when he was a five-year-old boy and he put him to work drinking alcohol as part of his act, he was barely seven when he started puffing on cigars.And what of Joice Heth, the 80-year-old black slave whom Barnum bought for in 1835, he had her rebranded as 'George Washington's 160-year-old nanny.' Poor Joice was blind and partially paralyzed, with just enough movement in her right arm to allow her to smoke a corn-cob pipe. She was also toothless. Barnum even boasted about how he'd plied her with drink and then pulled out her remaining teeth to make her look closer to 160. Not surprisingly, she didn't last long - barely a year. He made still more money out of her death, charging the public 50 cents each to attend her public autopsy.
She has been airbrushed out completely out of the movie.Also there is no mention in the film of black conjoined twins Millie-Christine, or black brothers, Eko and Iko, all of whom had been kidnapped from their parents as children for their 'freak show' value, and later acquired by Barnum. Or the dread-locked black men who were displayed in cages as 'wild men.'
Also upsetting was an African-American boy, William Henry Johnson, who suffered from microcephaly, which meant he had a tiny, sloping head.
His 'act' involved sitting in a cage, dressed in a furry suit, shrieking and rattling the bars and pretending to be the Wildman of Africa or a 'man monkey'. At other times he was exhibited as Zip the Pinhead.Barnum is shown heroically rescuing someone from a fire. In truth in the 1860s, his New York Museum did burn down not once, but twice, boiling whales alive, roasting pythons and letting orangutans and serpents loose to roam free in Manhattan.In what was perhaps his biggest fraud of all, Barnum achieved the acceptance he craved from posh society by reinventing himself as a philanthropist, reforming mayor and anti-slavery campaigner.What is annoying about these movies is that they try to history so that characters like Joice Heth on whom he built his fortune, the black brothers, Eko and Iko, poor little Zip the Pinhead and scores of others like them, are forgotten. Just as they have been in the film.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
SENSATIONAL!!!,"Everything about this film was perfect! For a film that's so big on it's spectacle it manages to approach issues that we as a society are still facing today without bombarding the audience. The songs make you want to get up and dance. I definitely cried from start to finish, it takes you on a perfect rollercoaster of happiness and sadness! This is definitely a film for all ages and for non-musical movie goers I would still suggest going to see it as the musical numbers are so positive that you can't help but love it!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Greatest Movie!,"Like many people, I've seen this multiple times at the cinema. The music is sublime; the message of acceptance is beautiful; and the feeling of being uplifted is almost unparalleled. You'll leave the cinema elated. Can't wait for the Blu-ray to watch over and over again",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fantastical...,"This movie has great visuals. Most of its songs were catchy and fun, and they did a lot of interesting cinematography and colorful visuals. Though the story they are trying to tell about PT Barnum is interesting to say the least. A very fantastical story of a man who wasn't actually that great. I think despite the very very non historical tellings of this man, and it very much romanticizes this man who did a lot of bad things in his life, like cheating and exploitation. Though I suppose it's supposed to be a more fantastical film, despite the historical connections. I would recommend this movie for people who enjoy their fantasies.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Greatest Musical Movie ever!!!!,"Can't have a word! First, i'm in love with the songs, i listened them, imagine it how they're gonna be in visual. And, voila the visualization of the songs are really really great! Acting, Scene, and Musical are just too awesome. The lyrics are so powerful.Thank you for making this greatest movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"I kind of get what the critics were saying, but to heck with them anyway","THE GREATEST SHOWMAN is undoubtedly hokum in every sense. The themes are cliche, the history laughable, the story less a narrative than a series of music videos strung together. And yet, the performers and visuals are packed with such cheerful energy that one cannot help but leave the movie with a smile, feeling satisfied. The ambiance reminded me a lot of old-school movie musicals: the deliberate artifice and simple characters combined with a giddiness that's infectious.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

heart is in the right place,"This is not a flawless movie. First i will talk about good things. The songs and dance choreography is stunning. And through songs story and mental state of character is nicely conveyed. The saying story through the songs are also nice . The acing is good, production design is great . Some people says that it is not historically accurate and i think the film also does not want to be. The main problem with this movie is in character writing . For that you dont feel for any character . And second one is there is very few low point for that high point is not that impactful . Overall it is a good entertainer to be seen on big screen.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
PURE MAGIC!,"I haven't seen such a beautiful movie for years. I bought the dvd two days ago and I can't stop thinking how I have been stupid not to see it at the cinema. Great rhythm, wonderful direction, acting (Hugh Jackson and Rebecca Ferguson above all), screenplay, cinematography, editing, art direction, costumes. And one the most enchanting and powerful music ever written. I just can't choose a favourite song, as they all are absolutely stunning. I wouldn't change a single moment or a single note. From the very first moment till the end I have been living in a dream I haven't get out yet. In the heaviest and saddest period of my life, this movie has made me find again the wish to smile, to sing, to dance, to live... I feel ""light"", like I'm walking on clouds, as I haven't felt for such a long time... This is not only a musical, this is not only cinema, this is pure magic!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Absolutely flawless execution of a very predictable, crazy mainstream story.","This might as well have been a disney movie. The songs felt way more ""cheap disney knockoff"" than broadway musical to me. They felt more like pop music. Catchy as hell though. The production value is absolutely perfect. The cast is amazing. Hugh Jackman carried the entire movie on his freaking back which is saying something when the rest of the cast is also great.But honestly, substance wise... It's really really predictable. And i guess that 's fine, it just makes this movie more of a ""family movie"" where you can miss half the movie and still enjoy it rather than a story driven film.Overall, was expecting more from the story, was expecting more from the songs, was blown away by the execution of what it actually was.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

SO much better than La La Land!,"For the life of me I can't understand how La La Land could land all the awards and this gem not getting anything close to the same recognition, when both the movie itself and the music are both infinitely better. One of the best family movies I've seen - works for all ages. For a non-American a lot of the messages in the movie can seem a cheezy, but never mind - good intent, fantastically acted and set note to. Go see, smile away and just enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pleasant but forgettable,"It seems every reviewer on this site is up in arms against a swarm of film critics who reviewed this film negatively. I abstained from any reviews or ratings before viewing, but frankly the film was only above average, no more.Choreography was quite good, and certainly captured the energy demanded by the film's subject matter. The accompanying cinematography was well executed, as should be expected from a director whose background is in commercial advertising. But for a film that relies on its score and spectacle, almost every song was immediately forgettable.Watch Moulin Rouge and plan to walk out with ""Come What May"" and ""Your Song"" stuck in your head. See Hamilton, and you'll be unwrapping dozens of cleverly hidden double-entendres for days. The songs from ""The Greatest Showman"" simply pale in comparison to those from any noteworthy musical. The lyrics are shallow, relying on tired turns of phrase and unoriginal analogies. The melodies border on pedestrian, and often provide little more than a framework to support the vocal riffs of the (admittedly excellent) performers.Hugh Jackman is clearly in his element here, and makes the most of every moment on screen. The same can be said for the majority of the cast, but sadly their greatest moments are limited by the failure of originality from the writing/composing team.This film is absolutely worth seeing, particularly for fans of theater and musicals. Just don't expect it to stand up to the expectations that have been set by the great musicals of our time.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Could have been 10 times better than it was.,"Generally very good. Superb cast and great songs. The story is also good.That said. I felt there was a lack of character development and having amazing characters this should have been explored.The first half hour could have been better spent. Too much time was spent on establishing a character which could have been done in a visually written screen grab or such like. The film as a whole could have done with an additional half hour. Although the story is good, it could have been told much better.The whole film felt rushed and very blocky. It didn't really flow and felt very disjointed. Individual scenes and big visual numbers were excellent, but weren't seemless together.The film could have been amazing and areas were. It just failed at telling a cohesive story.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Not bad, amazing songs","I thought I would hate this, but I was 100% wrong.I loved it. Great songs, great acting, amazing story. I don't think it was really based on P.T. Barnum creating his circus, but it did have amazing people, like the bearded lady who can actually sing, a trapeze act, and eventually a singer who falls for P.T Barnum.Zac Efron wasn't bad, the music was worth it, and I love seeing it as much as I can",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

I watched it again, and I still love it.This one is the complete opposite. It was boring, and by the first song, I wanted my eyes and ears to be in a different direction.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
The critics are out of touch with the people.,"This is absolutely one of the most fantastic and fantastical movies I have ever seen!! Definitely one of the best stand alone (not part of a series or cinematic universe) movies I have seen in recent years. 
Frankly the critics can go suck eggs. There is a 35% discrepancy between the audience score at the time of my writing this and that is ridiculous and tells me the critics are out of touch with the people and therefore irrelevant. The movie itself is like a ""screw you"" to the critics:
""Does it bother you that everything you are selling is fake?""
""Do these smiles seem fake?""
The movie is great. It isn't trying to be anything or say anything, it isn't condescending or manipulative, it doesn't linger on cliché situations for long and keeps moving through the story. It exists to make people smile and that is something wonderful. It really is like a trip to the circus. You don't go to the circus for realism, you go for a fun, colorful and fantastical escape from real life, that is what this movie is.
That all being said, if you don't like musicals you probably won't like this movie but I would still suggest giving it a chance and go in with childlike wonder, not adult bitterness and cynicism. Let it remind you of what a trip to the circus was like when you were 6.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Ignore the critics, they are nothting but humbug!","This is an amazing musical. It is big, loud, and over-the-top as all musicals are. It could be a Broadway show put on the big screen. That is what I expected, and I was not disappointed. I love the songs, how they weave into the story, and the voices preforming them are outstanding! The imagination and spectacle is magnificent. I would have liked it to be a bit longer, and some more depth added to some of the storylines, but overall, it is an outstanding production!!
I have already seen it twice, bought the soundtrack, and may see it another time or two before it leave the theater, and will definitely be owning this one!
The critics seem to think this was supposed to be a historical documentary or something. It could maybe be classified as historical fiction. It is loosely based on PT Barnum's life, but sensationalized for screen. So, as I said, ignore the critics, they really are nothing but Humbug!!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The greatest conman?,"Maybe it would've helped if I saw this during the 2017 Xmas season when it's easy to offer something to someone and they'd immediately consume it with glee and not during 2018's Typhoon season when the weather is dreary and everything takes a lot of effort to do. While it did lift up the mood on an otherwise gloomy Saturday night with it's blistering choreography, dazzling costumes and contemporary music, once the smoke clears and you go back to the story you kind of realize that you may have been conned a little.Overall, the movie was good. My only critic is it's pacing. While I appreciate the hurried pace since I'm not really into musicals, they sacrificed a lot of things in exchange for keeping the audience's attention span. PT Burnam's life was full of ups and downs but we're only shown what they chose to show. While I agree a musical isn't necessarily for historical accuracy, but what I got from their summary was that he was a con man through and through. They didn't give me time to sympathize why he had to do what he did, they just pushed me into the next scene hoping I didn't notice that aspect of his life. There were a lot of missed opportunities as well between the characters of Philip and Anne, and even between PT and Jenny. Maybe because this is Michael Gracey's first film to direct, prior to this he was doing commercials (where he first met Hugh Jackman and how he remembered him years after and sent Michael the script) and supervising visual effects.Taking all of those away and just the musical aspect of the show, this movie is an almost-winner. Choreography was near flawless (Zendaya reportedly did all her stunts), the music was purposefully made to sound ahead of it's time but some of the lyrics seemed off even if they were penned by Oscar award-winning duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul of La La Land fame. Some lyrics seemed force and were out of tune which pretty much sound like most of the song written nowadays if you think about it.If you've seen 2001's Mouline Rouge! by Baz Luhrmann, you can't help but compare and contrast and depending on who you listen to, this can mean as an insult or a compliment. But while the MR! is untouchable, The Greatest Showman has a lot of areas it can improve on and only time will tell if the future will be kinder to it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
