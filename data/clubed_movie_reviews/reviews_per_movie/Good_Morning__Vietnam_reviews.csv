A great morale booster!,"Vietnam without a doubt was a dark period in our history.Any comedy film surrounding Vietnam would indeed have to be done delicately.This movie pulls it off.What amazes me most about the film is the flawless, improvisational radio dialog from Robin Williams.This,as most of you may know,was completely unscripted to allow Williams an opportunity to work his magic.Also,it had to be timely,for the movie is,of course,set in 1965.The fact that he was able to do this is nothing short of amazing.The supporting cast was also incredible,with great performances by Forrest Whitaker,Bruno Kirby,and the late J.T.Walsh as ""Sergeant Major Dickerson"",the man you love to hate.Although some of the horror that was Vietnam is here,it's only giving you a taste of it,as it concentrates more on the Williams character's quest to make our beloved soldiers forget their horror,at least for a while.Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The best--Williams behind the mic--is 11 stars, but the movie as a whole is a kind of slick formula otherwise","Good Morning, Vietnam (1987)A lighthearted but deadly serious anti-war film, actually. This is of course a Robin Williams movie so that it is his schtick, brilliant and inspired, that makes it soar. The best of it, including the famous riff when he first gets on the air as the new Saigon DJ, is hilarious and breathtaking. There is a plot, sort of, as he goes through a rise and fall at the military radio station, but it's more about his shining moments behind the microphone than anything else.The ""else"" in this movie is, however, most of the movie. That is, Williams has a serious role as an offbeat renegade in a chaotic world surrounded by a range of sensible and very insensible officers and colleagues. At the most extreme, when we see a Vietnamese village firebombed while Louis Armstrong sings ""It's a Wonderful World,"" the sentiment is so cloying it makes you cry, and you're not sure why because you know it's just over the top manipulation. Likewise when Williams is caught in a traffic jam with other military vehicles and he warms up the soldiers by humanizing everyone and making them feel like they really should be back home. Which they should be, as we know in retrospect.So the movie has another side that's kind of sentimental and simplistic, whatever its good pacifist intentions. Williams is a decent actor—I'm not one of those who thinks he's brilliant outside of his funny roles—and so it holds up pretty well. But the plot line keeps the movie from really finding pathos, or comedy, or warmth, or tragedy of a dramatic kind, in the scenes outside the radio station. And I think that's what it intended.For those who don't know, it's worth adding that the main character, Adrian Cronauer, was a real person, and still is—he's a staunch Republican (Williams was not, to be sure) and an innovator in radio in Vietnam. He also co-wrote the screenplay, I assume working on the scenes that he would know best rather than the larger saccharine plot aspects. A great story, and the real Cronauer deserves credit for inspiring it, and helping it along. He was, along with most of us, ""Godsmacked"" when he heard the news of Williams's death.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The definitive Robin Williams film,"There never has been, and probably never will be, another film which shows both sides of Williams to such a great degree.As the wise-cracking disc-jockey, Williams shows his undisputed wild comedic talent, but the bomb scene and scenes of rural Vietnam life, truly allow Williams to such his dramatic acting ability. They look at the conflict, without getting in too deep.A superb cast as well including Bruno Kirby and the late great J.T. Walsh gives a solid backdrop, and are beautiful foils to Williams.Overall, a wonderful movie, add it to your collection.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Funny and real,"Let me be perfectly frank and say right away that I watched this to experience Robin Williams at his best. That guy has so much comedic talent, it's unreal. I mostly got what I expected from this movie... but I found that it also contained some truths about the Vietnam war. The movie has plenty to offer on both fronts. Any fan of Williams' comedy will definitely enjoy it, and I think most war-movie buffs will too... if they can keep an open mind, and accept a slightly different approach to the genre. The way the seriousness of war is underplayed for most of the film really works to enhance the effect of it when it is shoved right in our faces, when we are forced to acknowledge it. We forget how serious and all-consuming war is, just like Adrian had(not necessarily the real one, I know nothing of him except of what the film told me, and as far as I understand, that's not that accurate a portrayal of him), only to be confronted with it. More effective than several big war movies. The plot is very good. The pacing is great, the movie keeps moving pretty much all through the film. The characters are well-written and credible. The acting is good pretty much all-round, and Williams proves once again that he can do drama just as well as comedy. The humor is typical Robin Williams. A very good film, and an unusual war movie. I recommend this to fans of Robin Williams and war movies. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Goooooooooooooooooooood Morning Preston Sturges,"It finally hit me when I watched Good Morning Vietnam what this film reminded me of. It was the famous Preston Sturges classic, Sullivan's Travels which coincidentally as it turns out is one of my favorite films.Both the real life Adrian Cronauer and Joel McCrea's fictional John L. Sullivan have to come to the same realization, that what they do matters a great deal. In Sullivan's Travels it's to the movie going public in general, in the case of Cronauer it's to the GIs in Vietnam stuck in a war where no one could ever know who the enemy was. A few laughs from a comic genius was necessary to get them through the day in their very cockeyed world.Adrian Cronauer was a real life person, but if he didn't bear a resemblance to Robin Williams, he should have. One of the great comic masters of any era in entertainment, Robin Williams is given full range for his zany sense of humor to work its magic with Cronauer. He's ably abetted and assisted by the other staff members of Armed Forces Radio Forest Whitaker and Robert Wuhl. Bruno Kirby is great as the clueless lieutenant in charge and so is J.T. Walsh who represents the limits of the military mind as the sergeant major out to get Williams by hook or very dirty crook.Williams himself doesn't understand the complexities of the Vietnam situation. That fact is brought home to him graphically when he's betrayed by his own innate decency.Next to Williams my favorite in the cast is Noble Willingham who plays the general who has overall charge of Armed Forces Radio there. He's a tough, but compassionate military man, the exact opposite of J.T. Walsh whom he has to reign in.Good Morning Vietnam is a frank portrayal of a war experience told with humor and irony through the eyes of Robin Williams.Preston Sturges would have absolutely adored this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Effective movie that is neither too funny nor too grim,"I just sat through a DVD of this movie,the second(?)time I'd seen this film. The last time I could recall seeing this,it was on pay-per-view television in a hotel(the Red Lion I think it was) room,August of 1988,so my memories of this film could use a refreshing. I'm glad I got refreshed.In 1965,Airman Adrian Cronauer(Robin Williams,in the first of his four Academy Award nominations)is brought on to do an Armed Forces Radio stint in Vietnam. Behind the microphone,Cronauer lets loose,much to the surprise and delight of many of the troops and servicemen around the area of combat. His combination of off-the-wall humor,impressions,sound gags and quick wit,mixed with his love of free-wheeling Rock music of the era,is pretty much welcomed in the area,save for a few angry sorts: a Napoleon-complexed intermediate CO named Hauk(Bruno Kirby,unrecognizable but for the voice) and a stiff-lipped,quietly vindictive middle commander named Dickerson(J.T.Walsh,so good here it would seem like this typecast him). As this is going on,Cronauer becomes smitten with a local girl(Chinatra Sukapatra,spelling?)and befriends her brother(Tung Thanh Tran),which leads the popular DJ down a road of self-discovery.With excellent support from Forrest Whitaker(one of my favorites!he ends up sort of counter-balancing Williams' manic frenzy with nerdish normalcy as his buddy/assistant/guide),Richard Edson,Noble Winnigham,Robert Wuhl and Cu Ba Nguyen(as the oily GI bar proprietor)among others,this film,directed by Barry Levinson(whose work hasn't been this good in what feels like forever,certainly not since Avalon or Rain Man) and written by Mitch Markowitz,it is arguable one of the deftest films to create and maintain a balance between the horrors and inhumanity of war and the humor and pathos that are very much present in it. Robin Williams' fans may get much more out of this that those who aren't,but I think even many of those who don't consider themselves fanciers of his talents should be able to appreciate this. The images were powerful enough that they stuck with me some after the first time I saw GMV and after a second time I feel like can appreciate even more out of this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Heavily Reliant On The Robin Williams Magic,"Despite being a fan of Robin Williams' unique brand of scattershot, stream-of-consciousness comedy, I had never seen ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" all the way through. While I am glad to have finally checked that off my watch list, I do have to say that it underwhelmed me a bit, especially when it comes to any historical or cultural significance outside of its leading man.For a very basic overview, ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" tells the story of Adrian Cronauer (Williams), an Army Radio DJ assigned to a Vietnam station in 1965. While his non-conformist attitude ruffles the feathers of the higher-ups--especially Lt. Hauk (Bruno Kirby)--he quickly inspires fellow soldiers in every corner of the conflict.There is absolutely no doubt or denying that ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" sees Williams at perhaps the peak of his comedic zenith. Every single scene of him DJ-ing the station will have you laughing out loud. His fast-talking, reference-alluding style is so unique that it's sort of a one-of-a-kind experience. Personally, I very much consider this entire film to be little more than a showcase for his talents.Which leads me to the unfortunate part of this experience for me: aside from Williams, I really didn't get much else out of ""Good Morning, Vietnam"". While it is pretty clear what the writers and director Barry Levinson are trying to accomplish character-wise, it all seems a bit cloying, predictable, and sometimes even a bit cartoonish. The Army is inflexible, Williams is the fly in the ointment, and we all bemoan the pointlessness of the whole ordeal. Maybe this all hit a little closer to home in 1987, but watching in 2020 it felt a bit overcooked in terms of stereotypes.Overall, though, the sheer presence of Williams makes this a very watchable film, albeit perhaps a bit overrated from a historical perspective. Come for Williams, but your mileage may vary regarding the other material here.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
good morning and (a very good) day,"""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is truly Robin Williams at his best. As anarchic DJ Adrian Cronauer in 1965 Saigon, he makes sure that you never stop laughing. I really liked what he did with the tape of Richard Nixon's speech, and then his comment about the bombing of a restaurant. Most amazing is that he ad-libbed the whole thing (but hey, that's Robin Williams). Maybe Cronauer wasn't that wacky in real life, but every one of Williams' comments makes the movie worthwhile. The soundtrack even includes his monologues (you'll go crazy over the imitation of Lyndon Johnson, and the commentary from ""Roosevelt E. Roosevelt""). A comedy classic in every sense.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Excellent performance, with a strong message.","Robbin Williams gives the performance of his life, in this funny, yet politically motivated movie, on the no (official) news or miss-information given out (to the troops) at the time of the most controversial conflict of the modern era. A strong supporting cast, including a young Forrest Whitaker are a bonus but the overall story is a bit thin and the love interest (for me) is not fully developed.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Robin Williams does his thing well in this comedy that makes us think. ***1/2 (out of four),"GOOD MORNING, VIETNAM / (1987) ***1/2 (out of four)By Blake French:Robin Williams is about as good as they come at doing stand up comedy, and in ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" director Berry Levinson gives him everything he needs to make the film go above and beyond the average satire. From his outgoing sense of humor, to his aggressive personality, and dozens of vocal effects, he portrays his character with interactive zest. Who can resist the awakening voice of Williams on the radio yelling ""Good Morning Vietnam."" This is a film that conquers the test of time.""Good Morning, Vietnam"" tells the story of a lively disc jockey who gets a job on Armed Forced Radio during the Vietnam War. Robin Williams is the fast-talking Adrian Cronauer, and who better to play the part than he. Although this character is one-dimensional (we are never informed on his background, marital status, where he comes from, what he did before we meet), as the movie continues he gradually begins to change into a deeper, more meaningful person.The story moves along smoothly; the narrative through-line is consistent as each scene relates to the next. Although little momentum or suspense can be noticed, the film does have several underlining themes, often viewed upon in a Stanley Kubrick style: sarcastic and uncompromising. We see how much a little humor and jazz can greatly enlighten the hard-core atmosphere of the military during Vietnam, and how it can thoroughly confuse the bleeding heart officials.The film hangs by the skin of its teeth for active conflict tension. Beyond people objecting to the actions of Williams' character, there is just not a lot of tension within the story, and at some points my interest wandered. ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is merely a portrait of Robin Williams releasing his perennial comedy, and unfortunately that does happen to get old quite quickly; the majority of an audience can only watch the humor for so long until it becomes old and somewhat stale.""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is definitely not a flawless film, but we do empathize for the main character, the scenes effectively capture the attitude and mood during the war, and the dialogue and writing feel accurate and involving. Barry Levinson has directed a marvelous comedy, one that is not all about making us laugh, but also makes us think.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Much more hyped than it really deserves.,"Robin Williams plays Adrian Cronauer, a real-life DJ stationed in Vietnam. He confronts authority and does what he can to defend the Vietnamese people, while befriending one man and trying to date his sister with moderate success. And then things go downhill.I can sum this movie up in one sentence: Robin Williams is not funny. The film is full of him ad-libbing voices where he's a homosexual, or a redneck or referencing people that were probably forgotten in 1987, and definitely today. He's decent as an actor when not trying to be funny, but every attempt at humor falls flat. To make matters worse, people in the background are literally falling out of their chairs with laughter... I don't think so.Forest Whitaker is in this, and plays more or less no role other than to follow Cronauer around and be a somewhat dim-witted sidekick who can't ride a bike or start a jeep properly. That's unfortunate that Whitaker was sidelined for Williams.You've most likely seen this film, as it has aired on television a million times in the past twenty years. I avoided it, and only came to view it by random happenstance. This was, as it turns out, a mistake, and I was right to avoid it. (Also, if you have any interest in real Vietnam War history, the actual Cronauer makes it clear that Williams did not portray him even remotely accurately.)",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Incomprehensible,"As a foreign viewer, more than half of the film dialogue and radio shows was completely incomprehensible. Filled with convoluted, old references to things and people you never heard of, that probably only an American in his late 70's would understand. Robin Williams charisma and comedic talent isn't enough to overturn that fact, so If you don't fit the above profile, I'd recommend to skip this one.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A dull, predictable film that's merely a vehicle for Williams's tediously overbearing comedy.","There's a great Family Guy cutaway gag in which Peter Griffin and Robin Williams sit on a sofa as Peter names topics such as religion and politics for Williams to comment on. Williams does so with his trademark brand of insufferable overbearing comedy, which is filling any amount of time with frenetically incessant rambling. Peter responds simply with an exasperated sigh before leaving for a five minute break, which prompts Williams to start yet another barrage of supposedly funny noises. I felt much like Peter Griffin whilst watching Good Morning Vietnam. It reaffirmed my opinion that Williams was not the 'tragicomic genius' that so many purported him to be.Read a short synopsis of Vietnam and you'll know exactly what it's all about: the lovable family favourite Robin Williams being kooky, charming the troops but clashing with straight-laced, humourless authority figures. It's completely predictable and completely trite. They also throw in a love interest for good measure in the form of Trinh (Chintara Sukapatana), a wholly lifeless woman whom Williams refuses to stop pestering.Williams is never funny during his radio broadcasts, however the film repeatedly tells us otherwise, showing us scores of characters struggling to hold back their tears of laughter. So many of the supporting actors, whether they're random troops or studio operators, were just diegetic canned laughter rather than proper characters.Make no mistake, Robin Williams isn't playing Adrian Cronauer, he's playing Robin Williams at his most loud and rambling. Williams is repeatedly characterised as the lovable clown who brings the people together, it's rather nauseating; no matter how hard the film tries, it cannot convince me that he's either funny or charming, only very irritating. Despite this, there are some moments that raised a smile, such as the language class scenes in which he focuses on New York City street talk rather than the artificial, staid sentences of the textbooks.Williams's flatly developed adversaries Lt. Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) and Sgt. Major Dickinson (J. T. Walsh) are the typical officious military men, they develop a resentment towards him that's so instantaneous that it's contrived and unbelievable; they're just narrative functions that try and make you feel sorry for Williams the lovable crazy cookie.It sometimes attempts to be a drama or 'dramedy' with moments of perfunctory war moralising, but ultimately Good Morning, Vietnam is preoccupied with indulging Williams's penchant for shouting incessantly rather than achieving anything approaching credible commentary or pathos.",,Anonymous,Biography
Here's Robin,"Robin Williams found fame on television with Mork & Mindy but his early foray into movies was hit and miss.Williams had yet to have a vehicle where his brand of humour can go at full flow. Good Morning Vietnam was it. The story is loosely based on the experiences of Armed Forces Radio DJ Adrian Cronauer.By playing the DJ, Williams could free-wheel it on the mic, provide laughs and annoy the authorities in this case Bruno Kirby who certainly does not get his humour. He and JT Walsh conspire to get him off the air. These two certainly did not want soldiers to be happy.As the story progresses you get some drama, but it's not quite the horrors of the Vietnam war in the way films such as Platoon would show it.After all this is still a comedy and the drama is secondary.This was Williams movie where he could be anarchic. It started a run of performances in comedy and drama that rewarded him with an Oscar a decade later.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Really smart and somewhat humbling film that entertains and amuses.,"Made at a time when films on the Vietnam war were being produced by America at a healthy rate, Good Morning, Vietnam comes across as the sort that falls into both 'types' that were being produced at the time. Platoon got under the skin of Vietnam, telling the events from an individual's perspective through voiceovers without relying on a lot of causality, rather the everyday tasks and events that occur. Full Metal Jacket was an interesting beast in the sense most of its more intense scenes didn't actually happen in Vietnam but rather at home on the training ground. But both were in a sensible tradition and took attention away from the Reaganism inspired 'action' films that were Rambo: First Blood Part II and the like.Good Morning, Vietnam falls into both these sorts of Vietnam war films. On one hand it is a serious film about the war and deals with serious issues such as morale and how dangerous conflict with the enemy actually is without doing what Rambo did by turning the war genre into a sub-division of the action genre. At one point in the film, DJ and lead character of the film Adrian Cronauer (Williams) finds himself in a hostile area out in the jungle and you do feel the shift in atmosphere the film briefly moves into in the sense this guy is not a soldier but he is in a dangerous position and he isn't equipped with how to get through it. There is another scene in which a street side bomb goes off and Adrian is caught up in the middle of it, further reminding us of the war zone and cleverly shifting the aura.But the film does fall into the genre of comedy and while it does so, it never distracts us from the fact this is taking place during a war unlike First Blood: Part II which could really have been an action film set amongst any backdrop. Good Morning, Vietnam does not ignore its comedy roots either and gives us genuinely entertaining disc jockey rants from Williams who shines with his animation and ad-libbing, further reminding us of a later film of his, Aladdin, and how he really was the star of that piece.The best parts of Good Morning, Vietnam actually raise issues to do with oppositional reading. As a character, Adrian is one of those charismatic individuals who is perhaps more focused on entertaining his audience first but when repercussions to do with that want to entertain arise, it is an oppositional reading to something that seems innocent enough. There are a couple of scenes and incidences that deal with this theme of oppositional reading. One that springs to mind takes place in a bar in which Adrian has brought a Vietnamese friend whom he teaches in an English class. The trouble is, it's a G.I. bar and certain soldiers have an issue with the Vietnamese person being there. It is Adrian's carefree and relaxed attitude to letting the individual come with him to the bar that has upset certain others around him, resulting in an oppositional opinion on whether the Vietnamese person should be allowed there. One says he can, others say he can't and conflict erupts.This battle is constantly going on within the boundaries of the radio studio and exists between Adrian and the censors who blank out all the bad news such as deaths and bombings, failing to deliver the real news, and instead keep morale from going below a certain point. Adrian's style of giving the people what they should hear in a charismatic style also rubs off spawning a sub-story revolving around a small school that teaches Vietnamese people the English language. Before hand, they were learning very basic words and phrases but after Adrian takes over, New York City slang or 'jargon' is the name of the game and while you wouldn't find English as a foreign language classes doing this sort of thing, Adrian brings his charismatic style to a class, turning it from formal to informal.The theme here is that he's giving them exactly what he feels they need to know, not what the curriculum demand they know. It is the same with the radio station and the news censorship; giving people what they have a right to know vs. what a higher power say they should know. The principal foil for Adrian is Lt. Steven Hauk (Kirby) who is against Adrian's style of parody and constant joking but when he is put on air, the best he can do is adopt the voice and role of a Frenchman as he mocks and plods his way through airtime. It is a battle that the oppositional readers loose since morale falls drastically after Adrian is taken off and he is forced to be reinstated because of this.Good Morning, Vietnam carries a pumping soundtrack which is what you'd expect for a film about a DJ and an emphasis on radio and its constant referencing to popular culture, gliding from The Wizard of Oz to Eleanor Roosevelt makes Williams' scenes consistently fun to watch. But other than this, it gives some political stances without ever feeling forced with the 'Wonderful World' montage over wartime action and juxtaposes James Brown's music over other scenes of wartime action. The film is a success in comedy and drama, a rarity of sorts given Dr. Strangelove supposedly set the standards.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Entertaining and fascinating movie about a frenetic Disc Jockey during Vietnam War,"An unorthodox DJ begins to shake up things when he is assigned to the US Armed Services Radio station in Vietnam ; it is based on real life Adrian Cronauer . An impulsive new Disc Jockey named Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams), on whom story was based , is shipped from Crete to Vietnam to bring humor to Armed Forces Radio. The irreverent radio man turns the studio on its ear and becomes wildly popular with the soldiers , realizing uproarious monologues but runs afoul of the middle management (J.T. Walsh , Bruno Kirby ,Robert Wuhl) who think he isn't G.I. enough . D J brings rock 'n' roll to troops during that period when the Vietnam War matured from its origins into a full-blown war as he briefly ruled Saigon's Armed Forces Radio in 1965 . While Adrian is off the air accompanied by his aide-de-camp (Forest Whitaker) attempts to meet Vietnamese especially women , and results to have brushes with the actual war that never appears on the radio.It's a stunning and absorbing story that is based on real events and historical deeds . The storyline tackles issues of ethics and morality and the horror war . The movie in spite of the passed time is still powerful and astounding. The film is a Robin Williams recital as he realizes a splendid portrayal of a frantic disc jockey as he plays , sings , stooges, tongue twister and pulls faces and grimaces . It's a farce with the master comic pretty amusing and with several wonderful songs from the 60s . Robin copped a first rate acting , achieved a lot of success and a well-earned nomination for best main actor . Williams' improvisational manic monologues are the spotlights and carry the film in an interesting story which meanders too much . Ideal main cast is completed by phenomenal secondary actors as J.T. Walsh , Robert Wuhl, Noble Willingham and also shines Bruno Kirby as jealous superior. Marvelous musical score by the classic Alex North -Cleopatra,Spartacus- , including relevant musical interludes . Coloristic cinematography by Peter Sova , the outdoors filmed in Thailand are spellbound and breathtaking . The motion picture is compellingly directed by Barry Levinson -Sleepers, Bugsy, Avalon- .This is a highly amusing and frequently funny War/drama/comedy romp with a witty script specifically aimed an adult audience . Picture is a vehicle Robin Williams , he's the whole show , he's an outrageous comic and real Farceur. If you like Robin's crazy interpretation , you will most definitely enjoy this one . Well worth watching for enjoyable performances from main cast as well as the warfare buffs who also will like it .

If Hawkeye was a  DJ AND in the Vietnam War...,"... he would be Robin William's portrayal of D.J. Adrian Cronauer in this film. This ended Robin William's long period of exile in purely comedic, and quite frankly, silly films that started back in 1980 with Popeye. His career up to this point paralleled Steve Martin's in many ways, because his past career as a stand-up comic - and let's face it Mork and Mindy just had him basically doing stand-up on the four year run of that TV show - had pigeon-holed him into doing films like ""The Survivors"" and ""The Best of Times"" where he was doing straight comedy with mediocre scripts.This role was tailor made for Williams, because when he does his thing as the morning DJ, it is his own impromptu brash brand of fast talking comedy that made him famous. I hear that the director just gave Robin an outline of what was going on and let him rip. Nobody is safe - not then ex-Veep Nixon, not Walter Cronkite, not LBJ's daughters. Plus there is a great soundtrack of the best of sixties music. So much so that they wind up playing a song that wasn't even written in 1965 - ""You Just Keep Me Hanging On"". To play against Willams' character is Bruno Kirby as Lt. Steven Hauk who is not evil, he is just as square as he can be with no appreciation of Cronauer's humor or taste in music. I think we've all had bosses like this guy. For evil you have to go to J.T. Walsh as Sgt. Major Dickinson, who threatens and actually seems like he would enjoy sending Cronauer to his death in the jungles of Nam.Robin Williams gets to do some serious acting when he runs into the extreme censorship of the news that is done by the army - he doesn't get to report anything that isn't completely positive. And, up close and personal, he runs into the fact that ""the enemy"" includes the Vietnamese themselves, who are not so much hot on Communism as they are cold to the idea of being occupied by the Americans as they had been occupied by the French before.I can't tell you anymore than this without giving something away. Just realize that this film is not a complete laughfest - there is some serious stuff going on here too - and that is why it was perfect for Robin Williams' transition to serious roles. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Funny with A Tragic Turn,"A fun and mostly lighthearted approach to covering the Vietnam War, as Robin Williams does his best to lift the spirits of the downtrodden troops in Vietnam. Forrest Whittaker is very sweet and adorkable in his supporting role, and the loudmouth insecure lieutenant is a riot to watch but heads with Robin Willaims over the radio show. The film is oddly almost pro-war and jingoistic, which is rare for a Vietnam film. But to be fair, it is subverted with the finale as one of the characters challenges Robin Williams' ideals on the ethics of the war and why the Vietcong feel driven to do such drastic warfare in the first place. It's not perfect, but there's a lot of sincerity and talent that helps it stand out from the other Vietnam War movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
more than a simple Robin Williams rant,"Director Barry Levinson takes a more comedic take on the Vietnam war like other great war comedies such as MASH. Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) is the new DJ in a stiff Armed Forces Radio. Edward Garlick (Forest Whitaker) is his best friend and Lt. Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) is the humorless superior. Adrian's life gets more complicated as he falls for a Vietnamese girl and befriends her brother.Robin Williams is doing his crazed manic persona. He lets his mouth run wild. Some of it work great. Some of the humor is era sensitive. How funny is a Lady Bird Johnson joke today? But how funny was it back in the 80s? Luckily, there is a story behind the crazy wise-cracking Robin Williams rants. The story works well with a good performance from the Vietnamese brother played by Tung Thanh Tran.

"""And if you dooooooo...""","It's been a while since I've seen Good Morning Vietnam but I was reminded of it with the untimely death of Bruno Kirby earlier this week of August 2006. While the film is clearly Robin William's vehicle, Kirby, playing 2nd Lt. Hauck, is the perfect comedic foil. Kirby plays the uptight Hauck, who can't wait to get his hands on the microphone, in way that brings many of the laughs and sets Robin Williams up for more. I continue to use his line ""and if you doooooo..."" when someone, e.g. my wife or children, do not seem to be listening to me intently enough. Kirby does this in a scene where he is giving instructions to his underlings, who are routinely ignoring him as they comment on things having nothing to do with his agenda. This is a great movie. Williams gives one of his best performances, and you already know how I feel about Bruno Kirby. Another newcomer in the cast is Forest Whitaker, who would later make his mark in The Crying Game and as the host of the update TV series ""The Twilight Zone.""",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The (live-action) role Robin Williams was born to play...,"""President Johnson says the situation in Vietnam will worsen before it improves""This is the last item of news we catch while we follow Adrian Cronauer's departure from Nam. We've laughed a lot with his crazy and hilarious antics but Lyndon Johnson provided the final punchline to the worst possible joke in a movie full of them: war itself.Calling war a joke is a cliché but it does seem that both humor and war (or politics) rely on absurdity, one taking the edge in the way it takes itself seriously. Whenever we read news about today's political leaders, aren't we all asking the same question after all: ""are they serious?"". A man said that the talent of a politician is to never answer the question, art is not to let them be asked, a comedian works differently: his talent is to ask the right questions, art is to pretend he doesn't even try. Comedians play, politicians dodge, that's the irreconcilable difference between the two worlds, intelligently explored in Barry Levinson comedy-drama ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" starring Robin Williams in the closest role to his real personality (and one of his best) as Radio Armed Services DJ Adrian Cronauer.Even the catchphrase ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" plays like a wake-up call to the troops, making Cronauer a sensation in 1965 and the target of a few petty officers disapproving his irreverent and raunchy humor. The film focuses on that internal battle with censorship a little more than the actual Vietnam war but to make an even more insightful statement about war, as if the script written by Mitch Markowitz illustrated that iconic statement from Clemenceau that war is too serious a matter to be left to military men. And maybe war is so tragic that extracting any humorous substance from it is the greatest tribute to the human spirit and Cronauer, the man who kept morals high in the infancy of the war with his puns, impressions and redundant ""Good Morning, Vietnaaaaam"" accomplished the closest thing to a heroic deed. He didn't save lives but saved them from boredom and alienation.Some people are just born to tell jokes, we forgive them for offending sensitivities because they do it with 'style' and they're so funny they never make it sound like something mean. And the movie draws that line between fun and mean-spiritedness from the way the troops and everyone around Cronauer reacts to his jokes, sometimes, his popularity is overplayed but Robin Williams is such a presence that he gives an extra aura of sympathy to Cronauer. In contrast, there's butt-monkey Lieutenant Hauk (Bruno Kirby) who doesn't get his vulgarity (he'd rather put Polka than Rock'n'Roll) and the fittingly called Dickerson (J.T. Walsh) who doesn't see from in a favorable light this man coming to stir anarchy, forgetting that even in WW2 vets had Tex Avery cartoons, Private Snafu's adventures and other stuff moral would usually reprimand.The film is full of fine supporting performances, including Cronauer's assistant Edward Garlick (Forest Whitaker in his young nerdy years coming back from ""Platoon""), General Taylor (Noble Willingham) a comprehensive man who sees as a priority that his boys have a good time and is perhaps Cronauer's number one fan. And the film proves he's got a good taste, offering the most latitude for Robin Williams to showcase his talent with all the flamboyance and instinct for improvisation he's capable of: a pacing problem with a record, a reference to ""The Wizard of Oz"", anything leads to humor. This is certainly his greatest role with ""Aladdin in the sense that it encapsulates all his talent and energy without distracting from the mood of the film, he makes us laugh first so we can appreciate the serious moments.And as viewers, we're more interested to see complexities behind that jovial facade, and see how eventually humor was like a self-defense to cover some deep insecurities. And even that would have been too predictable, the film starts with a man everyone likes immediately but who doesn't have enough perspective on himself. He's slightly cynical, turns everything into a joke, and somewhat we never know what matters to him, he might be as ""annoying"" (for lack of a better word) as Robin Williams could be during interviews. Progressively, the film unveils his depths, he has a crush on a Vietnamese girl (Chintara Sukapatana), learns to get along with her brother (Tung Thanh Tran), he teaches Vietnamese people the American slang, befriends a restaurant owner and slowly, the mundane gets over the professional and we start to see the war (and the comedian) from a different perspective, allowing us to appreciate the drama besides the comedy.And the film features many montages mixing music of the era and the war as a backdrop, switching between the fun with Williams dancing to ""I Feel Good"", to the more famous ""A Wonderful World"" one of the film's most memorable moments. I'm not sure the film is always that effective when it states the obvious things such as war being hell or Cronauer good guy, but there's something so genuinely appealing in Williams' acting that we're able to see the sadness behind his smiles without ever feeling manipulated. Still, no matter how high Barry Levinson's ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" aimed in terms of hilarity, it reminds us at the end that humor takes its noblest meaning when it operates within an area that doesn't leave much for laughs; humor is like a dish served on a ugly plate.And perhaps the comedians are men capable to see the worst in humanity before they conjure it with their fun and humor, and maybe the best comedians are deeply the saddest and yet the most capable to give us happiness, like Williams did, like Cronauer did... improving things a little before the situation worsened.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Vietnam,"different by majority from its genre, it is more a film of one actor than an anti-war movie. Robin Williams does a real great job . but his brilliant improvisation gives roots and force to a delicate subject from recent American history. because it reflects the small things who are ignored by large frescoes. who are insignificant in many artistic exorcism against a tragic political error. it is more than the small confrontation of a radio man. it is a realistic, subtle and precise portrait of Vietnam. reflected not only by the genius of words but by a love story, frustrations of a lieutenant, special friendship, human emotions and the absence of the enemy. a film about few ordinary people. maybe an early version of "" Life is beautiful "". and the waterfall of the words, music, ironies remind the discover of truth by a jester. this could be the motif to see this film. again.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Funny, touching and very interesting war story.","Barry Levinson mixes rock 'n' roll and comedy with the Viet Nam conflict. This movie makes Robin Williams a 'big' screen star. Airman Adrian Cronauer(Williams)is assigned to an Armed Forces Radio station in the DMZ. He brings with him an irreverent, crude, and some times lewd comedy to the air waves. He plays a real good selection of 60's tunes and brings a piece of home to his listeners. Several of his commanding officers don't agree with his style of comedy and wish that he take his rapid-fire wit and banter elsewhere. Of course, the war goes on and so does life.This ensemble cast also features: Forest Whitaker, Bruno Kirby, Robert Wuhl and J.T. Walsh.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Robin Williams Rocks the Airwaves!,"Robin Williams stars as Adrian Cronauer, an Air Force Dee-jay who has been brought to Vietnam to be on the airwaves there, ostensibly because he was funny when he was a Dee-jay in Crete. There is a real Adrian Cronauer, and this story is based on him, but the marketers never advertise this as based on a true story, so you know this must be mostly Hollywood at work.Cronauer's style is unique, wild, wacky, crazy, with tons of voice impressions and just off-the-wall stories and personalities streaming out of the head of Williams/Cronhauer into the ears of the troops. It's a huge departure from the typically monotone, boring, and heavily censored radio entertainment, and the troops love it!Forrest Whitaker also stars as Ed Garlick, a fellow radio Dee-jay and kind of the mentor to Cronauer. Once Cronauer gets settled, the story centers around two themes: 1\ his battle against the uptight stations owners, played beautifully by J.T. Walsh (See Breakdown - great bad guy) as the Sgt Major and Bruno Kirby as Lt. Haulk who desperately wants to be funny, and believes he is, but no, he's just not. And 2\ his attraction to a young Vietnamese woman he sees passing on the street, Trinh (played by Chintara Sukapatana who went on to become an actress with some credits).Cronauer develops a friendship with Trinh's brother Tranh, and Cronauer slowly realizes that the cultural division between him and Tranh is wide and probably insurmountable. Barry Levinson directs this masterpiece, with excellent taut movement from scene to scene - not much wasted moments here. See Rainman and The Natural from some of his other gems.In the end, what happens is pretty much what you might expect, but it doesn't make it less heartfelt an emotional pull for the viewer. I wouldn't describe this as an anti-war film, but more so, as a film that encourages you to question the status quo as you go through life, which is certainly what Cronauer did, in spades.

Typically Safe Levinson Film,"The mid-1980s signaled a Vietnam revival in American cinema, and ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" was Barry Levinson's contribution.Though boasting a pretty decent and characteristically hyper performance by Robin Williams, the movie over all is fairly forgettable, mostly because Levinson has always specialized in fuzzy, safe films that don't have anything by which to distinguish them.Like many of the other Vietnam movies that came out around the same time, this one has a great soundtrack.Williams received an Academy Award nomination for his performance.Grade: C+",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Comedy Should Have Been Blacker,"For the most part I did enjoy GOOD MORNING VIETNAM but I can`t help feeling that it would have been a great film if there was a more cynical darker edge to the comedy with more lines like "" You mean we should escalate the war so we can get bigger names ? "" or Adrian Cronauer`s interview with the make believe intelligence officer . That said the scene with Adrian meeting and entertaining the young draftees going off to war is haunting just because it`s so understated while the montage of Vietnamese villages burning against the soundtrack of What A Wonderful World is intrusive because of its sledgehammer unsubtlety - And lets not forget Michael Moore made a career out of this scene . The cast are fairly good with Robin Williams giving one of his better in your face performances while Forest Whittaker plays his role in his usual affable likable way and Bruno Kirby is very memorable as Lt Hauk the laughably unfunny DJ .So a fairly good take on the Vietnam war from a different perspective , but I couldn`t help thinking it should have been to `Nam what MASH was to Korea",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Still so poignant after all these years,"Every time I watch this movie, it's a new decade - and yet this movie evokes stronger and stronger feelings each time. At age 71 and being in the DMZ in 2016, I have still not reconciled to the horror. It breaks my heart every time. And yet, the music was the best and Williams was utterly brilliant. I often wonder what the still living military leaders think of this movie. Does it make them squirm?I've watched it numerous times with my husband, a double Purple Heart from Viet Nam. As a matter of fact, they used his name in the movie. It made him cry and laugh - and yes, while not as graphic as so many other Viet Nam era movies, it captured the spirit of human nature under stress. Humor is the fallback for rational human response in terrible times. This movie balances the horror, the day-to-day reality, and the blessed ability of humans to compartmentalize and survive.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"""Good morning, Vietnam."" What the heck is that supposed to mean?","In a move designed to hopefully boost the morale of the troops in Vietnam, DJ Adrian Cronauer is sent to Saigon to rock the airwaves. He does, in more ways than one, and as the madness of the war takes hold, Cronauer, his superiors and those closest to him, are all about to get taught some life lessons.Based on the story of real life army disc jockey Adrian Cronauer, Good Morning Vietnam plonks us straight into Saigon in 1965. Before Cronauer's arrival at the radio station, the harried and weary American troops had been served a diet of boorish drone music and droopy health awareness programmes. Cronauer tore down the schedules and cranked out the likes of The Beach Boys, James Brown and Motown standards, all linked by Cronauer's spitfire patter and propensity for close to the knuckle humour. All of which made Cronauer a hero to the listening troops and a foe of the top brass. Enter Robin Williams as Cronauer.Finally getting a vehicle to showcase his scattergun improvisation talents, Williams goes full tilt to make Cronauer a part of 1980s pop culture. Most of the studio scenes are just Williams let loose by director Barry Levinson. Given free rein {Levinson merely picked out the best bits from reams of tape} to poke fun at anything remotely military. So much so, the radio station sequences have a unique feel of exuberance about them, so really it's inevitable that when the film moves away from the station it's going to be something of a shift in mood. During these shifts Cronauer is involved in a would be romance, a friendship with a teenage Vietnamese boy, a teaching arc and dalliances with his sidekick Edward Garlick {an excellent Forest Whitaker}. Whilst the dialogue remains zippy and humorous, the film is suffering because of its radio station high points, and the finale is as divisive today as it was with audiences back on release.However, the film remains a joyous viewing in spite of its irritants, and it should be noted that in amongst the jollification, Levinson is affording the Vietnamese people respect by way of portraying them as cultured and complex folk. How many Vietnam War film directors can say that I wonder? Backing up Williams and Whitaker is a cringe worthy turn from Bruno Kirby, with added weight coming in the form of an uptight J.T. Walsh. Nicely shot in Bangkok and Phuket by Peter Sova, scored appropriately by Alex North, and containing a delightful foot tapping soundtrack, Good Morning Vietnam overcomes its flaws and delivers something of a debatable 80s classic. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

I probably would have rated it worse but it turns into a good drama like halfway through the movie. I found that aspect far more compelling.

He had that ability to adapt to each role and he would act like it was his last.Unfortunately he left us too early. God bless his soul. But he was among the best actors in Hollywood.

"Goooooooooooooood Morning, Vietnam!","I've been trying to watch this movie for ages without any success. I heard that Robin Williams makes wonders in this film. Finally I managed to watch this movie, now that the new year has arrived.The movie itself is okay, although in many ways better than I expected. But indeed Robin Williams is pure genius in this one! This is one of his very best performances, along with 'Dead Poets Society', 'Hook', 'Aladdin', 'A.I.' and 'Popeye'.Set in Saigon during the Vietnam War, this is also a war movie. It's not entirely comedy. Robin Williams also does a great job in drama here, but it's his comedy skills that really make him shine. This is Robin Williams at his best! Robin portrays Adrian Cronauer, a disc jockey on Armed Forces Radio Service who greatly amuses the troops serving in South Vietnam but angers his superiors with his irreverence (they don't have any sense of humor, really - or they're envious of him). But, unlike Robin's character, the real Adrian wasn't that funny.Robin is hysterical whenever he is on the air: he makes voices (typically Robin), he mixes unusual humor with news updates... and I loved it whenever he starts his show by yelling «Gooooooooooood Morning, Vietnam!», as well as whenever he pretends to be a teacher.Robin also puts nice music in this film, such as Beach Boys, James Brown's ""I Feel Good"" and Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"". There are some errors of dates, though. The movie takes place in 1965 and the song ""What a Wonderful World"" came out in 1967. But that detail is not to be taken very seriously.Trinh, the Thai girl, is quite pretty. Whoever is the actress who portrayed this character, she did a good job.Overall, a reasonable film without being great.

One Of Robin Williams' Best,"I find Robin Williams frustrating as an actor. He can be both very funny and he can pull off dramatic roles well. For such a versatile actor, though, he often ends up taking the parts he plays a little too over the top and can sometimes distract from the story. ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" was a very good performance by Williams, though, which allowed him to display both his comedic and dramatic talents.Williams played military DJ Adrian Cronauer, who hosted an Armed Forces Radio show out of Saigon in the mid 1960's during the Vietnam War. Cronauer was an innovative DJ, trying to make military radio sound more like civilian radio back home. The military, however, is very steeped in tradition, and Cronauer's efforts weren't universally appreciated by the military brass, with whom he often butted heads.Williams did a good job as Cronauer the DJ. In fact, you could say that he was tailor made for the part. Having said that, the real life Cronauer acknowledges that he wasn't as over the top as Williams portrayed him. So the movie isn't a biography; it was made for entertainment purposes. I suspect that much of the dramatic content of the movie was fictional. It revolved around a Vietnamese woman who became Cronauer's love interest and her brother, who became Cronauer's best friend until he was discovered to have been a Viet Cong member.This is, perhaps surprisingly, a reflective movie at times, giving the opportunity for the viewer to think about the Vietnam War through a number of scenes. It's definitely one of Robin Williams' best performances, and he's supported by actors such as J.T. Walsh and Forest Whittaker. (7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Second best Vietnam War movie.,"Just watched ""GOOD MORNING, Vietnam"" today, Veterans Day, and I have chosen this as my second favorite Vietnam War movie right behind ""PLATOON."" As a Conservative, I have to give the Liberals credit, they do know how to make entertaining films which capture the beauty and the horror of men's experiences in war. My third favorite, of course in honor of John Wayne, is ""THE GREEN BERETS."" Not in the class of GM,V or Platoon, but a good entertaining western set in Vietnam.Robin Williams should have been given the Oscar for his performance as Airman Adrian Cronauer even if the experiences of Cronauer were a bit fictionalized. Probably a best supporting award for Forest Whitaker would also have been in order.As with Platoon, Good Morning, Vietnam has that look and feel and smell of Vietnam and the war. Possibly you have to have been there to smell it in a movie, but a Vietnam Vet will know what I am talking about.This film has a note of sadness to it from another angle. Three great character actors who gave realistic and credible performances are no longer with us. Noble Willingham, Bruno Kirby and J.T. Walsh. They each played characters who were very much like men who were in Vietnam. Some good, Willingham as the General; some confused, Kirby as the 2nd. Lt.; and J. T. Walsh as Sgt. Maj. Dickerson.

Good Morning A Better Film Than Often Thought,"At the time this movie was released, most viewers went to it expecting a straight comedy film because Robin Williams was a star on the hit sit-com Mork & Minday. The viewers were surprised because this movie accomplished more than that, & because of this got mixed reviews. It wasn't fair.The story is based upon the real life experience a DJ & what he did when he went to do armed forces radio in Vietnam. The accuracy of the tale gets lost because of the Hollywood Treatment but when you look at this film, it is very successful on an entertainment level, and the film is well made.Robin Williams comedy in this is very good. The surprise at that time is how solid his acting is. He is able to mix comedy and drama here in a very profound way considering this is one of his earlier films. Hollywood really has not served the memories of the Vietnam war accurately on any level so it is not a surprise that exists here.While great directors have made great films addressing Vietnam, there is a haze that still exists over their efforts because Vietnam & the reason for being there is especially now looking back, a mystery. It did serve one major change in the United States which has changed history.Vietnam more than anything else ended the compulsory military draft in the United States so far. That draft was a form of slavery Abe Lincoln had to invoke in order to win the civil war. It was never questioned until Vietnam. This movie doesn't really show why that happened, but it does try to tell the real story of someone who actually went to Vietnam & tried to make a difference.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Robin Williams as The Perpetual Pierrot,"A fast-talking, wise-cracking, unorthodox radio DJ (Robin Williams) is sent to Vietnam in the days leading up to war. Here he learns life lessons, shares witticisms, mingles with the locals, and experiences the horrors that war in all its forms wreaks upon the world. An engaging premise for a film, and one which in the case is handled with great skill and care.I think, however, the thing that sets this aside from the multitude of other Vietnam war films or any other films that use humour to throw brutality into sharp relief is that this really is not a story about war. No, it is a film about a comedian's place in the world.Williams plays the perpetual Pierrot: laughed at and joking so that he feels like a real life human being. When our protagonist steps off the plane into the sweltering powder-keg of sixties Vietnam he is closed to the viewer. His japes and jokes are merely a way to justify his own useless existence. He breaks the rules of military radio not to prove a point, but to win the acceptance of his irritated comrades at arms.But, the death of friends and the turmoil of terrorism open him up to us for the frail and hollow man that he is, but this hollowness is what makes him such a complex and rich character. His stillness and sadness pierces to the very core of what is is to be a joker in the face of world of trouble, and it is not a pretty sight. He is now justified by a sense of purpose and the sense that others might rely on him rather than the shallow acknowledgment of one's own existence given by others, and this is where the real tensions take place.This deconstruction of the comedian and this insight into the defences we put up to ward of a savage reality is, in my opinion, what makes this one of the finest Robin Williams films to have been made. We, the audience, laugh not merely because Williams' patter amuses us, but because like him we would rather not subject ourselves to the ugly truth.Aside from soul-searching, however, this film has the added bonus of being beautifully constructed. The sixties soundtrack is woven expertly in through brilliantly shot panoramas and vistas, the editing is seamless and engaging, and no actor leaves room for doubt in the story. Forest Whitaker in particular is notable for his subtle performance of the nervous boy who grows into a confidant man, and Noble Willingham's gentle General is a nice touch in smoothing over the rough bumps of military complexity that might have otherwise arisen from this story.Really, my only issue with this film is, try as I might, I can't ever seem to find as much humour as is intended in William's quick-fire rambles. I mean, there is the occasional gem of shining wit (""women in comfortable shoes"" gave me a good chuckle), but mostly his quirky voices and manic ranting slide right past my funny-bone without giving it the slightest twinge. This gripe, however, pales in comparison to the purpose that his comedy serves. As I said before, he doesn't need to be funny he just needs to make the jokes so we don't pay attention to what's happening all around us.So, in conclusion I've got to say that Good Morning Vietnam is a very good film indeed. It lets the viewer float through without much demand, but on a slightly closer inspection it reveals a wealth of intentionally glossed over depth.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Who knew Vietnam was this much fun?,"This movie is Robin Williams at the top of his game in comedy. Robin was huge back in the eighties when he was doing his brand of hyperactive, hyper-referencing schtick in his stand-up act, but it doesn't seem to make the transition to film all that well, except in a few cases (this is one, another would be Disney's Aladin). The problem with other movies is they let Robin do his thing where it really has no place in the story. In this case, it IS the story so it works quite well.I like Robin when he does good movies, like this one for example. I can just imagine all the G.I.'s getting stoned and listening to him on the radio (""This dude is so funny! Hey, is someone shooting at us?""). There are a lot of laugh out loud funny moments in this flick. His act wears thin a few times, but over all it's great stuff. Bruno Kirby provides a lot of laughs too as the anti-Robin of the radio.Director Levinson has had an incredible career. Seems he's always doing something interesting, it's refreshing to watch a guy at work where box office isn't a concern, he just puts them out and you like them or you don't. This one starts out with big laughs, tells a sweet story about Robin's character and his relationship with the locals, and ends on a more serious note actually dealing with with the war and its effect on average citizens. Not Apocalypse Now or Platoon serious, but it's well done for a comedy. Worth seeing if you haven't already. 8/10 stars. G'night!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A very humorous but definitely real twist on Vietnam,"GOOD MORNING, Vietnam!Those are the words that open up DJ Adrian Cronauer's (Robin Williams) broadcast to all soldiers in southern Vietnam during the war, the beginning of a time block filled with hilarity and setting a humorous tone to a very harsh war. That's what the premise of the film by that title is all about, and how Cronauer's non-traditional radio and rock 'n roll music choice caused a stir on the Vietnam airwaves.Barry Levinson's film is humorous, but it attempts also to be very serious in addressing censorship and the fact that so much of the war's actual events were kept undisclosed from the soldiers. The comedy is the most successful part, simply because Robin Williams is a fast-talking runaway train of humor. While the rest of the film isn't as effective, it certainly makes an effort. ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" has a chance to take on more serious meaning, but it does so very casually and without true intent to be serious. After all, the genre listed is comedy, so that's what the film is.While some scenes, like the montage to ""What A Wonderful World,"" present a harsh irony and really show the war for what it was versus how it was perceived, those scenes get lost in the not as serious jumble of scenes and other scenes that are more serious but not nearly as effective. The conflict with Cronauer and those telling him he's wrong is probably the more effective of the drama compared to commentary on the war.""Good Morning"" is still a film that should be watched.

"A role tailor-made for Robin Williams, and a decent war movie to boot","""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is one of Robin Williams' best movies and was one of the first to really showcase his improvisational abilities. However, it's not just a comedy and in fact, the tone of the picture is more serious than you might think going in. While Robin Williams does get to let loose in several hilarious scenes as Air Force DJ Adrian Cronauer, there is an undercurrent of seriousness which seeks to examine the effect of the Vietnam War on Vietnamese citizens, as well as what the US troops endured. It's not particularly graphic, but it didn't really need to be. Up to the time this film was released there were several highly acclaimed films on the subject already. What sets this one apart is the character of Adrian Cronauer, who uses comedy to lighten the spirits of the men serving their country overseas. Still, the film isn't without its flaws. There is a romantic subplot that seemed shoehorned in just to give the film some extra conflict. Also, by virtue of coming later, none of the messages the film tries to get across were that original either. Still, it's worth seeing this movie for Robin Williams' performance alone. Forrest Whitaker also gives a good supporting turn as Cronauer's Army buddy/escort. Another outstanding part of this film was the soundtrack, full of great 1960's tunes. There is also a moving sequence set to Louis Armstong's ""What a Wonderful World."" On historical accuracy, apparently not all of the events in the film happened as described and some were surely invented for dramatic purposes. However, that doesn't really hurt the film too much. Is this Robin Williams' absolute best film? No, but considering what came immediately before, this collaboration with Barry Levinson (who he would team up with a couple more times in his career) was a step in the right direction. Just kick back, relax and take in the comic genius that was Robin Williams.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""The horror.""","This film is but a reminder of how brilliantly funny Robin Williams once was. As a military dj, he is allowed to riff at will.  Unfortunately, comedy's greatest daredevil is now working with a net.  His improvisations are no longer improvisations; rather, they are simulations, a stock set of comic moves performed at break-neck speed (so as to give the impression of spontaneity). And Levinson's heavy-handed direction only makes matters worse. There are so many cut aways to listeners laughing their poor heads off  that you can't help but feeling bullied (""YOU don't tell ME what's funny. I tell YOU what's funny.""). This is an example of Ineffectual manipulation at its most extreme.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another Williams paean to himself,"If you approach this as another Robin Williams exercise in self-aggrandisement, (in the mold of ""Patch Adams"" and ""Bicentennial Man"") you won't be disappointed. The laughs in ""Good Morning Vietnam"" rely upon William's ability to talk so fast that the audience assumes that the bits they miss must be priceless (as an experiment, I listened really hard during a couple of soliloquies, and they definitely weren't funny). Some comedians are sharp enough to improvise and have the audience rolling around on the floor, but Williams really needs a script in order to prevent him falling back on his ""camp impression"" and other assorted wacky voices. Cue segues to the soldiers actually wiping away the tears of laughter at his routine, in order to convey to us how hilarious he is. Such guidance is a relief, as otherwise I would never have realized. This film falls into the (dominant) ""please love me"" category of his career, before his agent took him aside to say: ""you're perceived as a bit mawkish Robin, you need to roughen up your edges by playing a psychotic film developer"". To sum up, if - as I do - you positively enjoy watching a performance so cringeworthy that it will disjoint your toes, this is a must see.",,Anonymous,Biography

An unseen side of the Vietnam War,"Airman Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) is a DJ in Saigon, 1965. While Cronauer is a hit with the troops he incurs the wrath of his superiors for what they consider irreverent and subversive tendencies. When he's off the air, Cronauer pursues a cute Vietnamese woman (Chintara Sukapatana) while befriending her brother (Tung Thanh Tran). Forest Whitaker plays Cronauer's friend at the station while J. T. Walsh and Bruno Kirby play his nemeses.Based on the real-life story, ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" (1987) came out when Vietnam films were popular. While categorized as a war comedy, it's more of a war drama with amusing touches, mostly due to Williams' antics. It was a box office hit when released and hailed by critics. Roger Ebert, for instance, gave it a perfect rating. I didn't see it until a couple of nights ago, far removed from the hoopla of the period, and found it decent and somewhat amusing, but a tad overrated.Nevertheless, there's an unexpected twist in the third act and the movie is a necessary companion-piece to movies like ""Platoon"" (1986) in that it provides the non-grunt, political side of the infamous conflict. For instance, the story takes place just before the troop levels were beefed up to 385,000 in 1966, which would escalate to 536,000 by 1968.The film runs 2 hours, 1 minute, and was shot in Thailand.GRADE: B-",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
""" You're in  more  dire need of  a  BJ, than any  white man in History ""","The harrowing tour of Viet-Nam is a chapter in a man's life which is something he will not soon forget. Having survived it, one wonders why the U.S. military tried so hard to deny they were ever involved. Having been stationed there, we did as this movie so aptly portrays, listened to the Armed Forces radio while in the field. The film is called "" Good Morning Viet-Nam "" and is purported to be the story of Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) the Disc-jockey who was transferred from the isle of Create to serve in Viet-Nam. Once there, the exuberant and happy-go-lucky DJ, becomes the troops' favorite, boosting moral and actively seeking feminine company. It is this later activity which brings Cronauer into direct conflict with Sgt. Major Dickerson (the late, J. T. Walsh) a no-nonsense, strait lace serviceman with no sense of humor. Although the disc-jockey disrupts the military radio station playing rock and roll music and ad-libbing comical sketches of various political figures, which upsets Lt. Steven Haul (Bruno Kirby) it is his after-hours activities with Trinh (Chintara Sukapatana) his girlfriend and Tuan (Tung Thanh Tran) her brother which produces sobering consequences and tragic results. Were it not for Gen. Taylor (Noble Willingham) his military patron, his stay would have been disastrous. Forest Whitaker and Robert Wuhl round out the fine cast and liven the radio setting. For Robin Williams, this movie is at the top of his impressive repertoire and is sure to become a Classic for his fans. Highly recommended as a collector's item. ****",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good Morning Vietnam spews non-stop improvisational comedy live on air with some now questionable politics.,"Regarded essentially as the self-titled ""one man Robin Williams show"", this comedy-drama is yet another addition to the saturated war genre of the 80s that depicted the Vietnam War. Only this time, instead of purely focusing on the conflict's brutality and overwhelming sense of American patriotism, it desires you to laugh instead. How many impressions can Williams do in one film? Far too many! That's all fine and dandy, considering it offers an entirely different perspective altogether, however Levinson forcibly involves poignant drama that never feels developed enough to convey evocative sentiments, consequently creating a jarring tone that ultimately doesn't suit the bustling chaos of Saigon. A radio DJ is recruited to host a show on Armed Forces Radio Service, but must deal with his infuriated superiors who believe him to be a loose cannon.Improvisation is a talent. It's the ultimate level of comedic power. To spew unscripted humour for minutes on end without the dialogue producing cumbersome stutters is, well, genius. That is why, and practically the sole reason why, this film works. Robin Williams was blindingly fantastic. Without him, the comedy dissipates. Without him, the contrasting demeanour and attitude against his colleagues wouldn't be as profound. Without him, Good Morning Vietnam would be shouting ""Goodbye"" instead. Various lines of unscripted dialogue were funny, if you can understand his riffing tempo which exceeds the speed of sound (subtitles anyone?), however it's the scripted lines from Markowitz that anchored the comedy down to realism. It prevented Williams from becoming irreverent and overly hyperactive, a necessary juxtaposition to tackle the more poignant moments.Unfortunately, despite the solid cast, soundtrack and comedy, it's Levinson's direction and Markowitz' overly dramatic plot details that prove futile. There's a fine line between comedy and cultural appropriation. Constantly remarking Vietnamese civilians as stereotypically short, no matter how well-intentioned the dialogue may be, prevents the film from ageing well. It's on the boundary of being deemed as insulting, and I'm not one for condoning that behaviour, especially for comic relief. Sure, times have changed, but that doesn't necessarily mean I have to agree with the previous tolerance for appropriation.Next, is the embedding of cultural exploration. The apparent poignant dramatic elements arise from the protagonist randomly seeking out a Vietnamese woman and desiring her adoration. This then allowed Levinson to depict Vietnamese culture, as all war films did back then, yet in the most uninspired and incommodious method. It never once felt natural. Beyond forced, it allowed Adrian to assimilate himself within the local community, but at what cost? The montage of anarchic chaos that plagued the streets of Saigon had no emotional impact because of this very reason. Too artificially created, just to appease both perspectives of the conflict.Then we come to my final criticism, the unwanted antagonist. Why oh why did they feel they had to have a villainous sergeant, I'll have no idea. But here we are. And there is one particularly ridiculous moment within the film that made me question the entire politics of the Armed Forces' inner workings. The sergeant sending two innocent colleagues through a Viet Cong-controlled route, just to rid of them because he didn't like Adrian's work ethic. Firstly, irresponsible use of power. Secondly, absurdly unbelievable! The plot didn't need an antagonistic archetype, the conflict within the office complemented the conflict within the country. That microcosm alone was enough to balance the drama with the comedy. Don't be sending characters into a death trap, just so the audience can acknowledge the intimidation of VC patrols (for a total of two minutes!). It's not worth it.Safe to say, despite the film not being bad in the slightest and harnessing one of Williams' best performances, I remained disappointed throughout. Various plot details envenomated the comedic moments and produced an unbalanced drama that infuriated more than entertained.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Stupidity Of War,"Good Morning Vietnam is stolen by the Oscar worthy performance of Robbin Williams.

Brutally captivating and hilariously funny, Good Morning Vietnam will get some giggling but most will be in hysterics.Gorgeous film made with such passion and love.

Disc jockey bucks the system.,"Robin Williams is excellent as the disc jockey Adrian Cronauer  who dares to defy the powers that be in Vietnam. He knew the average age of the soldier was 19 so he played what they liked. He also treated the nationals like human beings.  The most poignant scene was as he played Louis Armstrong singing 'Its a wonderful world"" the screen was showing just the opposite- poverty, death and war.  This movie makes a strong statement about the power of words on people- Adrian believed in starting the day with a laugh- his supervisors did not. He did more for morale than anyone else.  For those who watch Vietnam movies this is a must.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A very good morning indeed!,"The interesting thing about ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is that so little of the horrors of the Vietnam War are shown, that the film effectively portrays the horror and senselessness of war. Director Barry Levinson instead shows shots of a printing machine showing the number of U.S. soldiers in Vietnam. The numbers constantly rise. It's very effective.Essentially, though, ""Good Morning Vietnam"" is a hilarious comedy starring the master of improvisation, Robin Williams. Williams plays a non-conformist radio DJ, who essentially tries making the troops laugh. The GIs love him, but the military's top brass (especially Sgt. Major Dickerson, played by J.T. Walsh) is up in arms.Interesting enough, by the end of ""Good Morning Vietnam"", we learn so much more about the characters— except Adrian Cronauer (Williams). He uses his comedy as a wall, keeping people from learning about him. When stranded in the wilderness, he starts using one-liners on the trees, for instance. This is a guy who remains a secret because he wants to— and it works, developing his character better than any back-story could.Another extremely effective touch in ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is the music. Sometimes, I'm not a fan of music with lyrics in films (most often, instrumental music works best, in my humble opinion). But in ""Good Morning, Vietnam"", songs about love are being played to accompany a time of war. It's a successful move.The acting of the film is exemplary, including a touching performance by an actor you probably never heard of, Tung Thanh Tran. Memorable performances come from Robin Williams, Forest Whitaker, and J.T. Walsh, and Williams even got an Oscar nomination for his performance.To conclude, ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is an interesting (to say the least) mix between wartime drama and comedy, aside from being plain old hilarious.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Over rated,"Williams runs at the mouth in this over serious comedy.  Rude and crude, and insulting over humorous dialog.  Maybe, Andrew Dice Clay could do better. Over rated, his comic bit, like in a club, sounds more like a tirade at the post office than humor.  No Caddy Shack, with the cholate bar in the pool humor.  Instead, the movie reminds me more of insults at work.  The ending is serious, and one needs to see a comedy after watching this film. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
It's pretty good,Based (very loosely) on a true story. Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) is sent to Saigon in 1965. He's a radio DJ and is sent there to boost the morale of the troops. His off the wall manner on the radio and jokes make him very popular--but he meets opposition from obnoxious Sgt. Dickerson (J.T. Walsh) and stupid Lt. Hauk (Bruno Kirby). Then he falls in love with a Vietnamese woman and realizes he can't just ignore the violence all around him.This was a huge hit in 1987. This is the movie that made Williams a star. I loved it back then but not so much now. Williams' rantings on the radio really aren't that funny--the sequence where he entertains servicemen outside on trucks going off to combat has more laughs than anything else. Also this move shoves its sentimentality down your throat (it's no surprise this is a Disney picture). We hear these beautiful songs of the period over scenes of revolution and violence. Everything is painted in black and white. Walsh and Kirby are one-dimensional villains and Williams comes across as almost perfect.The acting is all good and Williams non-stop comedy bits are occasionally funny. But this movie just about grabs you by the throat and forces you to cry and just pours on the syrup. Worth seeing but no great shakes.,7.0,Anonymous,Biography
great improv by Williams,"""Good Morning Vietnam"" is the story of Adrian Cronauer - well, that's how it started out - until Robin Williams got his hands on it.The real Cronauer actually didn't employ humor in his broadcasts. But I'm sure he was very happy to have a star such as Robin Williams interested in his story.In the '60s, Cronauer is assigned to the US Armed Services Radio station in Vietnam and finds it pretty dull with a lot of boring music playing. He immediately shakes things up with his broadcasts, which begin GOOD MORNING Vietnam.He makes a lot of jokes, plays a lot of rock music, and infuriates some of the powers that be with his total irreverence. He also develops a crush on a young woman (Chintara Sukapatana) and follows her one day to an English class.He ends up teaching some of the more colloquial phrases to the class, which is delighted, and he becomes friendly with the young woman's brother (Tung Thanh Tran). He starts hanging out at a local bar and even gets used to the food.Despite his immense popularity, the waves he is making threaten to get him drummed out, as he is unhappy about censored news and one day mentions a tragedy that occurred on the radio.Slowly, Cronauer sees more of the war, meets soldiers going into combat, and learns the hard way that he can't trust everyone, and he gets a big-time reality check.Filmed in Thailand, Good Morning, Vietnam is a really excellent film that combines comedy with drama, improvisation with a solid script and manages to show the horror of war and its effect on the citizens and soldiers.Williams, who improvises all of the radio shows, is marvelous as Cronauer, here a man who uses humor in his life until he is faced with some harsh truths -- and even then, in one of his darkest moments, he finds his sense of humor again.Forrest Whitaker, as a soldier working at the radio, gives a wonderful performance. As Lt. Steven Hauk, Bruno Kirby is brilliant as a delusional man who thinks his groan-worthy sense of humor and Mantovani music is just the ticket for a radio show.Well worth seeing by baby boomers for the nostalgia value (though not all good) and by anyone to appreciate the skills of Robin Williams as an actor and comic.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Madman At The Mike,"At the center of ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is a man sitting at a radio microphone, performing a balancing act of uncommon delicacy as he teeters on the edge of madness and delivers the biggest laughs in the movie.That would be Bruno Kirby playing an obtusely square Army lieutenant who thinks he is actually a comedy cut-up. At one point in the film he gets his chance, after the much more successful DJ Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) has been pulled off the air for reading censored copy. Watching Kirby's Hauk character bug out when the other people at Armed Forces Radio Saigon beg him not to go on with his lame array of bizarre puns and French accents kills me every time I see this film.""If it's not funny, why did I hear you laughing when you typed it?"" Hauk demands of his aide.""I was thinking of something else.""""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is Williams' movie, of course, and most of the attention is on him. It's his best film for distilling the essence of Williams' comedy in cinematic form, basically giving him a mike and letting him rip. Williams' material isn't his sharpest, but it has the feeling of being off-the-cuff (probably was a lot of the time) and for the most part is very specific to the time and place of the film, Saigon in 1965.""Say, Mr. President, why did you name your daughter 'Lynda Byrd'?"" ""If I named her 'Lynda Dog' that would be too cruel.""The film does best when it sticks to the radio station, with Hauk whining about not being saluted while Cronauer develops his on-air persona to the approval of the U.S. troops, then still in build-up mode. The scenes with the other radio guys (including Forest Whitaker, Robert Wuhl, Floyd Vivino, and Richard Portnow as the affable but deadly-dull jock Dan ""The Man"" Levitan) have an energy and authenticity that sell the realistic comedy director Barry Levinson is after.But like too many 1980s films, ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" suffers from an attempt to inject excitement and romance in crassly overt ways. So we have scenes where Cronauer woos a Vietnamese girl, befriends her brother, and tangles with the hard-case sergeant-major Dickerson (J. T. Walsh), whose homicidal hostility is neither developed nor well-explained. All this seems at the heart of the film's message, about the wrongness and destructiveness of war in general and this war in particular, yet the film doesn't need them.Proof of that comes in one scene where Cronauer, during a down moment, is pressed into delivering an impromptu stand-up for a bunch of troops about to ride into heavy battle. They laugh, and smile, and cheer, and in their nervous eyes and Williams' desperation to keep them entertained, you get about as strong an anti-war statement as you'd ever want to make.Too much of ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is burdened by the other stuff for me to recommend it too heartily. But if you're a Robin Williams fan - or even more, a Bruno Kirby fan - who hasn't seen this film, you really want to.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lifting Soldier Morale,"Vietnam was a hot topic in 80's film, even comedians such as Richard Pryor starred in Vietnam based movies. Good Morning Vietnam sidesteps the actual fighting to focus on a DJ in Vietnam: Adrian Cronauer (pronounced crone-our), played by Robin Williams. He was a fast talking funny personality that was on the edge of being a shock-jock. Perhaps some of the Army brass considered him a shock jock. Certainly, some of the upper ranking officers believed he was too risqué for the Vietnamese airwaves.It's amazing how important his presence was for the men fighting. He may have been the only real entertainment they got out there. Morale is a critical thing when you need a group of people to accomplish a goal. I'm sure you've heard of ""employee morale."" It's usually brought up when it starts to decline. It's brought up for a reason. High morale allows management or commanding officers to get more out of their people. Adrian Cronauer did that for the soldiers. He kept their spirits up with laughter. Many of them didn't ask to be there and many of them didn't want to be there, so the least that could be done was to make there tour bearable. Cronauer did that and then some. He didn't fire any shots, nor did he take a bullet, yet he was just as essential.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Robin Williams At the Top of His Game!,"""Goooooooooooooood Morning, Vietnammmmmmmm.""
When you hear Robin Williams and his manic energy bellow those lines for the very first time, you know you are in for a treat. This movie finally proved to the world how gifted of an actor Williams really was. Everyone knew about his comic skills and he proudly displays them here, but you see that his character goes through some bittersweet moments of self-discovery. Here, you realize that this comedian can nail the dramatic bits. Director Barry Levinson used William's comedian skills against him which allowed him to draw a stronger performance. If you were to grow tired of his schtick, you will be impressed with his dramatic portions. I have only seen him in Moscow on the Hudson prior to this film's 1987 release, and it is a more impressive performance-one that earned him his first of four Academy Award nominations.Williams's performance is based off the life of real Vietnam-era DJ, Adrian Cronauer. In 1979, Cronauer pitched his life experiences as a sitcom to the big studios. Despite M. A. S. H being a wild success at the time, they felt like war should not be used for comedy. Williams eventually got hold of the script and was impressed. Screenwriter Mitch Markowitz took over the script and almost completely changed the treatment. Essentially, more entertainment value was added. Some scenes that were never meant for an accurate portrayal such as the hilarious scene where Williams taught his English class how to swear and his pursuit of Vietnamese women did not happen in reality. But they did beef up the movie situations! Once Williams took the basic structure of Markowitz's script, it was off to the races. Levinson gave Williams leeway in terms of his improvisation. His radio monologues were generally hilarious.Following the recent successes of Platoon and Full Metal Jacket, we get another Vietnam War film. The tone is a touch lighter (thanks to the immediate presence of Robin Williams) but manages to pull some dramatic strings. The audience responded with positive reviews and made this film the fourth-highest grossing film domestically in 1987. Of the two films Levinson directed in 1987 (with Richard Dreyfuss's Tin Men being the other one), this is the better of the two. In addition to the lead actor, it has a great supporting cast. Levinson did a good job on setting an even tone of comedy/drama. Of course, the soundtrack is excellent. Cronauer has some excellent taste in rock'n'roll. (with apologies to the Percy Faith-loving CO).Without much background on the man, we are immediately introduced to Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) who is shipped from Crete to Vietnam to deliver comedy for the Armed Forces Radio. With his nonstop rapid delivery and a more modern music taste, he becomes an instant hit with the troops. Management, especially the immediate CO Lt. Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) and Sgt. Major Dickerson (J. T. Walsh) do not approve of his antics. He becomes good friends with one of the soldiers, Edward Garlick (Forest Whitaker) and he tries to woo the Vietnamese ladies. In addition, he teaches English to the local Vietnamese and he also experiences war action, something that would humble even a comedic DJ celebrity.I can make this entire review talking about how amazing Robin Williams is, but I really did enjoy the supporting cast in which Levinson was able to humanize. The best part about the cast is how Williams's peers, especially his commanding officers, react to his nonsense. I was in stitches. Bruno Kirby is excellent and unrecognizable (with the exception of his voice). J. T. Walsh was likewise great. And Forest Whitaker had excellent chemistry with Williams. Keep an eye out for solid character actors like Richard Portnow and Robert Wuhl.Overall, Good Morning, Vietnam is another film that tackles the war in an era with plenty of them, but it comes at it with a unique angle. Robin Williams is the film's star, and his improvisation is just a reason to watch his performance. But he also undertakes an important journey of self-discovery where he learns it is just not about the jokes. There are some moments of hilarious craziness, and moments of intensity. The film goes a little long in the tooth at times and not all of Williams's jokes work for me. But those are small complaints. If you want to see Robin Williams at the top of his game, here you go!My Grade: B+",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Vietnam killed the radio star.,"'Good Morning, Vietnam (1987)' is mostly a vehicle for Robin Williams' particular brand of fast-talking, impression-heavy comedy. The legendary actor reportedly ad-libbed all the radio shows his character DJs, which is easy to believe considering how closely the talents of the star and his on-screen persona align. If you're a fan of Williams, you'll likely find quite a lot to like here. Unfortunately, I don't actually find most of his schtick all that funny in this context; he's a great actor and is really funny in other films, but this just doesn't land for me and I'm not sure exactly why. It's not as though it's because a lot of it is at the expense of other races, sexualities and cultures (which obviously isn't going to get me chuckling), as even the entirely inoffensive elements aren't particularly appealing to me. There's something just off about it, I guess. This is a bit of an issue considering how much time is dedicated to watching his character take command of US airwaves and broadcast his banter across Vietnam, and the first movement is pretty difficult to digest if you can't quite get on its wavelength. Thankfully, though, the likeable characters and generally good-natured vibe of the picture eventually break their way through this barrier, and it becomes fairly enjoyable in its own laid-back way. It has an underlying anti-war message that's sometimes clumsily handled but is ultimately welcome (even if it's a little too light). To be fair, the flick manages to catch you off guard with the brutality of its focal conflict on more than one occasion, and these moments are almost certainly the its most potent. It does feel a bit messy in the way it weaves its loose narrative with its equally loose theming, and it includes a late-game reveal that feels like something out of an entirely different movie, but it keeps hold of its overarching identity and is relatively cohesive on the whole. In the end, this is a decent, if underwhelming, effort with a commanding central performance (even if it doesn't quite win me over in the way it's intended to) and a generally rock-solid execution. It's good, but not great.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A brilliant multi-dimensional film.,"This film has a superb mix of contrasts, Robin Williams at his insane best but against a backdrop of a very serious story and how Uncle Sam's interference how ever well intentioned just creates a mess. Given that the Vietnam war was 40 years ago and this review is being written some 40 years later (nearly 20 years after the film was made) it is interesting to see parallels with what has followed in American actions since and also in what is going on today.Some wonderful 60 music adds a real highlight to the film, against some the intense interactions of Williams and the other characters.The humour is top class, and even if you are not a Williams fan I doubt you could fail to appreciate it. It just frame & highlights some powerful messages.In my book this is a top notch film that can be enjoyed thru countless re-runs.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great comedy.,"It is a very good comedy movie! I laughed a lot with it.The performance of Robin Williams is awesome! I watched the movie mainly because oh him and I wasn't disappointed. It is truly a very good actor.I also liked how they described the war in Vietnam, it is very useful for people who don't a lot about the subject, still they could have been a bit more detailed and added a bit more information.I think they could have worked a bit more on the story to make it a bit more interesting.In general I think it is a good movie to watch if you are willing to watch a comedy. It is more of a comedy than a Vietnam war movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the mose memorable films I have seen,"I have watched more than a few movies in my time but this one still stands out as one of the best.Robin Williams stars in one of his best roles as a Radio DJ amidst the horror of Vietnam.  A wise-cracking star of humour and moral to the soldiers of Vietnam while higher officials around him build a dislike toward him through his satirical approach to the politics surrounding the war.  Through his sense of loyalty to his work and to the soldiers of Vietnam he bucks authority and tries to make a difference.As I said, this is one of the most magical and memorable films I have seen. I wouldn't describe this film, however, as a comedy.  The film is indeed very funny and I still find it impossible not to laugh through the radio broadcasts.  But I also found the tone of the film sets itself apart from the comedy and describes the Vietnam war in a very serious and moving way.It is very rare that I would rate a film as highly as I do this.  Anyone who watches movies should see this - rent it, buy it, borrow it, steal it.  This is a piece of art which deserves to be seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Two different movies,"Creating a movie with a duplicitous thematic and emotional nature is a commendable feat, as it is very hard to, for example, be funny while discussing war without coming across as disrespectful. This film managed to stay within this line, but failed to connect its two parts.The radio sequences are mostly fine, but not amazingly funny and the war story is decent in itself, but there was little thematical relationship between the two stories. There was no ""dark humor"", but merely humor in a dark situation, which leaves much to be desired. Ultimately, no part of this movie is badly done, but the whole picture feels inconsistent.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
So when do we start the laughter?,"Not Robin Williams worst film, that would be 'Mrs. Doubtfire', definitly not his best.Let me say the filming was terrific, the editing suburb, the cast topnotch, and the music was good if only they played a whole song or two.Williams work in other films is sometimes brilliant, sometimes spot on, but this mess as a DJ in Vietnam probably would have been great if not for his constant way over the top attempt to be funny. The other actors in this film must have been paid top salary to appear to enjoy the manic ad libs from Robin's mind.Honestly, if you removed Williams from the cast, it would be a good movie. Trying so hard for laughs is not funny and never will be.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Robin Williams . And it is enough.,"Another image of Vietnam. New slice of a kind of M.A.S.H. A comedy with flavor of drama. In fact, only a impressive work of Robin Williams. The art of improvisation is all. The game, mixture of joy and metamorphosis of reality is heart of this film about war but, more that, about the hope and its roots.Interpretation of Williams is not a surprise but the great piece is art to define a fight in different terms. And the science to escape behind any trap. Because no crime, no errors, no gray perceptions are absent. The war is not fiction and the Vietnames are the enemy. But the role of huge show is more small. The relations between ordinary people and the resistance of absurd vision about reality is more powerful. So, it is not a war movie. It is not a comedy. Only picture of a world. And a extraordinary Robin Williams who gives sense to many small facts.",,Anonymous,Biography
"A Dynamic Blend of Humor and Heart - ""Good Morning, Vietnam","""Good Morning, Vietnam,"" directed by Barry Levinson and released in 1987, is a standout film that masterfully combines comedy and drama against the backdrop of the Vietnam War. Featuring an unforgettable performance by Robin Williams, this film balances the absurdity of war with the human need for laughter and connection.Robin Williams stars as Adrian Cronauer, an irreverent and energetic DJ brought to Saigon to boost the morale of the American troops with his unconventional radio broadcasts. From the moment he shouts his iconic ""Good Morning, Vietnam!"" greeting, Williams commands the screen with his rapid-fire humor and boundless energy. His improvisational talent shines through, making Cronauer's broadcasts a delightful mix of sharp wit and hilarious impersonations.The film's strength lies not only in its comedic elements but also in its ability to address the serious and often grim realities of war. As Cronauer becomes more entrenched in the lives of the soldiers and Vietnamese people, he confronts the harsh truths that lurk behind the jokes. This shift in tone is handled deftly by Levinson, ensuring that the film never feels disjointed despite its oscillation between comedy and drama.The supporting cast provides solid performances that ground the film's more outlandish moments. Forest Whitaker is particularly notable as Private Edward Garlick, Cronauer's loyal and somewhat naive assistant. Their camaraderie adds a layer of warmth and authenticity to the narrative. Bruno Kirby, as the officious Lieutenant Hauk, and J. T. Walsh, as the stern Sergeant Major Dickerson, offer effective antagonistic counterpoints to Cronauer's freewheeling style, highlighting the tension between creativity and military discipline.The film also thoughtfully explores the cultural and political landscape of Vietnam during the war. Cronauer's interactions with local Vietnamese, including his romantic interest Trinh (Chintara Sukapatana), offer a nuanced perspective on the impact of the conflict on the civilian population. These moments add depth to the film, reminding viewers of the human cost of war beyond the battlefield.Technically, ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is well-crafted, with solid direction and a memorable soundtrack that features a mix of 1960s rock and roll hits. The music not only enhances the film's nostalgic appeal but also underscores the era's cultural vibrancy amidst the turmoil of war.In conclusion, ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is a compelling film that effectively marries humor with poignant social commentary. Robin Williams' extraordinary performance elevates the film, making it both entertaining and thought-provoking. While it may not delve as deeply into the complexities of the Vietnam War as some other films, its unique approach and heartfelt moments make it a memorable and worthwhile watch.Highly recommended for those who appreciate a good blend of comedy and drama, and especially for fans of Robin Williams' unparalleled comedic genius.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Back to 'Good Morning, Vietnam'","I rewatched Good Morning Vietnam for the first time since I saw it as a kid. Like last time, I watched it in translation, and perhaps that's why Williams' character's jokes seem strange. Or maybe I'm just not in the context of 60s humor. Nevertheless, the film is good. Behind the humor in the film there is an unfolding tragedy, and there is an attempt at reconciliation. The military surrounding Cronauer is rather flat, but memorable. Rediscovered that there was a young Whitaker in the film. The film is more nostalgic, not for the war, of course, but for the times when I first saw it. It was interesting to plunge back into this world and understand how my perception has changed over the years.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

What started as a dull, boring night was to transform. The movie was not just going on, it was taking me with it, it was capturing my smiles in a 12 mega pixel camera. All courtesy Robin Williams. He is the head of the film, and he is the leg too. He played the character perfectly, blending emotion and laughter in right proportions to create a believable performance. Forest Whitaker, is good as the side kick, with his expressions being right all the time.But what stands out about this film is that this film succeeds in not being partial to America, nor is it partial to Vietnam. This movie creates sympathy for both Americans and Vietnamese, and we take no side at last, left to think what is good or what is not!Watch the movie. It's good.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A sweet comedy on the bitter facts of war Robin Williams' wonderful Improv alone deserves your watch,"Good Morning Vietnam (1987):
Brief Review -A sweet comedy on the bitter facts of war Robin Williams' wonderful Improv alone deserves your watch. War comedy is a very tough genre. God knows how Stanley Kubrick managed to pull off a classic movie like ""Dr. Strangelove"" (1964). He also made ""Full Metal Jacket,"" which has a lot of gags in the first half during those army training sessions. Good Morning, Vietnam came in the same year to challenge it and did pretty well. It's one of those radio-based movies you'll always like to remember and have an intimate smile on your face. Robin Williams plays a lovable DJ with a few dictations that he later copied in ""Dead Poets Society"" (1989). Good Morning Vietnam isn't actually that funny, but it has some brilliant sarcastic one-liners coming out as fictional events from the DJ's mouth. Robin is exceptional here. Those broadcast speeches will leave you speechless. And guess what? Many of them were improv, not rehearsed. His voice modulation and dialogue delivery will make your voice chock for a while. Inspired by true events that happened to AFRS DJ Adrian Cronauer, Good Morning Vietnam is a story about the Army's Special DJ, Adrian Cronauer, who becomes highly popular amongst troops for being extraordinarily funny. He can be funny in no time, as he has a special built-in quality. However, his straight-forward behaviour and extra-conscious social sense put his career in danger. Two officers are already against him just because they don't like him or his comedy. Apparently, one of his friendly associations turns out to be terribly bad. Will he find peace now? This film is all about Robin Williams. He is phenomenal. I repeat, he is just phenomenal. The climax tickles emotional nerves, and there is some surprise value to it. I didn't see that coming, I admit. You shouldn't be much concerned about that, or rather, you can't, because Robin hardly gives you a chance to think about anything else. Watch it, enjoy it, and feel it.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A 'must see' movie about the tragedy of our war in Indochina,"Possibly Robin Williams' most brilliant movie, the comedic character (Adrian Cronauer) is perfectly cast in Williams. But in this movie we see the true meaning of tragi-comedy. This is no laughing movie. I truly wept more than I thought of laughing.In this would be funny movie, we see a heartfelt and sometimes horrific glimpse of what was really going on over there, and in fact, what happened to anyone who might have wanted to tell this to the rest of the world.This is not a minor film and is a 'must see' movie about our tragedy in Indochina.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Solid Comedy Skipping Severity,"An iconic Robin Williams film displaying his talents in impov and riffing, but perhaps not his best. Taking a comedic look at the US' presence in Vietnam, Good Morning, Vietnam portrays a character Williams is well versed in, wise-cracking and confrontational to authority and wrong doing. The film dips into the severity of the context but only really scratches the surface, showing some depth and contrast within the storyline without pushing too far. The real drama is short and although light hearted and fun, it never is never particularly gripping. A biographical film in sorts, but if they were to stray this far from true events then providing more of a climax would have been good. Still, iconic for the actor, with quotes that have lasted over the years.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent blend of comedy and drama!,"Robin Williams' role in this film is probably his best known to date, as it should be.  This is a great film!  I suppose this falls in the category of comedy, but there is also a great deal of drama in the film as well.  The film has some interesting things to say about war, politics, racism, friendship, the military and a few other things (or at least that's what I got out of it).  Of course, the comedy greatly outweighs the drama in the film and is absolutely great all the way through the film.  If you are a fan of Robin Williams' comedy, be sure to check this film out.The cast in this film is very good.  Robin Williams is, of course, just fantastic in the film.  He's a little nutty sometimes, but that is to be expected and that's what the role called for.  Forest Whitaker is very good in his role and plays a very likeable character.  Bruno Kirby, on the other hand, plays a very UN-likeable character, but did a fantastic job with the role.  The rest of the supporting cast was very good as well: JT Walsh, Robert Wuhl, Noble Willingham, etc...  Director, Barry Levinson, did a very good job with this film as usual.If you are a fan of Robin Williams or any of the cast/crew, then you should definitely check out this film.  If you like war-comedy films, then you should take a look at this film.  I feel that the film is most definitely worth seeing, so do yourself a favor and go see it.

Good film,"Good film. During his visit with the troops, Robin realizes that the happiness and morale of the troops is more important than voicing every bit of controversial news. Humorous satire and sarcasm are one thing, and even lighten the burden of the soldiers, but reading unofficial news of the sort he did was completely unnecessary. There is no point in scaring the soldiers by telling them of bombings in demilitarized when nothing can be done to alleviate the problem and only learned helplessness will result. But, the censored news could have saved Robin a lot of trouble at another point. Basically, in this conflict between oppressor and oppressee, rebellion for the sake of rebellion is pointless and counteractive - as demonstrated by the final address and every post-suspension show.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Robin Williams at the microphone,"Good Morning, Vietnam was one of Robin Williams' first movie roles and perhaps one of his best.The reason for this really is the fact that the character he plays allows him to channel both his manic stand up comedian side and also allow him to show just how good a dramatic actor he could be given the chance.This film manages to combine that humour without being neglecting the story of the war that was going on at the time. The laughs are aren't but then again so are the moments that really do shock.While not my favourite Robin Williams film I still accept that this was one of the occasions where the great man was at his best.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Average film that will only get better if you really like Williams' hyper comedy and overacting,"In the Vietnam demilitarised zone, the US troops are 'entertained' by the forces radio under the command of Sgt Maj Dickerson and 2nd Lt Hauk. Into the rather stale and censored station comes broadcaster Adrian Cronauer, who's impressions and crazy sense of humour immediately gets the support of the troops and becomes an instant hit. However his inability to follow orders causes major problems with his superiors; but things get worse as the Vietnam war starts to kick off with bombings and guerrilla warfare. Cronauer is forced to enter the reality of life in Vietnam and come out from behind his microphone.It has been many years since I saw this film and I remember laughing at it so much that I bought the soundtrack because it included snippets of Cronauer's radio broadcast. However then I was a young teenager and was maybe more of a Williams fan than I am now  and here we have the crux of the film, if you love Robin Williams' style of stand up then you will enjoy this film but if you aren't won over by that then there is little else to win you over. The plot mostly trades on Cronauer upsetting his superiors before eventually getting into a final 30 minutes of 'oh, look, isn't war awful' that is delivered with such an obvious change of pace that. The film should have had this aspect running through it with a blacker vein of humour (a la M*A*S*H for example) and it would have been much better; as it is, it is more like an hour of a stand up show which then tries to be an affecting war story. It is OK but it didn't really work for me because I didn't find the jokes that funny and didn't appreciate the sudden reality check at the end.Williams tries really hard and I was surprised that I didn't laugh as much as I did  maybe he never had time to get momentum up as his routines were edited all to hell and were delivered too fast. I have seen him in early stand up and found him hilarious so maybe it was a mix of delivery and material letting him down. The support cast is mostly pretty good and features some well known actors even if they don't all have that much to do.Whitaker has a good feel for the material and is nice enough; Kirby allows himself to be a fool; Wuhl is OK as a sort of comedy aside; Edson is OK and both Walsh and Willingham add clout in more serious roles. Tran and Sukapatana have much lesser roles and exist to carry the weight of the 'war is awful' message, they drift aimlessly enough for most of the film before getting to shout lots towards the end.Overall this is an OK film that rather averagely delivers comedy and a 'war is hell' message, but it was a problem for me that it seemed to deliver these is two different strands rather than being successfully mixed together. If you are a big Robin Williams fan then you should like this as his manic stand up personae gets a good run here but I imagine many viewers will feel that the 'message' is rather thrust onto them. Worth a look but there are much better wartime comedies that are darker, funnier and much more intelligent than this one.",,Anonymous,Biography
Hollywood fiction replaced fact.,"One super movie to watch but not to be believed.  The original story was written by the real Adrian Cronauer.  The movie did not follow the script and made significant changes as to what happened.  I had the pleasure of hearing Mr. Cronauer speak and his comment on the movie was, ""If I did half of what was portrayed, I'd still be in Leavenworth.""

It is very light-hearted and it isn't complex at all as all the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated many falsehoods.

Williams the Big Movie Star!,"""Gooood Mooorrnning, Vieeetnamm!!!"" screams Robin Williams from the big screen as he stakes a claim once and for all to be recognised as a long awaited Big Movie Star-an actor in his own right.This achievement is made with the aid of a well-scripted storyline, supporting cast and fine direction, with of course that certain special 'Williams-thing' that was his bread and butter even at this time of things-stand up/sit down improvisational comedy in front of a microphone. This all makes for a truly rare, wonderful and unusual scenario unlike any film of this genre. It's a touchy subject but it's all handled beautifully, making it a touching subject more than anything which can be very few and far between in any routine comedy/drama.Robin Williams has come a long way since his TV days of 'Nah-nu, nah-nu' as he sets out to portray that he can handle the heavy and demanding scenes as well as anything else. But, he had already gone through the motions of these kind of scenes previously with the likes of the classic 'World According To Garp','Moscow On The Hudson' and the maudlin 'Seize the Day'.In this film the 'Williams-machine' all came together for the very first time as he portrays his version of Adrian Cronauer, the Armed Forces Radio D.J. sent out to Saigon in 1965 to help whip everyone's morale into shape-and that he certainly did! Well, maybe not everyone's has one or two of the top ranks aren't too pleased with such quips as ""the Big Dick is here!..."" when referring to a visit from Vice-President, Richard Nixon.When you see Williams,as Cronauer, perform the comedy routines on, and off, the Airwaves, all you can do is watch in hilarious wonderment and ask just exactly what kind of brain are we witnessing here.'Good Morning, Vietnam' is billed as a Comedy/Drama, but it was the Drama aspect of it that for me, certainly shone through as much as the hilarity side of the script. All the aspects that centred around this angle of the Vietnam War-Cronauer in trouble with his superiors, falling in love, and ultimately crossing the political line of fire, all make for a creative piece of film-making, and certainly one that deserved it's Oscar nominations.Mr.Williams seems to have a flair for making this type of comedy with a mix of the unusual dramatics, and this seems to have started with the aforementioned 'Garp' and is continued after 'Vietnam' with the lesser-rated, but rather amicable 'Cadillac Man' and the absorbing 'Fisher King'.Anyway, no matter what, you will laugh, cry and laugh again at 'Good Morning, Vietnam'-it is a classic. And, don't forget all those great sixties tunes in the background.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gooood Morning Vietnam TCM Essential,"Directed by Barry Levinson Good morning Vietnam loosely based on the story of Adrian Cronauer starting Robin Williams as the new host of the AFRS station to provide news and morale to the troops of Vietnam he sees how the Lieutenant and Sergeant Major runs this station as a big joke, does his best to make the most out of his time here goofing around and having a good time he eventually ends up becoming the most popular man in Vietnam. The higher-ups see him as a problem and a minor nuisance until Adrian witness the impact of the war firsthand and spending time with the people realized There's more going on here then he thought. While the movie is a comedy it still has a powerful tone to it. Similar to Full metal jacket there's a anti-war message ideas of censorship and what you're doing is actually right. Robin character Adrian make a compelling lead. He just thinks it's all a big joke until he spends more time with the locals and actually connects to them on a deeper level. Some of the most heartwarming scenes are when he's with the locals. He grows as a person but doesn't lose his self. Forest Whitaker as Eddie Garlick is good supporting role and good for a laugh he plays more of a dorky private.

Definitely an outstanding movie...,"I opted to sit down and revisit the 1987 movie ""Good Morning Vietnam"" once again here in 2023. I don't think I've seen it since the mid-1990s or so. So I must say that it was certainly a long overdue revisit.Writer Mitch Markowitz certainly put together a very nicely written and entertaining script and storyline for the movie. And I have to say that there really isn't a dull moment throughout the 121 minutes that the movie ran for. And the storyline told here is one that combines comedy, drama and a much needed different approach on movies about the Vietnam War. Thumbs up to writer Mitch Markowitz on that accomplishment.But it is not only because of the script and storyline that ""Good Morning Vietnam"" is such a good movie. Nay, it most certainly is also because of the cast ensemble. Initially, I remembered thinking 'Robin Williams in a Vietnam War movie, nah...', but time and time again were I proven wrong, because the late Robin Williams is phenomenal in the movie, and it is definitely one of his more significant, memorable and outstanding roles and performances on the screen. Williams really showcases his ability to impromptu ad-lib on the fly, as well as showing off his ability to take on a more serious and dramatic acting performance as well.""Good Morning Vietnam"" has some great performances by Forest Whitaker, Robert Wuhl, Bruno Kirby, J. T. Walsh and Noble Willingham as well.If you enjoy movies with a Vietnam War based them, then ""Good Morning Vietnam"" is certainly a good movie to sit down and watch. Especially so if you want a break from the usual jungle skirmishes and guerilla warfare movies that make up the majority of Vietnam War based movies.It should be noted that ""Good Morning Vietnam"" is a movie that can be seen again and again.My rating of the 1987 movie ""Good Morning Vietnam"" from director Barry Levinson lands on a seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Admiration for Williams,"The best thing in this movie are the songs the DJ gives us. That DJ is funny man Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) and we are talking 1965, Vietnam. I didn't find him very funny, but I can understand if you think that he is. Although I didn't like the character, a man who really was a DJ in the Vietnam war, I admired Robin Williams. With a lot of improvising, may be sometimes trying to hard, he does a great job. My problem is that I only liked some of the jokes and, again, there is a good chance you will not have that problem.The story is mainly about Cronauer. How his superiors try to get rid of him but his co-workers like him, especially Montesque Garlick (Forest Whitaker), how he becomes friends with local boy Tuan (Tung Thanh Tran) and how he is in love with Tuan's sister Trinh (Chintara Sukapatana).It is all a little predictable. Example: Cronauer gets suspended and when they want him back he is not very willing. The sequence where he is convinced to go back, you will know which one I mean, is something that has to be in a movie like this. When you see the set-up you will predict the whole scene right.Again, I admired Robin Williams. The other performances are good as well. I loved the classic songs, I especially liked the sequence chosen during Louis Armstrong's What a Wonderful World, and of course the direction by Barry Levinson was pretty good. These things make this movie easy to watch, it doesn't get boring either, but I simply did not like it very much.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Robin Williams is funny as always, still the movie plays both sides of the fence, most of the time, leaning on the anti-war side. Without Robin Williams, you have a story which is suppose to be a comedy about the Vietnam war. Hard to do, and without taste, if I may add. A nice movie, but far from anything timeless or terrific.

"Williams sole energy source in ""feel good"" Nam film.","In Good Morning Viet Nam Robin Williams takes his stand up act to SEA as an irreverent DJ. A mild mawkish comedy under the mundane style of Barry Levinson who seems content to just turn the zany comic loose it never attains much of an energy level outside Williams inconsistent rants.Transferred from Greece to Nam to DJ and entertain the troops Adrien Cronauer has little respect for the men running the war and he subversively gets it across to the grunts on the ground fighting it who bond with him. His superiors find his attitude trying however and take steps, one very cynical and drastic, to remove him.In his prime Williams took his wacky and irreverent comedy routines and incorporated it into a ""Mr. Wonderful"" persona in a series of films in which he championed the underdog and vanquished the big bad establishment with his rapier wit. Good Morning may well be the best of the lot with an ideal occupation and situation for Williams to be in but director Levinson brings nothing in terms of a look or a cohesive storyline to the picture. Injecting flaccid montages to accompany the era's music he more or less abdicates his directorship in favor of Robbie coming up with comic gold. There's some dust to be mined but away from the mike Williams drowns in schmaltzy interplay with the child like Asians( courtesy of Levinson's hackneyed patronizing) bridging the gap like LBJ and MacNamara could only dream of. Good Morning Viet Nam is little more than a stage for Williams routine and incite, something you can catch on a late night show in less time and for less money.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good Morning Vietnam is a wonderful film that knows how to balance the comedy of Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) with one of the most serious and tragic events in American history.,"Good Morning Vietnam is an excellent film that is extraordinarily funny thanks to the comedic genius of Robin Williams.  It is important to recognize that the film addresses the tragedy behind the highly sensitive and tragic Vietnam War, and the film is masterful at touching ones heart with drama.  One of the more memorable and notable scenes is when Adrian Cronauer entertains the American soldiers who were leaving for battle while in their transport vehicles; one could grasp the feeling that these young individuals were being sent into certain death.  I felt that it was simply brilliant.  This film demonstrates the most difficult task of intertwining comedy and drama with such a perfect balance.  I highly recommend this film to all.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Williams at his finest!!,"The only thing more amazing that there are tastless viewers that don't see the humor in this movie is the fact that you would actually print their responses like they were ""expert critics"".  Williams delivers playing fast talking discjockey Adrian Cronouer.  He is hilarious in the fast talking lines that he delivers over the air and the movie also has an interesting serious side too, showing the pointless destruction that war brings about. This movie delivers from both angles, from the funny to the serious.  The other actors such as Forrest Whitaker complimented Williams quite well and this movie deserves high marks.  8 out of 10 definitely (or 3.5 out of 4)",,Anonymous,Biography
A wonderful conmemoration of the hardships of Vietnam soldiers,"This movie made me cry and laugh throughout! What soldiers in Vietnam faced was no picnic, and the man (such as the one the Robin Williams portrayed) who used his amazing facility of humor to brighten the lives of millions of young soldiers performed an act of altruism that ought to be remembered and admired. Robin Williams's character embodied what it meant to be American during Vietnam: stubbornly proud, a fighter, and an optimist even when all hope is lost. It is amazing how bringing a smile to someone's face can help them to carry on and in the case of a soldier, to not be so afraid and to try to forget about the possibility of death with every turn. Williams deserves so much praise for his perfectly timed shrewdness and witty humor and the life he ultimately brings to his character and to the entire picture.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

An optimistic film about a terrible war : people must remain optimistic.,"Perfect film to demonstrate with humor and kindness the Viet Nam war. A nice film but not simpleton. Nice for the kindness of all the characters. A caricature, but a nice caricature. Whatever, the name I will give to the film I will qualify it by ""nice"". However, nice in a positive way, not at all simpleton or stupid. To have lived and worked two years in Sai Gon in recent time (1996-98), I was happy to feel the country I loved, although there are only few pictures who really show Viet Nam (numerous stages are shot in studio). I cannot separate this view of ""Good Morning Vietnam"" to the view of ""a quiet American"". Although, there were, maybe, less pictures of the countries in Good Morning Vietnam, I feel the atmosphere of Sai Gon better shown in this film. Photos of A quiet American were too clean, too nice.

Dominated by Williams' manic mind...,"American radio personality in 1965 Vietnam, assigned to the US Armed Services radio station, shakes up the status quo with his off-the-cuff humor. Directed by Barry Levinson and written by Mitch Markowitz, ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" was originally drafted by Pittsburgh DJ Adrian Cronauer based upon his life. Hoping to pitch the idea as a TV-movie, Cronauer got lucky (sort of) when Robin Williams became involved and the script was retooled as a star-vehicle--with Levinson allowing Williams to ad-lib à la his comedy act. Williams portrays Cronauer, but the DJ no longer gets a credit (while I'm sure the success of the film pleased him, Cronauer later said the movie was only about 45% accurate). How successful the picture is will depend on one's appreciation (or tolerance) of Williams' manic mind. The star turns a gobbledygook stream of consciousness into a succession of comedy hits and misses, but it was enough to net him an Oscar nomination as Best Actor. Markowitz is shameless is creating pathos based on the war and the locals...and if you're not sure whether you're supposed to have a lump in the throat during the picture's third act, the inclusion of Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"" on the soundtrack should prod you. Williams won a Grammy award for Best Comedy Recording and the Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Comedy. Most astoundingly, the film won the Peace Award and a second ""Special Award"" from the US Political Film Society. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Very funny, Robin Williams delivers a good time.","I wasn't alive to witness most of the key events of what is happening in GMV, but I had a good understranding of it. I have to admit everytime I see it the movie always makes me laugh. But I imagin if you know the events of Nixon, the Vietnam war, the pope and the other events mentioned in Good Morning Vietnam, you will only find it funnier. Robin Williams plays Airman Adrian Cronaure, a DJ with a sense of humor that always makes everyone smile. He is brought into a military radio station to do morning shows, and atracts an incredible amout of fans and listeners. The troops in the field love him, with all his hilarious antics and with him playing the greats in music.

CAPTIVATING AND INNOVATIVE !!!,"In the first place, Good Morning, Vietnam is a serious film about the war and deals with serious problems such as morale and the dangerousness of the conflict, it follows the arrival of Adrian Cronauer played by Robin Williams, a radio host, in Saigon in 1965. Assigned to the local radio of the American armed forces, he disembarks from Crete at the request of General Taylor, interpreted by Noble Willingham. His mission is to boost the morale of the troops present on the territory. This 2:01 movie was released in 1988 at a time when you had to be careful of the way you talked about the war. Indeed, the Vietnam war had been over for only a little over a decade and the ""Cold War"" was still a reality.This film is great especially thanks to the talent and genius of Robin Williams who feels inspired and who improvises to perfection. From Cronauer's first speech you feel at ease and it is funny because you are so absorbed by his speech rate. We see in this film that the character of Williams is quickly tired of the censorship imposed by his superiors, he thinks differently from his colleagues who let this censorship pass without complaining. The plot also forms around his love affair with a Vietnamese woman as well as a change of atmosphere when Cronauer is sent to the jungle, the plot forms around the fact that he is not a soldierThe moment that turns the film upside down is when a Vietnamese village is bombed, while you can hear music that opposes sound to action which caused me a feeling of sadness. It is after this that Williams will try to convey all the information that is not disclosed to his listeners while keeping his humor and his entertainment. There are still moments of hesitation, when the film goes from a funny moment to a serious one. Despite that Good Morning, Vietnam remains a very interesting film, with very good music that offers us a different approach to the Vietnam war. I find that even though it was released in 1988 this film is very original, excellent and unique, it's become unmissable.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Entertaining movie with a star turn from Robin Williams,"A new DJ arrives in Saigon to entertain US troops over the airwaves.This is an enjoyable movie with a great central performance from Robin Williams, strong imagery and a great sixties soundtrack.The plot is based on some of the experiences of real life Vietnam DJ Adrian Cronauer, but as is well documented by Cronauer, the majority it is fictionalised for the entertainment value. Entertainment is something it does well, mainly because of Williams portrayal of Cronauer. Saying that, there is a pretty solid story that unfolds quite well, aside from a few plot points that feel rather contrived for the sake of drama and to portray certain characters are overly evil.There are several memorable scenes such as all Cronauer's scenes in the broadcast booth, his many antagonistic exchanges with the military commanders, his interacting with Vietnamese characters during English classes and probably the most memorable is one montage sequence that uses a well known Louis Armstrong song.I enjoyed the visuals. There are some great location shots from the streets and countryside of Thailand that double for Vietnam. Despite the con of being in a different country it all feels pretty authentic to the unknowing Western viewer.Good Morning Vietnam contains a number of very good performances such as Bruno Kirby, J T Walsh, Forrest Whitaker, Tung Thanh Tran and Noble Willingham. However, it is a huge vehicle for Williams, who throws all his energy, charisma, comic and dramatic timing at the audience in one powerful star turn. It feels in some scenes that they were just pointing the cameras at him and just seeing what happens. To be fair it rarely disappoints.As with all comedy, it is in the eye of the beholder so if Williams' improvisational humour is not to your taste, you are unlikely to enjoy the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Definitive Robin Williams Movie,"Good Morning Vietnam is quite simply the greatest movie Robin Williams ever made (I know Mrs Doubtfire has a lot of fans, but I think this is the essential Williams movie)Plot In A Paragraph: In 1965 An unorthodox DJ (A brilliant Robin Williams) begins to shake things up when he is assigned to the Armed Services Radio Station in Vietnam.I can't praise the cast highly enough here, Forest Witaker, Bruno Kirby, JT Walsh, Robert Wuhl, Noble Willingham are all superb, as is Tung Thanh Tran and Chintara Sukapatana as some local people Williams befriends.The soundtrack is a great asset to the movie, featuring The Beach Boys and James Brown to name a few and Louis Armstrong's ""What A Wonderful World"" is an absolute show stopper!But it's Williams who is the star of the movie and he handled the emotional scenes just as well as the comedy scenes.

He won an Oscar eventually for the worked he did on Good Will Hunting as a best supporting actor but I didn't like that movie so I pretend he got the award for his acting in this movie instead. I think this is his best acting and also his best over all movie (maybe this shared with Dead Poets Society).He plays an army radio DJ who goes to Vietnam to entertain the troops because he is so fun and well liked. His show ends up being a hit but he rubs all his superiors the wrong way by making fun of them and Richard Nixon and doing funny characters on the air as well as breaking all kinds of rules.I won't spoil the ending but if you haven't seen this check it out because it's a very funny movie but also can be very touching.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A delicate but nonetheless impressive show of characters under the strain of another ""...for the sake of the nation..."" crusade.No Vietnam theme is complete without GMV and it certainly deserves buying a DVD player just to have this single movie in collection - because you'll play it over and over again.It is not enough to put together light, film, camera and a few actors to make a movie.

Let it be known that Robin Williams is a multi-faceted talent,"Good Morning, Vietnam has the uncanny ability to surprise. At around the hour mark, I was convinced that the film, while funny and impossibly kinetic and energetic in tone and performance, was solely sticking to this act of energy, while maybe touching but not capitalizing at the apparent possibility of an emotional subplot. Sure enough, director Barry Levinson and writer Mitch Markowitz manage to work in a seriously believable and touching bout of sentimentality to a picture so manic one doubts that it could possibly fit comfortably inside of it. The film is the perfect blend of manic, disposable energy and tender drama that it becomes a film to seriously commend in many different departments.Robin Williams is at the film's core as Airman Second Class Adrian Cronauer, who arrives in 1965 Saigon to work as a DJ for the Armed Forces Radio Station. He meets and takes a liking to the straight-laced and genial Private First Class Edward Montesquieu Garlick (Forest Whitaker), who also takes a liking to Cronauer after seeing what the man can do with a microphone and a broadcasting signal. Cronauer's radio broadcast, contrary from the archetypal and uninspired transmissions the bases were used to hearing, are irreverent and fun, with lively bursts of energy and unpredictable wit coming directly from the mind of its radio DJ. This leads him to be immensely controversial with his peers. However, Cronauer becomes supported and rejoiced by his students who attend his English language learning class on a frequent basis, proving that while he does things differently, the man has the incredibly ability to connect and to inspire.It should be dually noted that Williams exercised the practice of improvisation while performing his wild-and-out radio shows in Good Morning, Vietnam, for it shows extreme comic energy, timing, and capability. Williams indefatigably, zealously delivers monologues of true power during his radio shows, zipping by with unprecedented comedic speeds, with jokes so sneaky and quick that you're bound to miss at least a few. His character Cronauer doesn't even a cohost for his radio show, as he is the sole provider of such indescribable energy and fun in the film.Furthermore, Williams works to illustrate Markowitz' more sentimental and emotional second half, which isn't as emotionally manipulating as one would expect. Rather than carelessly paint a second half so somberly, immediately following a goofy but thoroughly enjoyable first half, Markowitz carefully constructs scenarios and characters for us to latch onto as likable souls victim to a senseless, brutal war. After an hour of Williams' rampant comedic delivery, despite it being incredibly enjoyable, I was expecting the entire film to only vaguely come to an emotional or even dramatically investing second half. As Markowitz goes on, however, he totally creates a wonderful climax and conclusion to the film.In addition, let it be known that Williams works tirelessly to detail the emotions necessary for the film to succeed. He transitions ever-so naturally from manic energy to humble and sentimental, effectively but commendably illustrating a drastic divide in emotions so beautifully. The performance at hand rightfully earned him an Oscar nod and affirmed a potentially skeptical audience of Williams' incredible on-screen energy.Starring: Robin Williams and Forest Whitaker. Directed by: Barry Levinson.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Robin Williams At His Best!,"Good Morning, Vietnam is often a funny and witty movie thanks to the fast-speaking talent of Robin Williams. Williams delivered his lines at his usual rapid pace and that makes things all the funnier. But in order to effectively deliver the material, he needed a great screenplay and that's what he got. It delivers the goods and some of the lines are just funny. My favorite is when the film lambasts Richard Nixon. I was in hysterics.Barry Levinson directs a film about the fast-talking radio host named Adrian Cronauer who is sent to Saigon to be the funny on-air personality everyone is raving about. The brass may dislike him for his on-air antics, but he has gained the ears of the common soldier.This is the perfect role for Robin Williams. His approach to comedy is perfect for this role. Some people may find this annoying, but I was laughing very hard throughout. He's at best when he was on-air. His off-air scenes were good, but they were more considered melodrama than comedy.Overall, Good Morning, Vietnam is a very funny film thanks to the presence of Robin Williams. This can also be considered a war film, but it's a rather unusual take on war film. But with Vietnam still fresh on many people minds at this point, this was a good way to tell the story: with comedy. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Robin Williams... what more can you ask for...,"For this role, Robin Williams was nominated for an Oscar and it's a shame he didn't get it. It's hard to say if this was the role of his career because he nailed literally every role he ever played and he was one of the best comedians and actors of all time.

A gut-busting comedy/drama/war flick,"GOOD MORNING, Vietnam, in my opinion, is a gut-busting comedy/drama/war flick. I laughed really hard when Adrian (Robin Williams) did the traffic report (""How's the traffic on the Ho Chi Minh Trail?""), imitated famous people (such as Gomer Pyle), made fun of the weather (""It's hot! D*** hot!""), and all the funny stuff he did. It was really funny! The music was also good, especially the rock 'n' roll that Adrian played. However, I simply couldn't stand Hauk (Bruno Kirby) and Dickerson (J.T. Walsh). This was because they seemed to have no sense of humor.

Rising Star: Robin Williams,"The funny thing about this film, I really didn't hear too much about it, I had just read a lot about it in my film books and how this movie pretty much made Robin Williams what he is today. I love Robin Williams, he is one of the greatest comedic actors of our time and not to mention a terrific man who really gets involved in his charities, I have a lot of respect for him, so I figured that I should probably see this movie since I'm a pretty decent fan of his. While it wasn't as outrageous as Mrs. Doubtfire, it was still a fun and realistic movie that made you laugh and feel.Robin plays Adrien, a marine who has been brought to Vietnam actually for a radio show due to his comedic reputation and he blows his audience away with great sketches along with the best music of our time. But Adrien is also somewhat playing with fire when he decides to read ""unofficial"" news that shouldn't be broadcast according to the military, which disappoints Adrien since the audience is being held back from the truth. He also makes some Vietnese friends, one of which he finds out to be part of the enemy while he is in love with the enemy's sister.Good Morning, Vietnam really shined Robin William's talents and strength towards being a star. He and the cast brought together a great comedy mixed with very dark drama. It had great acting and a unique story that I'm sure that anyone could enjoy. While it's not really a true Vietnam movie, it's still a decent film that deserves a look. This film did terrific things for Robin, we owe it to this film for that.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Some of Williams Finest Work,","Good Morning Vietnam is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and a fantastic cast. The movie is without a doubt some of Robin Williams finest work, one thing that he has proved to us over the course of his outstanding career is that he is great at doing both comedic and dramatic roles, he is given a chance to do both here. The highlights are certainly the scenes where he is hosting the radio show, it is very obvious that Williams got to improvise these lines and they are absolutely hilarious, the humour flies out of him very naturally, as well as a clear knowledge for the Vietnam war. There are some surprising twist and turns throughout that are exciting and take us deep in to the events of the war, many unexpected moments that really shocked me.

Also funny is Bruno Kirby in his role as the not-funny Lieutenant who thinks he knows comedy. The film wisely avoided having Cronauer's relationship to the Vietnamese woman (Chintara Sukapatana) proceeding beyond friendship, which showed a level of maturity and respect in the script.

An 80's comedy classic.,"This film is a comedy set in wartime and based, very fictionally, on the life of a real person, radio announcer Adrian Cronauer, who spent some time in South Vietnam, in Saigon, in the service of USAF Military Radio. Despite the truthful bases, most of the things we see in the movie are fiction, as Cronauer himself mentioned. However, without this fictional component, I doubt the film would have been as successful.The film's story begins with Cronauer's arrival in Saigon to take up a radio job. He will soon capture the soldiers' sympathies, with his contagious joy and a rebellious, sharp and irresistible sense of humor. However, it also becomes evident that he will not be easy to control, and high ranks will have difficulties in dealing with him and imposing the limits they think he must respect. At the same time, he will socialize with the Vietnamese, learn local customs and even teach English. But the enemy is subversive, and not even in the city they can know where he will attack, or where he will be.Despite being a comedy, the film does not treat war lightly. There are several moments when we feel that danger lurks, and enemy agents can be anywhere. Despite the way Cronauer wins friends, the grim faces of the population reveal the prevailing antipathy, understandable among a population that feels that their land has been occupied by foreigners who, supposedly, came to help them defend themselves, but who then treat them with suspicion, when not with violence. The film paints an acidic portrayal of the war in Vietnam, with cruelties committed by both sides. By the way, there is one scene that is particularly critical, and where war scenes are accompanied by the Louis Armstrong song ""What a Wonderful World"". To be more ironic, it's impossible.Robin Williams was the ideal man to bring Cronauer to life, and the right person to revive his sense of humor. With this character, Williams was able to let his imagination run wild and invent the craziest puns and jokes. It is not by chance that the film became a classic of the 80s comedy, and one of the most memorable films of this actor's career. With him, we have an excellent Forest Whitaker, a great Robert Wuhl and an obnoxious, but equally funny, Bruno Kirby. The film also features splendid collaborations by Tom T. Tran, Noble Willingham and J. T. Walsh.Technically, the film doesn't have any major demerits, but it knows how to keep a low profile, leaving humor to take center stage. Even so, I think it's fair to highlight the exquisite quality of the visual and special effects and the exceptional soundtrack, with a series of songs that we can easily recognize. Set in a military context, the film has good props, costumes and sets that automatically transport us to that environment and period. Finally, a word of praise for the cinematography and editing.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Life's Contradictions,"Outstanding movie. The contradiction of violence and love residing in one place. This was no more clear than in the classic scene where the visual images of the war was the backdrop for Louis Armstrong's beautifully touching song ""What a wonderful World"". Robin Williams job as a DJ enabled him to convey hope in a hopeless situation. His humor was good, as usual, but didn't let it overshadow the powerful movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Comically Serious,"One of Robin William's best films then and now. Though the movie is set during the Vietnam war, that does not tone down the comedy that Williams brings to it. Through it all, his character Cronauer manages to lift the spirits of the men at a time when everyone there thought no one's spirits could be lifted. His irreverent takes at anything from the weather to the war itself is simply hilarious and is Williams at his comical best. A definite must-see for anyone who seen the other serious war films and need one which shows you the lighter side of it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
What A Wonderful World,"Good Morning, Vietnam is a cinematic masterpiece that seamlessly blends the uproarious comedic brilliance of Robin Williams with poignant moments that reveal the harsh realities of the Vietnam War. Williams, in a role seemingly tailor-made for his unparalleled talent, delivers a performance that elevates this film to a realm of its own.The film's genius lies not only in its ability to tickle the audience's funny bone but also in its courageous decision to delve into the darker corners of war. The incorporation of Louis Armstrong's timeless ""What A Wonderful World"" in a tragic compilation of scenes during the Vietnam War is a stroke of cinematic brilliance. The juxtaposition of the upbeat melody against the backdrop of war-torn Vietnam adds a layer of irony that is both haunting and unforgettable.Only Robin Williams could have embodied the irreverent and quick-witted Adrian Cronauer with such finesse. His improvisational skills and infectious energy turn what could have been a simple war comedy into a multi-dimensional exploration of the human experience. Williams' ability to seamlessly transition from uproarious humor to moments of profound depth showcases his versatility and underscores the uniqueness of this film.The supporting cast, including Forest Whitaker and Bruno Kirby, provides a solid foundation for Williams to shine. Their chemistry adds authenticity to the camaraderie portrayed on screen, enhancing the film's emotional impact.Director Barry Levinson deserves praise for his masterful handling of the material. The decision to use comedy as a vehicle to convey some of the harsh realities of the Vietnam War is a bold choice, and Levinson executes it with finesse. The film's pacing, while slightly uneven in the latter half, ultimately contributes to the narrative's emotional depth.In conclusion, Good Morning, Vietnam is a triumph that lingers in the hearts and minds of its audience. The film's audacious blend of laughter and tragedy in portraying the Vietnam War earns it a well-deserved 9/10 stars, solidifying its place as a cinematic gem that resonates far beyond its release.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Got to Like Williams' Style,"If you like Robin Williams comedic style - this will be a great film.If you don't - it won't be.The movie is 90% him; with all other characters serving as comedic launch pads or nets.I do, so this is an easy 8, for me.A decent movie back then, now a great film compared to contemporary efforts.We wish we could get films this good, now. Lol
Forest Whitaker serves as a charming sidekick.This is actually an interesting film to study - because it absolutely is the standard comedy formula of 'just using a premise enough to have a story to the comedy'. Yet, watching this film is a very serious experience - vs 'Something About Mary' or 'Me, Myself & Irene' which really are the exact same formula, but generating the status quo comedy vibe. Makes me contemplate those other comedies having a more serious tone, and what they might have been.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
No One Can Play The Role Besides Robin Williams,"I can't think any single actor who can play Adrian Cronauer besides Robin Williams, the man was perfect for the role, he's talented, he can improvise, and he is energetic, Good Morning, Vietnam is not only fills with Williams amazing performance, the movie fills with an incredible performance by the supporting actor too, especially Forest Whitaker, Good Morning, Vietnam is a truly solid film, is a very very must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Classic comedy,"This was one of my favorite Robin Williams movies as ""Good Morning Vietnam!"" has pretty much entered popular culture. I loved Williams's radio broadcasts as they were hysterical, and his interactions with the Vietnamese people and army officers were first class. The scene ""What does three up and three down mean to you?"" ""The end of an inning?"" gets me every time! I loved the scenes in the classrooms and his playing ball with the village folk. What makes it even better was that this movie was based on a true story! Any Robin Williams fan will love this movie-I guarantee it. It is filled with classic moments and classic lines and classic characters.*** out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
What a wonderful film,"Robin Williams! What can I say? Everything he does is so brilliant. ""Good morning Vietnam"" is a wonderful movie, a true story, somewhat ""Hollywoodified"", but perfectly made. For an 80's movie, it stands head and shoulders above other films made at the time. Without Mr Williams as lead actor, it may not have worked out so well, but his humour makes this movie a joy to watch. Add into that the excellent Forest Whitaker, and you have the perfect chemistry. I have watched this film many times, and it is always a truly wonderful 2 hours of entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Funny Yet Serious,"Classic Robin Williams. His improv is on point, and the comedy style is all him. Though he's able to still perform a dramatic role at the same time, and we all know he can act with the best of'em.War comedies can be hit or miss. This is a hit. It's real comedy, not spoof material. Vietnam War was very demoralizing, and so any effort to combat that was a good effort. Adrian Cronauer exceeded in that department.Also, this was my fourth of July movie this year.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

I got to say, It was very funny because I think personally that the radio scene was so hilarious and it's amazing! The part where Robin Williams does the Wizard of Oz quotes and references, It was really interesting. I also heard on the movie that one of the characters said what Marx brother, Zeppo, The guy with the hat? That was so hilarious, I liked it a lot!!

The Genius of Mr Robin Williams,"One of the finest actors to grace our screens. Good Morning, Vietnam gave Robin Williams the role he was born to play; hilarious, respectful, whole-hearted and kind, not dissimilar to the man he was in real life.Adrian, a disc jockey, goes to Vietnam to work for the Armed Forces Radio Service. While he becomes popular among the troops, his superiors disapprove of his humour.Williams was nominated for an Academy Award and picked up a 1988 Golden Globe for the film, though no award could fully credit the excellence of his acting performance. One with enthusiasm for his eccentric character, though also a touch of care for his surroundings. A comedy watch is always made increasingly difficult when placed in an age of conflict, and there is a greater reliance on the writing and directing of the production to present the context of the Vietnam War with strict justice. Barry Levinson captures the horrors of the action to contrast with the humour provided in the radio show by Williams through heart-breaking scenes of anguish and desperation.The screenplay - crafted by Mitch Markowitz - elegantly illustrates Adrian as a ray of sunshine to all the serving officers as they fought in combat away from their loved ones. The laughs of the spectacle purposely make the audience forget the troubles at hand and enjoy the entertainment value Williams provides in his character.The uniqueness of a man with the ability to bring happiness in times of uncertainty and fear epitomises the power of comedy. A genre which Williams represented.A beautiful film that celebrates a beautiful man. Rest easy, Robin McLaurin Williams.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good morning Ork.,Why is so hard for comedy parts to win Oscars.Let's face it when Peter Sellers can't win an Oscar for Dr Strangelove then basically it's impossible to win one for comedy.Robin is phenomenonal in this film. I almost wet myself laughing as his impoverisations are incredible.Good morning Vietnam is basically good morning Ork.Robin always played Mork in his comedy parts. There's nothing wrong with that as Mork was the epitome of classic comedy.Good morning Vietnam is a vehicle for Robin just as the searchers was a vehicle for the Duke.Take away either and you've got no film.Any film I watch with Robin is always tinged with sadness for obvious reasons.But let's remember Robin for being one of the finest and fastest comedians of all time.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Definitely worth seeing,"I dont normally find robin williams comedy very funny, but this is an exception. As someone else here has said, he was born to play this role.

Good,"Good Morning, Vietnam is a spectacular blend of uproarious comedy and emotional drama with an outstanding performance from Robin Williams.

The blend of these two genres is what makes the film so great and it's a non-stop journey throughout.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
My rating: 8,"I watched the whole trailer to recall this movie. Why I did this? I was moved from this movie at the time I saw it even I do not know why I have missed to write about it till now.So... Goood mor-ning Vi-et_naaam! It is really interesting to see what happened to this country and how a single person using the radio and radio broadcasting - these such powerful sources of the mass communication - succeed in uprising the spirit of the people doing what he like most. I do not know why but on the last accent from the previous sentence his role of disco jockey, in a way, is best presenting the man and how he feels about his passion.Naturally, it is clear the deep sense of ""who is paying, he is playing the music"" and - you will dance what we play looked in a political way for which the movie can take a lot of critic.When I watched the movie for the very first time I have not the experience that I have now. And that is why I enjoyed it naively and esthetically. I watched it like a piece of art.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Robin Williams is clean shaven, it must be a comedy","This movie has just one good part - In the first act, when Robin Williams does his first DJ gig in Vietnam and adlibs the entire thing.  After that, there is just nothing noteworthy about this film that rises it above ""movie of the week"" material.  Robin Williams and his irreverency against the Department of Defense.  Ah, the zaniness!  Williams and Levinson would later team up again for the even more unwatchable, ""Toys"".",,Anonymous,Biography
lots of good,"There were a lot of things I liked in this movie, all centered around Robin Williams' performance as Adrian Cronauer, an army DJ during the early Vietnam War.  This was really a perfect role for him, combining the radio improv hilarity (similar to his other earlier work) with the touchy feely aspect of his relationships with the locals (characteristic of his newer roles).  The supporting cast was solid, but Williams really carries the movie.The main problem I had with this movie was that it didn't know whether it wanted just to tell a good story or really drive home a message.  There are a lot of moralizing elements, but in the end it seems that Cronauer is more concerned about his own skin than any greater good; for me the ending didn't quite jive with what led up to it.  To be fair, it was a well-done characterization of a basically good man who is not perfect; it's nice to see a movie where the protagonist has limits, where the ""hero"" is not a superman.The baseball game is a classic scene; the movie as a whole is a bit slow but this scene is worth waiting for.",,Anonymous,Biography
A great comedy - bit 'story'less though,"Good Morning Vietnam I think it's a great movie. OK so there isn't that much of a story line and quite a bit of 'filling-in', but I still enjoyed it. It was definitely written with Robin Williams in mind, and he acts superbly. There are some absolutely hilarious jokes in there along with some great music, which is what makes it enjoyable. There are some parts that aren't very believable, but hey - we watch movies (hopefully) for entertainment, and I thought this movie was very entertaining.If you haven't seen 'Good Morning Vietnam' and you want to watch a movie, I would recommend renting it, and if it's on TV definitely watch it.",,Anonymous,Biography
The wrong man. In the wrong place. At the right time.,"Goooooooood morning, Vietnam', is the catch cry of irreverent, nonconformist Army Radio DJ Adrian Cronauer, and once you have heard it for the first time you know that you are in for a special performance from one of Hollywood's great comedic actors.  Placed in Saigon, in the middle of the Vietnam War, Cronauer has a very unique style of Dee-Jaying, which makes him very popular with the troops, but not so with his officials. This is Robin Williams at his very best, in a role that he was born to do.Imported by the Army for an early a.m. radio show, Adrian Cronauer blasts the formerly staid, sanitised airwaves with a constant barrage of rapid-fire humour and the hottest hits from back home. The G.I.s love him - but the brass is up in arms! Riddled with side-splitting comic bombshells and studded with hot '60s hits, Good Morning Vietnam depicts Cronauer's raucous Saigon adventures amid a world gone mad.I really enjoyed the story of GMV. As I am writing this review, the world is at war, so I feel that a movie like this can help to bring into perspective what war might be like. The story is based around the Vietnam War, with Adrian Cronauer brought into strut his stuff on the air. From the first time we hear Adrian do his radio show, the movie is placed into overdrive, as we get one of the great comedic performances. GMV was directed by Barry Levinson in a really clever way. I love how he shows Cronauer to cause a great commotion during the war, while not shying away from other issues concerning the war. Levinson used the very funny screenplay written by Mitch Markowitz. I love the characters Mitch wrote in the story, and the humour that was placed in the lead character of Cronauer.So with all that in prospective, if Robin Williams did not bring the right comedic feel to the movie, it could have gone wrong. But as the good comedian that he is, Williams pulled the role off. He was so funny in front of the microphone, adlibbing his way through all his radio show. When he is not, he is almost as funny, trying to pick up Vietnamese girls of the street, going as far as to be an English teacher to attract one sweet girl called Trinh (Chintara Sukupatana). These scenes are extremely funny, as Cronauer uses a lot of his humour to allow himself to fit into the class. Adrian's help while on the air is Edward Garlick (Forest Whittaker). He rides through all the highs and lows Cronauer has in Vietnam and is strongly influenced by what sort of character Cronauer is. The other character that is helped by Cronauer is another DJ, Marty Lee Dewitz (Robert Wuhl) who is totally in awe of DJ Cronauer who has swept in from places we actually do not know.Yet there are characters here that do not like Adrian, which in turn I feel us as the audience, are not meant to like either. Lt Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) is infuriated by the style of broadcasting that Cronauer has brought to Armed Forces Radio, so much so that he tries his own hand at Cronauer's show. However, he is a terrible replacement, with the troops causing quite a commotion, asking for the irreverent DJ to be reinstated immediately. The other official that Cronauer rubs up the wrong way is Major Philip Dick' Dickerson (J.T. Walsh). He has no time for Adrian's smartass attitude and has contempt for the man, evening commenting that Cronauer's humour is not funny at all'. Yet, at the end of the film, the comment by Cronauer is exactly what you want Dickerson to hear, as he has a really mean attitude problem, as told by his superior, General Taylor (Noble Willington).There is one surprising character in GMV, that of Trinh's younger brother Tuan (Tung Thanh Tran). For the majority of the film you believe that he is a good character, but as the film comes to a conclusion, and we learn who and what Tuan really is, and you can understand why Cronauer is a little peeved at person that he called friend'. There confrontation is one of the more dramatic and touching moments in the film.There are many other memorable moments in GMV'. I love how we are introduced to Cronauer, as we have no idea what sort of DJ he is or he is going to be. I also like the scene where Edward takes Adrian into the field, to see what a difference he has made to the troops who are serving in the war. Once again we get to see how funny-a-man Cronauer is. I must also make mention of the great soundtrack that was assembled for GMV. With Adrian playing such great rock 'n' roll hits as the Beach Boy's I get around' and Don't worry baby', the Searchers sugar and spice', Wilson Pickett's the midnight hour', James Brown's I got you (I feel good) and Louis Armstrong's classic hit  What a wonderful world'. All these songs make the movie unforgettable and essentially what it is.So I really like this movie, not only for the classic radio scenarios that we are shown, but for how game the movie is in showing the dangers of war. In fact there is one scene in this movie that brings back memories of last October in Bali. I believe this is the good work of Barry Levinson and his team, who must have had a great time on the movie. I just wish I had watched this movie while trying desperately to become a radio DJ, because Adrian Cronauer makes the air waves look a lot of fun.CMRS gives Good Morning, Vietnam': 5 (Brilliant Film)",,Anonymous,Biography
