Relevant movie,"Why relevant? Until I saw this movie, in my point of view Tonya Harding was a cheat and a lowlife and this was entirely based on the media coverage of the events in 1994. Having seen the movie I feel ashamed about how easily I judged her and I realised I have to be way more careful in forming my opinion about people.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"I, Tonya (2017)","I think this film may have had the best trailer of 2017. I saw it and knew instantly how badly I wanted to see it. I've never been a fan of Margot Robbie and her previous acting efforts but this looked like her awakening and where she would be proving me wrong. I believe it, she's quite sensational in this film. Her dedication to her role shows but really everyone involved has done very well. Craig Gillespie has his first real winner with I, Tonya.I, Tonya is a biographical picture about famed and disgraced figure skater, Tonya Harding. Tonya was pushed onto the rink by her abusive mother at a very young age and despite the abuse becomes a very talented ice skater. The cycle of abuse continues with her abusive husband but she tries to bear through and succeed. Everyone seems to be against her but her talent is hard to deny. The film also goes into the famed attack on fellow ice skater Nancy Kerrigan and the aftermath of the incident.The film is sort of told from a mockumentary perspective as if key characters are being interviewed. The film also utilizes breaking the fourth wall where characters in a scene would talk to the audience. I thought this was interesting and separates itself from being a standard biopic and gives this film a real comedic depth. The soundtrack is catchy and literally every performance in this film makes for a very engaging time. I didn't even recognize the chameleon Bobby Cannavale until the credits rolled.Some wonder why the film was made but it kind of helps you identify with Tonya. She suffered physical and psychological abuse from both her foul mouthed mother and her rage filled husband. Her hands may not be completely clean in what happens to Nancy Kerrigan, but she is also just a victim of circumstances. Vastly talented, but just short of reaching her pinnacle due to outside factors and her image and attitude. The film isn't perfect but its vastly entertaining and could be giving Margot Robbie and Allison Janney Oscar nominations. I'm going to let this sink in and I'm sure its going to be something I go back to.7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
On paper it just didn't appeal to me...,"... because I just remember everybody actually involved being so unlikable. This caustic true-story comedy-drama tells the story of Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie), the champion figure skater who came from a hardscrabble background, raised by an abusive mother (Allison Janney), but overcoming the odds to rise to the top of her sport, only to see it come crashing down thanks to the criminal activity of her dim-witted husband Jeff (Sebastian Stan).I'm old enough to recall the story well enough, and I didn't really care about it then, let alone now, and I've never been a fan of figure skating. However, I am once again pleasantly surprised with how good the resulting movie is. Robbie and Stan, two of the prettiest people in movies these days, do a good job of deglamorizing themselves. Robbie is fierce, a description I am loathe to use as it's overused, but it really fits here. Janney got an Oscar for Supporting Actress, and she's also ""uglied up"", and her character is completely reprehensible. In fact, most of the people are in this movie, and there's a lot of coarse language and violence, particularly spousal abuse both by and from Harding. The film doesn't really have a message, as it's more of a character study and a sad-but-true tale of shattered dreams. It's also very well acted, darkly funny, and occasionally moving.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"More than about tabloid trash, this movie should be watched","Anyone who was old enough to be sucked in by the media circus that this scandal turned into should make it a point to take a look at this film, in my opinion.The media seemed much more about the sensationalism of it all than it was about maintaining the kind of objective balance that'd presume Tonya's innocence until evidence proved otherwise. 
But being honest, even if evidence came along that absolved Harding of any wrongdoing in the Kerrigan attack, how happy would the media have been to report it? Or would we have been to hear it? Because we've got to admit that, although it might not seem very nice, there was quite a bit of fun to be had during the couple months we spent focusing on this Hillbilly girl and her bumbling husband, right? Well with that in mind, what would the thought of her innocence have brought, other than damage to the narrative we were having such fun with? Regardless of where you stand in regards to her innocence, its only fair to acknowledge that her role had been laid out for her pretty much from the get-go. Kerrigan was its hero the moment she became the victim, could we have honestly entertained the notion that maybe Harding wasn't as much the villain as seemed to befit the story? How fun would that have been? Really?In the last couple months, the articles about this upcoming movie had comment sections riddled with people mostly bemoaning the current state of Hollywood. Not the scandals, but that it'd even stoop so low as to peddle this kind of white trash story. ""White trash"" came up repeatedly of course, and while comment sections generally aren't the place to find the best sampling of voices, I personally wasn't able to find a single comment that was anything other than damningly derivative of Hollywood and/or Tonya...certainly not one suggesting the possibility that maybe there was more to this story than what we already knew. But that was always a possibility, wasn't it? The telling of a side that we hadn't heard?After seeing the flick last night, I passed along my recommendation of it to a friend, commenting that Tonya Harding's guilt might have to be re-thought. In response, I got a chuckling, ""Oh I have a hard time believing that!"" Which, sure that has to be the prevailing opinion, I'd imagine. 
But why? Do we really and truly think that we have the kind of information on the subject that'd allow for the most objective, fact-based decision on it? Have many of us ever stopped long enough to have wondered whether or not we did? The line of questioning isn't likely to be met with much more than scoffs by those who've yet to view the movie, but they're questions that end up being well begged and something that the same people may find themselves unwittingly exploring afterward. I sure have been.In the meantime, this isn't just a great movie, but a great sports movie, detailing an ice skating prodigy who love for skating drove her life, and whose life ultimately served as a testament to just how influential a class system can be that many of us are barely cognizant of even existing. 
Based off interviews and testimony from the key players in the Kerrigan scandal, watching it brings a much needed sense of balance to the story and will likely leave you amazed at how easily the truth can be blurred when viewed through the lens of sensationalized media coverage.10/10, great movie that grabs you from its opening scene and will have you entranced throughout.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"It's an excellent, interesting movie.","The rollercoaster of American skater Tonya Harding, a super talented and successful skater, who will always be known for one incident in particular.What an absolutely first class movie this was, prior to this I knew nothing about Tonya Harding, after watching this I felt like I'd learned a lot, and been thoroughly entertained, it even encouraged me to seek out videos of her, visually, they got it spot on, from what I've seen of her, they also got her story spot on.An immaculate production, they got the era absolutely spot on, and it was out together in such a way, that it absolute flies by, it's so well paced.It's funny, it's moving, it's quite shocking, I won't give too much away about the incident, and I won't dwell on it too much, but it really is a shocking moment, one which will leave you speechless.Margot Robbie delivers an award winning performance, I know she's an actress, and will have no doubt learned how to perform all number of accents, but she absolutely nails it. I had no idea that Robbie could skate, clearly she could.Allison Janney and the whole cast were terrific. That mother of Tonya's was quite something.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tabloid Times,"I was going to make a list of people who made extraordinary things during the same period that Tonya Harding monopolized the headlines but then I thought it was a pointless exercise. Charles Manson will always be more famous, much more than Sharon Tate. That's the world we live in or maybe it always was. The sadness verging on horror of of the Tonya Harding story will win, fascination wise, than any kind of kindness from anyone anywhere. Now that out of my system let me say that I Tonya is an entertaining harrowing tale directed by Craig Gillespie and his extraordinary cinematographer Nicholas Karakatsanis with, clearly, Martin Scorsese in their minds and hearts. Margot Robbie is terrific and Sebastian Stan as the husband from hell, superb but it's Allison Janney that creates a character that is impossible to take and irresistible at the same time. She is spectacular. So, that's more than enough to recommend I Tonya but if the Tabloid Times is something you subscribe I will highly recommend Gus Van Sant's To Die For and Michael Ritchie's made for television The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Some Darwin award winners,"Man, I personally found this one to be an exceedingly uncomfortable watch.""I, Tonya"" is cleverly filmed as a pseudo-documentary, featuring re-enactments of the real-life interviews of most of the participants in this true-life drama. I recently bitterly criticised some film critics for spoiling the story of Donald Crowhurst, the subject of the recent ""The Mercy"". But I was about to do exactly the same here, *assuming* that you all know the lurid tale of the rivalry between Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan that led up to an 'event' in 1994 that shocked the world. And of course, many of you younger folk don't know: case in point my 26 year old son who I went to see this with, and who went into the story blissfully blind of the drama about to unfold. So I will try to keep this review spoiler-free.Playing Tonya from a (not very credible!) 15 years old to her mid-20's is Margot Robbie (""The Wolf of Wall Street"", ""Suicide Squad"") in what is a BAFTA and Oscar nominated performance. And for good reason: the performance is raw, visceral and disturbing in reflecting a victim who still thinks everything at heart is her own fault.Also BAFTA and Oscar nominated is Allison Janney (""The Girl on the Train"") as Tonya's obnoxious chain-smoking mother LaVona. Janney is truly terrifying as the mother who abuses her daughter both physically and mentally in a driven attempt to make her the best ice-skater in the world.Victims seem to attract abusers, and Tonya is surrounded by people who are just plain bad for her: notably her husband Jeff (Sebastian Stan, ""The Martian"", ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"") and his slimy and pitifully self-deluded friend Shawn (Paul Walter Hauser). The end credits video footage of the real-life players show just how well these parts were cast.Why so uncomfortable to watch? There is a significant degree of domestic abuse featured in the film, both in terms of LaVona on her child and Jeff on his wife. This is something I abhor in general, having been brought up to believe it is never EVER acceptable to lay a hand on a woman. To have these cowardly individuals sensationalised in the movie I found to be really upsetting. I strongly feel, for this reason alone, that the film should have had an 18 certificate. Violence in film should be related to the context as well as the severity. (Note that this is in stark contrast to my comments of recent BBFC decisions to make ""Phantom Thread"" and ""Lady Bird"" 15-certificates when I believe they should have been 12A).The film is executed extremely well, with 4:3 framing for the staged interviews, and ice skating scenes that seamlessly cut between the professional clearly doing the stunts and Robbie (who must also be a half decent skater too). The soundtrack is nicely littered - ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" style - with classic hits of the early 90's.To think that this story actually unfolded in this way is nothing short of astounding... but it did! There is an astonishing video clip here (#spoilers) of the run up to, and the immediate aftermath of, the Kerrigan incident. I came out of the film with a deep feeling of sadness for Harding (at least, as portrayed) and utter disgust that the villains of this piece could be a) so cruel and out of control and b) so utterly stupid. These are individuals who really should have been sterilised to stop them polluting the gene pool any further.Written by Steven Rogers (""Stepmom"") and directed by Australian Craig Gillespie, there is no doubting that this is a powerful film: played to an absolutely silent and gripped Saturday night cinema audience. And it has truly dynamite performances from Allison Janney and Margot Robbie. But be warned that you'll need a strong stomach to go and see it without being affected by it afterwards. It's a mental keeper.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Dialog and acting had the entire theater hushed.,"I must have been at a different movie than those who did not like it. The story is well written, the acting was excellent and the twist in the way the story is delivered makes for a memorable event.

A great story to get lost in and I was not really interested in seeing this when I went into the theater.",,Anonymous,Biography
"I, Tonya flows as swift as an Olympic figure skater.","Have been anticipating this release for quite some time. Why? Well I love a good biopic, the cast immediately attracted my attention and it's figure skating. Not often you see an ice skating film. Thankfully, this was bonkers and I loved the fact it was crazily stupid. Tonya Harding was famous for being a bad tempered figure skater in the 90's. This biopic triple axels (oh God I'm too good...) into her family and marital relationships, as well as exploring ""the incident"". A timely release considering the Winter Olympics, showcasing the grace and endurance required for figure skating. Pushing the sport aside, the focus is primarily on Tonya and her marriage to Jeff whilst intertwining her tough upbringing by her mother. Seemingly Tonya is portrayed to be spoilt and a fame seeker, but I consistently sympathised with her. Her pure skating talent being diminished by judges due to her presentation skills and media attention to the sport. It's a harsh reality, and the film made me feel for her. Played eloquently by Margot Robbie who was able to capture both her solid exterior and emotional vulnerability. Allison Janney was outstanding as the straight talking mother from hell who just loves to throw kitchen utensils at her own daughter (seriously...what the hell). I wished the story delved into their relationship further, just so she could have more screen time. Sebastian Stan also deserves recognition as he conveys both anger and love perfectly. Gillespie's directing style was interesting. Some nice one take edits and the figure skating segments were electrifying, albeit with a noticeable green screen. They tried too hard changing the traditional biopic formula by making it quirky. Consistently breaking the fourth wall, mixing narratives, embedding an interview with a linear plot. It works, however the constant use of these grew tiresome especially for a two hour runtime. Having said that, the plot never skates on thin ice and glides along swiftly. This is Robbie's baby, she and the film deserve recognition.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Allison Janney Steals The Show In This Wild Biopic!,"Before I give my thoughts on 'I, Tonya', let me just say two words: Allison Janney. The Multiple Time Emmy-Winning Actress delivers one of the STRONGEST Performances of the year, in her portrayal of LaVona Fay Golden, Tonya Harding's Mother from hell. Janney is pure Oscar-GOLD.And now coming to the film...'I, Tonya' like any other sports Biopic, shows us a woman from being a bullied nobody to becoming a somebody in the world of sports. Over-here, we explore Tonya Harding's hardened journey, that is at times powerful & at times exhausting.'I, Tonya' Synopsis: Competitive ice skater Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie, in great form) rises amongst the ranks at the U. S. Figure Skating Championships, but her future in the activity is thrown into doubt when her ex-husband (Sebastian Stan, very good) intervenes.'I, Tonya' is about Tonya's violent journey, that started from an impossible, no-holds-barred mother to a violent, brutal husband, who eventually ruined her career. But, Tonya is not a victim of her circumstances. Here is a woman, who despite being thrown into a world of ice-skating & rigorous competition, left a strong mark. She may have not done the right things to get to the position she got, but she was a talented personality who had the power to mesmerize & inspire.Steven Rogers' Screenplay begins superbly & the personal interviews of its characters throughout the film, give it that extra edge. The first-hour is solid & gets into Tonya's world & the people involved with a wicked sense of humor. The second-hour is a little disappointing & overlong, and the sub-plot involving the 1994 attack on Nancy Kerrigan, Harding's rival and Olympic teammate, offers less impact. The Writing isn't always compelling & takes away some glory from the film, overall. The Dialogue, however, are crackling & foul to the core.Craig Gillespie's Direction captures all the madness & ambition, with skill. The Director is in good form this time around. Nicolas Karakatsanis's Cinematography & Tatiana S. Riegel's Editing are strongly done. Art & Costume Design, as well as Make-Up, deserve a special mention.Performance-Wise: Janney is outstanding & is sure to pick up many awards for her portrayal here. I wouldn't be surprised if she takes the Oscar home, next year! Margot Robbie, also is in very good form, delivering a credible turn as Tonya. Sebastian Stan is entirely convincing as the violent husband. And Paul Walter Hauser is terrific as Shawn, one of Stan's friends, who leads Tonya & Stan, into much trouble.On the whole, 'I, Tonya' is an imperfect biopic about an imperfect woman. Do watch it though, especially for Janney's sterling performance.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A triple axel of a skating movie,"If I could have voted online for the best movie that I saw at TIFF 2017 (the voting was limited to iPhone and Android users), it would have been for this film, which wound up second in the People's Choice award competition. Director Craig Gillespie has tackled a difficult subject brilliantly without removing the considerable number of warts from the main characters. This film should garner a considerable number of Oscar nominations, including best picture and director.Margot Robbie should be a lock for a Best Actress nod, completely burying her Australian background to deliver American white trash with complete credibility. (She won't win of course, because ... Tonya.) Her skating sequences are edited brilliantly - you really believe that it's her.THE surest Oscar bet has to be Allison Janney as Tonya's acerbic, domineering, Swisher-chain-smoking mother LaVona Golden. She gives what I call a ""schizophrenia"" performance - there's no way that anyone seeing JUNO and this film back-to-back would ever notice that the mothers in both films are played by the same actress. Robbie got the loudest applause when the actors were introduced before the film, but when they came out afterwards, Janney's applause was equivalent to hers.The story sticks to facts and places most of the blame for the Kerrigan incident on Sean Eckhardt, played with spot-on obnoxiousness by Paul Walter Hauser. The rest goes to hubby-at-times Jeff Gillooly, played by Sebastian Stan. He handles the husband-to-a-celebrity role with a charm not seen since Eric Roberts in STAR 80.The subject matter may cost the film at awards time, but it's still an excellent movie that you should definitely check out if you have any interest at all in the story.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pure pain on skates,"So, you have watched Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri and thought that story was tough and Frances McDormand was terrific and nothing could ever be more tough and more terrific. Especially something with that hot blonde chick from The Wolf of Wall Street. Right? Wrong! So get ready for a big fat kick in the nuts, because sh!t has just got real.From the very beginning of the film you realize that it won't be pretty. An abusive ever-smoking and ever-cussing mother who would rather wipe the floor with her daughter than say a nice word to her. So destructive that even her rifle-shooting husband loses it and flees leaving a poor child completely unprotected. And when it turns from verbal abuse to the physical one, by her mother, by her boyfriend and later her husband, it's clear that it's not just not pretty - it's damn ugly, and that it's gonna get even uglier still.The trio of Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan and Allison Janney does an unbelievable job of focusing a huge amount of anger, hate and frustration onto the single character, Tonya Harding, making almost every second of her screen time a pure pain to watch. You see her going through things you'd be waking in cold sweat from if you saw them in your dream. But, then again, for someone it was not a dream but an everyday routine. A vicious circle of abuse and humiliation, and the only way to forget it, even just for a minute, was through that ice rink, doing the only thing that would make you feel like something more than a pathetic loser with no single bright perspective ahead.And with that ugliness comes the true power of this film, of Robbie's performance, and of the real Tonya. The power that channels all the hate she received from all around into the thirst for skating, as if that ice rink is your arena where you fight for your life - or die trying. And when it's your life at stake, things are never chivalrous or graceful - so the way the Hollywood sex symbol dies and gives birth to a relentless competitive monster is a true miracle. And, just like a miracle of a real birth, it's full of pain for both the participant and for the ones witnessing it.What makes I, Tonya an even more shattering experience is that it's not just a made-up story, it's something that a living human being once went through. When you see her husband beat her and threaten her and even shoot a gun at her, you wish you could simply tell yourself that it's just cinema - but this time it's not quite so. When you see her mother come to her, pretending to be offering a helping hand when she's the most vulnerable - to end up being yet another vulture that came to feast on the prey that looks done but still keeps twitching - you wish you could say that no real child has come through such pain and betrayal, but you can't once again. You see a girl whose story was simply meant to be a tragedy from the very beginning - and you just wish it to be over. But she takes another hit, falls, yet for some reason refuses to stay on the floor.I guess I realize why this film missed the Best Picture Oscar, just like Margot Robbie missed the Best Leading Actress one. Just like the real world Tonya who outskates her rivals but fails to meet the expectations about her presentation, this film is technically the most riveting and intense story this year, with the leading performance being a big shiny diamond of a masterpiece, twice as precious because it wasn't an established Oscar winner who delivered it but a girl who till now was the most famous for doing a full frontal nude shot a few years ago.I'm not saying that the scores are rigged and that the competition was flabby. On the contrary, Three Billboards was a great film that I loved, and McDormand's performance is 100% Oscar worthy. The point is that I, Tonya is just not the image the Western cinematographic establishment is ready to associate women with yet - ugly and abused and blood-spitting. But, if in the figure skating world you could at least say that such are the house rules, and a pretty dress and a smile are something that matters at least as much as - if not more than - a triple axel, then the film industry community screaming ""equal rights to women!"" at every corner and not acknowledging the most glaring case of one woman, fighting for her right for her skills to be valued and for herself to be treated as a human being, and another woman, incarnating all that fight and suffering that comes with it on the screen, is pure hypocrisy. Inclusion rider or not.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Margot Robbie and Allison Janney,"After seeing the preview I knew I would love this. Margot Robbie and Allison Janney were both impressive. I have to say, I was really surprised by Robbie!

Still a fascinating story,Margot Robbie is a terrific actress - eminently watchable. But she is bit too mature and large for the role of Tonya Harding. When she and Sebastian Stan as Jeff Gilooly take over from the child actors they look ludicrously too old. But then the whole movie is done in an over the top parody style so I guess it's forgivable.The scenes of abuse from Jeff Gilooly and her mother are quite shocking. Alison Janney does a great job as the mother from hell. Sebastian is a bit too clean cut looking - white trash don't look like him. All the abuse she suffered invokes a lot of sympathy for her overcoming such grinding poverty and sacrificing so much to get where she did.Just as in real life the events of the attack are not that clear cut.Whatever it is the story is one of the most interesting scandals of the sports world and worth watching.,7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good, not Great","If I had a penny for each time Sebastian Stan played an emotionally or physically abusive partner in a famous relationship that took place in the 1990's, I'd have two pennies. Which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice.An enjoyable watch, great performances, nice visual style, lots of funny moments, tells an interesting story that feels too bizarre to be true, but overall it didn't do much for me.It's a good film, just not a great one. Pacing was a bit off most of the time, and a bit of an imbalance in the direction of the narrative, and the third act was very messy, ended like 4 times. For some reason, although abuse and domestic violence is a large factor and theme, I didn't always feel its weight in the film. Margot is great, and so is Sebastian, but I don't believe Allison Janney's Supporting Actress win is deserved, she starts off strong but then doesn't do much overall to earn that honestly, or she maybe wasn't given much.Individually there are scenes, like the mirror one and the one between Tonya and her Mom at the house, that felt levels above the rest of the film. Sometimes the film was trying to do a lot of different things, not all of them worked, lots of obvious inspiration from Scorsese and Adam McKay, but not pulled off as expertly.A stronger screenplay and a stronger focus on the implications of American celebrity and the toxicity of the sports industry could've elevated this film for me in some areas, still a good experience though.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Entertaining and thought-provoking,"For all the great things I had heard about 'I, Tonya' from the time it was released, my expectations were nonetheless a bit mixed. But I'm pleased to say they were far exceeded: This is an outstanding film.Margot Robbie and Allison Janney are absolutely marvelous as Tonya Harding and LaVona Golden, her mother. Their performances alone make this well worth watching. Janney's role is defined by such obscene spite that I can only imagine how difficult it was to personify, yet she sells it so deftly. And Robbie very capably humanizes a complicated person that from the time I was growing up I only knew I was supposed to despise. Neither performer are actresses I've necessarily paid much attention to heretofore, but I surely will moving forward.I had been concerned that 'I, Tonya' would glorify the people responsible for the attack on Nancy Kerrigan - the first major news story I remember from when I was little, followed shortly thereafter by OJ Simpson. But it doesn't, and if anything simply conveys how the murky truth surrounding the incident is more complicated than any news outlet would televise. 'I, Tonya' rather concretely impresses the notion that Harding herself was an unwitting accomplice after the fact, but doesn't downplay the severity of the event - and also makes it clear that everyone who had a hand in it has their own version of events. If anything, the assault is minimized only insofar as this is the story of Tonya Harding, and her story is more than just her lowest moment.The abuse and domestic violence in the film is shocking to watch, contrasting sharply and painfully with the incredible artistry and athletic skill exemplified in figure skating. Screenwriter Steven Rogers is to be commended: even with the aid of interviews with the individuals involved, this is not an easy, simple story to tell. But he does it with aplomb, alongside the lovely editing by Tatiana S. Riegel, showing the convoluted tangle of Harding's life - her difficult personal history, her focus and enthusiasm for her beloved sport, and the way she was seemingly set upon by media who needed a villain for their burgeoning 24-hour news cycle.Beyond the glimpse at a reviled public figure's life, the media involvement is perhaps the biggest takeaway from 'I, Tonya', emphasizing the theme of perception. We may certainly take Harding's perspective with a grain of salt, yet there's no questioning the truth in the quip that America wants Someone To Hate as much as they need Someone To Love. And who better to demonize than someone who isn't picture perfect? That goes as well for the unflattering portrayal of skating judges in their convention and rigidity. Subsequent years have shown just how deep the rabbit hole can go with Olympics judges, and it's easy to relate to the notion that Harding's style, and lack of personal grace, clashed with the squeaky clean image figure skating is supposed to present. Who among us hasn't encountered a similarly duplicitous scenario?Mirroring the disparity between the turbulence of Harding's personal life and the finesse of figure skating, one also can't ignore the music on display. Music supervisor Susan Jacobs carefully selected music for the picture not only from Harding's routines, but other songs both popular and classical that match the tone and aesthetic of the picture. Likewise for the original score of Peter Nashel, who pointedly echoes the same.And really, that's the key - from narrative, to tone, to music, 'I, Tonya' is a study in contrasts, increasingly focused over its length on the way people and events are perceived and portrayed, as it tells the story of a very complex and very American person.And it is simply splendid.It took me a long time to get around to watching this, for a number of reasons. Don't make the same mistake.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An interesting take on tabloid journalism and the true story itself.,"With ""I, Tonya"", your views on former figure skater Tonya Harding and the scandal surrounding her and the Nancy Kerrigan attack could change entirely when you see this outstanding darkly comedic biopic.The story, like I've stated before, surrounds the life of Tonya Harding, a former figure skater, and the scandal surrounding her and the attack on competitor Nancy Kerrigan that inevitably ended Harding's once promising career for good.Margot Robbie plays the title character. Her performance is one that will have you in utter star-strucken amazement. That, and the performances of Allison Janney of ""West Wing"" and ""Mom"" fame, who plays Harding's abusive mother, as well Sebastian Stan of ""Captain America"" fame, who plays Jeff Gillooly, Harding's ex-husband.Then comes director Craig Gillespie. It's hard to put in to words how brilliant Gillespie's direction is in the movie. He is truly an unsung voice that deserves a little more credit. What he does with this film is carefully-knitted art. He and writer Steven Rogers are able to poke fun at the character's obvious lies and stupidity while being respectful about Harding's circumstances.Overall, ""I, Tonya"" is one to see for those who love scandalous stories, skating, and the truth.",,Anonymous,Biography
"I, Tonya","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerI, Tonya tells the story of Tonya Harding as she grows up to become a professional figure skater and then falls into the depths of controversy.

Sebastian Stan, Julianne Nicholson, Paul Walter Hauser (who is hilarious), and Bojana Novakovic (who is such a sweet lady) all perform very well.

Should Be Advertised as Pure Fiction,"Don't expect a film that reveals the untold truth about Tonya Harding. This is pure fantasy. If Harding were running for political office, this would have been funded by her supporters (if she had any) to paint her in a completely different light from the truth.First of all, Margot Robbie is FIVE inches taller than Harding with a much slimmer (less athletic) physique. Putting a 90's hairdo and makeup on her doesn't come close to transforming her into a believable replica of Harding. She also speaks with a southern accent--Harding was from the Portland area, where people are hardly known for their drawls--and the CGI dubbing of Robbie's face onto the skater standing in for her was obvious and awful.But the worst part is the story. Harding is a criminal who has admitted that she played a role in the attack on her rival, Nancy Kerrigan, who is something of an afterthought in this movie rather than the victim. Harding is portrayed as a victim and suddenly we're supposed to feel sorry for her because she endured a rough upbringing and marriage. Lots of people have crappy childhoods and marriages, but they don't plan assaults on others to get ahead.Many of the major players in this so-called ""biopic"" were not interviewed by the screenwriter, who tells the story sort of like the media reports on news these days--making stuff up as they go along without substantiating anything. Is it possible that Harding's mother was as much a villain as Janney portrayed? Sure, it's possible, but remember, the old gal worked 3 jobs at times to give Harding the opportunity to skate and if she wasn't interviewed for the film, then we are only hearing one side of the story and it is likely far from the truth. Harding was known for clashing with just about everyone, including those coaches who tried to help her, and she was always rough around the edges, making her less than palatable to the admittedly snobby figure skating world.Kerrigan remains the victim and this film victimizes her all over again, this time by painting Harding as some pathetic creature whom we should absolve of any complicity or responsibility for her actions simply because her mommy didn't love her. Abuse is not an excuse.Do yourself a favor; save your $12, look at videos on YT, and see what really happened 24 years ago.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Not a whole lot of class, but a lot of talent and entertainment","As with many of my most anticipated films of the year, 'I, Tonya' had a promising trailer that made me want to see it and an interesting cast, the accolades (wins and nominations) and generally positive word of mouth were just as encouraging. Not to mention that it was based on a fascinating true-life person, Tonya Harding, with an equally fascinating and infamous story.'I, Tonya' was entertaining and well done with a lot of great qualities, but somehow it felt uneven to me and like something was missing. Can totally see what people see in it, due to absolutely agreeing with what has been singled out as especially good, but it could have done more with such a great subject to work from and does fall short of being one of my favourites of the year.Starting with the faults, the CGI for the ice skating sequences (which were otherwise very well choreographed and both witty and graceful) was both not necessary and distracting, as well as not being particularly good.There should have been much more focus on the Nancy Kerrigan story, that is what made Harding infamous and it was a shame that nowhere near the amount of attention that went into Harding's rise and struggles went into this aspect, which featured nowhere near enough and was under-explored. Likewise with Kerrigan herself.Also found the montage of Harding's abuse by her mother rather crass. Childhood abuse is a very serious and hard-hitting subject, to see it for my tastes trivialised and not taken seriously (instead played for laughs) won't bear well with sufferers and even non-sufferers like me will find it an ill-judged touch.However, 'I, Tonya' elsewhere is handled very well. Particularly good is a sensational Allison Janney on pretty terrifying form, with her Oscar Win being one of this year's most deserving in a rare of few questionable wins, was rooting for between her and Laurie Metcalf. That is in my opinion, though there were a few that weren't my personal picks for the category, for example 'Lady Bird' being my pick for Best Original Screenplay.Margot Robbie taking on Harding was a risk and it pays off mostly in a brave and credible performance that is her best to date (though not in the same league as Frances McDormand and Sally Hawkins). She may not look like Harding, is too old for her and could have brought out her vulnerability more (which would have happened if the film was consistently bolder showing the full horrors of the abuse, some times it was harrowing, other times it was too safe), but she is very successful at portraying her as a flawed and troubled human being with a lot of talent who made numerous mistakes but brings enough pathos to make her worth rooting for.Rest of the cast are just as good, Sebastian Stan has never been better to me and the same goes for gentle and elegant Julianne Nicholson. Paul Walter Hauser entertains hugely as well. The direction is solid enough.Visually, apart from the CGI, 'I, Tonya' looks great. It's beautifully shot and cleverly edited, while the music is energetic and whimsical and the ice skating choreography graceful. The script is sharp, acerbic and irreverent, with plenty of blackly funny moments. The story has its faults but is gripping and fast-paced with a lot of entertainment value, relatable themes, moments of tender poignancy and some unflinching ones. Was with the film for much of its length, which is why it was so frustrating that the Nancy Kerrigan story wasn't focused on enough. The documentary elements are an acquired taste and not for those looking for accuracy, but they were generally entertaining and clever if not as illuminating as they could have been.Overall, entertaining and well done if uneven. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The facts vs the story,"When I started watching this I found myself quite displeased with the way things were told, in some sort of sarcastic way, to make fun of things, and with great amounts of ""unverifiable"" stuff; this was not the way to tell a biopic. And I stood by that opinion until almost the very end of the story, in fact, until the very last scene. And this is why: I Tonya is not trying to give an ""objective"" vision of the events of 1994, it's actually trying to do the complete opposite. I would say the main point of this movie is to show you how there's no such objective point of view, as media in general is always trying to perceive to a certain audience, just as the skate judges. And so, the whole world only got to see what the media wanted you to about Tonya, therefore creating a ""universal"" opinion. The movie shows us what the media never wanted to, Tonya's point of view, Tonya's life, and how it was distorted by everyone else to make her look like a monster, be it true or false, because there's no truth except what each person claims it is.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great performances, but...",The acting performances are amazing. I do wish this movie had been made more like a traditional movie though. The fact that it's this quirky intercutting movie between the story and documentary style interviews with Tonya and her mom prevented me from getting pulled into the story. I was always aware that I was watching actors pretend to be these famous people. I never got lost in the movie. It felt like a little gimmicky when it could have been better.,6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"I, Love, This, Movie","I, Tonya treats the story of Tonya Harding as if you already know the punchline, and you probably do. It doesn't build up to the ""incident"" in climactic mystery-drama style, like some sort of ""Memento on Ice"". Instead, it focuses on correcting the public consciousness of an uncomfortably complex figure. It isn't a single-minded recreation or a myopic vision of an easy character. It's a celebration of the ethically grey, allowing the bigger truths to shine through the conflicting details. One of the most stylish, energetic, and hilarious films of the year, I, Tonya is a stone-cold scorcher.
A biopic of Olympic-skater-turned-American-pariah Tonya Harding, we're given a fully-formed view of what made the superstar one of the most controversial people in sports, and one of the most compelling cultural characters ever. On simple filmic levels (perfect performances, fun long-takes, seamless ice skating cinematography), it's nearly impeccable. The film glides along gracefully, before repeatedly being hit by a baton of style, violence & unique honesty. Using conflicting first-hand accounts, recreated interviews and fascinating fourth-wall-breaking, it manages to make a ubiquitous news story an eye-opening experiment of stylish filmmaking.
Not that the style is mindless pretension. All the kinetic editing and unique writing play into the real point: that truth is more complicated than heroes and villains. Harding worked hard, tried to dress the part, piled up the makeup to hide her bruises (both literal and figurative). Yet no matter how she changed her image, she couldn't change others' perceptions, or even the truth of who she was. She was human. She was complicated, and so was her story. And I, Tonya treats her with that respect, all while staying endlessly entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Margot Robbie Leads an Excellent Cast to a Gold Medal,"TL;DRUnique style makes it personal and stand outGreat soundtrackGoodfellas vibe to the whole thingTracks a lot of Tonya's life but the focus narrows in on ""the incident"", improving structurePhenomenal performances, particularly Margot Robbie and Allison Janney in particular-------------------------------------------------You have to admit, I, Tonya came out at a pretty perfect time; with the Oscars just around the corner and the Winter Olympics in full swing, Margot Robbie's latest ticks both boxes with a film about ice skating worthy of its three Academy Award nominations. Bringing a sporting legend to life, I, Tonya is a well-made, strangely captivating film.The style chosen by director Craig Gillespie and writer Steven Rogers is a unique, interesting one and works very well. Starting from her childhood and tracking her life up until the present (more or less), it's absolutely a biopic, but it's given a dash of personality and realism by occasionally having the style of a documentary, with the actors recreating the real-life interviews and the editing cutting the talking-heads to fit in seamlessly with the rest of the film - the nomination for editing is well-deserved. Having the actors break the fourth wall and talk to the audience, both in the talking heads and fitting into the action, makes the story seem a lot more personal and works well, also fitting with Tonya's rebellious persona. In fact the constant personal narration (along with the fantastic soundtrack) gives off a strong Goodfellas vibe that works well.Most of the film is about the characters though, the latter half specifically being about how they react and handle the aftermath of ""the incident"". The cast are all wonderful, without a weak link. Even the comic relief in Paul Walter Hauser doesn't detract from the film's tone and is used in moderation to lighten things up. It's especially refreshing to see Sebastian Stan flex his acting talents more than we often see him in the Marvel films, with his Bucky character relegated to just brooding and not giving off much of a character. Here however he's given a chance to deliver a well-rounded, complex performance, playing a character we really shouldn't like, but Stan makes the pathetic and aggressive Jeff almost sympathetic. This complex performance extends especially to the Oscar nominated performances by Margot Robbie and Allison Janney. Robbie makes a wonderful lead, fully embracing the ""bad-girl"" persona of Tonya Harding, while still making her empathetic and likeable. With such a charismatic, intricate performance, it's not surprising she's been nominated. Janney in particular is one of the most interesting characters though, easily stealing every scene she's in and really making the part her own. It would be so easy for her character to be seen as an abusive villain, but instead she makes her more complex than that. Like with all the characters, Janney's excellent performance portrays her character as neither good nor bad, neither likeable nor unlikable. She's a flawed person and is perhaps the best thing in the film.I, Tonya is nothing if not refreshing; a uniquely styled biopic which breaks the fourth wall, is effortlessly entertaining and captivates audiences worldwide with flawless performances of very flawed characters. This one easily steals a gold medal.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"This is a movie about a bidimensional, white trash ice skater - not Tonya Harding.","I finally have watched this movie and I can say I am deeply disappointed. I, as a big fan of figure ice skating was really thrilled about this movie and expected much more. If you don't know much about Tonya Harding's story, I suggest you read about her and watch some of her old and new interviews and you'll understand why I didn't like the movie.One of the reasons is its screen script. There is no ""official story"" about what happened to Tonya Harding or Nancy Kerrigan. The script was written based on interviews with Tonya and her ex-husband, carried on by the screen writer himself. So, much of what is told in the movie is purely fictional, especially the parts about her mother, since she never agreed to talk to the screen writer or the production staff. Tonya herself said some parts of the movie were inaccurate, and Margot Robbie said that when she first read the script she thought it was about a fictional figure skater, not Tonya Harding.Besides, many things in this movie remain unexplained. The movie is basically about the verbal, physical and moral abuse Tonya endured throughout her life, but shows too little how Tonya built her athletic and ice skating career. And regarding the Nancy Kerrigan controversy, there isn't much talked about, either. Nancy is just a shadow in this movie, there's nothing about her point of view or how the incident actually affected her or her career. In the end you feel that you don't really know what the life of Tonya Harding the ice skater was really like.Regarding the direction, I found really tasteless Gillespie's attempt to give a comical tone in the NUMEROUS domestic violence scenes of the movie. The characters break the 4th wall to give the violent scenes a more 'casual' look (because according to Gillespie, Tonya talks about her violent past in a very casual manner), but cinematographically this 'casual tone' didn't work - it only makes it look like the movie romanticizes abuse and underestimates its impact on a woman's life. Also, the whole sarcastic/comical tone of the movie made it feel superficial, boring and childish. To me, a more serious approach to Tonya's life would be more appropriate.And regarding Margot Robbie's performance, I found it very disappointing and amateurish. Regardless the fact that she's not as bulky or athletic as the real Tonya, she played a white trash, foul-mouthed Tonya Harding that never existed. Her interpretation of a redneck is purely stereotypical. Also, I don't know where Robbie's accent came from, since real-life Tonya doesn't have that strong southern accent - she's from Portland, come on! It's an annoying accent that appears and disappears throughout the movie, alongside with the numerous bad words (some of them included by Robbie herself) and a very artificial, rude way to talk that Harding didn't have. Robbie didn't convince me and made me feel NOTHING for her character.On the other side, Allison Janney is BRILLIANT as Tonya's mother. She could flawless play a sociopath, and truly deserves at least an Oscar nomination as a supporting actress. Another good surprise in this movie is Paul Walter Hauser's acting.To sum it all up, this is a mediocre movie, that didn't entertain me (how am I supposed to find funny a story with so much domestic violence?), and didn't move me. It also barely tells who in fact Tonya Harding was. It is a superficial, bidimensional portrait of a woman who's surely much more complex than what was shown in the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Nudge, nudge, wink, wink, aren't we clever?","""I, Tonya"" is a film based on an undeniably startling series of events in the ice skating and entertainment-gossip worlds of its era, but it ultimately comes off as a cruel stunt rather than a riveting dissection of all that went down and the societal implications of same, which it pretends to be. From the very first moments of the film the actors come off as actors commenting on, and impersonating, the real-life people they play rather than becoming them (with the usually-reliable Bobby Cannavale the worst offender of all), and that queasy feeling lasts throughout the film, even when it pretends to be sympathetic to their violent, lost, and confused world. Allison Janney, who I usually enjoy tremendously as an actor, summed up what I suspected about the actors' and creators' misguided, even clueless actions regarding the making of this film: On a talk show she condescendingly described the real Tonya Harding's behavior at the recent Golden Globes Awards show while seated at her table by implying Tonya had the clueless audacity to approach Oprah at a nearby table, when, in fact, you also get from the story that Tonya innocently thought Oprah would remember her from interviewing her back during the actual high-profile peak of the events' turmoil. That same condescension toward the (at the time) clueless real people involved showed through in the film itself as well, and it makes for uncomfortable viewing. Yes, it is true the real-life people depicted were then-clueless and confused, lost participants in life-destroying antics, but everyone involved in this present-day production should have realized their depiction of them is just as lost, clueless and confused.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Based on a True Story,"""I, Tonya"" is a biographic film telling the story of the notorious American figure skater Tonya Harding, brilliantly performed by the Australian actress and producer Margot Robbie. The dramatic and heartbreaking storyline is supported by magnificent screenplay by Steven Rogers that combines dark comedy and docudrama and fantastic music score.

We will never know the truth!,"The Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan scandal of the 1994 Lillehammer Winter Olympics was the biggest ratings winner for the ladies short program. 24 years later, the world has changed and moved on. The figure skating world had other scandals but none topped the Harding-Kerrigan saga. Nancy was Olympic bronze medalist from 1992 and Tonya finished fourth place. Tonya would have probably been okay if she hadn't an abusive ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly in her life. She married him to escape her abusive mother (Allison Janney earned an Academy Award for her performance in this role). Tonya's life was one tragedy after another. She should have been removed from her mother's care as a young child. She was neglected and abused since she was a young child. Tonya's relationship with her mother, Lavona, was abusive and dysfunctional. Her father abandoned them and he was the fifth husband and her fourth child. She was a chain smoking waitress who worked hard to put Tonya through skating lessons. Tonya was a high school dropout with only figure skating on her mind until Jeff entered her life. Margot Robbie escapes into the role of Tonya Harding as a believable tragic figure skater. The film is about Tonya Harding's life not about Nancy Kerrigan. After the scandal, figure skaters earned a lot of money as a result by performing for television specials. If you have any prejudgment about this film, you need to see for yourself and decide for yourself about what really happened in 1994.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Can Jane Eyre Love?,"One of the topic that came across my English class this year is if Jane Eyre can truly love given her orphaned, loveless childhood. Another example would be Tonya herself, whose life is epitomized and largely influenced by her childhood - being deserted, being coerced, being beaten up. These memories not simply haunts her, but becomes a part of her genetically, resulting a fair legal penalty, and yet a tragically pitiable story. The movie itself reminds me of Air slightly (yes I watched them in reverse order), comprised of compacted narration and multiple perspectives. Margot Robbie's performance is a dynamite in this film, as the mirror scene is a combined self-immersion into her character and natural fluctuation of emotions. Not only a great biography of one contemporary Jane Eyre, but a refreshing insight into the American athletic industry.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Gripping but not really funny,"I, Tonya is a surprisingly good movie and much of the credit goes to Margot Robbie and Allison Janney who were both excellent. If you want to call this a ""dark comedy"" though I guess that would be alright but don't expect a lot of laughs. The humor is really in the storytelling, full of irony, plus the foul language and violence which is kind of taken to absurd, almost comedic levels.Anyway, Tonya is portrayed throughout as a fiercely combative woman who gives as good as she gets. She's no timid victim except perhaps when going up against her mom in the early years. You can infer what you will about that as it applies to the ""the incident"" as it is called. I mean, the real Tonya always seemed more sweet that prone to violence at least in public interviews. But if she is in reality anything like the Margo Robbie character, I would have to say that yes, she could easily have been complicit.But I liked this movie especially because of the way it contrasts the ""two"" Tonyas - Tonya while on the ice vs Tonya everywhere else in her life. The skating scenes were awesome (good music throughout, BTW), with Tonya's gracefulness and athleticism on full display. Everywhere else in her life though it was pretty much chaos, so the skating seems likely to have been an escape for her. This is reinforced in the movie by her relationship with her proper coach who is so very different from her mom you have to wonder if Tonya ever wished she actually had been her mom.Also, taking everyone back to your main character's childhood is a ploy that always works for me in movies in general (like in ""Contact"" etc). Its just something that inevitably causes tears to well somewhere along the line while evoking sympathy for your character.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

What did Tonya know and when?,"Comparisons come to mind when thinking of both Tonya Harding and this excellent film about her life and that notorious incident that led to her disgrace
and banishment. The film is done almost as a homage to the faux documentary
style that Gus Van Sant used in To Die For which was based on the Elizabeth
Smart story. Both even had Australians as protagonists, Nicole Kidman for the
Van Sant film and gloriously memorable Margot Robbie for I Tonya.I racked my brain trying to think of a sports figure like Tonya Harding and the
closest I came up with was Shoeless Joe Jackson who came from a similar trailer park background that Harding did. He too listened to the worse angels
of his nature and got himself banned for life in his sport. Jackson had far less
education than Harding did, in fact he was almost illiterate.One thing about Jackson though his choice of life partner was a good one. By
all accounts his choice of life mate was inspired as Katie Winn Jackson stuck
loyally by him and was never a bad influence.That could not be said for Jeff Gillooly who had the same kind of trailer park
background that Tonya did and who let being the husband of a celebrity just
totally go to his head. Sebastian Stan whom I consider one of the best actors
around today plays Gillooly with an explosive intensity. As the sports press
built up this rivalry between Harding and Nancy Kerrigan, Gillooly tries to think
of ways he can make himself indispensable to his wife.Thus was born the knee capping incident which gained both Kerrigan and Harding a celebrity status far beyond the world of women's figure skating. It
was done by a man hired by a dim bulb friend of Gillooly's played by Paul Walker Houser. The scene with Houser being interviewed by the FBI is laughable and the expressions on the faces of the agents just says it all.The investigation went almost Watergate like up the ladder until the real target was reached by law enforcement and public opinion. It's such an incredibly plaintive scene as Harding begs the Figure Skating Association not to
be banned. It's all she knows. The film is purposely vague as to how much 
Tonya did know.Best of all is Allison Janney and while the cast is great and many might get
Oscar consideration Janney I think is a sure bet for a nomination as the monster of a mother that Robbie has. Still alive she denies the child abuse
allegations. I kind of doubt it. Janney is unforgettable.Two scenes are also real keys to Harding's character and how it developed. One is early on when Harding berates the judges. She knows she outskated
everyone, but they remind her that form and presentation count big for them.
And later on she's told she's not the right image. Figure skating champions have to be pristine princesses as they have from Sonja Henie to today. She
does make the effort to clean up her image.She almost does and a scene that will break your heart just before the fall is her leaving an arena and being asked by a little girl for an autograph. In that
moment with dignity and class she shows herself the role model sports figure
she was expected to be. Poignant all the more because the audience knows
the fall is coming.More than would be figure skaters should see I Tonya. It's the sad story of an
American tragedy.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Really made me sympathize with Tonya Harding, and root for her!","'I, TONYA': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A sports comedy biopic about figure skater Tonya Harding, and how she and her ex-husband were accused of hiring a man to break the leg of her competitor, Nancy Kerrigan. The film stars Margot Robbie as Harding, and it costars Sebastian Stan, Allison Janney, Julianne Nicholson, Paul Walter Hauser, Caitlin Carver and Bobby Cannavale. It was directed by Craig Gillespie (who also helmed 2007's outstanding 'LARS AND THE REAL GIRL'), and it was written by Steven Rogers. The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it was also nominated for three Golden Globes; including Best Motion Picture-Comedy, Best Actress-Comedy, and Best Supporting Actress (which it won). The movie (surprisingly) really made me sympathize with Tonya Harding, and root for her.The film follows Tonya Harding's (Robbie) figure skating career, and life, from the time she was a three-year-old girl, until the attack on Nancy Kerrigan (Carver) which ended her career. The film shows how Harding was horrendously abused, both physically and emotionally, by her mother (Janney) and her husband (Stan). She was also treated extremely unfairly by figure skating judges, and society as a whole, because of her poor upbringing and appearance. The movie also takes the perspective that Harding had no knowledge of the attack on Kerrigan before it happened.The film actually made me feel guilty for thinking so negatively of Tonya Harding, because I always assumed that she was somewhat of a bad person. Of course the movie doesn't present her like that. It actually makes her out to be a tremendously abused, and oppressed sports hero, who at one time was the greatest figure skater in the world (which is something I didn't really know). She lost it all, of course, due to society bigotry (the film suggests). So I really found the movie to be interesting and involving, and it reminds me to always give people the benefit of the doubt (and to not jump to biased conclusions). Any film that can do all this, deserves a lot of respect in my opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Plus did you know Shawn died in 2007 and years prior to that had changed his name? The media had said a lot of crap about her but again in the movie it wasn't really covered enough, especially international media - what was local media saying about her during the Olympics? What did the judges think about her? Then there's Nancy Kerrigan, who's really just a prop in this movie. Who is she? We know nothing about her. Tanya says they were friends, which seems shocking, were they really? What is the depth of this friendship?? Anyway I enjoyed it but it could've been epic.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Glib Retelling of a Sensational Story,"I remember well the whole Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan story (I was just graduating from high school when it all went down), and I was very intrigued to see how a movie would portray it all. At the time, I mostly just remember being done with the whole thing by the time it had played itself out. I was so sick of everybody involved, Kerrigan included, and it all just seemed so sleazy and embarrassingly American. The movie made me feel much the same way. These were trashy people living a trashy life style doing trashy things, and despite the film's clear intention to do so, it isn't able to wring much moral significance from the whole episode.Margot Robbie does a fine job in the lead role, avoiding the temptation to do a simple impersonation and instead trying her hardest to turn Tonya Harding into a three-dimensional character. The film limits her success, however, because of its dogged determination to remain glib and cartoonish and play the whole thing like a big joke that the audience is in on. This is weirdly at odds with choices the director, Craig Gillespie, makes at various points in the movie, like giving Tonya monologues about how she's a different person than the media would have us believe, or one uncomfortable scene during which Robbie addresses the movie audience directly and tells us that we collectively are as responsible for persecuting Harding as her abusive husband or monstrous mother. If handled differently, moments like these could have made this film a reflexive examination of America's unhealthy relationship with the media and its obsession with fame, however earned. But the movie is too eager to be a crowd pleaser to dwell for long on anything too serious, so it rushes on to its next bit of comedy and ends up doing to Tonya Harding exactly what it accuses its audience of.In addition to Robbie, Allison Janney is getting a heap of acclaim for her performance as Harding's mother, an absolute horror of a woman. She hits the marks she's asked to hit, but it's a shame that such a talented actress as Janney isn't given more to work with than the gross caricature she's given here. On the other hand, Sebastian Stan, as Tonya's buffoon of an on-again-off-again husband, gives a great performance that no one seems to be talking about.""I, Tonya"" is entertaining, but it doesn't deserve to be remembered in the same company as some of the best films of 2017.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Make up your mind! What kind of movie are you making?,"What kind of movie was this supposed to be? Because it bounced back and forth between dead-on realism (Rawlinson) and raw violence (domestic and parental) to satire? (Harding's interview recreations) and absurdist comedy (Eckardt - good lord!) to the point where I just didn't know what the filmmaker(s) were trying to accomplish. I learned nothing new about Harding's story here, so maybe my POV on the story was the target? If so, you need to pick a tone and stick to it. Because I felt continually jerked around, I came out of this movie within antagonism toward the whole enterprise and sympathy for none.And as for the acting, I personally thought Robbie was terribly miscast as Harding---didn't believe her for a moment, and Janney, while competent and entertaining, can play this type of supporting role in her sleep and did nothing here to convince me otherwise.I just ended up feeling that maybe this movie was better suited for the Lifetime TV channel--although even there a couple of reality TV documentaries have told the same story in a more interesting manner.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
I did my best and got an 8! Well done look at real life Greek like tradegy that's a life full of hard knocks with a blunt and brash lady who came off the train tracks!,"Everyone remembers the drama of around 1993 and 1994 when the sports and ice skating world was turned upside down by an attack scandal featuring Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan. It rocked pop culture and became tabloid headlines. And this latest biography type picture called ""I Tonya"" captures those moments just perfect as the acting and direction is just perfect as the film is told from the perspective of all involved thru interviews and flashback like form.The movie follows the life of one hard luck woman as from the start you see that Tonya Harding(in a fine performance from Margot Robbie) is a doomed lady who's abused both mentally and verbally and beat on from those most close to her. Tonya's only comfort is the cold ice that she skates on underneath and it's her want and desire to be the best on the ice that moves her, even though the odds are stacked against her.This picture is also a showcase on the life of hard knocks and abuse as a key contributor is Tonya's hard and tough as stone wicked witch of a mother LaVona Golden(in the best performance ever from veteran actress Allison Janney) who helps throw her daughter into a life of negative ways and trailer park trash type living. And upon marriage to a guy named Sebastian, Tonya's life doesn't improve as the beatings and punches and bruises are still given to her. And it's the husband who plays a key role in the plot to go after and mess with Nancy.Overall really a pretty good movie that's blunt, brash, and outspoken for the way how it shows that the life of a woman came more and more off the train track. It proves for some that life is cruel and brutal and it took me back in time to the early to mid 90's when this drama was headline news!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
a TRUE underdog story with no fairy tale ending,"I absolutely adore this movie. First off,, obviously this is Margot Robbies coming out party. She's an A+. Its her movie and she delivers. The characters are so unique and interesting and....true? Even if its only 90% true, wow. I love the formula with the faux docu style. I love the mix of drama, comedy, and raw, yet not boring styleBut mostly I love that Hollywood told a true underdog story for once. A girl who never got a fair chance despite being the best due to ther bad luck of upbringing. The quote about society became her final abuser. Boom. I love that. Our progressive culture for some reason dismisses ""hicks"" or people from poor backgrounds and I think that's a shame.Tonya got screwed and I love a movie that doesn't give us a happy ending.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Entertaining but lazy,"The story of Tonya Harding is an amazing one. A figure-skater whose face and image didn't fit her chosen sport's, she nonetheless had a pretty decent career; but one which ended in extreme controversy when she was implicated in a plot to injure one of her leading rivals. It's a story of someone doubly disadvantaged by their background: Tonya faced prejudice, but that's not to say she wasn't carrying real baggage as well, in the form of the various unsuitable acquaintances of hers involved in the assault. Unfortunately, 'I, Tonya' is a rather lazy film, with a clumsy and unsubtle description of American ""white trash"", an unimaginative soundtrack comprising a semi-random assemblage of pop hits, and a treatment of the story as essentially comic. It ends with a ludicrous court scene in which Tonya is banned from competition as part of her criminal sentence. It's a shame, because you're left with the feeling that there's certainly a story worth telling in here; but this feels no more sophisticated than a cartoon.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
a perfect landing,"Greetings again from the darkness. Your recollection of Tonya Harding is likely not that she was the 1991 U.S. Champion figure skater and a two-time Olympian. And rather than honoring her as the first female skater to land a triple axel in competition, you likely remember ""the incident"" in 1994 where she whacked her on-ice rival Nancy Kerrigan on the knee with a club. Only Ms. Harding wasn't the one who attacked Ms. Kerrigan ... and that's only the beginning to what director Craig Gillespie (LARS AND THE REAL GIRL) and writer Steven Rogers (P.S. I LOVE YOU, and a bunch of other mushy stuff) detail in this madcap look at a reality infinitely stranger than most fiction.Margot Robbie (THE WOLF OF WALL STREET) stars as Tonya Harding, and it's a career-defining performance ... funny, tragic, physical and emotionally charged. This isn't the expected bleak biopic, but rather it's a brilliant blend of parody, docudrama, and dark comedy focused on some real life folks that will surely make you grateful for your life. Harding's abusive, profane and icy mother LaVona is played with aplomb by Allison Janney, who manages to bring some humor to the role of a woman whose approach went far beyond the realm of tough love and straight into cruelty. Sebastian Stan plays Tonya's husband Jeff Gillooly and Paul Walter Hauser is Shawn Eckhardt, his friend and co-conspirator. In regards to these last two gents, we spend most of the film trying to decide if they are goofy, ignorant or downright dangerous (or all of the above).Director Gillespie expertly weaves together the domestic scenes, ice skating scenes, and ""current"" interviews with the main characters. The domestic scenes include Tonya and Jeff, Tonya and her mother, Eckhardt with Tonya and Jeff, and Eckhardt with his own parents. The ice skating scenes emphasize how hard Tonya worked and her relationship with Coach Diane Rawlinson (Julianne Nicholson), while the interviews (recreated from actual interviews) provide contradictory details from the memories of Tonya, Jeff, Eckhardt and LaVona. The film tries not to make fun of them, but they kind of do it to themselves.Bobby Cannavale appears as a ""Hard Copy"" reporter who provides some story structure by walking us through the timeline as reported by the media at the time. McKenna Grace plays a young Tonya, while Caitlin Carver is Nancy Kerrigan. Tonya has long been labeled as the most ""notorious"" figure skater, and a failed boxing career was the closest she came to capitalizing on her notoriety after the scandal. Her life and the incident have been the basis for songs, books, news specials, documentaries, TV parodies, and even a Brooklyn-based museum. The film reminds us that truth and recollections are open to interpretation, and that there is much more to the story than what was reported. Respect is too much for Tonya to hope for, but this excellent and entertaining film might deliver a dose of compassion or empathy (along with incredulity and some laughs).",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A very interesting approach to an otherwise no go story.,"When I first found out about this film, a question instantly popped into my head: How do you make a film about one of the most hated persons in America, and make it work? I mean there must be some artistic choices going into the equation here, just telling it ""as it is"" would've been impossible. And I was right. ""I, Tonya"" is a funny, snappy, fourth wall breaking dramatic comedy (or ""tragicomedy"", if I can say that without getting lectured by the stage fanatics).They solved the problem of not necessarily telling the truth, by making a variation of a multi-plot; having the actual, character-based, living and breathing people tell their own versions of what happened. They have different stories about the same story, which is the outset for a multi-plot. The only anomaly here is that all stories have the same protagonist - Tonya. Another way of looking at it, a more conventional way for sure, is to regard the ""ice skating story"" as the central storyline, the a-plot; their ""mother-daughter-relationship"" (incited by Tonya's father leaving her as a young child) is b-plot and ""romantic relationship with stash-guy"" is c-plot. Both subplots serves the dramatic purpose of complicating the central story line, making our protagonist's life more difficult.The film is about her, Tonya Harding's, ice skating career, but her intense desire (overwhelming at some points) to be loved and accepted for who she is drives the telling. This dynamic relationship between action and desire results in troubled personal relationships when she can't skate to her satisfactory standard of perfection. This is a key ingredient in creating any interesting, empathetic and multidimensional character - by giving the protagonist an unconscious desire and letting the audience sense that it is there, contradicting the flitting conscious choices of the protagonist. In this film for example - her unconscious desire is to be loved for who she is and not for what she can do, but her conscious desire contradicts this idea, as she wants to be the best at what she does, so that she can be loved. And we, as the audience, can sense this contradiction in how Tonya always seeks her mother's approval and always goes back to stash-guy, hopelessly seeking that fulfilment, which is to love and be loved as a human being and not as an ice skater.I believe this approach to making the film was necessary, as everybody already knew about the ""incident"". And Steven Rogers (screenwriter) did a great job directing the attention and focal points of the story elsewhere. The theme of the film isn't ""the protagonist failed in her career, because she physically whacked her rival before a competition"". No, it goes much deeper than that. This story is more about what we do to ourselves and others in pursue of our shallow, soul-corrupting desires - fame, money, a celebrity's kind of love - and what consequences we suffer as a result. At least, that's what I took away from the story.To wrap this up, I just want to give the remarkable Margot Robbie (Tonya Harding) a solid 9/10 for an outstanding performance; a beautifully portrayed protagonist!Overall, it's a great film! 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Entertaining, Well-Acted Dark Comedy","This biopic on the Tonya Harding figure skating scandal is both entertaining and informative. Headlined by performances by Margot Robbie, Allison Janney, Sebastian Stan and Paul Walter Hauser, the film tells the story of Harding's upbringing through her figure skating career that eventually lead her to the Olympics. The performances in ""I, Tonya"" are strong throughout. Margot Robbie manages to play the lead role well, with the perfect pitch of darkness and sarcasm. She manages to get the audience to root for an otherwise deeply unlikable (for obvious reasons) protagonist who one might consider to be an ""anti-hero"" in the structure of this narrative. Allison Janney is excellent (as always,) and the other supporting characters bring a unique amount of depth and character analysis to the story. The fact that the incident is approached from a variety of sides and perspectives is unique and provides a sense of originality within the film. The film is also rounded out by an astonishingly good soundtrack loaded with classic rock songs.""I Tonya"" isn't perfect, however. The film is paced very poorly, as it manages to start introducing the viewer to the circumstances surrounding Tonya Harding and the 1992 Olympics just under halfway through. The lack of resolution after the climax is also a concern. Despite these structural imperfections, however, this is an entertaining and well-made sports biopic also working as a pitch-black comedy--that I do recommend. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Alison Janney deserves an Oscar,"Janney's performance as the mother is stunning. See it for her, if nothing else. As for the rest of the movie, I was not impressed. It is clearly so proud of itself for being mildly clever - it feels like a self-congratulatory university revue written by a bunch of heartless frat boys. It lacks genuine warmth and sensitivity. I also found Robbie to be completely wrong for the part. There is actually something very insulting about her shallow portrayal of Tonya as screeching trailer trash. She is not convincing and you are always aware that Robbie the actress is performing this pantomime - ie, the very opposite of good acting. The CGI work when she ice skates is also terrible.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Best Film of the Year,"First, I'm stating that it's the best film of the year, and I just barely care about women's figure skating. So you know that it's phenomenal. For me, it edges out ""Dunkirk,"" which was my favorite 2017 film until the night I saw it.Director Craig Gillespie is obviously a Scorsese protégé, and unlike Martin McDonagh's cheap ripoff of the Cohen brothers, he manages to pay homage to the man without imitating him. Like Scorsese (and Bob Fosse) he meshes documentary with realistic drama seamlessly well.Margot Robbie and Sebastian Stan deliver good performances. Allison Janney and especially Paul Walter Hauser deliver OUTSTANDING performances. In fact, I didn't feel like Hauser was even acting as much as he was just BEING. These performances are also a credit to Gillespie.Almost every scene is well-paced, has little ""fat,"" conveys meaning and adds to the narrative, which indicates great video editing. The editing was so good that I didn't even check the time, which is rare for me. Outstanding pacing.When I entered the theater, I didn't think that I was going to get even slightly emotional about Tonya Harding's story. But she is truly a sympathetic character without feeling sorry for herself, which is rare nowadays. Nowadays, everyone seems to be competing for who has it worst and who is the most pathetic victim. In Tonya's world, it's just her life, and it's presented as factual rather than maudlin and soap operatic. As Tonya basically says at the end of the film, ""s--t happens. Deal with it.""",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

a compelling portrait of an abused skater-made-good,"From its confessional title to inconclusive finale, I, Tonya (2017) is the kind of film that leaves you wondering why it was made. The fragmented mockumentary approach disguises a lightweight narrative filled mostly with deplorable people with few redeeming qualities. However, Margot Robbie's compelling portrait of an abused skater-made-good turns an otherwise lacklustre melodrama into an engaging performance.The pathologically unfiltered stage-mother LaVona Fay Golden (Allison Janney) was the kind of mother than nobody deserved. She forced her four-year daughter into ice skates and a life of verbal and physical abuse. Without ever once enjoying a mother's praise, Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie) grew up a talented competitive figure skater who had nothing else in her life except Olympic dreams. To escape her mother, she fell in with another abuser Jeff Gillooley (Sebastian Stan) who became her husband. Despite the elite skating fraternity looking down on Tonya for her loud-mouthed brashness and being too poor to buy costumes, she competed at the 1992 Winter Olympics to win a fourth place. Retiring briefly, she mounted a comeback while her husband and his moronic friends arranged an inept attack on Tonya's main skating rival Nancy Kerrigan. She recovered quickly yet the entire story leads to the question: what was Tonya's role in the attack?It is difficult to label this film: it is not a serious whodunit nor is it funny enough to call it a black comedy. The mockumentary technique leans heavily towards telling rather than showing and the narrative is disrupted constantly by actors shifting out of character and into the role of interviewee. But the effect of multiple narrators is to construct a swirling matrix of viewpoints, in the middle of which Tonya desperately struggles to find respect and belonging. Margot Robbie's performance is outstanding. To convincingly play a girl from the wrong side of the tracks who was force-fed elite skating despite abuse from her mother, husband, sporting judges, and the media, is no small achievement. Whether the film makes a compelling case that we should care at all is another matter. With Tonya centre stage, the camera treads lightly over her abusers and leaves us guessing about her involvement in the Kerrigan attack.If you are hoping to see some skating excitement the film will disappoint. There is a noticeable absence of narrative tension in either the characters or depicted events, yet the story engages our sympathy for Tonya. Themes like the discriminatory politics of elite sport and the social burdens of class and family dysfunction get a light airing, but it's hard to see this as a message film. Those who remember the real Tonya and the attack will find it interesting. For others, the unusual story format and characterisations are more enough to hold your attention.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Weird Presentation, But Fascinating Subject Matter","Because of the attack on figure skater Nancy Kerrigan leading up to the 1994 Winter Olympics, Tonya Harding is largely a household name even to the most casual of sporting fans. What was her role in the attack? Did she help plan it? These are questions that may never definitively have answers. What ""I, Tonya"" looks at, however, is the notion that Harding has perhaps been judged as much for her upbringing and ""redneck"" personality as anything else.For a basic plot summary, this film is a bio (of sorts) of Harding (Margot Robbie). It really focuses on the relationship with her mother LaVona (Allison Janney) and on-again-off-again husband/boyfriend Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan). Growing up without much formal education and pushed to focus on skating at a very young age, Tonya did not possess the princess-like grace of her competitors, much to her dismay as the scores would inevitably disappoint. Despite being perhaps the best technical skater of all time (landing the first triple axel in Olympic history), Tonya could not seem to truly grasp the status she thought she deserved. The film then delves into the infamous Kerrigan (Caitlin Carver) attack, and posits some theories on how exactly it all came together.What one must remember about ""I, Tonya"" from the very beginning is that it is pieced together from interviews conducted with Harding herself and Gilooly. Harding tends to deflect blame to anyone else (mother, background, etc.), while Gilooly really puts much of the attack incident at the feet of his mysterious oddball friend Shawn (Paul Walter Hauser). This is pretty standard behavior (trying to as much blame others as take any sort of personal responsibility) for these types of situations.What this approach does net, however, is some interesting things to think about regarding Tonya that are indeed interesting to ponder. Her mother is a true piece of work, she indeed was very naive due to a lack of education, and it is demonstrated time and time again how both the professional skating administration and the media used her to shape and cultivate their own narratives. While the film doesn't (and rightly so) make the leap of excusing the attack on Kerrigan because of this, it does make one perhaps at least look at Harding in a different light. Perhaps she was not the ""monster"" she was made out to be at the time.Robbie's performance as Tonya is incredible, and almost single-handedly makes the weird presentation of the film work. Personally, I prefer a more direct approach when dealing with a documentary subject, but ""I, Tonya"" constantly breaks the fourth wall (talking directly to viewers) and often has a character narrating certain scenes from an outsider perspective even while the scene is transpiring in real time. It can be a bit jarring, to be sure, but as I said Robbie really mitigates that with her incredible Oscar-nominated performance.Overall, I enjoyed ""I, Tonya"" much more than I probably ever thought I would do to how thought-provoking I found it. Will I ever completely sympathize with Ms. Harding? No. But what this film gave me was a look inside her life and how her tumultuous background may have colored both the events and relationships that eventually brought the skating portion of her life to an end.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Possibly Margot Robbie's Best Role Ever,"I, Tonya is fantastic on so many levels. This film approaches extremely disturbing topics from child abuse to domestic violence to ""the incident"" with pitch black gallows humor and a strangely comforting comedic style. Almost everyone in Tonya Harding's young life is portrayed as lovable and human, no matter how trashy or violent their behavior, to a point that I wonder if some individuals involved took offense to this effervescent light touch. However, the empathetic suggestions which are made in the script serve to explain what led to extremely unpleasant circumstances; it honestly helped me as a viewer grasp events that baffled many people back in 1994. In a world where abuse was commonplace, such an act of vengeance almost seems ...normal.Taken strictly as a work of art, I am pleasantly surprised that a bio pic managed to be brilliant comedy, while weaving an atmosphere in the background that convincingly recreates the late 1980s and early 90s. So many directors have tried and failed to capture the feeling of 30 years ago, but I, Tonya performs time travel with such skill that it rivals the deceptive ease of Harding's triple axels.

"The season of good movies continues. Here's another one that I devoured with my eyes, and recommend!","Who needs traditional sports movies when there's a new mini-trend emerging to get ride of any old ""classical"" approach and concentrate on the actual pain and madness behind the life of the champions? I liked ""Borg McEnroe"" a lot, and I pretty much love ""I, Tonya""!Based on a true story, it's about an American figure skating star Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie) of the 1980's and early '90s who's too white trash-y to be taken seriously by her peers, and her life choices turn out to be so damaging that she's banned from professional skating forever.Robbie is nothing short of sensational as Harding but it's not just about her. ""I, Tonya"" is hands down one of the best ensemble movies that I've seen recently, and there's been quite a number of them.You may remember the rising star Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn of ""Suicide Squad"" - the only memorable thing from this abysmal superhero effort -, but you wouldn't probably recognize any other name from the cast.But there's so many incredibly enjoyable performances that I just have to give shout outs also to Alison Janney as Tonya's stone cold ever-hateful mother, Sebastian Stan as Tonya's impulsive and violent husband, and Paul Walter Hauser as Tonya's ""bodyguard"", one of the most brilliant comic relief type of performances that one could think of.It's amazing how, on one hand, everybody feels like such a black and white cartoon figure, and on the other hand, like a real person.There's also Bobby Cannavale - the only one besides Robbie whose face you might remember easily from other movies or series - but his contribution seems wasted by the creative team behind the project.Cannavale has great presence and he's super charismatic as usual but the character has so little screen time and importance that it could have been replaced by voice-over or just let somebody mention him in passing. Sad.In fact, not making the most of the material is the only thing that I would call the weakness of the movie - and why I wouldn't give it even higher score.It's not that the storytelling is lazy but Cannavale is not the only thing that's been added to the story just to be thrown aside carelessly.For example, I find it most curious indeed that Tonya has four siblings but they get mentioned once and otherwise have zero participation in the story. It would be reasonable to show at least something about their lives, even if they were not part of Tonya's life.On the other hand, the storytelling is enriched by the inventive technique to sometimes speak directly to the audience even during the busiest of scenes, without losing the momentum or spoiling the atmosphere. Impressive use of breaking the fourth wall, as they say.I also love the production design - how the 1980-90's lower working class American dream looks like. As period pieces go, this is great work in its own right.All in all, I just loved ""Tonya"". There's a great number of movies aiming for sassiness and feeling energetic, but director Craig Gillespie and writer Steven Rogers have managed to raise these qualities to a new level, or at least to a league of its own.Judging by this movie, the old spiritual observation that being poor can make you more alive - living in constant need will make good things more vibrant and enjoyabble - seems 100% true.There's something irresistible about the atmosphere of ""Tonya"", all this mobile and restless energy just glues the attention on the screen.""I, Tonya"" is nominated for 3 Oscars: Robbie as the actress, Janney as the supporting actress (she already won the Golden Globe for this) and the editing. All three seem award-worthy on their own, although the competition is strong in each category.So, I don't know what to tell you. Go see it, if you haven't already. It's captivating, always ertertaining and has a lot of punch.

An American tragedy from the dawn of the age of 'infotainment',"If you like to watch stupid lowlifes repeatedly shoot themselves in the foot then you will really like this film, which follows the infamous Tonya Harding's life from precocious child skater to the abrupt termination of her skating career in a court of law (with a quick jump to her brief stint as a novelty-boxer). The movie is an example of the 'unreliable narrator(s)' motif: opening with a disclaimer stating that it is ""based on irony-free, wildly contradictory, totally true interviews"" and allowing characters to break the 'fourth wall' to inform the audience that the other character is lying or the portrayed event didn't happen. This all makes for a fun film, as the makers can play up the most bizarre, ridiculous, or tragic versions of events without worrying about whether they are strictly true as long as someone said that they were. Margot Robbie does an excellent interpretation of the tough, foul-mouthed, quick-tempered, 'trashy' '80s chick who was also one of the best skaters in the world (although Robbie would tower over the diminutive Harding) and Allison Janney is outstanding as her abusive, coldly-pragmatic, chain-smoking mother. Sebastian Stan is great as husband Jeff Gillooly, who unwittingly (maybe...) set off the chain of events that led to the crack that was heard around the world, when gormless goon Shane Stant whacks America's beloved, prom-queen skater Nancy Kerrigan on the knee. I especially liked Paul Walter Hauser as Shawn Eckhardt, who was always my favorite dim-bulb in the Harding chandelier back when this was all news, not entertainment (although the line had begun to blur even then). Great fun, and if the line between fact and fiction is fuzzy, that just makes the movie all the more like the original 'news' story.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A sports biopic, but definitely not a boring one.","For those who aren't aware, Margo Robbie used to be in the Australian soap opera, Neighbours (which is more popular in the UK, or at least, it used to be 10 or 20 years ago.)Anyway, I bloody loved it and still watched it well into my 20s like a weirdo (and got back into it when I had my first baby in my 30s). Margot Robbie played an aspiring fashion designer called Donna (short for Donatella, of course) and I loved her to bits. She had a boyfriend called Ringo who was a bit of a drip and he got killed in a car crash right after they got married age 17.Sorry - this isn't a review for Neighbours. Anyway, I actually had no idea she was playing the titular character of this film until about 10 minutes in - that's how good she was. Everyone was good in this film.I knew nothing about the film and only hazily recalled the whole Harding/Kerrigan 'incident' so it was quite a fresh story to me, and told in such a clever way with so many little blink-and-you'll-miss-it type shots and tricks. I've not seen a film so engrossing in quite a while and has certainly made me want to check out other work directed by Gillespie.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fantastic acting,"I guess because I had no real expectations about this being great, I was actually surprised by how great it was. I admit the writing/directing stylistic choices become obnoxious at times, but they also work to make the film stand out from the usual biopic at other times. This is one of those biopics that has the quick, showy type of editing that award bodies go for so I fully expect the editing to get some notices, but it would definitely be deserved. The film moves like a machine while still keeping the character dynamics and development in tact. Overall, the biggest standout aspect of the film is its acting, and in that department it in no way disappoints. Allison Janney was the predicted frontrunner for Supporting Actress before Laurie Metcalf started beating her for Lady Bird. Since this film has come out all I have heard from those who have seen it is how this is not an Oscar-winning type performance, and I completely disagree. I am actually now surprised by how baity and typical the performance is, compared to previous winners. Now I'm back to predicting Janney to take home the big awards. She is definitely really great in the role, although I myself prefer Metcalf. But the biggest stars of the film are Margot Robbie and Sebastian Stan. The former has deservingly been in the conversation for awards, and I would say she is in the same level that McDormand, Ronan, and Hawkins (the other three frontrunners) are. She would make a fine winner. Sebastian Stan is almost equally as great, and it's a real shame he's not getting much notices at all. It's a fantastic performance through and through.",,Anonymous,Biography
Margot's best role!,"The movie is good. It's real, sometimes funny and it keeps you interested most of the time.
But let's talk about the best thing in it - Margot Robbie. Real beauty who people often underestimate because they see her just as a beautiful woman. Not very talented one. But here she proved them all wrong. Her performance was amazing. Even more than that, I can honestly say her acting made the whole movie intriguing, without her this would be somehow dull and maybe even boring.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Mean and talented,Tonya is a real person. Hearing her story and how this movie came to be with Margot Robbie cast in the lead I was like sure why not. It surprised me.

I was surprised to learn about who this real person is the movie is depicting that I had never heard of before. Everyone has a story. Great watch.,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not as inspirational as I'd hoped it would be!,"The thing that I liked the most about the film was Allison Janney. She played the complicated character of Tonya's mother very well. Besides that, it is an average film with a protagonist who I believe may have been given more attention than she deserves. After all, there are many sportspersons with much more inspirational lives, but obviously not many would be willing to make a movie out of their lives. I think that sometimes these model sportspersons must feel cheated by our society's attitude of worshipping scandal.Besides, the film's treatment of violence and abuse is much too cavalier for my taste.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

It's Not My Fault,"""It wasn't my fault"" is a line we hear over and over in this movie - it should probably be a secondary title, as the movie seems to serve as a 'sort of' apology for what they call The Incident, the 'whacking' of Nancy Kerrigan's knees. Everyone is aware of that incident - it was, for a while in the 90s the lead story in the news, capturing the tabloid interests of America by combining a forum for competition in skating, social class, and good looks. Tonya Harding captured more than her fifteen minutes of fame.The movie does not definitively answer the question of what, exactly, Tonya's role was in the trailer-mafia story. Telling the tale from the mouth's of several of the participants, I don't think we yet have the final truth about whether Ms. Harding plotted the 'whacking' in advance. If the movie truly represents her confession about the matter, then she was at least knowledgeable after-the-fact and participated even dim-wittedly in the cover-up. For that she was punished greatly, being banned from the sport that had defined her life for nearly twenty years.If we are to believe Tonya, though, 'none of it was her fault'. No, instead it was the judges who could never get past her background; her coach who never gave enough; her husband, who she loved despite the marital violence; his friends whose egos exaggerated their mildly nefarious plot; and, especially, her Mother who, despite giving her as much as she was able, never really gave her any support at all. Whatever happened was always TO her, not BECAUSE of her.And so the movie leaves you with a very ambivalent set of feelings. You'd like to at least understand Tonya's role in The Incident, and perhaps leave with a little sympathy for her fate. But you can't - there is no acceptance from her here, and no humility. Its all about how awful her life was and how, whatever happened, it has its explanations outside of her.The movie comes to us from the fertile imaginations of writer Steven Rogers and director Craig Gillespie. Rogers wrote StepMom, a movie from a couple decades ago starring Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts about a dying wife and mom who selects her replacement. I remember the story as being effective and intriguing, although it was not a huge success. Gillespie is best known for directing Lars and the Real Girl which had some genuinely weird and funny moments which he succeeds in bringing to I, Tonya.One device they bring to this movie that succeeds wonderfully is telling the story in two ways - one in conventional movie scenes, and the other as a series of interviews with each of the characters, separately, sitting in chairs and recounting the events as they remember them. Then, as an added effect, at certain points in the movie the characters break the fourth wall by speaking directly to the audience through the camera. Although this stunt is a dangerous one because it often fails, in this case it seems to add credibility as well as a certain sense of humor to an already twisted story-line.
The movie received a well deserved Oscar nod for film editing. Tatiana Riegel also worked with Gillespie on the Lars and the Real Girl project. In I, Tonya, she succeeds in putting together a tight movie with no extra fat - every scene adds to the film and helps tell the story.Margot Robbie, as Tonya, does a credible job, and I can understand the nomination for leading actress as the Harding character was not an easy one to play. But I couldn't help but think, as I watched the movie, that she was miscast. Simply put, Ms. Robbie is too attractive to play the Tonya role. Robbie is five inches taller than Harding and doesn't have nearly the muscular build that gave Harding a huge part of her image as a redneck female (Harding was often referred to as Thunder Thighs and she could bench press more than her own weight). Robbie shines in roles like Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad, or Jane in Legend of Tarzan, or Naomie in Wolf of Wall Street, or even as herself in The Big Short - yes, she works best in more glamorous roles. She gets an A for effort here, but it's simply the wrong actress for the part.Allison Janney, on the otherhand, is damn near perfect as Tonya's mother, Lavona. As she chain smokes and swears through the entire first half of the movie, we get a real clear insight into how Tonya turns out the way she did. That Lavona is cold and hard is real enough, but she also gave as much of herself to Tonya as she could afford to give without losing her own identity. Her methods were often crude, but her motives seemed, to me, honest. Janney succeeded in playing a very complex character without dominating her scenes. She was, in fact, a Mother.I, Tonya is not a perfect movie. At times it doesn't seem to know whether it is a tragedy or a comedy - and works at being both. When it presents violence, which is frequent and fundamental to the story, it sometimes does so with intended comic effect. That can become disorienting to the viewer. Combine that with the almost documentary tone, and the frequent audience asides, and you have a work that is both interesting and challenging to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A Fascinating Biography that Never takes itself Too Seriously,","I, Tonya is a great movie with a very well written plot and a tremendous cast. While it is a very fascinating, well told biography and the character's hardships are felt almost as soon as the film starts, I must also applaud this film for never taking itself too seriously. It has a very fun, flamboyant flow and a lot of moments are unexpectedly hilarious, including several parts where Margot Robbie breaks the fourth wall and talks to the audience, making it a very fresh take on a true story.I will say that the film did feel a little overstuffed at times with too many big ideas that some elements did fall flat. Running at 120 minutes, it jumps around to the main plot to the people being interviewed, which can get confusing for viewers, and it derails from the story a little too often.The cast is all around terrific, the main credit going to, of course, Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan and Allison Janney, who all transform in to these parts with great depth, being completely unlike their real life selves. Despite playing generally unlikeable people, they do manage to add layers to them that helps us connect with them on a human level.Interesting and refreshing.

"Average Film, Nothing Special","I felt compelled to write a quick review based on the number of glowing 10/10 reviews I'm seeing on here. Maybe everything is 10/10 now, and that's just the times we live in, but for me a 10 is a masterpiece of film, a seminal film. ""I, Tonya"" is nowhere close to that. I found it to be an enjoyable bit of nostalgia that was sadly a bit lacking in emotional impact.I personally disliked the fake-documentary style of the film, and found that this had the opposite of it's intended effect: it took me out of the film and made it seem more fake. It reminded me I was watching a film recreation of actual events, instead of being able to just enjoy the story for what it was.About 3/4 way through the film I started to lose interest. I knew where it was going to go and there were no surprises. If you are interested in the Tonya Harding story and pine for some 90's nostalgia (which I thought could have been emphasized more), then I would recommend this film to you, but sorry folks, ""I, Tonya"" is not the second coming of ""The Godfather.""",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A bio-pic with original structure and superlative performances,"""I, Tonya"" is an interesting bio-pic for few reasons. First of all it does not have the same structure of a lot of bio-pics Hollywood is producing because it is structured as an interview to the protagonists and the whole film is like the reconstruction of a documentary. This is fundamental because the movie is honest in reporting the different points of view without choosing a crystal clear side. Indeed the structure mentioned before allows the filmmakers to place here and there hints that a character is telling the story accurately or that maybe he/she isn't, leaving the viewer with the doubt. This is a great merit because on one side it seems fair to all the people involved, and on the other side it stays true to a story which each details are still not known exactly. Furthermore the various hints makes you speculate, reproducing in a way what the media did in 1994. And so in a way we as the public ""abuse"" of famous people and their shady sides for our entertainment, a concept expressed by the protagonist during one of the fake interviews during the movie.As far as the technicality goes the movie is great, the performances are excellent, the music solid.

A Mixture Of Jarring And Brilliant,"There's much to enjoy here - especially Allison Janney's and Margot Robbie's towering performances as mother and daughter. I was also struck by the cinematography of the skating sequences, which was visceral and beautiful at the same time. I was disquieted by the tone, however; I can understand the comedic edge, given the essential absurdity of much that happened. But when that comedy plays round, and occasionally bleeds over in to, the edges of elements of the story of domestic violence, it jars and feels distasteful.

"Margot Robbie is fantastic in a film that flashy, blunt, and unapologetically crude","Margot Robbie has had a pretty big climb to fame in the past few years. She kicked off her Hollywood career in 2013 with The Wolf of Wall Street, then made a splashy cameo in Adam McKay's 2015 hit The Big Short. She then achieved A-list status in 2016 with Suicide Squad and The Legend of Tarzan. Now in 2017, she's hitting the awards circuit with I, Tonya, in which she plays the infamous figure skater Tonya Harding. Her performance is the highlight of the film, which is a semi-autobiographical story about one of America's most beloved and most hated athletes.The film opens with interviews from Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie), her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan), and her mother LaVona Golden (Allison Janney). The interviews are taking place about a decade after the ""incident"" and are intended as a way for each of the characters to tell their version of what happened. In between the interviews we are treated to the story of how Tonya grew up as a redneck figure skater in Oregon. We witness her rough upbringing at the hands of her mother and how it affected her skating. After that, we see her meteoric rise to superstardom, all of which is constantly in jeopardy because of her rocky relationship with her simpleton of a husband, Jeff. And finally, the moment you've all been waiting for, the Nancy Kerrigan incident. We watch it go down, the due process immediately after, and how Tonya got caught up in a mess of stupidity.What I can say is that this film doesn't do anything wrong, it just does everything adequate or well. The handling of the story through interviews and flashbacks does well at establishing the chaos and insanity since each character gives conflicting reports as to what actually happened. The film also uses the fourth wall to have Tonya interact with the audience and extend the autobiographical nature of the story. However, the interviews lose steam about halfway through and are left dormant until the very end. It felt weird since they were heavily used in the beginning and are made to seem like the central medium for telling the story.Director Craig Gillespie uses stylish editing and camera tricks to keep the story flowing at a quick and breezy pace. Some scenes are oversaturated with them, but overall the tricks serve their purpose well.The behind the scenes work does a nice job at establishing a feel for the 80's and 90's. The hairstyles and fashion are timely and will make anyone who lived in that period feel nostalgic.Last and most importantly, the performances carry this film all the way to the very end. Margot Robbie is astonishing as Tonya. She has the perfect mix of looks, personality, and skill to pull off the role. She plays Harding perfectly at every point in her career, especially at the lowest.Allison Janney is also great as Tonya's cold and unloving mother, LaVona. Janney goes full out in makeup and chain-smoking, giving an authentic portrayal of a mother that will never be satisfied with her children.Sebastian Stan gives a good, but not great performance as Jeff. He does his best to make Jeff his own, but unfortunately gets overshadowed by Robbie and Janney. On a positive note, Stan shows off a wide range of emotions as Jeff slowly turns from a dumb nice guy to a violent madman.I, Tonya delivers an entertaining and original way to tell a story that is well known by almost everybody alive. While it's a good film caught in a time of great films, Robbie and Janney give career-defining performances that make this film deserving of your time.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sort of a Sad Parody,"I didn't enjoy this movie. Sometimes I like the docudrama style, but in this case, it seemed more like a substitute for a real script.. I thought the characters were one dimensional and the docudrama script was pretty uninspired.But mostly I found the movie to be a sad parody of Harding as she was portrayed by much of the media at the time. I followed the story with mild interest, and without strong feelings about any of it--not pro-Kerrigan, not pro-Harding, nor with any guesses as to what actually happened. That said, Harding never struck me as anything like the (as another reviewer put it) ""white trash hillbilly"" the media tried to portray her as, any more than Kerrigan stuck me as the smug ice queen, although it seemed there could have easily been some truth at the core of both portrayals.I thought the movie portrayed Harding as far harder and trashier than she came across at the time. I remember her more as unpolished than trashy, and with an underlying vulnerability that the movie talked about, but which I didn't think Robbie ever conveyed. I saw it even in the brief film clips of the real Harding at the end, but perhaps that's just because I remember her that way.The movie seemed to be trying to give a more balanced portrayal of Harding than the media had at the time.

A bizarre true story that makes for a fun ride,"A story so bizarre it could only be true, the tale of Olympic figure skater and American cult figure Tonya Harding makes for one of recent memories most purely enjoyable and fast-paced experiences in Million Dollar Arm director Craig Gillespie's Coen Brothers like adventure of dumb criminals, talented sportspersons and dragon like mothers.A passion project that was instigated and spearheaded by its Oscar nominated star and producer Margot Robbie, I, Tonya quite clearly represents a product that was developed by a unified cast and crew and this pitch black comedy that deals with some fairly confronting and at times in your face issues of domestic violence and childhood traumas is an absolute blast to sit through.Capturing the time and place of Harding's upbringing in the late 80's, through to her rise to fame for the right and many wrong reasons in the early 90's, as her quest to become the number 1 in her sport took her down many dark and publicly prominent paths, Gillespie instils his film with a real sense of purpose that's heralded in by some committed and duly recognised performances from its main cast members.Shedding her image as a beauty of the screen, Australian superstar Robbie excels in her first legitimate headlining role and is utterly convincing as the rough and ready Harding.Tasked with inhabiting Harding as a teenager, a young twenty year old year and also in documentary like style as an older more life-worn version of the unfortunate soul, Robbie has with this role grown as an actress and showcased an ability to disappear into a role when the situation requires it.Surrounded by an hilarious Alison Janney as Harding's cold-hearted parrot loving mother LaVona Golden, Sebastian Stan in his best role yet as Harding's often detestable husband Jeff Gillooly and Paul Walter Hauser as Jeff's grotesque best friend Shawn Eckardt, I, Tonya has assembled quite the cast to elevate itself above the usual biopic fair, even if Gillespie's film can be accused of covering similar ground a few too many times as the runtime pushes on.Before finalising ones thoughts on I,Tonya, it would be remiss to talk about Gillespie's film without making special mention of Walter Hauser as wannabe criminal mastermind Shawn.One of the most memorable dumb criminals of recent memory, who isn't too far removed from a Walter Sobchak like figure of this story, many of I,Tonya's most laugh out loud and memorable moments stem from the sweaty presence of Shawn, who has a much higher opinion of himself and his abilities than he should ever have cared to conjure up. Each time his on screen, the laughs will follow and seeing real life footage of Eckhardt during the post-film credits sequence gives a you a real appreciation for just how good Walter Hauser is in his role.Final Say -I, Tonya is a real riot of a film, featuring an abundance of great performances and cast chemistry. Gillespie has crafted a truly original biopic that mixes in laughs, shocks and drama and while it at times loses some of its steam in the 2nd half of proceedings, when I, Tonya hits its groove, it's a rollicking good time.4 taped over Star Trek episodes out of 5",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Brilliant Actors Transform A Smug, Shallow, Insulting Script","I heard so much hype about this movie that I was a little disappointed by the end result. There's no question that Margot Robbie is a stunning success as Tonya Harding. Margot captures all sides of Tonya, making her brave, tragic, funny, seductive, innocent, deeply flawed and yet amazingly strong all at the same time. Sebastian Stan is almost as brilliant as Tonya's husband Jeff, a dim bulb who genuinely loves his wife but has to idea how to prove his loyalty except through stupid schemes and shiftless behavior. Even Paul Hauser is remarkably effective as Sean Eckhardt, the fat and brutal yet strangely childlike simpleton who unwittingly destroys both Jeff and Tonya.Allison Janney as Tonya's mom, Lavona . . . well, here's where I deviate from the conventional wisdom. To me, Allison's performance rang hollow all the way through. There was no nuance, no texture. Just meanness and cruelty without any room for any kind of insight or humanity. It wasn't like watching Gloria Swanson play Norma Desmond in SUNSET BOULEVARD. Gloria Swanson never let you forget that this woman really was a star once, and that her love for the fans (""those wonderful people out there in the dark"") the movies and for acting was sincere. None of that cancelled out Norma Desmond's murderous hate and her manipulation . . . but it made her human, and therefore believable. That never happened with this character.But it's not really Allison Janney's fault. The problem with this movie is that though the acting is brilliant, the writing and direction are geared more towards lazy cheap shots than real insight. How many times can you tell us that rednecks are stupid and mean? Do we really need to see a Ronald Reagan poster in the fat boy's living room? Ask yourself another question. If this movie were about an Asian mother trying to make her daughter into a doctor, would anyone describe the character as a monster?Another disappointment was the crude soundtrack, overstuffed with classic Seventies rock. I love that music. I grew up with it. But the film makers don't use it effectively. You get the impression that to them the music itself is a joke. Now and then they hit the right note, match the song to the mood in just the right way. (""Shooting Star"" by Bad Company tells Tonya's story better than the movie.) But much of the time it just feels gimmicky, and fake. (""Those rednecks and their dumb music . . . why can't they listen to the Beatles and Bob Dylan like civilized people?"")A lot of the class hatred in this movie feels forced and calculated, meant to please today's elites. The idea is something like, Tonya's type are trash, they're the ones who voted for Trump. Let's laugh at how stupid they are! But that sort of reasoning rarely makes things better. ""They"" voted for Trump. ""They"" killed Christ. ""They"" stabbed us in the back at Versailles. That's the spirit that drives this movie, and even though the actors are sensational, they can't quite overcome the meanness of the script.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Flawed film - Boring as bio-pic, underwhelming as a dark-comedy","""I, Tonya"" spends too much of its (119 min) time focused on Harding's personal life, while never delving very seriously into her psychology or personality. Basically, movie doesn't try hard enough to understand its fascinating subject. In the first half of the film - which charts her meteoric rise - it truly feels like skating is a joyous escape from an otherwise frightening life. But then the story's focus shifts to the attack on her competitor Nancy Kerrigan, and that compelling narrative quickly gets lost. Actually, film may feel like a bullet point presentation of Harding's 20-year figure skating career from age 4 to age 24, while depiction of working class life in Portland, Oregon is mostly quite shallow.

Scorsese-ish with a female lead character,"As someone born in Mexico in 1995, I approached this movie completely unbiased and unaware of all the media circus surrounding the Tonya Harding controversy in the 90's, that most americans are familiar with. Maybe it was this emotional distance that allowed me to fully enjoy the movie and just let the characters take me through a story that was completely new to me.
My opinion about Tonya Harding now is that she is a fighter. Someone with the sensibility to love a graceful and beautiful sport such as figure-skating, who, at the same time, had to grow a very thick skin and toughen up to endure all the rough stuff that life (and especially those closer to her) kept throwing at her.This is a different kind of sports film. There isn't a big final competition where the underdog beats the odds and wins, with a happy ending. It's more about Tonya's personal and domestic life than it is about her as an athlete. 
Characters constantly break the fourth wall and all the humor is very dark, as it invites you to laugh at the violence between the character's interactions.You can see the influence of Martin Scorsese in the filmakers' choice of story, music and cinematography. Here, instead of a real-life inspired male lead character who is violent, we get the story of a female lead character who is violent as a result of the violence inflicted upon her first by her mother and later, her husband.I really enjoyed the perfomance of all the main actors, especially Margot Robbie, Allison Janney and Sebastian Stan. I thought Margot made Tonya a compelling and sympathetic character; Sebastian was good and believable as the nightmarish husband; Janney made the most out of her supporting character and gave a very strong performance.I would recommend the movie to those who enjoy black humor and aren't easily offended by depictions of domestic violence and profanity. 
Also, it's probably more enjoyable for those who are a bit emotionally distant from the Tonya Harding story and have a more open mind about it. 
For some, it might even change your opinion about her or -as in my case- make it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not A Dull Moment In The House,"We have now come full circle with the life and times of the one and only Tonya Harding.I very much remember the actual footage and news stories and relentless pursuit of her movements.Tonya the champion. Tonya the conniving participant in evil deeds. Tonya the celebrity joke. Tonya the hated.The first half of the movie very efficiently converts the hard-scrabble world of Tonyas' daily beat-downs from a hell bent mother, well meaning but idiot husband, and a small collection of his single-digit I.Q. associates into palpable comedy.We actually receive guilt free laughs as Tonya and her husband Jeff pound on one another, delivering blood and bruises while shoving each other's heads through walls and shattering mirrors.The formula works, considering a lot of it probably did happen. Before this, I had no idea how deep her red-neck roots went.Imagine the Bundys from the old ""Married with Children"" TV show except with genuine violence, alcohol abuse, and firearms... you get the idea.The second half delves into mostly tangible drama as Tonya's world is permanently unraveled by bumbling, delusional fools who fancy themselves real live black-ops agents and 'cleaners'.As the buffoonery and drama fades into the end credits featuring footage of the real Tonya at work on the ice, your heart strings will be tugged on more than a little bit in hopes the once brief American Legend has found peace.And a big fat check in the mail.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Quite The Biopic,"I've watched quite a lot of biopics, including; Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocketman, Elvis, The Theory of Everything, and Hacksaw Ridge, all quite amazing films, which I am incredibly happy with. I believe it's incredibly important for biopics to be very well made with care and caution because these are real people, significant and noteworthy people who have affected and made history within their industries. But coming back to I, Tonya, I had absolutely no prior knowledge of this entire incident, the only pieces of content surrounding this event and film was some of the promo they did back in 2017. This being the interviews with Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan, and Allison Janey, all great actors with performances in this film that reflected that. This film, I believe, balanced its humor, violence, and set pieces, it felt a lot more real this way and grounded in reality.The format of this film is something I do really want to highlight because it is integral to how good the film was in my opinion. The film is centred around these series of interviews with the actors playing the real people; Margot Robbie playing an older Tonya Harding, Sebastian Stan as an older Jeff Gillooly, Alisson Janey as an older LaVona Golden, Julianne Nicholson as an older Diane Rowlinson, Paul Walter Hauser as Shawn, and even Bobby Cannavale as Martin Maddox. I thought this format of these characters explaining and briefly giving their opinions on the events of Tonya's life, was very interesting especially because there are so many people that were involved and made an impact on Tonya's life.The acting performances were good, and from the footage I've seen of the real people, really captured the likeness of those people. The main cast was especially impressive for me; Sebastian Stan in his performance felt real and a person with depth to him, Julianne Donaldson showed a certain calmness and intimidating composure, Margot Robbie was excellent, she showed passion and you could feel the care she had for the role. However I do believe that my favorite performance in the film was from Alison Janey. She blew me away, her performance was so convincing and every scene she was in was interesting and she manipulated my emotions throughout the film.The pacing for this film was also very good, it felt natural and each event/ period in Tonya's life felt like there was a proportional amount of time given. Although it didn't jump right out to me straight after I watched the film, in writing this review it occurred to me that it was very well paced, and even though long it felt like it did do justice to Tonya Harding's life.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Comedic tragedy, or tragicomedy?","The story of Tonya Harding is painted as a tragicomedy, maybe a comedic tragedy, as we watch a story self-admittedly ""full of boobs."" Tonya is abused by her mother and husband in nearly every way possible for her entire life, stopping short of plain torture.There's some digging into what is truth, what is exploitation, and how the spectacle can feed on globalized media sensations of disfigured skaters. There's little more than a little digging into these deeper topics, because the centerpiece is Tonya, the unlikely white-trash star who proved them all wrong, all of them, a desire built upon hate of everything and everyone, surely due to nurture not nature.The hanging, nagging question is whether Tonya would have had any success as a figure skater if she had grown up in a supporting, loving household. Could it have then been nature not nurture? The unlikely series of boobs and their actions led to an international feeding frenzy, to be usurped by O.J. Simpson's white Bronco ride.The skating scenes fall with an intoxicating beauty, and Margot Robbie's own face paints the iconic binary masks of tragicomedy, defiant against all on-comers. It was never just about the skating, though, and the pace is unfortunately persistently jogged with breaking of the fourth wall, and light-hearted glibness which downplays and mutes the scenes of inexcusable abuse.You, Tonya, you had the stuff of spectacle, the same stuff the spectacle devours for fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Tonya, we owe you an apology","Besides being a really good movie, meaning the acting was strong, the plot moves to a kicking soundtrack and I laughed out loud, I was genuinely surprised to learn the heartache that Tonya Harding had to endure growing up. ""I Tonya"" is a great depiction of a woman who, unbeknownst to America, didn't have the ""typical"" life of what we all think is the clean, happy life of an Olympic skater. Why? Our beloved media of course! Look at all of our skating representatives: oh so pretty and so innocent! So says the media.
 When the ""incident"" happened back in the early 90's, us onlookers of course, well, looked. We didn't have the internet back then, which clearly sets this story apart than other true stories. We didn't have Nancy Kerrigan or anyone else tweeting 24/7. We had ""Hard Copy."" Oh wait...we had the major networks too! They controlled the narrative and my goodness did they dig for dirt at every turn. We relied on their stories to frame our perspective. Why was Tonya vilified? Was this the start of our tabloid television? Why yes...if you look closely at the television set near the end...there is a peculiar figure on it...
 These issues are at the heart of ""I Tonya"" and are relevant. I owe Tonya a huge apology...I had no idea Mrs. Harding. I hope the rest of your life is a happy one and I will forgive you if you want to give us all the bird.

"Talented skater, wrong side of tracks","7.4 stars.Whaddya gonna do? Tonya was one of the greatest female figure skaters ever, especially in the 90's, but she had the unfortunate fate of having an awful upbringing and a bunch of miserable people in her life. I suppose it had to happen to someone at some point in the sport of figure skating. My guess is that there have been many skaters who started off like Tonya, poor, less fortunate, trailer trash etc. The only difference is none of them ever made it to the big time like she, because Tonya had a particular motivation to be the best. You might be convinced that she had nothing to do with Kerrigan's injury, but we will never really know.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Intelligent, unconventional and highly entertaining","What I know about the world of ice-skating wouldn't fill the back of a postage stamp. I'm familiar with Torvill and Dean's famous gold-medal winning routine at the 1984 Winter Olympics, but that's probably because I'm British and have seen their performance repeated during near enough every Olympic event since. Craig Gillespie's I, Tonya doesn't care if you like ice skating or not, because as soon as its troubled protagonist Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie) hits the ice to the likes of Cliff Richard's Devil Woman and ZZ Top's Sleeping Bag, you'll be too caught up in the action, which are comparable to Baby Driver's car chase scenes, to care. But of course, if you know anything about Tonya Harding at all, you'll know this could never be just about ice skating.One of my biggest gripes with biopics is the issue of historical accuracy and artistic license. Often a film can resemble a moving Wikipedia page as a result, and the other times it can be accused of glorifying its subject. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I, Tonya plays with this idea by admitting its based on questionable statements, and so tries to film it all to let the audience decide for themselves. Tonya, her mother LaVona (Allison Janney), her abusive husband Jeff (Sebastian Stan), security guard Shawn (Paul Walter Hauser), and a handful of others who were caught up in the whole Nancy Kerrigan debacle, all give their testimonies to camera as the action jumps back and forth in time. Characters sometimes break the fourth wall to outright deny what we're seeing is true, and this playful, fast-moving approach is what gives I, Tonya its zing. It reminded me of Adam McKay's excellent The Big Short, which also featured Robbie talking to camera.Saying that, the film clearly has more sympathy for Tonya than it does for the abusers and low-lives around her. Born into a white-trash community with a sharp-tongued, bully of a mother looking after her, Tonya felt compelled to skate from a very young age. Trainer Diane Rawlinson (Julianne Nicholson) doesn't train girls of her age, but soon changes her mind after meeting LaVona and seeing the 4 year-old come alive on the ice. At 15, she is one of the best skaters in the U.S., and one of a few who can pull off a triple axel jump. She is the only one to brave it in competition as well, but despite her abilities, the judges refuse to warm to her unconventional music and clothing choices, and general 'white trash' reputation. Against her mother's wishes, she starts to date Jeff, who quickly becomes abusive whenever Tonya speaks up. She pushes on anyway, trying to reinvent herself in order to meet the expectations of a snobby sport.Of course, the action builds up to the attack on rival skater Nancy Kerrigan, an incident that shocked the sporting world and is still surrounded by controversy. As for Tonya's level of involvement, that's for you to decide. Gillespie's film could be accused of ignoring one of the victims caught up in the story, but to have focused more attention on Kerrigan could have taken the action away from Tonya, whose film this is. As for the performances, they are stellar across the board. It's a shame Margot Robbie wasn't up against such a formidable opponent in Frances McDormand for this year's Academy Awards, as her transformation here would have surely seen her take home a golden statue most other years. Janney and Stan are excellent too, with both managing to squeeze some sympathy out of their loathsome schemers, and Hauser appears to have wondered in from another movie until you see the real-life footage of Shawn at the end credits. I, Tonya is an intelligent, unconventional, highly entertaining and darkly funny re-telling of a difficult subject matter, with a knockout performance at its centre.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""There's no such thing as truth...""","""There's no such thing as truth... Everyone has their own truth."" I, Tonya exploded into the public's eye in 2017 and proved itself one of the best sport biopics of the last 20 years. Relying on the unreliable narration of disgraced figure skater Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie), we find ourselves lost in the classist struggle, abuse, and self-inflicted torment that turned arguably the most talented of skater in the world into the butt of a generation's jokes.Margot Robbie is fantastic in her representation of Harding. Spunky, yet oddly disciplined, Robbie works best by highlighting Harding's own malaise and disregard to her surroundings. The only poor note in Robbie's performance is that one can easily see tinges of Harley Quinn in Tonya. This makes the performance feel slightly ingenuine, but still, this is not a reason to skip a viewing.From a narrative perspective, I found it captivating that the screenwriter tackled Tonya's story not by fabricating a grandiose imagination of the true events. Rather, writer Steven Rogers offers up the story from Harding's perspective, almost in documentary format. This allows us to truly feel her pain. It begs us to empathize with her choices as she clamors to make a name for herself despite everyone playing down her talent and place in the refined world of competitive figure skating. And by doing all this, we see how warped and godless the events surrounding Harding's exile from skating, how we are guilty for jumping to our media-driven conclusions.Go find I, Tonya and devote two and a half hours to it. If not for Robbie's acting chops and Rogers' expert screenwriting, enjoy the amount of legitimate training Robbie put into learning to skate like Tony Harding did. Sit back, grab the popcorn, and let the villainy ensue.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Fantastic engaging story incorporating multiple accounts,"I love this film having watched it several times. It is a great 'story', that integrates multiple perspectives, with an excellent cast and acting. The breaking of the fourth wall (where the characters talk to the audience through the camera) made this more engaging and effective.Portraying real events is difficult due to the multitude of human perspectives (which they gained from real interviews) and the lack of one 'true' account. This film overcomes that inability to 'know what really happened' by integrating the different accounts all at the one time to create a complicated (but easy to follow!) narrative. It's thoroughly engaging.Robbie is fantastic at playing Tonya as is Stan as her husband Jeff. Even the actor portraying Jeff's friend is great as the pathetically delusional 'bodyguard'.Obviously the lack of Kerrigan's perspective (the victim) is a gap but also understandable. Why on earth would she want to be involved in this project?One thing I did get from watching this is that the ice skating world is prejudiced and harsh. It does seem like Tonya had an uphill battle from the start due to her disadvantaged and 'non wholesome' lifestyle for which she appeared to be punished in scoring despite her talent.While Kerrigan was the victim in this, so too was Tonya - at least in her life and career - this film makes me sad at the tragedy of her life circumstances that shaped her experiences.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Do we get nearer the truth,"I guess like a lot of people who watch ""I, Tonya"" I can remember the events surrounding Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan pretty well. This movie is focussed on these events from the viewpoint of Tonya Harding. You can't help wondering exactly what the truth is behind the story and only the people who were actually involved will ever really know. The movie tells the story of Tonya via and interview and little snippets of her life story. Some of the domestic violence scenes portrayed are quite raw and she certainly endured some very difficult relationships in her life.The skating scenes are really nicely shot and Margot Robbie does a pretty good job in the lead. Allison Janney steals the show playing Tonya's mother and was well worthy of the supporting actress award. The good thing is that she does get quite a lot of screen time as well.

"Brilliant performances, never slowed down.","This has been on my watchlist for a while now. I heard both good and poor things about this film, mostly concerning it's representation of Tonya Harding. Despite what I've heard, I went into this with a relatively open mind. I'm glad I got around to watching this film because it was quite entertaining to watch.Starting with the acting, there is not a single noticeable weak performance in this entire film. Margot Robbie was amazing and played Tonya Harding to near perfection. Her chemistry with Sebastian Stan was great, and every time they were on screen together it was enthralling to watch their relationship slowly devolve. However, Allison Janney totally steals the show. She does an amazing job at playing LaVona, an important figure in Tonya's life. She really brings the character to life in every single scene she's in, Janney indefinitely gave a flawless performance.The directing was pretty great. I'm happy to see that Craig Gillespie attempted to give this movie it's own visual flare and style. Some of the artistic choices worked really well while others, not so much. I wasn't a big fan of them constantly breaking the fourth wall, while it made sense it definitely broke my engagement in the story. Sometimes they use it for comedic effect but most of the time it fell flat on it's face. I also wasn't a big fan of the sheer amount of music choices. There are so many songs they use in the movie which are only there for like thirty seconds. Some of the music was inappropriate and unnecessary, fortunately it didn't ruin too many scenes.The writing was on par with the directing. I, Tonya had a quick pace and never slowed down to tell this amazing and interesting story. Some of the jokes felt forced, but for the most part it feels like a documentary and really long flashback, which is what I believe Steven Rogers went for.For the skating scenes they superimposed Margot Robbie's face over a stunt double and it looks quite obvious in the movie. I wish more of the budget went into the effects so that the superimposing looked more convincing. There's the obvious overabundance of songs, making it feel forced.Overall, it's enjoyable. This movie felt heavily inspired by Wolf of Wall Street, and if you liked that movie then you'll probably find something here. They did a pretty good job of portraying her career, even though some of it feels either exaggerated or fabricated. Regardless of painting Tonya Harding as the victim in all this, I, Tonya was very entertaining.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Just leave me alone....for now!,"This movie is definitely about dysfunction and don't worry, you'll get your fill.
This movie depicts the true story of sk8ter girl Tonya Harding who in a quest to achieve the American Dream attacks her figure skating opponent Nancy Kerrigan in order to secure a spot on the US Olympic figure skating team.
The story is compelling and the actors do a fantastic job in their roles as perhaps the dumbest tools to ever draw breathe.
Margo Robbie is able to carry the load as Tonya and Janney, Hauser and Stan are spot on in their portrayals of mean spirited, low down white trash.
I know, it sounds like I didn't like it.....but I did. It will be hard to forget and is an enjoyable watch.

Solid Black Comedy With an Intriguing Backdrop,"Firstly, the only actual complaint I see about this movie is from people that claim it's inaccurate. If that is your complaint, way to miss the point, dumb dumb.This movie is a black comedy, the comedy of which centers primarily on the fact that the filmmakers employed the services of completely unreliable narrators. Basing their script off actual interviews with the key players involved, including Tonya, her ex-husband and her mother, the filmmakers make no claim that the events unfolding in the film represent the 100% true story. Instead, it's the story told by people with a very clear stake in how they're represented, and the attitudes of these people in addition to their different interpretations of the same events is exactly what makes it funny and interesting.And interesting it is, even for someone like me who has been very invested in the story for as long as I've known about it. I mean just think about the absurdity of it: a woman consistently portrayed as white trash seemingly calling in a mafia-style attack on her rival figure skater. Her rival... figure skater. How has it taken this long for a comedy to be made based on this?! It writes itself.And to make it even better, the story is far from that simple. There are many debates even to this day about whether or not Tonya Harding knew what was going down or if she had any involvement whatsoever. You will certainly see many interpretations of that night's events in that film. But as mentioned, these are interpretations from wildly unreliable sources and while that supplies the comedy and intrigue in spades, it certainly doesn't provide concrete answers. That's what makes it kind of brilliant. This is a black comedy film based on the Harding/Kerrigan Saga. Not a 30 for 30 special.And let's make no mistake. This film puts the black in black comedy. This deals with heavy subjects, especially to do with abuse, both mental and physical, from parents, children and spouses alike. And while it will often give these moments the emotional gravitas that it deserves, the film will just as often treat them strangely light-heartedly. The expectation of a dark subject being treated respectfully, only for the rug to be pulled out from it in seemingly careless fashion, is the crux of a lot of the humor here. By black comedy standards, it's all rather tame. But people who don't have a dark sense of humor and are unused to that style may find themselves offended. To this I would normally say nut up and learn how to take a joke, but instead I'm gonna be nice and just leave a fair warning.Now that the disclaimer is out of the way, I should definitely talk about some stand-out performances. First of course, is Margot Robbie, who is rapidly making a case for being called a superstar. Between standing out from the mediocrity in Suicide Squad to deliver a pretty definitive version of Harley Quinn, to now playing a tough-as-nails redneck figure skater in Tonya Harding, the Australian bombshell has displayed a range befitting much more seasoned veterans. She does a great job here being everything from funny and relatable to broken and miserable and it's truly something watching her go to work.Who I especially want to sing the praises of, however is Allison Janney, who's portrayal of Tonya's damaged mother is a sight to behold. Janney is completely unrecognizable here, marvelously portraying a woman who truly thinks she is doing her best but is ultimately poisoning her daughter with perpetual verbal and physical abuse. Listening to real interviews with Tonya Harding makes it very clear how much contempt she has for her mother, and looking at Janney's performance you can very easily see why. She was absolutely wonderful here, and pretty hilarious in her own right when it was called for.At the end of the day what we have here is an endlessly intriguing and hilarious depiction of one of the most brutal -and funniest- sagas in the history of athletic competition. I highly recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Sardonically bleak and brutally honest; a difficult piece despite its generally upbeat telling and moments of genuine (black) humour.,"'I, Tonya (2018)' is inspired by real events but makes no qualms about its contradictory nature, instead focusing on showing the story from all sides possible, and is told through a fast, frenzied and frankly odd mix of traditional non-linear, narration-heavy film-making interspersed with fairly regular to-camera interviews (recreations of real-life footage on which the whole affair is based) and occasional fourth wall breaks. It's a sardonic, sad and, at times, difficult picture despite its occasional moments of (black) humour, actually ending up quite a bleak and brutally honest piece that leaves a bitter aftertaste of melancholic regret with a distinct hint of unfortunate inevitability. Don't expect a laugh-a-minute riot, because this is a reflexive and ultimately sombre story despite its generally upbeat telling. It's compelling stuff. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great movie - funny and emotional,"The life story of Tonya Harding, champion ice-skater. From her life as a young child to teenager to adult life everything centred on ice-skating. Then came the Nancy Kerrigan incident...Great movie. Could have easily been a fairly dry paint-by-numbers biopic but writer Steven Rogers and director Craig Gillespie infuse the movie with humour and lightness giving it a great deal of energy and engagement. There's also a character-based side to it, especially in terms of how Harding's mother shapes her personality and views on life. This leads her to accept the abusive, dysfunctional relationship with Jeff Gillooly, her first husband, which brings about her downfall.The light tone does change from a point, and it is a bit disconcerting. As things get more criminal, the lightness is replaced by a seriousness and the movie starts to resemble more the conventional biopic one would have expected. There is still a degree of humour: the bodyguard and the hired thugs take stupidity to another level (and, by the looks of things, this wasn't dramatized - they were really that dumb).However, the come-down from the energy and comedy of the first half does make for an uneasy transition. There was no way round it though - it would have been inappropriate to maintain the level of frivolity considering what happens.Ultimately the transition works out well, as the movie ends very emotionally.Superb performances by Margot Robbie as Tonya Harding and Allison Janney as her mother. Robbie would not have seemed the right person to play an uneducated, working class, incredibly intense, foul-mouthed competitor with hordes of demons but she pulls it off with aplomb. Well deserved her Best Actress Oscar nomination.Allison Janney won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance and the choice is hard to fault.

"I, Margot","I, Tonya is a movie about Tonya Harding, professional figure skater who became popular because of the rivarly with Nancy Kerrigan and incident that made her charged for. That situation made Tonya one of the most popular people in USA.This movie fulfiled my expectation in terms of biographical segment and learning about this case. Margot Robbie portrayal of Tonya is amazing and we can say this is the best performance so far for Margot. She showed different personalities of the main character from childhood to the final performance in the Olympics 1994. Tonya was so unique and she had specific relationships with two of her biggest support and in the same time stumbling stones in her career, her mother and husband.
Another pleasant suprise is Allison Janey who just won Golden Globe and will be in the Oscar race. Allison plays Tonya Hardings mother LaVona woman with really strange and sometimes harsh behaviour towards her daghter but in some way she pushed her to be good as she was.
Craig Gillespie is director of this movie and he decided to shoot this movie in a little bit cartoonish way but thats what makes this movie funny sometimes. My problem with this movie is that some scenes or should say some situations was repeated so many times in the similar way esspecially towars her relationship with husband Jeff played by Sebastian Stan. 
This movie is divided in two parts, first part refers to getting to know characters and second is about incident and resolving that case. Second part wants to show us how regular people can be stucked in complicated situation similiar to movie Fargo (1996) but this is where that cartoonish shots is the problem because we cant experience that incident and lawsuit seriously and all looks strange in the end but that is risk when you make a movie about famous person and cases of the past.
This movie with all his advantages and disadvantages is decent maybe not what i expected to be but on the other side its not 
disappointment. Margot is the star of this movie and she is big reason why this movie is good and why we will remember Tonya Harding character and personality.
I give this movie 7.7",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Thumbs Up For Robbie's Performance,"The reason to recommend this movie is Margot Robbie who performed exceptionally well as she portrays Tonya Harding. The movie stamps the acclamation and versatility of Robbie as an actor. The whole drama is well drafted which centers around Tonya the talented but problematic and disturbed individual constantly tries to prove herself, supported well by Allison Janney as her mother for which she claimed the Academy Award for her supporting actress along with others with the same category. Margrot Robbie also got several awards for the best leading role but unfortunately lost Oscar from France McDormand at 90th Academy Awards.
A film might look a bit stretched due to the story built-up but for the performances it worth's a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
PORTRAIT OF A MODERN DAY AUTO-DE-FE,"I, Tonya (Directed by Craig Gillespie and written by Steven Rogers) is a ground-breaking new film about the unstated class system in America.I, Tonya is that rare movie that puts you, the audience, into the center of what the movie is about.I, Tonya tells the story of what really happened when a world-class ice skater from the wrong side of the tracks had her main rival whacked, literally.I, Tonya tries to do for film what Picasso did for art and William Faulkner did for the novel - to capture reality from more than one side, one point of view.OK, this movie works on so many levels, every time I started to write this review, I kept changing it. So I decided to use all of them because that is what this movie is about: reality in all of its many dimensions.The story is simple and one that many of you will remember. Tonya Harding (Margo Robbie) was a great American ice skating champion who was the first woman to do a triple axel (three and a half rotations) during a competition. Nancy Kerrigan (Caitlin Carver) was a great American ice skating champion and in direct competition with Harding for the Ice Skating Champion of the 1994 Olympics. One day, coming from practice, Kerrigan is whacked in the knee by an unknown assailant.What is not so simple is the world that Harding came from. Her mother (Allison Janney) is one of the great Dearest Mommy mothers ever portrayed in film. And she even hits Nancy with a hair brush. The more success Nancy has, the more her mother insists that it is because she pushed and slammed and even knifed Nancy to be the best.When Nancy meets Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan), she is only 15 years old, but she desperately needs someone to love her and Jeff is it. Sadly, he, too, cannot keep his slaps and punches to himself and worse, he is not too bright. When Nancy tells her mother that she and Jeff are going to be married, her mother advises, ""Jeff has a friend who is even dumber than he is, Sean (Paul Walter Hauser). When Nancy gets a death threat just before the American championships, Sean suggests that they get back at Tonya's biggest competitor, Nancy Kerrigan, by doing the same to her. From such stupid, small ideas comes a scandal that made tabloid news seep into mainstream news so that today, one cannot tell one from the other. In 1994, Tonya became the second most recognized person in the world behind President Bill Clinton.The story is told by the major characters in interview format that is inter-spliced with action scenes of what is being described. Director Gillespie keeps switching the format so that we are constantly being thrown from one person's reality to another's. By the time we get to 'the incident' (and Harding tells us, OK, that is what you are all here for), we are not certain who to believe and what really happened. What we are certain about is our complicity in the circus that surrounded the tragedy of Harding's life. As she tells us, she was abused all of her life and (looking straight into the camera) ""lastly by you.""The acting is some of the best you will see this year. Robbie is incredible. The makeup, the spectacular skating of Harding and, especially, the parental and spousal violence are so real that they make us understand more than ever that the movies are now at a stage where they can create reality, any reality, that they want to create. What is real becomes just as nebulous as what is true.I, Tonya is about class, both as in classy and as in class status. Harding was from the wrong side of the tracks and her 'class' is not something she could hide any more than she could hide her ambition. As she continues to be the best female ice skater in America, but is never named the best by judges for the American Ice Skating Association, her frustration mounts until she finally confronts a judge in a parking lot who is visibly scared of her. He admits that her mediocre scores have nothing to do with her skating but rather they are because the Association does not want her to be the face of American Ice Skating.In the irony to end all ironies, that is exactly what Tonya Harding becomes.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Crappy movie,"This is one of the worst movies i have watched.

Brilliant and spellbinding,"As someone who remembers the actual incident this movie was based on, I have to say that the film was spot on in its reconstruction of the events. Margot Robbie is truly brilliant as Tonya. Her convincingly accurate performance is frightening to say the least. Allison Janey who plays her mother is also incredible. The film is one where you are on the edge of your seat from the very beginning - from Tonya's beginnings with her overly pushy mother to the crisis where she finds herself a criminal. Truly brilliantly done.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Bunch of Entertaining Gillooly,"It's often difficult to find the balance of portraying real life events accurately and delicately. And I say delicately because there's so many times when movies take the approach of brushing over real life events with a cheap and safe version of what actually happened. Vague, but true. However, I, Tonya throws all of that out the window by telling a fascinatingly outrageous story of Tonya Harding's upbringing, triumph, and of course the downfall following the Nancy Kerrigan attack.
The attack may be what you go to see the movie for, but it's far from the centerpiece of this ridiculously ridiculous film. And yes, I just said that. I, Tonya has irreverent humor with an underlying sense of heart (which I didn't expect), and oh it's also filled with the most vacuous of characters/real humans. You will walk out of the theater asking yourself, ""did all of this really happen?"", and the most likely answer is yes.
Director Craig Gillespie, who has done films like The Finest Hours and Million Dollar Arm stepped into unchartered territory with I, Tonya, and did so rather well. Whether it be fourth-wall breaking, heightening scenes to improve the effect, or even shooting visceral ice skating sequences, the energy of this film never stops.
Gillespie isn't the only hero of this movie, as it's hard to overlook the performances of Margot Robbie and Allison Janney as Tonya and her mother respectively. Producing as well, Robbie is clearly devoted to this role and it sure looks like she'll get some gold this awards season because of it. Her counterpart, Janney, may do exactly the same, as a scene stealer and brutally relentless mother. If I were a betting man, I may put my money that those two to win this Oscar's. So a wild story, told in an insanely entertaining way, makes for one enjoyable 120 minutes.

"I, Tonya","Average movie, it wasn't a great movie, but it was a fun and entertaining movie.

F-ck u Shawn,"Forget biopics playing it safe. I, Tonya rips onto the screen like a triple axel with broken blades, a dazzling spectacle of dark humor, raw emotion, and heartbreaking truth.Margot Robbie channels Tonya Harding with ferocity, capturing her grit, vulnerability, and yes, even that infamous whack, without veering into caricature.Director Craig Gillespie masterfully weaves Tonya's story through layers of unreliable narration, blurring the lines between perception and reality. We see her rise from trailer park prodigy to Olympic hopeful, witnessing the brutal training, the constant criticism, and the suffocating shadow of her abusive mother (an unrecognizable Allison Janney, delivering a chillingly good performance).Here's where I, Tonya shines. It refuses to spoon-feed you a clean-cut villain or hero. You cringe at Tonya's choices, gasp at the injustices she faces, and ultimately question who gets to write the narrative of a life lived on the edge. The film doesn't shy away from the dark underbelly of figure skating, exposing the classism, sexism, and the ugly politics that lurked beneath the sequins and perfect smiles.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Chokes on its own hubris,"Yeah, this movie is punchy and Alison Janney delivers her best performance of her entire career. But I didn't think this film was anywhere near as great as others appear to. There was something really tacky and self congratulatory about the vibe that didn't sit well with me. The tongue in cheek story is offensive to both the real victim Nancy Kerrigan as well as Tonya Harding, who is given an insulting cartoonish treatment in this and a woeful Southern accent. There were a lot of faults, in particular the gross miscasting of a tall slim blank and demure Australian to play the short, stocky, fierce Tonya. You can't just put bad make up and hair on someone who is all wrong for the part and then expect the audience to think it's an Oscar worthy portrayal.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""America. They want someone to love, they want someone to hate""","Entrance scenes of the movie are excellent. Allison Jenney's acting immediately attracts us at first 10 minutes. I got information about most of the characters at short notice, with this feature I could dominate the movie and I didn't lose my attention One of the most important thing is that character behaviors and ideas are sharply separated from each other other ones, in short I clearly feel the conflict.Switching of the dancing scenes are expertly adjusted. I never bored when I watched these scenes. Besides, story progression is obviously perfect.""I think it will break the progression and it will be boring"" this was my opinion when I saw an the interview scenes, however in this movie interview scenes and events are meshed. These scenes never effect the progression and they didn't lower pace.Also supporting performers (like Paul Walter) are really good.The movie tells inner face of this sports competition and razes (the idea of) classical happy American family moreover they openly express it.However after all the movie does not turn into a success story, that's what I expect throughout the movie. You know, almost all sport movies have a happy ending and this movie also differ from the others with this feature.Have you ever watched the real tapes of Tonya Harding? Makeups, costumes, physical features and mimics of the performers are almost the same.I can watch this movie over and over again, I am sure no one wanted to shoot this scenario, final is not certain or there is not any success story but they made this movie, in fact they did this marvellous.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Funny, but actually serious in nature","Overall I do like the movie. Even though many of the protagonists are what I would call ""unlikeable"" they are being portrayed in a dualistic way. We get to see them at their worst and their best. One good example would be Tonya's mom. Yes, she is a very cruel person but at the same time her motherly love shines through sometimes (like e.g. in the diner scene). On a fundamental level she does care but prefers to shield herself behind a cloak of phlegmatism and profanity.Another thing that I liked was the movie's postmodern approach. There were a lot of scenes where the protagonists broke the 4th wall. I love that stuff, it makes you feel involved even though you're only an observer. Not many directors go this route because it's tricky to implement it properly. If yo do it wrong it seems gimmicky but if it's done right (like e.g. in Fight Club and the Deadpool movie) it's a real experience that you won't forget. Kudos for the execution.A funny thing that I noticed; some of the protagonists call Tonya Tanya throughout the movie. And yes, although the names may seem similar their etymological origins are not; 
Tatiana -> Tanya 
Antonina -> TonyaMy biggest gripe with the movie was the message that it was sending. All the violence and abuse that Tonya had to endure from both her mother and husband, that's not funny. But the movie kind of makes it seem that way. With the way everything was shot the movie went a little overboard with the whole ""gratuitous violence""-shtick. It was funny the first time but then became worrying as it continued. I mean, I get it. Hollywood is currently obsessed with the strong female protagonists archetype and there is nothing wrong with that. One of my favorite protagonists of all time is Ellen Ripley from the Alien franchise. But... , and this is a big ""but"", in this movie they should've just kept it real instead of simply going with the whole ""this is normal to me""-narrative. 
It's not! Domestic abuse is a serious problem and it's not going to get solved by joking about it.Another thing that I didn't like was the fact that the movie didn't really portray the intense rivalry between Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan. If you're old enough to remember the ""incident"" you'll know exactly how intense their rivalry was. There were also other movies about Tonya and Nancy back in those days which focused more on the rivalry between them. I really liked those. For someone who doesn't know the backstory the ""baton attack"" would seem totally ridiculous and unbelievable, but considering the circumstances it's anything but. And that's where the movie falls short. It only focuses on Tonya and totally leaves out Nancy, to the point where people who are unfamiliar with the story would think that the ""incident"" was totally unexpected. But in stories of intense rivalry there is always that one person who's willing to go the ""extra mile"". Just like in the movie Rush where Niki Lauda foolishly jeopardized his health in a daredevilish attempt to win the championship. These things actually happen in the real world; people who compete at the highest level tend to have risk-seeking personalities (think professional gamblers and Olympic athletes who dope). It's a well-defined psychological phenomenon.Final verdict: recommended (for it's entertainment value)",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Some of the best performances of the year!,"I, Tonya (2017) is a film about the true story of Tonya Harding, the former Olympic ice skater. I didn't know much about this, I mean I was born in 1999, so it was interesting to see this and learn all about it. The awards show season is really what lead me to watching this film. I can for sure say that the awards are well deserved. Probably the best thing this film has going for it is the acting. Margot Robbie, Allison Janney, and Sebastian Stan all turn in great performances. Robbie is such a talented actress and she really does a great job at embodying Tonya Harding. But really the actor that shines the brightest is definitely Janney, she plays the b**ch mother and she plays it very well. I mean it's truly one of the best performances I've ever seen. The script tells us so much about these unfortunate characters. Every aspect of the film is put together is a way that just works. Yes, it's dark, and that is because of the characters and what all they go through, but there is some comedy sprinkled in there, dark comedy that is. But it's not awkward or weird, it works. 9/10 for I, Tonya.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"There are biopics that make you look up the authors or people involved and when you do, you're let down, oh dang, is that it?","The turgid Molly Bloom for example. And then there are biopics so immediately different and a sheer tour de force from script to actor to screen that it makes you dive in to their heads and into the history and it's even more weird and exciting.
Margot Robbie is superb in absolutely every frame and makes Harding a sympathetic relatable portrait and the film allows her to be at every turn. You're so swept up in the electricity that it no longer matters how much is true, how much was dramatised, how much actually happened that way.
In fact all the actors are at the top of their game. And Gillespie uses a soundtrack so well that's it's notable compared to how lacklustre soundtracks have been in films recently. The film also manages to touch upon the media's role a little bit, and it has a blistering portrait of domestic violence that is normalised in a frighteningly real way.
Craig Gillespie has long since been one of my favourite directors, making little, overlooked films that delight in a mixture of creative and conventional ways. Here's he's renewed my interest in the biopic and he's told a story with the perfect amounts of normality and madness that a true story has.",,Anonymous,Biography
or as the judges would say: 5.6(?),"I, Tonya is that frustrating good movie that should or could be better. Not much of any fault can be found on the actors, and while they're all quite good it's Robie and Janney's movie (sometimes Stan's too as he effectively shows he can do more outside of Bucky). And the direction is absolutely acceptable as far as how Craig Gillespie moves the camera and knows how to hold on a shot when he must - certainly at an absolutely crucial moment, without music and only Robie's face as she goes back and forth from tears to smiles in a mirror, is that moment - and getting this work with the actors had to take some deep work. No, everything problematic is the script and the music, and it's not so much what is there as what isn't and/or what could have been.I didnt know much at all about the Harding/Kerrigan story outside of the general basics of the ""Incident"" as all of the characters in I, Tonya call it, but as much as I might get out of the repeated abuse that Tonya received as a daughter and a spouse may make her more sympathetic (the connection of her physical, as well as mental, abuse to that she received from the media in 94), but I wondered if they could have shown other things to make the story more complicated. Of course there's the bungled crime plot part of it - maybe this screenwriter is a big Coen fan along with Scorsese, and make no mistake this is down-the-line Diet Scorsese, which ill expound on in a moment - and yet Tonya had, from what the movie tells us, a connection *to Nancy Kerrigan as a friend.*As the audience, what do we get to see with that? Tonya saying it one line and then we see them giggling on a bed. That's it. What is that bond that happened there? Why was Tonya friends with someone who was much more beloved and maybe/maybe not had the hard existence that Tonya had it? I have to think Robie when presented with the script likely responded to the potential in getting deeper into what is underneath when Tonya talks to us (4th wall is broken not only by fake documentary style but by characters doing it mid scene) and is beaten up and fights back and then accepts whats happened and then in reverse the joy of being on the ice. Did she actually respond to the plot mechanics? Because those... I dunno.None of it is actively bad exactly. If you are looking for straight entertainment that goes for an invigorating ""we're fuck ups but we're human beings look beyond the media depictions"" take, that is there. But Gillespie or the producers or whomever missed out on what could have been more... *showing* us Harding's existence instead of flat *telling* us. That is where they try for Scorsese first, as far as showing us a group of unlike able but honestly depicted characters (and among them Tonya is by FAR the easiest to understand, everyone else is a pathetic creeper or abuser or, well, okay Janney is outstanding as always and I will take her total conviction over exact depth), but it falls flat because the narration isn't necessary for that purpose, it's not original enough to stand out. It is just... There. The second part is the music.Just... Please, music supervisors, and I shall assume this had the same hack as Suicide Squad (the Robie connection coincidental. Maybe), listen to some of the deeper cuts on a CD or your iTunes, it is certainly possible to get something else than the same dozen 70s and 80s classic rock tracks to show us ""yes, hard rocking 70s times!"" A shame since I like most of the songs in and of themselves, and could see some value in a couple of them (the ZZ Top track which may/may not have been there when Tonya was skating early on is a good example and a deeper track that fits the scene). But like the script the songs spell things out to nearly comic degrees; Janney's mother has 4 year old Tonya on the ice, how about ""Devil Woman""? Theres another drive away ""for good"" from a mega blowout fight between Robie and Stan? How about ""Goodbye Stranger"" by Supertramp? It eventually is overkill too, but the bigger problem is that it accents the scenes and doesnt do scenes dramatic service. It tells us how to feel before we can get a handle or trust what's already there.I know this sounds like a dumping on on all of I, Tonya, but that may be in part an expectations thing. I thought if it was going to Goodfellas or maybe Wolf of Wall st lengths it might take a satirical view on this uncanny sports saga - the trailer leads one on that direction too, a great trailer I should add - but it is more like an inverted Raging Bull. What if we got the woman's take on being in seemingly endless cycles of abuse, and you cant take what happens off the ice on it either (except maybe to uh prove the abusers wrong?) and yet it is .... not that kind of story either because we do get a lot more of an indication of where the abuse comes from. It's an experience where I absolutely adore everything the actors are doing, I could go on and on about how much Robie owns even (especially even) the smaller scenes that need to be quieter like with Julianne Nicholson (unrecognizable as always), and at the same time they had richer material and a less hackneyed attitude to certain parts of the style.Oh, and last thing that may be a nitpick, but... It is really distracting at times how obvious it isn't Robie's face on the body during some of the skating moves. Just get a good double people!

I wanted to like this movie.... but,"I hate when they try to make ""realistic"" bios, i.e. mock documentaries and/or ""interviews"" that are supposed to be real or feel real, but the actors still ""act"" and just aren't believable.And if you are going to play real-life people, then get them close to the real people. But here they really just didn't. They played everyone as caricatures. But because they did that, it didn't feel serious and came off as a goofy comedy.And as a side note, the CGI face on the skater of Margot was too noticeable.If Real life Tonya had that life as they portrayed, they should have made it more sympathetic. I just didn't feel for her.Even if the script was workable, which I don't think it was, as I think they should have gone a different direction, the execution was not good, for the reasons stated. Just bad direction. Could also be because they got an Australian to direct a movie about Americans and there is a just a geographical and cultural disconnect that he didn't get.Just watch interviews with Tonya Harding and then watch Margot's ""performance"" in the film and you can see it's miles apart and you can do that with every single character in the film.

Tonya Harding with her ""trailer trash"" background is expertly played by a very dowdy Margot Robbie, she played the glamorous Sharon Tate in Tarantino's Once / Hollywood.

"Supporting characters shine, Robbie not so much.","Can this be called a documentary? A mockumentary? Biopic? At different times throughout the film it felt like it wanted to be any one of all three of these. Still after ending credits rolled, the film didn't stick with me. It was good, and for a handful of scenes very good.
 However it was never great.Margot Robbie was the wrong actress for this, with an especially wrong accent. Tonya Harding is not an Eastcoaster, she's from Oregon. Robbie is an average actress at best. Should have been Amy Adams all the way! On the other hand Allison Janney did a great job, and even more so Sebastian Stan as Harding's abusive husband.This is one of the few movies I believe could have benefited from an additional 15 to 20 minutes of runtime. At 2 hrs runtime that should be enough to forge a strong connection between characters and audience, but that connection never fully developed for me. Less editing may have helped. Different editing choices also. Perhaps more in depth coverage of Harding's childhood and adolescence, and less coverage of every single time she got beat by her husband.All in all its solid, but not outstanding.

"Despite ham-handed attempts to be winking or cute, a ballsy bio","The pretty little ice princesses in skating competitions around Portland in the 1980s find themselves competing with a rough-hewn, cigarette-smoking, foul-mouthed dynamo--one, Tonya Harding--whose specialty is the enviable triple axel. There is one major obstacle for our young heroine: the pristine sweethearts of the ice are walloping her in scores because, as one judge says, strictly off the record, ""It isn't all about the skating."" Years later, after finishing a dismal 4th at the 1992 Winter Olympics, Harding is granted ""a second chance"" when it's announced the Olympics will be returning in just two more years instead of four. Cleaning up her act (somewhat), and leaning on her abusive-but-obsessed ex-husband for support, Harding hopes to topple her main competitor, Nancy Kerrigan--a sometime-partyer who otherwise knows how to play by the rules; fate, however, intervenes infamously once Tonya's former-spouse and his low-life buddy decide Tonya needs a little help. Salty, ballsy biography of Harding (Margot Robbie), her tough-as-nails mama (Oscar winner Allison Janney) and her dumber-than-dirt husband (Sebastian Stan) gets the white-trash milieu down right, while the ice-skating sequences are pumped with excitement. Still, director Craig Gillespie goes a little cute on the cheeky asides, opening with 'funny', contradictory interviews of the principals, then flashing back in time to Tonya as a (soft) four-year-old skating under the thumb of her scheming mother. Perhaps Gillespie finally figured out what we surmise by the halfway mark: there isn't enough material here to sustain a feature (perhaps ""I, Tonya"" would've had more impact as a cable movie?). The director, the screenwriter, Steven Rogers, and the talented cast just about pull it off; you certainly don't end up caring about these unsentimental characters, but that's part of the enjoyment. Nobody needs to poke fun at them or look down on them--these mean, ignorant rednecks are funny enough on their own without any additional maliciousness--and watching them chasing their own tails in search of fame and fortune is the stuff of rich black comedy.

i don't know if they should've made that movie..,"Margot robbie definitely gave one of her greatest performances ever, yet the film had a lot of flaws
there is a lot of confusing decisions made in this movie,
the fact that they made the same actors do their teen-aging years and their 20 years later versions was kinda hard to believe
and the way 'the incident"" was delivered was a bit confusing too
in fact, the way the whole story was delivered was not the greatest.the performances was the only thing that made that whole movie bearable really,
Margot Robbie did a great job playing her character and so did Allison Janney, her performance was so convincing i wanted to punch her in the face through out the entire movie
sebastian stan's performance was kind of confusing though.
i mean, he did have some moments that made me so believe him, but other than that i thought his squeaky attempt to impersonate jeff's voice (which turned out not being that squeaky in the real interview) was kinda disturbing, but that is a director's thing though, which brings us back to the wrong decisionsthe movie in general made me question the reason why they did it, it somehow felt at some point that the producers themselves didn't know the actual truth behind the incident tooafter all, it still had some touching moments and kinda felt enjoyable at some moments, although this feeling doesn't last so long

"An American Tragedy, on Two Levels","As I wend my way through a plethora of films up for various SAG Awards _ an unusually diverse group including the likes of ""The Shape of Water,"" ""Darkest Hour,"" ""Downsizing,"" ""Lady Bird,"" ""Get Out,"" ""The Big Sick,"" ""Call Me By Your Name"" and ""The Disaster Artist,"" among others _ I find, much to my surprise, that the one I like the most is the one I thought I would like the least: ""I, Tonya.""""I, Tonya,"" directed by Craig Gillespie from a script by Steven Rogers, is a biographical film about the disgraced figure skater Tonya Harding leading up to and including her involvement (or not) in the 1994 attack on her American Olympic teammate Nancy Kerrigan.The film is a deeply moving study not only of a troubled young athlete and her dysfunctional family, but a convincing treatise about class distinction in the United States and how it can manifest itself in complex, easily dismissed and misunderstood ways.For example, when the movie-Harding confronts a skating judge after losing a competition she justifiably thought she had clearly won, the judge says the jury's vote was not about skating but about not wanting to be represented by someone from the wrong side of the tracks. Among other things, she makes her own skating costumes, which are clearly not in the class of those worn by the more well-fixed competition.The movie begins in the 1970s with Tonya, then 4, being shoved down the throat of a local skating instructor by Tonya's mother, LaVona Fay Golden, played by veteran Allison Janney (""The West Wing"") as a kind of more obvious and profane Nurse Ratched, the ultimate rotten stage mother incapable of love and caring even when it comes to her own child at her most needy and vulnerable.When the instructor balks, the mother levels the other skating tots with a coarse putdown usually not reserved for children (strong language permeates this script, another not-so-subtle reminder, and not an unbiased one, of the class distinction motif).Tonya is played with breathtaking _ and there's no other word for it _ effectiveness by Margot Robbie (who also produced). Robbie, a real beauty, makes herself much less so without the theatricality so often displayed by actresses when they are called upon to play more threadbare characters. Robbie is Harding right down to her toenails, whether providing commentary about her life as she smokes a cigarette at her kitchen table, or skimming along the ice with honest-to-goodness athletic virtuosity.Sebastian Stan as her boyfriend-turned-husband, Jeff Gillooly, whom Harding marries as much to claim independence from her mother as because of true love, is excellent as he walks the fine line between being physically and emotionally abusive even as he fights to defend her honor.The attack on Kerrigan is re-created in a chilling, violent street-crime-meets-the-Keystone Kops way that works in showing both its grotesque and tragic possibilities while exposing the ridiculousness of the misguided logic behind it.Julianne Nicholson, Caitlin Carver and Bobby Cannavale are completely believable and moving in supporting roles.The film is described as a black comedy that uses occasional mockumentary techniques (like having characters break the fourth wall and speak right into the camera), but I would beg to differ.This is an American tragedy _ a tragedy in which America itself was complicit.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A rags to rags story of your ordinary American trailer trash skating icon.,"Alongside some of its more highbrow Oscar contenders I expected I, Tonya to be a little lightweight and, whisper it, maybe one that's really more for the ladies than the gents.Not so. This movie has balls.It tells the true life story. (Wait a minute, who says it's true? Ed. Ah, good point Ed. the opening is heavily disclaimered regarding the truth and whose story is correct.)It tells a multi-faceted rendering of the happenings that surrounded Tonya Harding's rise from poor American trailer trash to, well, just managing American trailer trash, with a tilt at winning the Olympic figure skating Gold medal, as favourite, along the way.It's a rags to rags story in which poor Tonya has to suffer more than probably any global superstar ever before to make her claim for fame; ending instead in infamy.Margot Robbie not only stars as the eponymous lead but produced the film and, in similar fashion to Charlize Theron in Monster, ditches her stunning good looks for hair, make up and wardrobe (train tracks and all) that makes her, frankly, a mess.Her back story, brilliantly and hilariously told in pretty short order, deals with a life (allegedly) mired in terrible abuse; firstly from her disgusting 'Skating Mom' played brilliantly (and a cert for an Oscar) by Alison Janney (West Wing) and her equally disgusting young husband (Sebastian Stan). The opening scene, as a three year old skating prodigy being brought to her first skate class, is hysterical and sets the tone for the rest of the movie.Somehow, despite this tram-smash of a life, Harding rises above it all and bulldozes her way through the middle-class American skating hierarchy into prime position thanks not only to her generally brilliant ability but, in particular, to her nailing the Triple Axel.That's when it all goes wrong.You'll know why, so I won't bore you with the details. But suffice it to say the hapless events that follow are particularly well enacted by her 'security' Shawn (Paul Walter Hauser); reminding me of Four Lions.Suffice it to say this movie is great. The acting is universally superb. The skating scenes are entirely convincing, the humour (black as the ace of spades) is laugh out loud time and again, and the way that Harding is dealt her cards, and the beatings she takes both physical and mental, are abhorrent and repulsive.Robbie is a revelation in the role and has joined the Hollywood A list as a consequence. I can't wait to see her in Mary Queen of Scots (alongside, count them, no fewer than eight other announced roles) and whilst she won't beat Frances McDormand to the coveted Best Female Lead in March this performance has set a new bar for which she can only progress beyond.Bravo. If I had a red rose I'd throw it on the ice right now.(The soundtrack, all the best worst American MOR ever, is great too.)",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent!,"I hate sports & loathe when the olympics are on. 
I have never had any interest in Tonya Harding or her story. 
A friend talked me into watching this movie & I'm SO HAPPY I did! 
It was absolutely hilarious!!! The perfect dark comedy! 
Everyone did a phenomenal acting job in this & writing was superb!!!
Allison Janney deserved Academy award for her performance!
It felt like it was more a commentary on life and how your
environment effects your future, than it did solely on Tonya's story.
Cannot recommend this highly enough!
If you don't like this movie, then you dont get or dont appreciate dark humor!",,Anonymous,Biography
Entertaining enough but overrated,"Considering all the critical gushing that surrounded this movie back in 2017, it is possible that I came in with too high expectations, but I found I, TONYA disappointing in almost every category. Reviews would have you believe this is a pitch-black satire of media circuses and class privilege, but it's just your standard Oscarbait biopic, paying lip service to its themes while never really exploring them in an interesting way.Of all the actors, Allison Janey came off the best as the mother from hell. Maybe a bit one-note, but generally entertaining. I enjoy Margot Robbie as an actress and she does credible work here, though there are a few scenes where you can tell she's self-consciously swinging for that coveted Oscar gold rather than inhabiting a character. The other actors are pretty good, though they never really feel ""real"" to me-- considering the whole ""unreliable narrator"" schtick the movie insists it has going on, this might be the point (people exaggerating events and behavior in retelling a story), but even in the ""mockumentary"" sections, the acting felt off.The movie fires on all cylinders when it's doing its best Coen Brothers imitation. The dark comedy generally works, especially in regards to the criminal antics of Shawn, Tonya's hapless bodyguard. However, the dramatic scenes work less so and feel like they're from another movie altogether. These scenes are more conventional, hitting the usual ""biopic"" beats we've seen hundreds of times in other movies. Even the unreliable narrator conceit falls apart: the movie is pretty firm in its ideas regarding what the ""truth"" of the situation is, even if the Harding character claims there is no such thing as the ultimate truth.It's funny-- I saw this movie just last night and my opinion of it plummets the more I think about it. Another case where I like what the movie is trying to do more than its execution of those ideas.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the Best Movies of 2017,"When I first saw the preview for ""I, Tonya,"" I laughed. It looked cheesy, like a soap opera on ice - but I definitely wanted to see it. I just didn't expect much. I remembered the events unfolding in real life. I was about 13 at the time and watched it all happening on TV. It was just the sort of drama that grabbed the attention of a young girl in the early 90's. What's more, I was a dancer back then and (of course) there was that one girl who was my main rival. So there was some projecting going on.I went into ""I, Tonya"" thinking it would be nostalgic and funny to see the figure-skating drama queens. But by the time I finished watching it, I realized this movie was far more than a trip to the past. I discovered how much I can relate to Tonya, and how much she (in this movie) is really a metaphor for the American Dream. She's also a symbol of the obstacles faced in pursuit of it. Specifically, she's an excellent example of how class affects our pursuit of the Dream.No matter how hard Tonya works, and no matter how talented she is, her working-class background stands in the way of her dream. It doesn't just affect her ability to afford nice skating outfits and such. It affects her on a deeper level, destroying her self-esteem. Then she makes one bad choice after another - like staying in an abusive relationship.In America, we don't like to talk about class. We like to think there are equal opportunities for everyone. This movie puts the issue front and center. You get the feeling that Tonya suspects what a lot of working-class people suspect: that the world is rigged against them. That the only way to get ahead is to cheat. Is that true? I'm not sure. I like how the movie isn't sure, either.On one hand, you get the feeling that Tonya could have won the Olympics. Her coach believed in her. She had the talent. There's a reason why Rags-to-Riches is a cliche. Even though we have class divisions, we love it when people rise about their economic status to achieve their dreams. If she had the confidence in herself, could she have pulled it off?On the other hand, the movie hints at what I mentioned before: that the system is, indeed, rigged. We hear whispers that Tonya just isn't family-friendly or the image the skating world wants to project. The implication there is that, no matter how good she is, they still won't let her win.That's why I loved this movie. It doesn't really give any pat answers. It leaves the possibilities open. It shows that, yes, things are stacked against Tonya. But on the other hand, she had opportunities. After all, she did make it to the Olympics.I also loved the way the movie handled the Nancy Kerrigan incident. Was Tonya Harding involved? It's essentially left up for you to decide. The move basically says, ""Here she is. Here are the choices she made in her life leading up to that point."" Then it doesn't draw conclusions for you.That's why I enjoyed ""I, Tonya"" so much. It was much better than that fish love movie, in any case.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Well-Acted Drama,"As I've said throughout countless reviews in the past, true stories are hardly ever completely honest. The quality of a film that's based on a true story has nothing to do with the fact that the true story was incredible or not because there's no way of knowing if everything's true unless you're the character it's based on. That being said, I, Tonya is one of the latest feature films (based on a true story) to receive a theatrical release. Gaining buzz for awards season, this is a very relevant story for today's climate. Yes, this film was made before all of these allegation stories made their way into the public eye, but I, Tonya deals with this particular notion in a very grand fashion. While I don't particularly like any of the characters throughout this entire movie, here's why I believe this to be a movie that people will love to hate.Following Tonya Harding, an unlikely figure skater, due to her foul mouth and horrific upbringing, I, Tonya is about her rise to power and continual falls from grace. Falling in love with a man who (deep down) is just as violent a cruel as she is, their relationship finds a way of working out, most of the time. This film asks you to applaud for a despicable woman and try to forget about how she treats the people around her. Yes, she's talented, but it's hard to root for a woman that acts like this, especially when the entire film revolves around her. I'm sure aspects of this story have been exaggerated or made up entirely, but there are clever editing and writing techniques to make certain dramatic sequences quite funny at times.Margot Robbie, Sebastien Stan, and Allison Janney are all terrific and believable as these characters, with the most notable one being Stan's portrayal of Tonya's husband Jeff. In my opinion, he was the standout of this film, because even though I've seen and enjoyed his performances in the past, most of them fell in comparison to everyone else in each film he appeared in. I'm simply stating that he's the standout to me, due to the fact that I've never seen him deliver a better performance than this and I don't think I ever will. The performances sell this film, but the true star of this movie is the editor (excluding the very off-putting visual effects of the skater's faces).From cutting seamlessly between scenes with the brilliant use of sound effects, to quick cuts to show the progression of time, to the long takes exploring a character breakdown, there are many technical aspects about this film to gawk at. I found myself enthralled by the way this film was put together in terms of its structure. It's very rare that I leave a movie and find the most interesting aspect to be the editing choices, especially when everything else about the movie is just as great. Quite honestly, aside from a few plot points being brushed over, this was a terrific film from start to finish.In the end, I, Tonya impressed me on many levels. From its use of fourth wall breaking to each and every performance seeming extremely committed to the use of unique editing, to the direction that seemed calm and focussed throughout the dramatic moments, this is a ride that I believe is worth taking. Although it doesn't quite offer the truth and literally states that certain things may or may not have happened, it's told in a perfect way for a feature film. This movie deserves its award buzz and I believe it's a great movie that people should check out.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unfortunate Lifetime TV Channel feel presentation,"Haven't seen director Craig Glliespie's ""I, Tanya"" yet? Not to worry, you probably won't unless the amazing Allison Janney (""Mom"" and ""The West Wing"") gets nominated for Best Actress at the Academy Awards. Unfortunately, Glliespie (""Lars and the Real Girl"" - 2007) presents a big screen film that has a cheesy TV Lifetime Channel feel. Adding to his odd documentary interview style directing here, is the over the top costume design by Jennifer Johnson, whose period outfits and extreme hair presentations are a distraction to the story. Margot Robbie (Tanya), best known for her ""Suicide Squard - Harley Quinn"" character plays Tanya consistently hard, making it almost impossible to be believe her character and/or feel sorry for her predicament. The handsome Sebastian Stan (Jeff - Tanya's wild husband behind the mustache) is a pleasant contrast to Robbie and Janney's (Tanya's hardcore mother) bull in a china shop relationship. Character actor Paul Waiter Hauser does a nice job here as the guy behind the Nancy Karrington (played briefly by Caitlin Carve ""Paper Town"" 2015) attact. Odd as his character is, he comes across as the most believable in the film. Regardless of the above, enough can't be said for Allison Janney's commitment to her in-your-face, foul-mouthed, distraught, put upon character. Because Janney is so well know for her current and past nice gal character roles, watching her in this role is both hard to watch, yet somehow extremely satisfying. If Glliespie has any credit coming his way for ""I, Tanya,"" it's his casting of Janney in this Award worthy role.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"I, TONYA holds sway as a rebuttal to the truth-debunking trend and flags up the inherent impediment in front of everyone's upstream battle","There is something unconscionably rebarbative in the factual story of Tonya Hardling (1970-) (Robbie), an erstwhile top-notch American figure skater who falls from grace in the wake of a physical assault inflicted to her fellow teammate/rival Nancy Kerrigan (Carver), with which she may or may not be involved, that is, it represents the most air-headed idiocy and indignity executed by those we might refer to as ""peckerwoods"", for wanting of wits, conscience, compassion, even wiles, they are piteous for sure, but there is also a pithy Chinese adage, which can be roughly interpreted as: a poor person must have a detestable trait.Director Craig Gillespie briskly soups up this biopic with revelatory modi operandi of four-square faux-interviews and breaking-the-fourth wall gimmick to feed us prompt commentaries and wry afterthoughts apropos of its state of affairs from the subjects, an inviting tactic to piece together the less fluid chronological narratology. And the money-shots are certainly hinged on the re-enactments of Tonya's historical Olympic performances, and with a helping hand of cutting-edge CGI magic, despite on some occasions we can fairly discern the effect that Robbie's face is edited onto the gliding skater in the post-production, by and large, the filmmakers have done a cracking job to construct them with a scintillating cinematic sheen.Apart from a physically backbreaking stunt for Robbie to pull off Tonya's aptitude on the ice rink, she weaves through the whole shebang with amazing verve and compelling agency, aided by a beneficial factor of the film's slant on Tonya: blameless in the scandal, and is not someone who is willfully refuses to play along with the tacit rule of figure skating, but simply she is just a different kettle of fish from those elected ice princesses to represent a nation's international image, a tragic figure falls victim of the dark and sanctimonious side of a typical American dream.Consequentially, Robbie is proudly initiated as an Oscar nominated actress, which bullishly paves the way for her leading lady status among the Hollywood current echelon. But it is Allison Janney's Oscar-certified showstopper as a monstrously abusive mother that takes this reviewer aback (not in an entirely salutary sense though), as rewarding as to see a veteran of Janney's caliber finally pays her due to grasp the holy grail, her showy and bitter incarnation of LaVona Golden, Tonya's mother, ruefully overreaches the boundary between caricature and baring-it-out authenticity.Still and all, another monster in Tonya's life, Jeff Gillooly, her abusive first husband played by a smoldering Sebastian Stan, is left disproportionally unsung compared to the hailing laurels received by the two aforementioned ladies, in fact, Stan is far from a sub-par contributor to the film's hair-trigger dynamism, and rightfully, he transmits Jeff's pernicious influence with poise and a semblance of inner conflict that is so critical in a role's wholesome characterization, which is found wanting in both case of LaVona and Shawn Eckhardt (Hauser), the presumed barmy culprit whose presence only reminds us the nadir of human lunacy.By turns ebullient, over-the-top, rousing (partially thanks to Fleetwood Mac's infectious THE CHAIN), sardonic and archly cynical, I, TONYA holds sway as a rebuttal to the truth-debunking trend and flags up the inherent impediment in front of everyone's upstream battle: we cannot choose our parents, but can we choose our own path then? Not really, as Tonya's story tells us, when something so hardwired such as one's upbringing, stands in your way, just suck it up and keep your heads above the water.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hard to watch...,"I am not a big fan of domestic violence, even if its a retrospective character piece, its hard to stomach. The star of the movie was not Margot Robbie's Tonya, but Alliison Janney, whose protrayal of overbearing/vindictive mother of Harding was uncanny and mesmerizing. The whole movie should have focused more on that dynamic, then the rest of the film. Sebastian's Jeff Gillooly was a little unwatchable, as half the performance was him beating her. Rest of the film was more the aftermath of Nancy Kerrigan incident. Don't expect many scenes with Nancy Kerrigan character, its more a Tonya Harding centric pic. Worth watching on DVD, maybe for Janney's performance.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Is Tonya Harding a tragic figure skater or an airhead who went too far to be the best? I, Tonya is great at never clearly drawing a line","In the world of sports, there's a level of concentration and motivation that most athletes reach in which they have to decide when far is too far. Like any job, there's always going to be individuals who will want to be the best (only to encounter someone whose probably better). How to proceed from there depends on the people asking themselves that. Do they try to be friendly? Or is there no room for friends and must remain competitive? If you think that everyone is going to play fair, then your wrong. The world is full of people that will stoop to such lows that you'll question their humanity. Life's not fair, plain and simple.Going back to the sporting world, there are many horrible people that become famous anyhow. Whether people will know of their actions varies, but it seems that even the public is aware of the things that are done.One such case considers the former ice skater, Tonya Harding. In the late eighties and early nineties, she was a promising athlete who would become a media sensation for what she did off the ice rink. Regardless of whose the bad guy, I, Tonya takes a look at the controversy and those with her.As a young four year old, Tonya is encouraged by her tough and abusive mother LaVona (played by Allison Janney) to pursue her interest in ice skating. Though local coach Diane Rawlinson (played by Julianne Nicholson) doesn't want to teach someone that young, she is impressed and agrees to help. By the time she reaches sixteen, Tonya (played by Margot Robbie) has won several competitions and is seen as one of the best in America, but can't seem to win the national competitions due to her music choices, white trash background, and more rebellious attitude.When her mother goes too far, she moves out with her boyfriend and later husband Jeff Gillooly (played by Sebastian Stan) and continues her skating. Her routine at the 1992 Olympics goes well, until she fails to stick her landing, blaming her blades. She's encouraged to try again for the 1994 Olympics. Things get scary when she receives a death threat. In retaliation, her husband, whose convinced that competing skater Nancy Carver (played by Catlin Carver) sent it, arranges for her to get hurt. Once the FBI make the connections, Tonya is constantly questioned whether she knew about the attack or not, while hoping to proceed with the Olympics.Now doing a movie on Tonya Harding would seem difficult as someone with a controversial background is not a person that too many people are going to sympathize with. This is why I, Tonya does the smart thing, and sets the story like a character study. You certainly get a better understanding of her background and her personality, but it never takes a side. In fact, the movie almost seems like a troll, giving you the typical sports story for the first half, before going into the skater attack in the second half.This all works together thanks to the cast, which was selected perfectly. Though the roster is filled with mostly unknowns, the main stars suited nicely. Sebastian Stan makes for a good airhead with potential fame going to his head. Allison Janney plays a bit of herself, but still pulls off Tonya's mother LaVona whose a monster, but at least a human monster. Of course, Margot Robbie is great as Tonya. While she too is an airhead, she shows that there's a difference between that and her passion for the ice. In a way, she is a tragic character, but your also not sure if you want to feel sorry for her.I'll give this ten 1994 Olympics posters out of ten. The best kinds of biopics are the ones that focus on grey characters; those who do questionable things that you'll question for a while. I, Tonya does that and portrays the working American in a world of wealthier athletes. It may not be new, but her character makes your want to go through this trope. I'm glad I caught it in time for the award season. I recommend this, so get on the ice for your fair chance.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Think Goodfellas If They Were Morons,"""I Tonya"" in short: The story of competitive figure skater Tonya Harding as told by Tonya and her henchmen: ex-husband Jeff Gillooly, bodyguard Shawn Eckardt (with apparent ""training in counter-terrorism tactics""), and her mom, LaVona (who will not be winning any mother of the year awards).If you're not familiar with why Tonya Harding and her thugs spent most of the mid-1990's as a punchline for a vast number of jokes on late-night TV, this is a good place to start...with a caveat.""Based on irony free, wildly contradictory, totally true interviews with Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillooly"" warns the title card in the beginning.The ""interviews"" we see throughout the film are with the actors portraying the real people, with the idea, of course, that the actual interviews were conducted at some point. We also see clips from Tonya's bodyguard, a former tabloid journalist, and Tonya's mom (with a bird sitting on her shoulder that often steals the scene). Together, they tell the story of Tonya's life before, during and after ""the incident.""""The incident"" being referred to is the kneecapping of Harding rival, and apparent good friend, Nancy Kerrigan, during a practice session at the Cobo Arena in Detroit. Think of this like the Goodfellas (1990) if the Goodfellas were a bunch of white trash, moronic ""boobs"" (not my word) trying to pull off a hit.Two things you'll LIKE about ""I, TONYA"": 1) It's funny! The story we saw on TV in the 1990's wasn't that humorous, but how it's told here is quite fun. 2) The acting (props to Allison Janney, who plays mom) the production design, the editing, the directing. Everything seamlessly works together to keep your interest from the very beginning.Two things you'll DISLIKE: 1) A lot of the story is left out, apparently. I did some research after the film to see exactly how accurate this is. I knew a little about the incident, but nothing of the aftermath. Combine the film with some Wiki research afterwards for a more fulfilling experience! 2) Your feelings for the real people involved will change. I know that's vague, but it is what it is.Favorite quote from the movie (Tonya to Jeff), ""I really think you should just kill yourself.""",,Anonymous,Biography
Extremely Involving Movie That Tells a Crazy but True Story With Equal Parts Tragedy and Comedy,"I wasn't old enough to process Tonya Harding's story when it was going on, so I can only describe this movie as a fresh face. I loved how this movie played into the wild and varied accounts about Tonya's life. Instead of presenting one version and calling it ""the truth"" (which Harding even talks about through voice over in the final scene), they present different accounts through Harding (played by Margot Robbie), Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan) and LaVona Golden (Allison Janney) and the movie is very ambiguous about what happened. This was refreshing, the story is just so bizarre no matter whose account you choose to believe. It allows the creative team the freedom to cherry-pick what they want to show, and I was constantly engaged. Normally I'm critical when the stray from the facts in a biopic but no one will ever ""actually"" know what happened, so the movie has some fun with it without straying into implausibility.So, knowing that the movie toys with the story a little, I still was floored by the characters and the character development. Tonya Harding, whether she was guilty or not, became a sympathetic in my eyes. I'm not saying that what she did was right or that Kerrigan deserved it (that shouldn't even be a question) but with the kind of upbringing she had, was she going to be an emotionally stable adult? I would say no. Even though the world decided she was the villain, her work ethic and her perseverance made her endearing to me. Gillooly and Golden are villains and they're monsters but the movie makes them characters that you want to follow. Add in one of the dumbest characters I've seen on screen in Shawn (Paul Walter Hauser) and a surprisingly informative narrator in Martin Maddox (Bobby Cannavale) and you have a movie populated by unforgettable characters that all have a surprising amount of depth.I've talked about the characters and how closely the movie sticks to the facts, but I wanted to add how sharp of a script I think this was. The movie is hilarious at points and it just breaks your heart at others. The dialogue is always sharp (even though its vulgar as h@!!) and I found the movie suspenseful throughout. They also present serious issues like spousal/familial abuse in a different light. Tonya faces violence daily and instead of stopping the movie to show it, its very much treated as an everyday occurrence. It is shocking and every time you're starting to have too much fun, it just sobers you up completely. It was a bold but effective choice to show how screwed up her life was. Add in the great 4th wall breaking and narration from different characters, they really produced something special with this.The script was great, but Gillespie and his team shot the crap out of this too. The skating and action scenes are dynamic with the camera constantly moving and showing things from different angles. What Tonya and the other skaters do as athletes is an art and the movie shows that. I also thought the movie was gritty but had a sense of style. There's also a neat shot showing the passage of time after one of Tony and Jeff's breakups that weaves things together beautifully. Instead of just skating by, the movie committed to making things exciting from a visual standpoint.I, Tonya has also garnered some deserved praise for the actors and actresses. Even as a fan, I was blown away by Margot Robbie as Tonya. She doesn't look like Harding, but her performance has so much emotion and effort in it that she capably carries this movie. She's probably going to get an Oscar nomination for this and she deserves it. She's got tons of talent and I hope she gets more roles like this. I was expecting great things from Robbie, but the surprising performance was Sebastian Stan as Jeff. He really did great work, he's the underrated one in this cast. He capably plays Jeff as a slimy/bad guy but complex nonetheless. Allison Janney is just evil as LaVona and she's also deserving of the praise/award recognition for her work. She's so awful but you can't turn away because of Janney's performance. Paul Walter Hauser is perfect in the worst way for Shawn. He's so stupid and Hauser plays up the idiocy of the character so well. I also liked Bobby Cannavale in his small role, he's a nice mix of sleazy and funny that helps round out the story.I only have 1 criticism of this movie and its not the one that most of the reviews have. The biggest complaint I've heard about the movie is the CGI in the skating sequences, that its obvious that they've put Margot Robbie's head on another skater. I didn't think it was a seamless effect, but I never had a problem with it. My problem was that they made the decision to have Robbie and Stan play the 15-16 year old versions of Harding and Gillooly and while I get it would have been an awkward transition (by the end of the movie, Harding is only 23 so how else could they have done it?) I still found it hard to buy them at those points. I don't want to blame the actors, but it just came off as a rare misstep for a largely flawless movie.This is one of 2017's best movies for me. It was highly praised and after seeing it, I think rightly so. I think the acting, direction and script were all impressive and the movie came together to be something worth going to see.

"Not too bad, had higher expectations","I, Tonya had its strengths and was a decent film.However it did not live up to its hype. The acting and performances are the strongest part of the film. Margot Robbie does a great job as Tonya Harding and fully immerses herself into Harding's troubled and spiraling out of control life. It was hard to not feel sorry for Tonya and the abuse was not easy to watch. It also had a great soundtrack.The film could have had more laughs, been better directed and definitely contain less reflections from their older selves. Nothing kills the flow of a movie than disjointed confessionals from the cast that added little value to the film. A critic called this film 'The Goodfellas of Figure Skating', it definitely is not and does not have the same caliber or quality attached to it. The biggest weakness is this film lacked flair or style to weave it all together. Overall decent but lets not kid ourselves its nothing to brag about.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Uncomfortable Telling of a Tragic Figure,"I recall how incensed I was watching the Olympics with my daughter and seeing this coarse individual skating. It was a lesson for me to realize that sometimes other factors take over our lives.

Overrated,"The accolades for the acting in this movie are mystifying. If you weren't born at the time of the '94 Olympics, you might be convinced that Margot Robbie makes a good Tonya Harding. Sometimes an actor can pull off playing a real person despite not having any physical similarities. Margot Robbie is not one of those actors. She bears no physical resemblance to Harding, nor does she convince through her acting.Allison Janney's role as Harding's mother, LaVona Golden, is a one-note comic book villain. She plays it well, there's just not much heavy lifting going on there, acting-wise. (For a screen mother with some emotional layers, see Laurie Metcalf in Lady Bird.)While it's not Tyler Perry-bad, tonally it's broad comedy one minute, jarring scenes of domestic abuse the next.I was not left cheering Tonya Harding; mostly I was left with a sense of ambivalence.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""I was loved... for a minute""","""I, Tonya"" (2017 release; 121 min.) is a bio-pic about the life and times of (in)famous figure skater Tonya Harding. As the movie opens, we are reminded the movie is ""based on irony-free, wildly contradicting and totally true interviews with Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillooly"". After some current-day interview excerpts of them and others, we then go back to ""Portland, Oregon 40 Years Ago"", where we get to know Tonya as a 4 year old, along with her all-too-soon absent father and her abusive mother, the latter pushing Tonya into figure skating. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself hoe it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Craig Gillespie, who most recently brought us the excellent ""Their Finest Hours"". Here, in conjunction with Margot Robbie's production company, he brings the ""truth"" as to what ""really"" happened in 1994, when Nancy Kerrigan was whacked on the knee in the run-up of the upcoming nationals and then Olympics. But the movie is about so much more than that. Harding was ""white trash"", as was everyone around her. It breaks your heart to see her being abused, physically and psychologically, time and again, by the people around her, when all she really wants is some TLC. ""I was loved... for a minute"", laments Harding on more than one occasion. The movie's approach is wild, and wildly entertaining, where characters address the audience directly on numerous occasions. Margot Robbie is outstanding in the title role. Is that really Robbie in the skating sequences? If so, wow... But equally impressive is Allison Janney in the utterly unlikable role as Tonya's abusive mom. How can a mother end up so cruel as to her own daughter? It's a topic worth examining further in and of itself... The movie features a ton of great song placements, which only increase the viewing experience in the best possible way. ""I, Tonya"" is clearly inn line to do quite well in the upcoming awards season, and deservedly so (Janney already won a Golden Globe for her performance).""I, Tonya"" premiered at last Fall's Toronto International Film Festival to immediate critical acclaim, and is now finally getting a wider release. The Thursday evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay (for a weekday evening). I can only imagine that this movie will benefit from the sure positive word-of-mouth that audiences will give this. If you are in the mood for a wildly entertaining bio-pic about a controversial figure skater who never stood a chance, be it in figure skating or in life for that matter, you will not want to miss this. ""I, Tonya"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Scorsese on Figure Skates,"""Bash in a friends knee with a pipe? Who would do that? To a friend.""
That line did not come from De Niro or Ray Liotta. It came out the mouth of Margot Robbie playing Tonya Harding in what I have down for the best movie of 2017.
Let me start by saying I actively dislike figure skating. And that's okay. Tonya Harding doesn't seem to give a sh#t about figure skating either, even though she's forced onto to the ice by her hell-beast of a mother almost just after birth.
This movie really isn't about figure skating at all. Its about the dark heart of America, with all its love and hate and violence, wrapped up in bow ties and glitter and put on for show in the Olympics every four years. Tonya was different. She was an athlete that didn't care about the BS, and what happened happened.
Margot Robbie most likely wont win the Best Actress Oscar this year. But she deserves it. And it really doesn't matter. With cinema the cream rises to the top. Finally, there exists in film a female antihero as self destructive as Travis Bickle. Watch this movie now.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Interesting,"Everyone has been raving about this movie, so I had to go see it for my self. Now that I have seen it I honestly don't have much to say about it.This movie was interesting to watch, it was also educational because I was not familiar with the events that took place since I was young and living in a different country. ""I,Tonya"" doesn't really break any new grounds in filmmaking but it's a complete, enjoyable, entertaining and (for the most part) real story.The only thing that particularly stands out in this movie is Margot Robbie's absolutely INCREDIBLE performance as Tonya Harding. I think without her this movie couldn't exist or would fall under every radar. I really liked the style and the seamless blending of genres as well as the fourth wall breaking, it made it more unique.If you need to kill some time or you like movies about real people, this is a good choice. Definitely not the kind of movie you have to see on release in theatres, I'd say wait a few months and watch it in the comfort of your own home.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
news? propaganda? fake news?equal opportunity? fair treatment? this story is heart wrenching,"I remember Tonya Harding and the infamous incident: Wasn't she the one who...?
After watching this movie I am shocked how manipulated I was by the media coverage back then.
This movie doesn't make Tonya a lovable person, nor does it make her out to be something she wasn't - a graceful ice princess. But it does give you perspective of everything she should have had and didn't get: recognition of her athletic talent, support, and fair treatment.
At the same time it is funny in it's delivery of a heart rending truth of abuse, dismissal and bias that otherwise would have been too unbearable to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A re-telling of events of 1994 with a slightly different perspective,"I had mixed feelings while watching this excellent film and the great performances by Margot Robbie and Allison Janney.I followed every second of this scandal when it broke 25 years ago. I felt as many did that if Tonya couldn't find an ice show that would let her skate to Goodfellas, she might as well quit. She definitely knew what was going on, as she admitted in a recent interview.This film attempts to put her in a sympathetic light, and it does succeed - after all, she was abused by her mother physically and psychologically, her father left the family, she left school at 15 to devote herself to skating.Much is made of the fact that she wasn't the typical pretty skater with beautiful skating costumes. Well, that's a little twisted, as one who followed it from the beginning and followed figure skating for years.It may have been that behind the scenes, the ice skating profession didn't approve of her. But Tonya was pretty, despite what she says, and she wasn't the first skater who didn't come from money - far from it, nor was she the first skater whose mother sewed her costumes. Skating is very expensive, and families sacrifice a great deal to get their kids training, shoes, costumes, ice time, and everything that goes with it.The film tries to make it seem as if Tonya was the only one with these hardships. Nancy Kerrigan comes from a middle-class family, with a legally blind mother, and if you want to talk tabloid fodder, her brother was accused of killing her father.My major problem with Tonya has always been that she was a powerful skater, an excellent athlete, and she would have been on the Olympic team without anyone's knee being shattered. The subsequent notoriety and problems with her husband ruined her Olympic performance, which was sluggish - she was obviously out of shape. So what was accomplished?As the movie shows us, it's now years later. Tonya was young, she made some mistakes, time to move on. After some false starts, it seems like she has. Everyone deserves a second chance. She recently made a good splash on Dancing with the Stars (which I believe pays something like $200,000 - so not bad) and she still practices her skating. She's married and has a child.You can't leave the film without hoping that things continue to work out for her. The film gives us an interesting perspective on her early life, her bad marriage, the knee-bashing incident, and the stupid people who carried it out (some real dark comedy there).Highly recommended, and I hope Tonya's new momentum keeps going. Time to take some responsibility instead of being a victim and move on.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Well-Crafted Biopic Whose Only Plus Point Is Margot Robbie's Show-Stealing Performance,"Powered by knockout performances from both Margot Robbie & Allison Janney, I, Tonya brings the story of one of America's finest figure skaters to cinematic life in a stylish fashion but the impact of its emotionally resonant moments is rendered null by narrative choices that simply don't work together.I, Tonya tells the story of Tonya Harding, the first American woman to successfully land a triple axel in figure skating competition, and covers her ice skating journey from childhood to the controversial incident that ended her career for good. The plot also focuses on the abusive relationships that were part of her personal life.Directed by Craig Gillespie, the film employs narrative techniques like interviews shot in mockumentary style & fourth wall breaking but the only time it manages to be gripping is when our protagonist is on the ice rink. Her abuse at the hands of her mother & husband is disturbing to watch yet most of the time, it is played for laughs.Add to its off-putting humour, most characters in it are just spiteful. And though it gives us more reason to root for Tonya, the terrible choices she keeps making all her life only makes us question our investment in her journey. It's a tragic tale but it isn't treated right, or with respect, thus resulting in a movie that only impresses in bits n pieces.The white trash community isn't illustrated from any new angle. Camerawork is at its best when capturing Tonya doing what she does best. Pacing isn't an issue for the most part but a tighter editing could've resulted in a more compact structure. The stunt team that performed or choreographed the skating moments deserves kudos. And its musical choices are unusual yet fitting.Many moments are shot in a way so as to appear strikingly similar to the real-life footage and it also offers a number of takes on the scandal that eventually led to Tonya being banned from the sport. Filled to the brim with bums, there is nothing to like about any of the supporting characters plus they get way more screen time than required in the final print.Coming to the performances, I, Tonya is spearheaded by Margot Robbie's show-stealing performance as she plays her physically & emotionally demanding role with finesse and is at her absolute best during the final act. Much is made about Allison Janney's input but for me, it's Robbie who impresses the most. Sebastian Stan, however, plays a loser with effortless ease.On an overall scale, I, Tonya is a well-crafted biopic that could've been much more than what the filmmakers ultimately settle for. The various subplots aren't always aligned in the same direction, resulting in a narrative flow that isn't streamlined at all. It is entertaining and will manage to keep the audience around till the end but its fragmented structure hampers the film's prospect of being counted amongst the better examples of its genre(s).",,Anonymous,Biography
Better than expected - and really funny!,"Based on fact and dealing with serious issues, I loved the film's humorist narration. It was actually really funny!Margot Robbie portrays ice skater Tonya Harding, who's Mother, LaVona, wanted her to become a professional ice skater from the age of four. As a result, LaVona spent all her money on Tonya's training, and didn't really care for her much as a daughter. Allison Janney is fantastic as LaVona!Although I'm not a sports person - and generally don't like sport-themed movies - I actually really enjoyed 'I, Tonya', which I found interesting and entertaining. There's so much more here than just ice skating.The film is well photographed. The make-up is extremely well done. I also loved the soundtrack.

Well Done and Entertaining,"""I, Tonya"" kept me entertained from the first second to the last. The acting in this film is brilliant; Alison Janney as LaVona Golden shines in one of her best roles yet. Margot Robbie is phenomenal, and Sebastian Stan pulls it off brilliantly. The movie overall is extremely well acted, even if you're not keen on the story line or Tonya Harding herself, I think most could agree the actors are well immersed in their roles.The movie offers a different perspective on the notorious incident that happened in 1994 where Nancy Kerrigan was unfortunately assaulted by a hit man who based in her knee where she suffered severe bruising. The attack was then linked to Tonya, since it was her husband, Jeff Gilooly, who hired the hit man.. The movie explores what was going through her head at the time it all went down, as well as all of the layers that was going down that Tonya didn't even know about. In the end, it shows a fresher perspective on the issue, as well as, sees Tonya in a slightly more sympathetic light than other ways media presented her.Aside from the incident, the movie deeply explores Tonya's past, her heated relationship with her mother and the physically abusive one she had with her now ex-husband. The film also exposes how people who didn't grow up conventional are treated in the world of figure skating, and how that put's people like Tonya at a disadvantage. It's a very griping and raw film, the dialogue, editing, and performances are all stellar; I highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Margot Robbie deserves an Oscar,"Normally, actresses got an Oscar for emotional performances, and without any doubt, Margot does brilliant emotional acting in the movie ""I, Tonya"". But at the same time, you also have to consider the difficulty of the physical performances.

I think Margot does equally well in physical performances, and really deserves an Oscar.",,Anonymous,Biography

Although the movie is heartbreaking as you encounter the flair of tonya her greatness at skating soon enough you see how everything goes downhills and how a small event can change the whole life of a person.

Politics are the only thing that prevented Robbie from an Oscar win,"This movie attempts to make a dark comedy reminiscent of the Coen brothers' films. However, it never fully accentuates the comedic elements, leaving the viewers to wonder if they should be treating this movie as a comedy or as a documentary.Despite this confusion, the story is still interesting enough to keep the viewer's interest, but the real shine in this film comes from Robbie's performance. She portrays the role in an extremely convincing way, and her performance shows an extremely wide range of emotion. Her performance is absolutely outstanding, and I believe the real-life stigma against Tonya Harding is the only thing that held her back from the Oscar win. Robbie's performance outclasses McDormand's in every aspect.As for the other characters, Stan is the only one with any complex emotions. All the other characters are extremely one-dimensional, and I'm not really sure why this year's best supporting actress went to such a one-dimensional character, even if that single dimension was acted well.So in summary, the supporting actors aren't particularly outstanding, and the storytelling is somewhat confusing, but the story is still interesting enough to move between Robbie's scenes, and her scenes make the movie well worth the watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
American infamy,"Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie) comes from poor white trash and her domineering, abusive mother LaVona (Allison Janney). She had a natural talent for skating from a young age and driven by her unrelenting mother. At 15, she meets Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan). Despite her mother or maybe to spite her mother, she marries Gillooly who slowly turns more and more violent. Her ability to execute the triple axel jump puts her above her competitors but her lower class crass personality clashes with the judges. In the 1992 Winter Olympics, she fails to medal coming in fourth. She falls back into waitressing when her former coach Diane convinces her to return for the 1994 Winter Olympics. During the leadup, she would be embroiled in an infamous incident with fellow skater Nancy Kerrigan.It's funny at times with an undertone of Greek tragedy. It is pure delicious white trash infamy. It's great material and this movie has fun with it. It does have two hurdles to overcome. First is the unreliable narrator. The movie does play with this from a couple of different angles. It would be nice to play up even more this idea. It's fun and it inoculates against any slant in the story telling. The second is Margot Robbie's age. She's asked to play a very wide range from 15 all the way to present day. She doesn't look the part as a 15 year old. The movie could have played with that by claiming that she looked old for her age. It could be a funny jab at the filmmaking compromises. Quite frankly, she fits more after her failure in 92 and the movie works better as a struggling underdog. The more downtrodden the better she fits the role. Neither hurdle is major and both can be excused. Both Margot and Allison are terrific. Overall, this is a fun take on an infamous American story.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Sympathetic Perspective,"I don't remember the actual Nancy Kerrigan assault and the ensuing media fallout because I was too young, so I didn't enter with any preconceived notions of what really happened. They don't try to definitively say if Tonya Harding ordered the attack, because we will probably never know for certain, but they frame her potential innocence as a strong possibility. That seems absurd until you realize the incredible stupidity of her ex-husband and his friends. The film plays out as a dark comedy following the extremely unlikely rise of Tonya Harding from trailer trash to one of the top figure skaters in the world through all of the adversity with an institution that didn't want any part of her.Margot Robbie is excellent, if a little too tall, as Tonya, channeling the anger and drive that propelled Tonya to greatness and may have led to her downfall. Allison Janney is fantastic as her abusive, hateful mother in a performance that will earn her a surefire Oscar nod. Sebastian Stan is also pretty good in an almost unrecognizable performance as her unhinged ex-husband. Ultimately, I was left feeling a little sorry for Tonya because they took the only thing she could do away from her by banning her from skating.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
This is not Tonya Harding's revenge but Margot Robbie's triumph...,"This is the story of the most gorgeous actress of her generation: Margot Robbie. At the age of 23, she got her first break playing the 'Karen Hill' role in Scorsese's ""Wolf of Wall Street"" and took away Jennifer Lawrence's status as the ""it"" when by the sole power of a tight pink skirt and high-heel shoe, she put the big Leo on all fours. One cameo in ""The Big Short"" and one leap into stardom in ""Suicide Squad"" later, the young actress figured out it was time to earn the recognition of the peers. And so she got an idea: producing a movie... about Tonya Harding.Tonya Harding, the little girl from Oregon who sealed her name in infamy after a certain incident with Nancy Kerrigan. You remember it, I do remember it, the 90s born Robbie didn't even know that it was real but the producer could see the full potential of the story: a real-life athlete, a psychological case and the coolest-to-hate American after Nixon, in other words: an Oscar darling. But then Robbie the producer decided to let Robbie the actress play the infamous ice skater. After all, she's got the money, the idea, why shouldn't she get herself the opportunity of a role that was more in the physical vicinity of Amy Adams.Because Robbie looks nothing like Tonya, she's half-a-foot taller, she has that glamorous face bone structure that made her the perfect Sharon Tate or the younger version of Sharon Stone (as a matter of fact, she looks closer to Nancy Kerrigan) but no, she'd play the tiny, homely and insecure Tonya who looked like a teenager even as an adult. Talk about suspension of disbelief. I wouldn't be surprised if she plays Mother Theresa some day... but you know what? It doesn't even matter if Kevin Hart plays Witt Chamberlain. Robbie knew everyone would bite at the transformative role and the trifecta of sure-to-be-nominated themes it brought: sport, family troubles and nervous breakdowns. And so she got her Oscar nomination and career-leverage. Strategically speaking, a triple axel.Now, this is another story of an Australian director named Craig Gillepsie. He didn't know much about Portland Oregon and assumed that everyone growing up in a poor small-town background would turn out to ugly, slobbish and ignorant, he didn't want to approach the real-life protagonists and thought a use of their contradictory testimonies would make for a good comedy drama with that authentic texture à la ""Goodfellas"". And so he decided to interrupt beating scenes with nods to the audience and bone-breaking with fourth wall-breaking, if we can't understand these persons, let's laugh at their expenses. Gee, even Marty seemed to have a little more respect to his subjects.And speaking of Marty, Gillepsie figured the story would be edited with a lot of loud music following a very fast-paced patterns of beatings and reconciliations, like in ""Casino"" and unstoppable voice-over. He was the result and thought it would be fun to turn the whole thing into a sort of comment about media frenzy and make it a mockumentary a la ""Natural Born Killers"" with the protagonists talking to a camera. And so, instead of allowing the audience to dissect the character's actions and understand them, everything is just said right on-the-nose because white trash doesn't deserve subtlety.And so this is the story of a film that doesn't exactly knows what it tries to be: docu-drama, comedy drama emulating the style of Scorsese, it becomes ""Fight Club"" when characters address us, there's even a point at 44 minutes where it's exactly the succession of shots a la ""Requiem for a Dream"". And so the combination of styles earned Tatiana S. Rigel a nomination for Editing for accomplishing the kind of stuff any flashy student can do to show off. Fine for her and the editing is indeed spellbinding but it turns the drama into a messy joke.At the end, the film was nominated for Golden Globes' Best Comedy because that's what it is, for Hollywood, playing losers getting at each other in the arena of mediocrity. Pretending the film wasn't trying to sympathize with Tonya but just give her a break is pure bull, the film doesn't know how to handle heavy material and so goes the easy way; turning humor into a weapon and laughing at the expenses of others. But who cares Hollywood would bite the bait. Though Gillepsie didn't get a nomination.Finally, this is the story of a great character actress who finally got an Oscar for a role she could play in her sleep. But I'm not surprised in the era where Brad Pitt got his Oscar for playing it cool and showing his abs, Allison Janney looks mean, smokes constantly, keeps a perpetual death-glare mask on her face and she swears, swears a lot. I have nothing against these role getting nominations, it's part of the game but I want someone to explain to me how difficult they are. The more limitations you have, the easier it is to make your character match them, I'm sorry but ithe character of LaVona might even be five-dimensional but's it's a one-note performance, Laurie Metcalf had a more complex figure to play in ""Lady Bird"" but the Academy tend to go to the obvious, fair enough.And so that's the story of a film that took one Oscar in 2018.But that's not the story of Tonya Harding, who didn't speak to an audience when getting punched, whose fights weren't mixed with 80's/90s hit songs, and I was surprised that the trivialization of domestic violence in the ""me too"" year went over the Academy's heads....anyway, the pint-sized skater ceased to be the villain, she tried to reconstruct herself and get over it but just when she thought we'd forget about her ""I, Tonya"" pulled her back in and made Margot Robbie a Hollywood A-Star.The film isn't Tonya Harding's revenge, it's Margot Robbie's triumph.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Extremely impressive depiction of a controversial, ambiguous narrative","Coming from a perspective of knowing relatively little about the Harding scandal, I'm very impressed by the way Gillespie attacks the challenging and controversial topic. Robbie delivers a phenomenal performance, one of the best of the year, and Janney also does a very good job. What is so difficult is the contradictory narratives given by the media, Tonya, and Gillooy. Rather than piece them together and frame it as a clean, neat narrative, Gillespie turns it on its head by emphasizing the contradictions and how truth as a concept and particularly in popular culture is so loaded and complex. Devices such as split screens and breaking the fourth wall are employed effectively to underscore the fuzzy nature of truth. The way Tonya's character is explained and built up is also very well done and allows you to really connect with her emotionally and understand how the events unfolded. The ending was truly heart wrenching, and in general the movie did an excellent job of staying true to how things really unfolded. The script and direction both blew me away and were among the best of the year. Very impressive and well-rounded depiction of a crazy true story, with Robbie leading the way.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Abuse isn't funny,"More than a few critics have described this biopic as a comedy, and they're right - assuming that you find child abuse and domestic violence funny. But of course they are not funny, and it's cruel and contemptible to call this film based on Tonya Harding's sad life a comedy.For the first two decades of her life Tonya was subjected to the most extreme mental and emotional abuse imaginable by a mother who made Joan Crawford seem like a saint by comparison. She tried to escape her living hell by marrying a loser who physically abused her. It is a miracle that throughout this relentless torment she was still able to concentrate on her skating and to find the focus, both mental and physical, that is required to compete at an Olympic level.Margot Robbie gives a bravura performance capturing Tonya Harding's mannerisms, speech and even her skating. Allison Janney plays Tonya's monster of a mother in an Oscar winning performance of her own. The tragedy of watching this poor girl, deprived of love, kindness, protection and ultimately her future, surely deserves our pity. Seeing her persevere to survive such adversity while sharpening her skills to skate like a champion surely deserves our admiration.

Very disappointing,"After all of the buzz, I, Tonya struck me as being little more than a sad commentary on the state of contemporary white trash America.

IMDb format needs to just stop,"Tonya 
If given to a more capable director, this could have been so much better. This is frankly not worth paying to watch. The acting is good enough and the story it is based on is compelling enough however this is almost amateurish when it comes to the decisions made, like showing the interviews AND having the characters break the fourth wall, it gets old fast considering that both techniques serve the same purpose. And the film focuses on secondary characters far more than it should. This film should have never made it to the big screen. This is one of those smaller ""made for television"" type of deals. Shame on you Hollywood, calling this indie when it isn't and pawning - whatever, this review is over.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Absolutely Insane,"This is one of the most unique movies of 2017 I have seen. It takes an incident that is deadly serious, and transforms it into this whimsical, eccentric, fourth wall-breaking mania fest without ever minimizing the severity of the situation, which is a nearly impossible task. From the opening shot, I was whisked away by this film. This is a movie that could be categorized as a ""ride"", which is a strange way to put it but it oddly fits. You get a great sense that every single character in this movie is chemically imbalanced, but they all justify their actions through their own twisted thinking. Margot Robbie is excellent as Tonya Harding. She completely disappears in the role, as she shows us how unbalanced Harding is, while also simultaneously trying to convince us that she's in the right. Through an ingenious use of video confessionals, we get to see multiple perspectives on different events, and we get a window into how each characters' minds work. Every character thinks they are right and everyone else is wrong, and the film captures these mindsets in a really fascinating way. Allison Janney steals the show every time she is on screen. She is brutal and ruthless, but you can understand why she is the way she is...",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Well done but story left me cold,"We went along to see this movie mostly because we wanted to see Alison Janney's performance. She doesn't disappoint and her Supporting Actress nominations are well deserved. Margot Robbie also delivers an excellent performance and appears to do most of her own skating in the movie.The problem with the movie for this viewer was that by the end, I still wasn't any the wiser about Tonya's level of prior knowledge or involvement in the planning of the attack on fellow skater, Nancy Kerrigan, but actually I just didn't care. The attack on Kerrigan was a shocking thing, but she went on to win Olympic silver. At the end of the movie, I didn't care about who knew what and who was involved or about Tonya's upbringing and abusive husband. The whole thing left me indifferent.I do think it's a shame that Tonya Harding is getting renewed attention and publicity with the release of the movie. There are thousands of people with more interesting stories out there waiting to be told on the big screen.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing Movie...Unbelievable Acting....Brilliant!,"I saw ""I, Tonya"" last night because there was nothing else starting at the time. I am SO glad I did get to see it.What an amazing performance by Margot Robbie and Allison Janney. I cannot say enough about their acting. It was definitely OSCAR worthy.The plot, the cinematography, the script, the acting and the skating performances were all perfect....bordering on amazing.Margot Robbie is the real deal....she has some serious acting skills...way to go!And for the real Tonya....big hug from me!This is an amazing movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Judged by the media and for being famous,"All in all, this film is about 7/10. But uneven as it is, it has aspects worthy of a 10 and others worthy of about 3. It just tries a bit too hard to be entertaining resulting in a loss of credibility. It's hard to really relate to.The most engaging thing about I, Tonya is its energy. Craig Gillespie is a talented film maker (wonderful Lars and the Real Girl) working really hard to keep things always on the move. He is helped greatly by editor Tatiana S. Riegel, nominated for an Oscar. On the other hand, Gillespie kind of shoots himself in the leg by rolling a never-ending collection of pop songs, some of which are way over-used already. Case in point: Gillespie doesn' realize/care that Supertramp's Goodbye, Stranger is, in a way, ""owned"" by Magnolia. It seems a dull choice here. Note, also, that the film is largely modeled after The Big Short's irreverent style.Actors in this film written, surprisingly enough, by Captain America are uniformly great, but Margot Robbie really deserves to be up for an Oscar. She has scale, fury, presence and great technique to pull of playing the real Tonya she resembles in almost no way (really, the height difference, the face etc.). Robbie is the real show here. But they are all great, from Sebastian Stan to Paul Walter Hauser.Then there's the hugely entertaining Allison Janney. It's a great performance, but also troublesome. Tonya's mom is a ""real piece of work"". A truly horrible mother. But, Janney makes her fiercely unapologetic character so charismatic and funny, that the true monstrousness doesn't surface. It's a sleazy choice, if you think about it, trivializing abuse. Same criticism goes for the marital abuse Tonya has to suffer. It's played here as entertainment.And entertainment this movie is. That is why almost no time is spent with Tonya's grueling training, the greatest power that shaped her adolescence. Thus, we don't really get a grasp of the quantity of sacrifice she made as child and a youth. And the movie is still overlong.Among the things I, Tonya does really well is putting things in perspective and revealing the falsehoods we've accepted in a different light. As the film's passionate claim goes, Tonya was responsible for next to nothing relating to the assault on Nancy Kerrigan. Yet, she suffered the biggest punishment and is still the main ""bad guy"" in the public eye. I, Tonya drives this point forcefully to home, and kudos for that.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
What a story,"I have to admit, I was not familiar with the story of Tonya Harding. It might even be a good thing since the events of the story seem even more unbelievable and have a bigger impact. All the characters are a bit crazy but still very interesting in their own way. And you really feel for Tonya Harding since after all, she only wanted to skate and be successful. She achieved success but had to overcome endless hurdles along the way proving that you should never give up on your dreams no matter the odds. Performances are great, especially from Allison Janney and Paul Walter Hauser who played Shawn and captured his delusional character with perfection. Another positve thing about I, Tonya is a really great soundtrack containing classic songs from the 70's and 80's.Definitely recommended and you do not have to know anything about figure skating to enjoy this film since the story itself, characters, good performances and music will take care of that.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A dark comedy of many, many errors","In the history of American competitive athletics, there are a few moments that stand the test of time and are remembered many years after they happen. One of these moments is profiled in 'I, Tonya' - the 2017 quasi-fictional documentary-style film that follows the tumultuous life of former U.S. figure skater Tonya Harding (portrayed here by Margot Robbie), who had a swift rise to the top of the podium and an even swifter fall from grace thanks to the actions of her former husband.But 'Tonya' is about more than just ""the incident"" (as it's referred to in the film) - it takes us behind the curtain to see how the self-professed redneck was able to defy the odds, fending off constant verbal and physical abuse from her monster mother, LaVona (played brilliantly by Allison Janney), and her one-time husband, Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan), to make the U.S. Olympic team twice in two years. 'Tonya' is filmed in an unusual way, where the story's characters are interviewed present day, reflecting back on the events, and we then see these events play out. Director Craig Gillespie takes liberties with this approach, doing things like having the actors break the third wall multiple times to dialogue with the audience and editing together reflections to tell a disjointed story.But as serious as this story could be, since it's not a happy one, it's interesting to see how much sarcasm is injected into 'Tonya.' Of course, this was likely something that was cleared with Harding herself, but it still is almost shocking to see some of the things that are depicted onscreen and are then basically shrugged off. Because Gillooly and her mother were such domineering personalities who controlled Harding, the relationships are what drive the entire film more than anything else. Also not lost on us is the stupidity of nearly everyone involved here - from the attack on Nancy Kerrigan to the cover up, it's like a comedy of error after error - and everything is captured in a way that makes it feel almost unreal.'I, Tonya' is not an amazing film in and of itself, but it's a vehicle through which standout acting performances are carried. And for that reason, it should be recognized.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wolf of Wall Street meets Dumb and Dumber - On Ice,"One of those annoying movies that sucks you in with a captivating and somewhat strong start. It even had a couple of laughs. Then it just descends into boring, disjointed monotony that you don't really care for. But by then, you've wasted too much of your life on it - so you wrestle with abandoning or pushing through.At times felt like Wolf of Wall Street meets Dumb and Dumber On Ice. But ultimately, just felt like 2 hours of domestic violence.It has an absolute killer soundtrack and great use of music throughout. And sure, there are some strong performances, notably by Margot Robbie (doing us Aussies proud) and Allison Janney - but they didn't necessarily keep me engaged with the film. It all just felt overly long and drawn out.I knew nothing about Tonya Harding going into this, and don't think my life is any better for having watched this either. I'm going to stick with Cool Runnings and Eddie the Eagle until a Steven Bradbury biopic is made.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Going for the Gold,"""The haters always say, Tonya tell the truth! There's no such thing as truth.""What is the truth? Is it what we hear about through other sources (gossip, the press, television, social media) or is it only what we want the truth to be? ""I, Tonya"" takes on the controversial true story of Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan and the violent figure skating mele that shocked the nation 24 years ago this month. But despite the age gap, ""I, Tonya"" is a film for our times. The complicated insanity of this particular story mirrors so much of what we've been living through in this country lately. A time of anxiety, fear and paranoia of who to trust, what is right from wrong and what on earth is about to come next.You would think, in that sense, that ""I, Tonya"" would make a mockery of Tonya Harding. You would think that Hollywood would portray her as a piece of white trash from fly-over-country who got everything she deserved. We love to do this to each other. We enjoy a gladiator show of reaffirming our popular views in the court of public opinion. But ""I, Tonya"" chooses not to go down that path. Instead, it chooses an area just as problematic.. siding with Tonya Harding. Based on what we know about the case from the initial news reports, it isn't wise for any critical thinker to take Harding's word for what actually happened. We will never know for sure if she was an accomplice in the attack on Nancy Kerrigan or not. She was, at the very least, complicit in Jeff Gillooly's bungled attempt at sabotage. But in the end, does all of this really matter? Did we as viewers find it problematic that GoodFellas was based on Henry Hill's account of his time in the Mafia? Did we find it unsettling as Boogie Nights recounted the awful story of the Wonderland murders and the tragedy of pornstar John Holmes? We all did, but those are two great films. I, Tonya is a great film.I adored every last frame of this film. It is precisely the kind of energy and inspiration that keeps me going to the movies. Fearless, powerful, raw and most importantly, real. Craig Gillespie holds nothing back. Steven Roger's amazing screenplay doesn't mince words. By far and beyond, it is the best edited film of 2017. Clearly reminiscent of Thelma Schoonmaker. The icing on the cake are the performances. Margot Robbie is electrifying as Tonya Harding. Sebastian Stan plays the utterly despicable Jeff Gillooly perfectly. A soft spoken dummy and a wife beater. His portly companion Shawn Eckhardt (played by Paul Walter Hauser) is a full-on riot. The worst hitman in human history. A conspiracy nut who orchestrated an international incident from his parent's house and willingly exposed himself to the FBI. You could only find this kind of stupid in America. The role that everyone is talking about is Allison Janey's shocking portray of Tonya's mother, LaVona Fay Golden. A commanding on-screen performance for the ages. She's a horrifying cross between Nurse Ratched and Terence Fletcher. Sometimes, the film plays up a lot of the abuse that Tonya took from Golden and Gillooly, much of it violent. It is more matter of fact, than funny. At times, it's painful to sit through. But then two seconds later, you are laughing at a funny quip from any of the characters on screen. This is real life. It's horrifying, it's funny, it's absurd. Take the trip and you will love it as much as I did.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Interesting and entertaining look at one of the biggest ""villains"" of the 90s.","This one is all about the performances. Robbie and Janney steal the show as daughter and mother. I'd say with ease that both deserve nominations. Robbie's performance is equal amounts charisma, persona, comedy, and hope. There are numerous scenes in which her eyes carry more weight than any plot point or a piece of dialogue. There are a few scenes, in particular, where her strength, expression, and persona crumbles upon just seeing her mother. It's devastating.The movie itself has The Wolf of Wall Street watchability in that it deals with some despicable people and acts in a lighthearted mockumentray style, and is about as good, too. There are several scenes that have intentional tonal clashes, where like the aforementioned WoWS, you'll be thinking, ""Did I just laugh at that?"" Yes, you did, you heartless bastard. But it was funny, indeed.I, Tonya is a very good movie that'll make you laugh, it'll make you angry, and it'll make you sympathize with Harding. Most of all, it takes these numerous unreliable narrators, and crafts a story that feels genuine.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

This movie gives you a different prospective.,"I can remember the incident in 1994 and being from the other side of the pond, I had formed the opinion that Tonya was just a cheat. However the movie gives a good insight into Tonyas life and the difficulties she faced not coming from a stereotypical all American family. Her biggest mistake by far was hooking up with Jeff he basically ruined her career. She definitely had the talent and the drive to be the best in the world, but sadly she will probably always be remembered for the Nancy incident.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Disjointed And Clunky,"Look, I like figure skating so I was excited to see this! However once it finished I was just left feeling confused and quite frankly, bored. Tonya is a compelling lead, and Margot Robbie plays her brilliantly. But the editing, choice of story telling and overall feel to the movie just feels slow and clunky.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Uncovering a seamy underbelly,"An interesting thing happened to the audience (and to me) in the full theater that I was in when attending I, TONYA - the documentary-style behind-the-scenes look into the infamous ""event"" in 1994 between U.S. Figure Skaters Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding.The audience entered the theater expecting a rollicking good time - and at the beginning, laughs were a-plenty. But, about 10 minutes in, the mood began to change. I know I started getting uncomfortable laughing AT these players. I was beginning to get disturbed by them and as the movie unfolded, the raucous laughter turned into nervous laughter and then turned into somber silence, so - by the end - you did not know whether to laugh or cry at (with?) these characters/people.A good deal of this feeling has to do with the work of the three leads in this film. As the titular Tonya Harding, Margot Robbie continues to show that she is an actress and not just a pretty face. Her Tonya has a strong will to succeed despite the odds but also, as a defense mechanism, has an uncanny way of twisting the truth to land on the phrase ""this is not my fault"". It is this denial that, at first, is funny, but later is sad. As shown in this film, Tonya brings on quite a bit of her problems on herself and then blames others for her actions/faults, causing a cascade of negative consequences.Matching Robbie's delusion is Sebastian Stan as Robbies abusive husband Jeff Gillooly. Another actor that continues to grow and to show that he is more than just his Marvel SuperHero (Bucky Barnes, the Winter Soldier), Gillooly is a loser that sees his chance for winning in Harding's superb skating skills. The glimpses into this dysfunctional, abusive relationship is hard to watch, if you strip away the cartoonish nature of their characters and see the real dysfunction underneath.But both of these actors/characters pale in comparison to Allison Janney's performance as Harding's Tiger Mom LaVona Golden. This is an unsympathetic, driven character that will help her daughter win by sheer force of will if she has to. Janney's performance is superb, unwavering and stern - and that is both a compliment and a complaint. She plays Golden with a driven one-note performance. There is no nuance here - you know what you're going to get, so you just sit and wait for the inevitable blow-up to happen. Janney will most certainly be nominated for an Academy Award for her performance - and she deserves to be - but I wished that there was a little more nuance (or variety) to this extremely watchable character.But that's not the film that Director Craig Gillespie wanted to show. This is a ""warts and all"" portrayal of the people and events of 1994 and so his camerawork is just as unflinching as the character's perspective on what happened unfolds. Only Stan's Gillooly seems to be truly sorry for what had transpired, the rest still sit in the delusion that what they did was ""right"" or ""wasn't my fault"".Which makes I, TONYA interesting - and a bit disturbing - to watch.Letter Grade: B+8 (out of 10) stars and you can take this to the Bank(ofMarquis)",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A comedic great tale,I didn't know what to expect coming into this film and I'm definitely pleased. I knew vaguely of the story and it makes more sense to me now seeing all of the conflicting opinions. The interviews were great relief and the skating scenes were tense just as it should be. I thought Tanya's husband was great in this and her mother's portrayal as well. This definitely kept my attention as she fought for her right to be at the olympics and navigated everyone wanting a piece of her. I felt for Tanya by the end and definitely wish I could go back to some of the athletic feats of my past. I would recommend this as a historically relevant film given the role news has as well.,7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Remarkable.,"Bloody hell if there wasn't an undercurrent of dark farcical humour to this, you'd cut your wrists inside 20 minutes. I can't say I knew much about Tonya Harding and I'm gonna take all this with a pinch of salt. What we have here is what I suspect is the general gist of events, but with the drama dialled up... and there's a lot of drama. Harding is not a quiet character and Margot Robbie plays her with the volume turned all the way up. Poverty, casual domestic violence and an expletive count that scores 10 across the board, it's pretty gritty or perhaps as Harding suggests during videotape style pieces-to-camera, it's real. It's all punctuated with some really lovely stuff on the ice with the camerawork being almost as spectacular as the skating. This film though isn't about finesse, it's about the lack of and works as a perfect accompaniment to Harding herself. It's a raw struggle of pretty stupid people, living in a stupid class system, in a country that appears, at least in part obsessed with competition and hatred. A quite remarkable story, told remarkably.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Awesome movie,"I was a little familiar with this story being a 90s kid but anything involving these 2 I'm interested in. The story is full of differences: beauty & being homely, rich & poor, etc. Initially I would've thought Tonya was the predator but as I find out more about her story (this film included) I believe she was just as much a victim as Kerrigan.

Paul captured Shawn's completely break from reality and Stan I've never seen play someone so wormy and violent.Please watch if you haven't!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Skating Around the Truth.,"I didn't really know what to expect from this movie, nor did I come into it with any expectations, and what it ultimately ended up being was a pretty funny, fun, and more importantly, refreshingly grounded in reality biopic, and I mean that mostly based on how the movie concluded.I enjoyed all of the actors' performances, from Margot Robbie and Sabastian Stan, to Allison Janney and definitely Bobby Cannavale, while I found the story's clashing perspectives that created a kind of skating around the truth quite interesting and humorous.However, though the film did receive a Best Film Editing Academy nomination, I didn't particularly like its editing, and I may have found it to perhaps be the movie's most lacking aspect, but overall, I did enjoy I, Tonya. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Hardings and Giloolys stories laid on the table-you decide....,"Amazing film- the director handled the material objectively and with fantastic character development. Getting to know Tonya Harding was a trip. She came from the depths of poverty and abuse with no connections, yet used her considerable fortitude and discipline to sculpt her natural talent into skating gold. I loved the fact she could fix cars, shoot guns and sew her own clothing from scratch. Yes other skaters work hard, but most have the luxury of money and support at home. Tonya Harding had none of this; she wore the badge of 'white trash' and fought biased judges and the elitist skating community making her achievements ever the more exceptional. 
The Kerrigan attack is presented quite differently between Hardings and Gilooly's retelling. The movie leaves the viewer to decide on what really happened. And as in all memories of our personal stories, the mind colours events and distorts truth. I love this movie for letting us decide.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

An acting driven biopic with little else going for it,"I, Tonya is quite a mixed bag. The subject matter is pretty difficult for any writer or director to take on so it isn't surprising that the film falls flat in every area except acting (mostly) because neither the writer or director have shown themselves to be capable of tackling such a difficult subject.The movie isn't really bad it is just a very standard biopic with less than stellar writing and exceptional acting in most cases.
Margot Robbie deserves to be mentioned as someone who is showing to be a very good leading lady in drama, however I didn't believe the character of Tonya Harding in the film and I thought she was written poorly. Margot's acting was fine considering what was written for her, but the character wasn't written as ""white trash-charming"" as she should have been.Allison Janney is marvelous as the harsh and unforgiving mother of Tonya.
Her performance was believable and her character was very well written so I guess you could say that she was the real star of this movie. She was the only character in the movie that fit perfectly.Sebastian Stan was fine. I didn't hate his character and that's bad. His character wasn't written correctly at all but again, the actor did fine with what he was given.The movie sometimes does not know what it wants to be, editing wise. It has some pretty weird choices that I was able to follow but really shouldn't have needed to. In the beginning it has an interview style, then it goes away, then comes back again, then goes away and so on. Its just annoying and it should have been written as a standard biopic.
The second half of the movie that focuses on ""the incident"" is tedious and annoying and not what needs to be seen when talking about Tonya Harding. At no point in the movie except when Tonya said it , did I feel how important skating is for her.This movie could have been way better and I blame the writer and director for its mediocrity. Margot and Allison did a wonderful job, Allison especially, and I'd consider both of them an awards contender.

'There's no such thing as truth'.,"Before this movie, I've never heard of Tonya Harding, here in Spain the incident wasn't that famous, so this story was completely new for me.
I really liked the way they shot the movie, it was great seeing the actors talk direct to the camera telling some facts or their characters sides of story, it gave it more authenticity.
All of the performances were brilliant, Margot, Allison and Sebastian are outstanding, they did an amazing job carrying the weight of this movie.
What I liked most about it was how they told this complex story, how you can see everyone's point of view and at the end you can choose to believe whatever you want. For me there were moments that I could totally feel what Tonya felt at that time, I actually felt sorry for her, she deserved much better.

"I, Tonya Review","I, Tonya is a film directed by Craig Gillespie. I hadn't known about this film until, I heard about the Golden Globe nominations. This film also got some rave reviews, which increased my curiosity for the film. So I finally decided to give it a watch without watching any trailers. And I can say that I wasn't disappointed.Plot: The life and times of Tonya Harding, a professional ice skater and the 1994 controversy that led to her subsequent downfall.Story and direction: This film is not your conventional biopic. The makers decided a different way to go about it, which works quite a lot in the film. It employs the fourth wall breaking and mockumentary technique, which fascinated me a lot. The characters also are varied and interesting. We have Tonya who from her childhood itself was hardened to become strong and stand for herself. Then is LaVona, Tonya's mother, who is very hard on her and wants to make her daughter stand on her own and fight for herself. We also have Jeff, Tonya's husband, who has various shades for his character. And finally, Shawn, Jeff's friend, who is that dumb person everyone has in their life. The skating shots also looked very real. It never felt that a stunt double was doing the skating and it was edited so beautifully to make it look like one shot. The selection of music is great too. I felt like dancing in each of the soft rock numbers that played on screen. But this film has some issues that bug me. For instance, towards the last act the film felt quite rushed. And also some characters were just kind of not given that screen space which should have been done.Performances: Margot Robbie did it again. She never failed to impress. From sad to happy she yet again proves how fine an actress she is. Sebastian Stan was also great. I didn't expect this kind of a performance out of him. Allison Janney just killed it. The way she adapted to LaVona Harding was awesome. She just mesmerized me. Bobby Cannavale was restricted to only the interview parts of the film, but still it's always fun to watch him.Favorite Scene: The scene where LaVona warns Tonya about Jeff right after Tonya's wedding. We see a mother's worry and a daughter just not caring about what the mother thinks of her choice. This is the kind of scene that takes place between every mother and daughter even now, which touched me a lot.Verdict: Although there are a few hiccups, I, Tonya doesn't have a single dull moment. I liked the not-so conventional take on a biopic. Do watch this film for some awesome performances and the great soundtrack.I am going with an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Absurdist comedy retelling of the Tonya Harding story. Much of it is accurate.,"I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. Perhaps the biggest thing to keep in mind is the overview at the beginning, """"Based on irony free, wildly contradictory, totally true interviews with Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillooly."" The interviews were true, not all the details could have been.Meaning the story here in the movie is pretty much what the principal characters had to say but each one had his or her own version of ""the truth."" Throughout the movie characters commonly look into the camera and speak, as if they are speaking to us, the audience.The climax of the whole story of course is the incident where Harding's main rival, Nancy Kerrigan, was clubbed on the leg after a practice session in an attempt to remove her from future competitions by breaking her leg. Margot Robbie is a reasonable Tonya. But even more impressive is Allison Janney as Tonya's abusive mom, LaVona.Much of the movie is presented in an almost absurdist style and frankly is very entertaining. Most of the time. I remember Tonya and Nancy very well, it is interesting revisiting that time in this movie's presentation of the ""facts.""",,Anonymous,Biography

It could very possibly be that the whole truth hasn't been shown or the movie favors Tonya in certain aspects. This could very much be the case but from what I feel, the movie did justice to the characters be it Tonya or Nancy. At first I thought that the bodyguard was intentionally shown to be that stupid but after watching his tape at the end of the movie it became pretty clear that he was actually that daft in real life! It was indeed his stupidity which lead to the incident and further lead to the downward spiral of Tonya's life.The movie was very well directed, no scene felt unnecessary. The movie didn't feel as if it was being dragged on and on. It was crisp and to the point. The actors did a phenomenal job. Each and everyone in the cast perfectly embodied the characters they were playing, which becomes evident when you see the tapes at the end of the movie. All in all it was an enjoyable watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Muddled biopic,"Boasting tremendous performances from it's leads, this biopic ultimately deflates under the weight of it's lofty expectations. Following Tonya's life from childhood to present day, we see the events leading up to her brush with the headlines, and find out what's happened since. Marketed as a comedy, your level of hilarity would depend on how amusing you find abuse and dysfunction. Providing no ultimate catharsis, we go along for the ride. It's an amusing one, following a predictable path, and leaving the viewer a little cold. We have great actors in limited roles. Allison Janney won a well deserved Supporting Actress nod for her lip curling performance as Tonya's mother. You'll probably enjoy once, but not much should linger.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Surprisingly Feel Good Movie,"I have to give credit to the people behind this movie. They could have easily made a feel-good Nancy Kerrigan movie, hired some adequate actors, and made a ton of money. But they decided to tell a good story, make us re-think what we remember, and make a great movie. Just when you think the film industry is nothing but cheap sequels, remakes, yawning rom-coms, and the same-old looking/feeling comic book movies, they slap you in the face with something fresh.Honestly, I went to this movie for one reason: to see Harley Quinn in a skating uniform, doing those intensely sexy skating maneuvers. And I did get those incredible scenes, but honestly, they were the boring part of the movie. Call me ignorant, but I didn't know much about the Harding/Kerrigan incident. I didn't know Harding was so poor, that she was a skating pioneer, that Kerrigan only bruised her knee, and that she still ended up winning Silver.That's why I titled this review a Feel Good Movie. Before this movie, when I thought of Tanya Harding, it made me mad thinking someone could be so evil they would assault and cheat just to win. My blood pressure would rise even though I didn't know the whole story. Now thinking of her name makes me think of this movie and how great it is. And replacing hate with laughter definitely feels good!I wish they would make more movies like this. Take public figures that are in general disliked but not well known. If a movie can humanize a person who is vilified by public opinion, it's a recipe for a successful movie. There must be an endless supply of people that fit this mold: Michael Vick, Barry Bonds, Prince Charles come immediately to mind. They all have stories most people haven't heard, and if you're going to hate somebody, you better have the whole story.I've been talking to alot of people trying to convince them to see this movie, and they all say the same thing...Tanya Harding doesn't deserve a movie, or the movie will be tabloid garbage. But don't watch it for either of those things. The movie is smart and hilarious. Robbie's acting was so good, I wouldn't be surprised if she got Oscar nominated. It very much reminds me of when Charlize Theron won the Oscar for monster. She played a hateable anti-hero where the acting and story softens the hate. She also downplayed her gorgeousness for the role just like Robbie. Allison Janney was also terrific, although her character was much more one-dimensional and a smaller role.This is one of those movies that will stick with you weeks after you see it. If you're sitting around doing nothing, you'll find yourself thinking about certain scenes and how great they were. I don't know how historically accurate the movie is and I don't care. It's a great movie regardless.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Beyond the Trash,"I, Tonya is trash made into art. A real surprise as far as I am concerned, I was immediately seduced by this movie, by its way to blend comedy and drama as well as navigating the thin line between documentary and editorial. It is also a blast to watch - there is hardly a dull moment.As a sideway comment, some have said that Harding was a victime of violence - I tend to disagree; She probably was a product of petty, everyday violence, a part of it. Violence was her norm, the un-told yet practical norm of the society around her, and she wasn't a stranger in ditching some of it around too. Likewise, neither her mustachied husband or mother hated her - they just loved her in their own inept way, because both of them came from the same environment. Such an entourage prevented Harding from accomplishing the American Dream, and yet all the while they thought they were doing the best thing for her. They were, of course, wrong.All of this drama is played with levity, by well-directed actors in a tale told in the most honest manner possible. The film doesn't want to pass as an infallible teller but rather as doing what it can according to the different versions they've got, which provides us with some fourth wall comments, but all of them fit wonderfully with the movie's format. Robbie offers here the best performence of her (quite successful) career, of course, but Allison Janey and Paul Walter Hauser, helped by their larger-than-life characters (the villains of the movie, some would say) shine through the screen in every scene they appear in, in spite of having both a light touch.Truely interesting movie. Not so much for the splendid special effect or photography (which is correct here nonetheless, mind you), but rather for the way it tells this rather sordid chapter of American sport history.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Especially for someone who grew up after the scandal left the headlines.

Margot Robbie and Allison Janney's performance steals the show in a edgy humor style film.,"I, Tonya (4 out of 5 stars).I, Tonya is a biographical film that has a tone like a mockumentary showing the interviews from Tonya, her mother, her ex husband Jeff, and even the tv producer played by Bobby Cannavale giving his input on the whole situation of Tonya entering the Winter Olympics on figure skating and the 1994 event attack on Nancy Kerrigan. The plot follows Tonya when she was young around 4 years old wanting to learn on being the best figure skater and her abusive mother (Allison Janney). Then, following her teen years with still training to be the best and she meets Jeff (Sebastian Stan) who soon becomes her husband and also abusive. Then, as an adult, were her and her husband are on and off every time. She enters the 1994 Olympics and her rival Nancy Kerrigan was attacked by some hired help that comes bashing her knee before the event.What worked great with the film? Director Craig Gillespie tried to keep this film at a fast pace. It follows modern times during the interviews with these characters sharing there side of the story and perspective on what they thought of the 1994 attack and Tonya Harding. Then, it flashes to her earlier years briefly up until the 1994 event. Were she gets accused and put on trial for the attack. I will say the film moves at a brisk pace, which does not slow down or get boring. There is also some characters breaking the fourth wall barrier talking to the audience about what they thought of their side of the story.Margot Robbie was fantastic as Tonya Harding. She grows up to be somewhat of an unlikable character, were judges criticized her for the attitude. And how she acts towards people. Also, Sebastian Stan was great as her passive aggressive husband. He is like a ticking time bomb when he gets abusive around. Allison Janney was phenomenal playing a strict, abusive, unsupportive mother.What I did not like about the film? Bobby Cannavale's character is out of place. He plays a tv producer sharing his input on the 1994 Winter Olympics attack. And his input on Tonya Harding. His performance was decent but his perspective on the event was more of a commentator as an audience than being involved with the characters.Overall, I, Tonya is a good biographical film. It was fast paced showing Tonya's earlier years on training to be a figure skater, some events with her on and off husband, and her mother's unsupportiveness, and her entering the Olympic championship. Film does not get carried away with the mockumentary style or wall breaking but does feel out of place with Bobby Cannavale's character. But I still recommend the film as worth watching for some incredible performances and the story of Tonya Harding.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Tonya's rough and elegant, a tough combo for figure skating.","""I mean, come on! What kind of friggin' person bashes in their friend's knee? Who would do that to a friend?"" Tonya Harding (Margot Robie)Director Craig Gillespie's I, Tonya may change the way you view Tonya Harding. This gritty docudrama chronicles the life of the competitive skater who worked a lifetime to become a member of the Olympic team only to see the dream shattered by her ex, Jeff (Sebastian Stan) in the now infamous assault on superior skater Nancy Kerrigan (Caitlin Carver).Although Tonya admits to coming from ""white trash,"" she dreams of entering a world that mostly coddles to girls from proper families, hardly a term for the Hardings. Their incessant smoking and Eskimo-Pie eating are small reminders of how difficult she would have it in the culturally rarefied world of Olympic competition.Tonya displays an astounding naiveté as she places her confidence in boyfriend turned abusive husband, Jeff (Sebastian Stan). No question she knew he wanted to harass competitor Kerrigan through the mails, but she doesn't seem to have sanctioned assaulting her. Harding's hard shell makes it difficult to sympathize with her nevertheless.The crux of this revealing and ultimately sympathetic chronicle is that Harding, as bluntly competitive and rough as she is, is easily buffeted by her rude mother, La Vona (Allison Janney), whose drill sergeant ways and seeming lack of love set up Tonya for feelings of inadequacy for the Olympics and life.
 
The action of the film, well known for anyone aware of the turbulent 90's and Harding, arguably, as she says, secondly famous only to Bill Clinton, doesn't play as well as other docs that keep the audience on edge but eager for more. Harding is deeply in need of real love, a circumstance that gives the film less suspense than that of a more stable hero. I might even be challenged calling her a ""hero.""",,Anonymous,Biography
It successfully elicits sympathy for an infamous person,"Based on a true story: Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie) is an American figure skater who was linked to the 1994 injury on her fellow American rival Nancy Kerrigan. Harding's hardship life is depicted before and leading to the event including abusive relationships with her mother LaVona (Allison Janney) and later with her husband Jeff (Sebastian Stan).Anyone who had access to television at the time would recall this event and the attempts to link the Kerrigan attack to Harding. The forecasts seemed endless and were a staple in the vulgarization of the 1990s. In giving the chance for the deeper story to be told, ""I, Tonya"" does the impossible: it humanizes someone whose name had been reduced to a punchline and shows that nobody ever starts out as ""bad"" (though the same could not be said for LaVona - at least as depicted here). It also makes one question how much guilt Harding had in the attack and whether or not her eventual punishment was fair.""I, Tonya"" is another fine film that shows the result of class prejudice. While Tonya was a great figure-skater, she had a hard time winning the hearts of judges who seemed to dismiss her as ""white trash"".Robbie is superb in the title role. She easily draws sympathy as someone who worked through terrible hardships to make the best of her life even if she made some terrible decisions. Janney, who is winning multiple awards, can be quite funny at times as a vile, despicable, creature from hell but the role is under-developed. There is never a moment when we see LaVona in a light makes one understand her beastliness or even the slightest moment of goodness. When all is said and done, is it really ""funny"" to see a parent abuse her child as she does?The courage in telling this story is also a challenge to the encouragement of chasing the American Dream. In this case, the dream ended up as a nightmare. After viewing this film, one can't help but re-evaluate one's own judgments against Tonya Harding. Kudos to the filmmakers for that.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Winter sports/soldier,"Watching this, you can see how Allison Janey won the Oscar. She's an extraordinary actress and this excessive role brought her the accolade she deserves. What I didn't realize and I'm not alone with this, the major male character in this, is played by the actor who's also in the Marvel Universe as the Winter Soldier .... Mind blowing stuff I know.And add to this Margot Robbie, who while beautiful, does not shy away of being and acting ugly. Getting down with a role like this and be sort of someone others would call ""trash"" is not easy, especially in the vain group that actors are associated with. But she really did her thing and she deserved the nomination at least too. Oh and did you know that what we get here is kind of what happened in the ice skating business? It's crazy and some things are still unclear, but just the fact that this madness is sort of real (recollections of the people involved, you decide what you think really happened) ... makes you realize that not all ""based on true ..."" movies are bad!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A great surprise how excellent this film is!,"I was in college when this whole thing was happening, which means I only heard the headlines but never had time to digest the story. I believed the conventional wisdom that made most people dislike Tanya Harding. I was looking forward to seeing this movie just to get a new perspective of things that I was too young to pay close attention to, so I was expecting to like the movie for it's historical review. However, I was blown away as to how well acted, written, directed, edited, and produced this movie was, and it is certainly the best movie I've seen in years, if not a decade.The acting and characterizations of the people involved in this story is possibly the best I've ever seen. I think every single person in this movie deserves some sort of Oscar nod. In the closing credits they show the real people that the actors were portraying, and you will be amazed at the likeness each actor was able to convey. Amazing.I was a little worried that the story may be a bit boring about what appeared to be a fairly two dimensional event, but I was totally sucked in and enjoying every morsel of gourmet movie ""food"", and it never stopped delivering. You'll laugh out loud right from the beginning of the film, sometimes uncomfortably so, as this story is much more bizarre than I ever thought possible. The writing, directing, and editing of this film will reward you with a new experience in movie watching. This was truly groundbreaking in it's artistry and delivery.I won't conclude by telling you how you will see this event at the end of the movie , but suffice to say anyone that has a critical thinking mind will change their view about Tonya Harding and the ""Nancy Kerrigan event"" at least a few times while watching this film. You will be brought to the sad conclusion that no matter how guilty or not guilty that you feel Tonya is in the end, that the news media loves the headline and the sound bite too much but never cares to ""right"" the story once they've made money with the headline, leaving millions of people with hatred for things that may have never happened. This is a must see film, if only to adjust our national conscious and to correct the black and white feelings that media leaves us to deal with. If anything, this film will leave you filled with empathy and a renewed perspective of understanding of Tonya Harding, and perhaps a new mistrust of blind conventional wisdom.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Contemporary,"This is a perfect movie for the Age of Trump in three respects. First, as Harding says at the end of the movie, ""There is no such thing as truth; everybody has their own truth."" Second, it is the self-pitying tale of a talented prole who found the system rigged against her. Third, the central character turns her feelings of undeserved inferiority into energizing rage before she is undone by moronic underlings. Robbie's Harding is a blue collar Nixon.Superior acting; Robbie proves that she is far more than this year's blonde, and Janney does a great embittered working class authoritarian. The supporting cast of idiots from the husband on down is maybe written and played a little overbroad, but then people that dumb are walking around out there. The shot in which a man carrying a metal club nevertheless uses his head to smash a locked glass door says it all.The script claims to be based on interviews with Harding, her mother and her ex-husband. Missing from the list is her self-appointed ""bodyguard,"" Shawn Eckerdt, which is why all the blame for The Incident winds up on him and his minions.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
No sympathy for Harding.,"This movie tries to excuse Harding's conduct by portraying her (miserable) mother and former husband as cruel and abusive but Harding made no effort to improve the quality of her life.
But does that excuse Harding's classless, disrespectful, abusive personalty? No way.
The acting is good, and the production fine.
The movie attempts to encourage sympathy for Harding but its difficult to believe she wasnt involved in or at least know of the attack on Kerrigan.Clearly her mother, if portrayed accurately, is one of the meanest, evil people one could ever meet.
Overall, I would recommend this movie only to get the historical background but be skeptical about how Harding and Gilhooley are shown. It seems they are more culpable in real life than the movie suggests.
The cigarette product placement is annoying and insulting and if big tobacco paid to finance this film, it should be made public and investigated.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Tonya Harding gets her chance to tell her side of the story,"1/21/18. Saw this today in the theater and it was worth seeing on the big screen. Janney and Robbie were phenomenal as the dysfunctional mother-daughter act that basically ruined the life of Tonya Harding. The movie was well-done and tried to make sense of the messed up memories of everyone involved with the clubbing of Nancy Kerrigan. While Harding was not viewed as an American sweetheart, she was very much a child of America's heartland, home of the working class. It was hard watching Harding being continuously abused by her mother and then her husband, but this is her story. Despite it all, Harding was a talented skater who never got the break that would have put her up where she belonged - the winner's circle. Worth catching. Hopefully, Robbie and Janney will get some recognition during movie awards time for their portrayals.",,Anonymous,Biography

When a plan is hatched to torment Kerrigan via abusive mailings, her idiotic bodyguard hatches a scheme to hire a couple of brain dead thugs to intimidate her resulting in a kneecap shot heard & seen around the world.

"Unique biopic with bold storytelling decisions, could've been 30mins shorter","This movie felt like it was Tonya Harding getting the real-life treatment that Maleficent, Cruella, and Wicked provided for classic literary villains. And please don't get me wrong, I did like this film quite a bit. I think the framing of the narrative through Tonya and Jeff's unreliable narrator characters and the overall ""homespun"" aesthetic to the production design was captivating and intriguing. Allison Janney and Margot Robbie put up really incredible performances respectively as Tonya's abusive mother and Tonya, and the film really had me hooked in the first half. I found, however, the other characters weren't compelling enough to carry the second half, and since ""the incident"" was placed at the halfway point, there was quite a bit of real estate dedicated to the fallout that just didn't feel super compelling.I sound like a broken record with all these reviews, but man: I, Tonya could've been something really incredible if it was about 30 minutes shorter. I found my mind wandering in that back half of the movie, but the ending sequence really made for a great finale. Some amount of discerning edits, either in the screenplay stage or the post-production could've made the back half match what made the first half of the film so compelling. The last thing I'll say here is it was a super refreshing shake-up to have a black comedy take on Tonya Harding's story. I believe this tonal decision was wise, as a more traditional straightforward, drama biopic for such a grey figure as Harding could've made for a bland and confusingly-messaged film otherwise.All in all, this was a solid film with some bold, unique choices.

"I, Tonya: Exciting, Hilarious, and Moving","I, Tonya recounts the events before, during, and after the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan incident of 1994. Rather, it recount several versions of these events as told by those involved. While the Kerrigan attack is a driving force of the plot, make no mistake, this film is about Tonya. Whether or not most of it actually took place, we bear witness to the devastating psychological and physical abuse Tonya was subjected to by her mother, LaVona Golden, and her ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly. The story is told in a remarkably engaging way through a sharp screenplay, phenomenal editing, and a stellar cast. The film stars Margot Robbie as Tonya Harding, Sebastian Stan as Jeff Gillooly, and Allison Janney as LaVona Golden. Robbie and Stan as Harding and Gillooly are indeed noteworthy, but the standout performance is Allison Janney as Tonya's abusive and tyrannical mother, LaVona.

Great movie and all Oscar worthy performances,Tonya Harding will live in infamy but I like that this movie humanized her without making excuses. It was handled well but it was a heartbreaking watch to see such a talented and gifted woman be treated so badly by the people who were supposed to love her the most.

More Than Just A Figure Skating Film,"Sports is a huge passion of mine, despite not being an athletic abilities myself I've always been drawn to competition. The Tonya Harding story I knew from a documentary I watched regarding the famous 1994 incident involving Nancy Kerrigan. Figure skating wasn't ever something I enjoyed watching, but every sport has their stories and this is definitely the first thing people think about when they hear ""figure skating"". This story does recount the incident, but dives much deeper into Tonya's life - some of which may or may not be true.The film starts off by showing Tonya's love for ice skating at only four-years-old. That is the simplicity of the film; a girl who loves the sport she competes in and overcomes obstacles to obtain her dream. However it takes a turn showing her abusive and toxic relationship with her Mother played by Allison Janney. Her need to be loved comes at a cost when she leaves her Mother only to be put back into another abusive and toxic relationship with her boyfriend - turned future husband - Jeff Gillooly.I like how the film tows the line - taking an unbiased look into Tonya's life. Writer Steven Rogers is able to show that Tonya had a terrible upbringing and life, but also points out that she wasn't always the lovely person she let on to be. Repeatedly stating that nothing was her fault and taking no responsibility for her actions. Despite all that, this is the classic rags to riches tale that comes with a cost. She mistakes fame for the love she desperately desires. However no one really knows exactly what is true because the film is based on many interviews with everyone involved in a Scorsese-esq biopic - having the characters at times break the fourth wall and claim what did and didn't happen. You do get a good idea on how things went down though, because between everyone's separate recounts, there are some moments where their stories coincide with one another.Janney plays the textbook, overbearing sports parent that we all know still exist. Pushing their kids to do better by treating them with what they think is ""tough love"". She shines in this film, stealing every scene she is in; making you despise her. If you remember back when I spoke about Margot Robbie, I said her good looks were getting in her way. Everything she was cast in was the pretty blonde, but you could tell she was just about to break out of that and show everyone the talented actress she can be and she does that in this film. This in my opinion is Robbie's coming out role; showing everyone she is more than a pretty face and can act toe to toe with the best of them.There were a few things I didn't enjoy, which kind of stood out like a sore thumb; one being the atrocious CGI effects used when Robbie is skating. I understand that clearly isn't her doing those spins on the ice, but did they have to make it so obvious? With today's technology, you'd think it would be able to look more realistic and less green-screeny. The other thing I disliked was the ""character"" of Shawn; Tonya's bodyguard who conspired in the breaking of Nancy Kerrigan's knee. I put character in quotes because he is based on the real man and unfortunately he comes off too cartoony. Instead of being the dumb person he is meant to be portraying, he comes off like a henchman from a bad '80s superhero movie.Overall, I enjoyed the film. If you're thinking you don't want to see a movie about figure skating, that is just what the story is presented on; it is much more than that and should be mentioned alongside some of the other great sports biopics. I, Tonya deserves a watch if you enjoy a unique take on a story as old as time.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Interesting but harsh,"I watched the movie out of curiosity, and with much prejudice I confess. I remember when all this happened, I joined the crowd empathizing with Nancy Kerrigan and shaming Tonya. Then I forgot all of it until the releasing of this movie and I'm quite puzzled. What if...
It's an interesting movie but for a 50-something like me it was hard to watch. Firstly because of my own experience, my own perspective of the events. Secondly because of the physical abuse depicted in it by the mother then by the husband. It's one thing to know it's a movie, it's another to realize this maybe really happened to a real child, teenager, woman.
The movie is directed like a mockumentary, the acting is really awesome and the hardest thing for me was to distance myself. Movie or biopic ?

"Tonya stole my heart. She wanted to be loved, but got beaten up by everybody, including the media. Best TRUE story I have seen in years. Magnificent!","What an incredible true story! Really amazing. For those unknown with the history of Tonay Harding: she was accused of hiring a hitman to crush the knees of her competitor at the olympics for ice skating.Excellent performance by all the actors involved. I mean really EVERYBODY acts amazingly hilarious, but they do it so seriously that they really seem true to life. It is without a doubt the best performance by Margot Robbie of her entire carreer, playing a white trash redneck girl who gets beaten up by her mom, then gets beaten up by her husband, then gets beaten up by the media and justice for having dumb than dumber friends who ruined everything she loved: ice skating.This movies trailer is way more aggresive than the actual movie. The trailer of ""I, Tonya"" almost depicts her as a loudmouthed b*tch, who will kill to achieve succes. But the actual movie is much more nuanced and really endearing and supportive of Tonya in the end. In essence the story is all about a little girl wanting to be loved. And the only love she ever had was ice skating. That was what her mother forced her to do, cussing at this little innocent kid, hitting this little young kid with only one goal: to achieve succes in ice skating. That is just heartbreaking to see.Yes despite all the heartbreaking misery it is still a great comedy. The truly magnificent acting by all the actors, but especially by Margot Robbie, makes this tragic comedy become way more powerful than I expected it to be . Very pleasantly surprised by it. Touched me on a level few comedies ever have achieved before. Very impressed.

"7/10 for dark comedy, but I had to quit watching","A dark sardonic look at at Tonya Harding and the people around her that may have the blame for her sociopathic take on competition. The acting was great, good character development, but I just didn't like looking at the characterizations of Tonya, and the ""redneck"" mentality of the people that surrounded her. Depictions of abuse from her mother, boyfriend rang true, as did the depictions of horrible people who are, unfortunately, all too real.

Skate Around the Truth,"Which part of this is true? Skip that, just watch old truTV Presents World's Dumbest episodes.I only know Tonya from World's Dumbest. But, what they showed in this movie makes sense. Just wish it wasn't two freaking hours.Basically, they show an incredibly bad mother, an incredibly bad daughter, a bad husband, a bad fat friend, etc, etc. No one's likable in this.I've been told to see this for Allison Janney's performance for 2017's Best Supporting Actress nomination. True, she's excellent albeit a terrible individual. She's truly scum and lives up to the hype. My vote still goes for Laurie Metcalf for Lady Bird. Both are deserving, but at least Laurie has some traits to hold onto. Janney was just pure evil throughout.As a whole, the movie's okay. Not anything to fully recommend, as you know the ending if you've lived as long as I have. And besides, they kept telling you, this may/may not be the truth.

Funny and maddening great,"I felt so impressed, actually, about this movie. Taking the base that the last empowered woman´s film that I watched before was ""JOY"" I didn't wait so much from this movie. However, the first thing that I could understand about this, It doesn´t try to be a good-message film. Since the first moment, Craig Gillespie take us and throw us into a real life of Tonya Hardling, without any kind of hope or certainty of a inspiring message. This is a film where the main characters, doesn't try to be models to follow: they're just people flow trough the circumstances. 
I'm pretty sure that is the most important thing to say about the film. The acting is such one of the most organic that i have seen in the year (in many years, talking about bio-pics). 
The drama and the black comedy present make me feel, i think this is a bad, that actually I enjoyed the story. The screenplay and camera game were easy to follow, and the magistral acting of Allison Janney was awesome. I have a thinking that recently it could be impossible to see a movie with so much encountered feelings.

Absolutely captivating,"What absolutely makes this movie is the statement right at the beginning. This movie is based on a set of ""irony-free, wildly contradictory and totally true"" interviews. That's where we're at. Everybody's version of events is represented and you can make up your mind.
This device compounds what is already an incredible story and makes it even more wild and zany. The characters within are all brilliant. Any of these would steal scenes left, right and centre in any other movie. Chief burglar is Allison Janney who plays Tonya's mum. She's cruel and damaged, with a filthy mouth and absolutely hilarious.
In truth this is a very funny movie. The dim witted individuals garner much of the laughs but there's plenty of black humour too such as when Tonya's mum kicks her off a chair as a child.
This is also one of the area's where one might criticise the movie. Tonya is a victim of psychological and physical abuse at the hands of her mother and of continuous domestic abuse from her husband. This is glaringly pointed out and alarming, but so often it shifts uncomfortably tonally as we witness another jape or moment of humour.
The excellent Sebastian Stan is partly responsible too. He is undoubtedly a shameful character but often his other antics elicit sympathy.
I'm not quite sure how the director would have managed to tip toe through this mine field other than the way he does, without losing credibility or enjoyment, but it must be recognised.
A more obvious misstep is using Margot Robbie (who warranted her numerous nominations) to represent Tonya at 15. Robbie, who to me generally looks older than her years, pushes credibility here. She's absolutely acceptable at 21-23 and perfect for the ""interview"" scenes filmed years after.
Whether you're familiar with the story or not, it's absolutely remarkable and 100% worth revisiting. There are interesting takes on the class barriers put up to figure skaters (and Olympians) and the infancy of 24 hour news channels and how their primary journalistic role gave way to providing opinion and entertainment.
Caveats aside you're in for a rollercoaster of 2 hours that zips along that has so much to recommend. EIGHT",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"I, Tonya","Though top billing must go to an athletic and convincing Margot Robbie and to Sebastian Stan, I thought Allison Janney was superb in this drama about the rise and very public downfall of Tonya Harding. She's the mother (LaVona) who drives, quite ruthlessly, her young daughter to excellence on this ice rink - whether she wants to skate or not. Rink-side with a cigarette never far from her mouth, she swears, threatens, coaxes and cajoles to turn this girl into a young woman (Robbie) who has the potential to get onto the US team for the Winter Olympics. Along the way, Tonya falls for the local nice-but-dim Jeff (Stan) and marries into something initially quite lovingly benign before it starts to become a turbulent and occasionally violent reflection of her own, unsentimental, upbringing. Of course the sport's establishment don't take too kindly to this rough and ready exponent of their art and much prefer her rival Nancy Kerrigan. It's the famous nobbling incident that debilitates her and puts the blame fairly on Harding that sees her career put, quite literally, onto the skids. It's told in an engaging documentary style with the three principal characters each taking a thread of their own to illustrate/contest/validate their own role in this increasingly messy scenario. That works really quite effectively and occasionally comedically as it shows us the flaws and upsides of all three people. As the story evolves it does tempt you to revaluate your assessments of each of them from time to time, too. There's not a great deal of ice action, it's much more of a melodrama that turns a little dark, almost screwball, as the denouement emerges in a fashion that fiction couldn't make up. There's no hanging about for this two hours and it successfully lifts the lid on a sport that is outwardly genteel and demure but underneath - well it's dog-eat-dog.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another case of Organizational Abuse,"This movie was hard to watch. The violence and spousal abuse was visceral and graphic. The characters were superbly acted and delightfully real with all of their character flaws displayed in neon lights. Margot Robbie was wonderful and award worthy. It should not matter in sports what side of the tracks you come from, but the movie made abundantly clear that in figure skating, it does. The film was a beautiful indictment of spousal and institutional abuse and so aptly timed to the current Olympics and national spousal abuse scandals of our day. Tonya Harding was an abused kid who rose to the top of her sport only to be abused again by the people and institutions she loved.

Decent bio-pic with brilliant performances,"I, Tonya had amazing acting and great chemistry amongst the cast as it brings us through a fun and entertaining story of Tonya Harding. The film deals with a subject matter from various points of views and is taken from the perspective of various characters. I found that this was a particularly effective and interesting way of depicting Tonya Harding's story that proved to be a brilliant device in depicting the complexities of the incident.The performances from Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan and Allison Janney were all brilliant, they all depict characters that are broken and they just come across as so uncomfortable but reliable at the same time. This all comes down to ating which was highly commendable, Margot Robbie's performance in particular was really great. Her performance encompasses a mixture of childlike naivete, absolute badassery and also the try hard lead. These all goes to depict the complexities of her character, the tenderness but also the toughness and grit of such a character.Allison Janney's performance just absolutely blurs the line of acting and reality, she complete dissolves into the role, depicting this stonewalling, stiff and harsh mother absolutely brilliantly. In a way that just makes her so unlikable, absolutely brilliant.I, Tonya was a great bio-pic, while it isn't the most exciting or amazing film it came with brilliant acting and a decent screenplay, at the very least it was fun and entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Vidiot Reviews....,"I, TonyaWatching girls perform vertical splits in their panties is only allowed during Olympic figure skating.Sadly, the skater in this dramedy has been banned from ever flashing audiences again.From an early age, Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie) had been pushed by her abusive mother (Allison Janney) to be the best on the ice. Despite the cruelty, she grew into a talented skater.Her abusive boyfriend Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan) sees that Olympic potential, but also a threat in her main rival, so he hires Tonya's bungling bodyguard and his dimwitted crew to assault Nancy Kerrigan at the ice rink.A bizarre true story made even stranger by turning the violent event and its participants into a comical situation executed by white trash caricatures.

"Powerful, Gripping & Emotional. Like the sport itself.","During the course of our lives, we are guaranteed to share distinctive moments with those close to us. Yet interestingly, we will all remember those events completely differently. I, Tonya explores this abnormality of the human perspective, an abnormality which leaves us to believe our experience is the absolute and only truth. This film explores this idea through the vessel of the infamous figure skater Tonya Harding. A woman's who's sporting career and personal life made global news in the early 90s. Tonya was perhaps involved in one of the most controversial sporting events in the world, the assault of Nancy Kerrigan at the 1994 Lillehammer Winter Olympics. Even now, when the key events of the assault are so well publicised, the details and motivations surrounding the incident are still unclear. Hence why Craig Gillespie's amusingly decides to open the film with disclaimer that this story is ""irony free, wildly contradictory and totally true"".Considering the vast array of perspectives on these complex events, one might suspect that such a story would be a challenge to adapt into an onscreen affair. However, Steven Rogers and Craig Gillespie creatively rise to the occasion by using clever framing devices such as the unreliable narrator. They use this in conjunction with a series of authentic interviews to contextualise the overall narrative, but throughout the film they also use the device for comic relief and emotional impact. The film also uses Deadpool esque fourth wall breaks to achieve similar effects. The film in fact uses a variety of stylistic techniques, which on paper seems like a risky choice considering the sensitive nature of the material at play. Margot Robbie certainly seemed conscious of this and she has talked at great length that as a producer on this film, she was determined to bring on board of a director who could simultaneously balance the beauty and horror of Tonya's life. I would say that Robbie made a good choice as Gillespie, for the most part, succeeds in balancing these dichotomous tones.Gillespie decides to start the story early, as the film opens with Tonya as a young girl (portrayed magnificently by Mckenna Grace) and we see some of the early defining moments that would come to shape her character. The film then documents her adolescent interactions with her abusive mother LaVona Golden (Allison Janney) and the beginnings of her relationship with the infamous Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan). The narrative then progresses to focuses on the professional highlights of Tonya's career, (such as her iconic triple axel at the 1991 US Championships), her tumultuous private life and eventually the 'incident' at the 1994 Olympics which forever changed Tonya's life. With such extensive ground to cover, there was a danger of losing focus and under developing certain story elements. Despite these potential trappings, I, Tonya manages to give equal weight to its various narrative arcs which only serves to enhance the audience's connection to this atypical story.I must confess, before this film was released I had never heard of Tonya Harding. I think it's fair to say that this off the wall story was a bit before my time. I also hadn't heard much buzz in the lead up to its release, which is odd considering the film has received extensive critical appraisal in the US. Thus, it's fair to say that I was rather surprised that this film blew me away.There's so much to praise about this film, but to me what stands out the most is the phenomenal performances. Firstly, Margot Robbie absolutely excels as the titular character. I knew she was a talented actress based on what I had seen of her in The Wolf of Wall Street and Suicide Squad. I just didn't know she was this good. Shame on me. In I, Toyna Robbie manages to deliver a sweeping yet nuanced performance. One minute her blunt and comical performance has you laughing at loud and the next you're emotionally moved by the horrid nature of some of her character's experiences. She really does bring a lot of charm and personality to one of the most vilified women in modern US history. It's even more impressive when you take into account that this is her first ever performance in a leading role. A performance that has been deservedly been recognised with a best actress nomination.Though it must be said, Allison Janney absolutely steals the show as Tonya's mother, LaVona Golden. She effortless portrays a woman who thinks she's a fantastic mother who provides for her daughter. Whilst in reality, all she does is instill various complexes and enables a cycle of abuse. Whether Tonya's mother was actually like this is up for discussion, as the portrayal of Tonya's mother in this film was entirely based on descriptions given by Tonya and Jeff. Interestingly, despite the vast discrepancies in their stories and their clear disdain for one another, the one thing they agree on is what LaVona was like. Regardless, Allison Janney is absolutely wonderful, throughout the film she just masterfully oozes toxicity and cruelty whenever she's onscreen. If the academy doesn't give her best supporting actress at this year's Oscars it will be daylight robbery.Another strong point of this wonderful film is its exploration and portrayal of abuse. It carefully and accurately captures the cycle of abuse, and how one's treatment as a child can affect the relationships and decisions one makes as an adult. Robbie's performance gives us an insight into a woman who was horrifically abused not only by her own mother, but also by her husband. The film allows the audience to comprehend the danger that Tonya was subjected to; dangers that only escalated as she aged and grew in notoriety. So much so that the film calls out the audience, essentially the world, for how it treated her. The world loved Tonya for a fleeting moment, hated her the next and eventually ridiculed her. A cycle she had been accustomed due to years of abuse, a fact the film heartbreakingly conveys. My only criticism would be that at certain points the artistic flourishes of the film do lessen the impact of the emotional intensity and the brutality of Tonya's experience. Yet this is a rare occurrence because of Gillespie's direction and Robbie's performance.I could honestly write at great length about the various things I love in I, Tonya. Whether it be Sebastian Stan's excellent performance as Jeff Gillooly, the film's imaginative uses of a colourful soundtrack or the genuinely exciting skating sequences which have the intensity of a high-octane action flick. Yet I think what stood out to me the most is that this isn't your average awards season biopic, it hasn't been solely constructed with the purpose of winning awards. The film, despite its artistic flourishes and humorous moments has something important to say. At its heart it's a meaningful mediation on the complexities and difficulties of life, and how these can completely change someone's circumstances. Whether it be something abstract like social class or something brutally tangible such as abuse. I, Tonya leaves us to ponder what could have been if the world wasn't so cruel.Because of that I, Tonya unapologetically stands out for the crowd of artsy and pretentious award season films. Just like how the woman herself stood out from the inauthentic and fraudulent world of ice skating princesses. For that alone, this film deserves to be championed and celebrated.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Misfit,"The movie itself was very well directed and acting was great as well, but the misfit between Margot Robbie and the real Tonya Harding was so obvious, that the movie just came out as a joke. I love Margot Robbie, she is an exceptional actress, but this role just didn't fit her at all and she actually made Tonya Harding look beautiful next to her. I don't know what the hell were they thinking hiring this sexy, mature and beautiful woman to play a teenager, they certainly didn't fool me, they made me laugh the whole movie, Margot looked older not only than the teenage Tonya, but herself as well, the real Tonya Harding had a certain innocence about her that no 30 year old actress can fake, I mean her face was out there 24/7 so we all know what she looked and acted like, so when Margot is hopping around as a 15 year old with braces, it kind of changes the mood of the movie into a comedy. It was such a disappointment because I liked Margot in other movies and I'm kind of turned of right now. I know there is a lot of great 16 year old actresses who could portray Tonya Harding more realistically, so why Margot? The acting just doesn't matter that much anymore if you misfit the look, the age, the character, the whole persona. Everybody else was great so I don't understand why did they have to ruin this movie this way. Tonya Harding carries the whole movie so why to make it so ridiculous, I still gave it 4 stars because everything else was spot on, acted well and directed well considering that the actual story could have made this movie cheap looking, but the director managed to give it a certain style, that deserved to be nominated.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

"I, Tonya","The story of Tonya Harding who despite the staggering naivety of herself and stupidity and spite of her family and friends became a world class skating champion.The scale of comedy and drama tips slightly more towards the dark comedy, which serves to neatly highlight through great performances how ghastly these people were and how appallingly class conscious her American audience and judges behaved.

Redneck Goodfellas on Ice,"I, Tonya boasts two first rate performances from Margot Robbie and Allison Janney in this honestly-told and hard-nosed based on a true story adaptation. The film transcends many based on a true story adaptations by not completely coasting off the source material. It adds unexpected depth by delving into what it takes to make a champion and how far parents are willing to go to push their kids to the maximum.I, Tonya is clearly inspired by the hard hitting cruelty, black humor and self-awareness of Goodfellas. With the source material, this approach proved to be more effective than derivative. The character interviews explaining why things happened allowed the film to be more funny, honest, and meta. You see these peoples' side and understand why they acted the way they did, even if sometimes their decisions were completely idiotic and downright amoral. The only person you feel for is Tonya Harding due to her abusive relationships with her mother and boyfriend, and the fact that her skating career was ruined thanks to a couple of bumbling idiots. Every other character is entertaining but is either ugly, abusive, or downright trashy. Give the movie props for not trying to lionize them and depicting them for how they really are.Something thought-provoking the film brought up had to do with the complex relationship between Tonya and her overbearing mother. When Tonya becomes an Olympian, her mother tries to take credit for it saying that she made Tonya a champion, through all the cruelty and abuse. Does beating and making high demands of your children really make them champions, driven to overcome any obstacle or opponent? Hmm maybe my parents should've beaten my ass so I'd learn to write better reviews and become the new Ebert. Damnit mom and dad! Haha just kidding.I, Tonya scores with its funny, well acted, and unbelievable true story that doesn't quite stick the landing discourtesy of its awful CGI skating scenes and unsympathetic, albeit entertaining, characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The first film I've watched in this new decade is the infamous underdog story and fall of figure skater Tonya Harding. Before I've seen the movie I only had rudimentary knowledge about her and the famous incident that dominated the news twenty six years ago and lead to her lifetime ban of the sport. People to this day have different views on the actual happenings and of how much she was actually involved. In the opening title it's stated that this film is based on the paradoxical interviews of the participants. This information is prominently used in the narrative structure. When I was watching it, I slowly began to notice that several scenes contradicted others and it had some continuity errors or unbelievable events. The ingenious thing about it though is how it was all done on purpose to perfectly mirror the structure of said interviews. I've never seen something like this before and it really amused me. Furthermore, after seeing the original footage in the end credits I was actually blown away by how brilliantly the actors were chosen for their respective roles. The accuracy of how the actors look compared to their real-life counterparts is eerily high. Not only the outer appearance was done right, also the acting as their characters. Margot Robbie delivered her most powerful performance as of today and definitely should have won the Academy Award for best actress (if it wasn't for the magnificent Frances McDormand in ""Three Billboards""). Also Allison Janney's transformation into LaVona Harding is scarily realistic and although she doesn't have that much screentime she dominates every single frame she's in. The interdependence of Robbie and Janney is simply stunning and shocking all the same. The tone of the film goes along greatly with the narrative and what I consider as precious, never judges one of the characters or mocks them in any way. Of course it has been a horrific tragedy and no one's not guilty in any way, but I think it treats everyone with fair respect in comparison to what the media did back in the day. Additionally, how the film is shot is just terrific as it has a lot of great shots, especially on the ice rink and in the slow motion scenes and a frantic editing style that captures the nasty attitude of the story. All in all, this brutal biopic showcases the infamous tragedy with enormous respect and contains both excellent performance and high quality writing and in comparison to what's the general belief gives Tonya Harding a whole new dimension to her as a person and the story that changed her life forever. I think it's great how it casts a new light on a not quite innocent but widely misunderstood woman and her life that has been mercilessly eviscerated by the media. I raise my hat to Gillespie to make this decision.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"I, Tonya","There are a lot of songs, but it's nice. Janney did a good job. The whole movie seems to be a bit of a hodgepodge. I would believe David O. Russell did it. In the end, the whole shooting method of the competition copied the black swan. As a producer, Robbie is still an actor with too much selfishness. She wants to take advantage of the popularity to reach the top, which makes the whole film vaguely permeated with the taste of ""my mother should take Oscar like a cousin stone"".",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Axel folly,"This review of I, Tonya is spoiler free**** (4/5)IN JANUARY 1994 - Tonya Harding famous for being the first American woman to complete the most difficult trick in Figure Skating this gained her a reputation as an adored sports-woman she literally had the world at her heels (or in this case her blades). However it wasn't long until she became infamous for an alleged attack on her rival Nancy Kerrigan. So more often than not she's remembered not only as having a dislikened attitude towards the pompous judges and sometimes against the audience - also she's remembered for the attack on her rival which not only got her banned from all future Olympic events but she was also forced to retire from skating in general. And, I, Tonya is more than capable of showing her life. 
 
We start with Tonya as a child played by Gifted's Mckenna Grace already forced into the world of figure skating only a few years before by the rule of her overbearing mother LeVona Harding (Allison Janney), Grace pulls a terrific performance as the already tortured child who starts to gain a bad attitude especially towards her dance teacher (Julianne Nicholson) - behind that though is a young skater who's ambitions are high, competing at a high level she quickly becomes a world-renowned athlete. On the ice she's dedicated to winning a life that's better than her own; at home she's tortured by her mother who sees it as a way to get her to become a champion. Then we skip to her teenage years - now it's Margot Robbie to take the reins - on the verge of gaining world fame after competing in championships, she finds a chance to escape from her tortured life at home and get away from her mother when she meets Sebastian Stan's Jeff Gilooly, but even after that moment when she feels better for the escape life doesn't entirely get better for her - not totally away from the abuse - it seems that the ice is her true home, she's utterly relentless thanks to a few action scenes that are fast-paced, well-timed and beautifully shot. But that's only the bare essentials; you have to credit the performances too. 
 
As Tonya, Robbie impresses, entirely capped in ugly wigs, completely stunning through visceral action scenes, complete with the attitude to be fair if you were to essentially rank her performance on a scale, it would very different from playing Leonardo DiCaprio's wife in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street, however her performance here is almost the same as the pure insanity of Harley Quinn - from her attitude on the ice, through the arguments with her husband, to the back-chilling Harley Quinn stare which is enough to make your skin tingle from head to toe. So despite her popularity in Hollywood she's not exactly a poor choice here. 
 
Her performance is more than a match for her co-star Allison Janney, as a woman who's not only a keen supporter of her daughter (in her own way) she succeeds as the vicious woman, the result here is even scarily close to the real person, complete with the gold faux fur coat, the bird on her shoulder and the wire of an oxygen tank snaking through her room up to her nose after years of smoking. As a performer Janney has had that streak of cruelty in her roles, but she's also had a nice side to her - not entirely on show her but that's what makes her performance so good (definitely earning her first Golden Globe win). 
 
There's only one criticism with I, Tonya, sadly the action scenes aren't as visceral as they should've been, granted they're fast paced but they fail to a noticeable rubbery CG of Robbie's face plastered over the face of a stunt double. Also the film sometimes gets distracted from winding road of Tonya's making it difficult to get into the underbelly of her turbulant life. Yet still the film is consistently gripping, darkly funny, and utterly relentless, ultimately convincing the audience her tale of trial by media, but Gillespie's directing through the dark winding road into sort of Goodfellas type territory, the stunning performances may perhaps ask you to reconsider. Changing her from the villain to the heroine, but really, what's so wrong with that?VERDICT Robbie and Janney give gold medal winning performances through darkly hilarious storytelling, if you only watch one biopic this year - make it this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Great American Trailer Park Controversy...,"The L. A. riots, Ruby Ridge, the Waco Siege, O. J. Simpson, and the Oklahoma City Bombing all happened during my high school years in the 90s. It was a crazy decade that contained a lot of messed up events. In the midst of all that tragedy and horror was probably the strangest of the big news stories of that time period...the Tonya Harding controversy. I, Tonya isn't so much about her run in with Nancy Kerrigan as it is a glaring revelation of what lead her to it. Like all biopics, I'm sure it takes a lot of liberties with the truth of what happened. Craig Gillespie does handle it in a more fun way with the interview style narrative and comedic story telling. That tends to take the sting out of the tragic nature of what a broken person she became through a series of unfortunate role models and relationships. Margot Robbie is always excellent, and Sebastian Stan has been making quite a name for himself as a legitimate actor rather than a Marvel muscle head. As usual, Allison Janney is worthy of all the praise and accolades she was showered with for her performance. There is no doubt that she is one of the greatest actors of our time. Everything about this film is extremely well done and I imagine you will find it very entertaining just like me, but you will likely leave it feeling a sadness that can only be chalked up to the extremely tragic life of Tonya Harding.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Interesting film but....,".....is nothing in TH's life her own fault? Her mother is a demon - but as a young girl she says she loves her mother and not her father (who appears to be quite decent). Her husband beat her - but in the film we repeatedly see her knee him in the testicles (ouch...). Her trainer is useless - so TH's best solution is to chuck her skating boot at the woman's head. The judges are all continually biased against her - but she does actually appear in the Olympics. And when, at one stage, she does not perform a triple axle it is only because people set her blade wrongly. The truth, I suspect, lies somewhere in-between.As a film, it plays between dark comedy and tragedy. But surely TH herself must be responsible for some part of that tragedy? Nope - according to the film she was always a victim, albeit talented and spirited. And, for good measure, Nancy Kerrigan was an ungrateful cow. Oh dear.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
SOO GOOD,"This movie is absolutely great. The comedy is actually funny but dark and true, the pacing is perfect and the storytelling is on point. It feels as if we know these characters and grew up with them personally. We see these characters struggle and grow and we see their conflicts. The movie is also inspiring in some way, educational and teaches you a lesson. The acting is strong and not one person is bad, even the background characters. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who's looking for an inspirational, funny, dark, life teaching and strong acting movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Harley does figure skating,"I know it's really bad to typecast an actor, but all the way through 'I, Tonya' I couldn't help but see Harley Quinn from the -debatably-popular - 'Suicide Squad' wielding her baseball bat all the way through. However, don't take that as a negative. Whether the cinema-going public loved or loathed DC's villain ensemble, most seemed to agree that Margot Robbie was a stand-out point.Back in the early nineties I remember hearing about the story 'I, Tonya' was based on, but never really knowing too much about it, i.e. an American Olympic figure skater was so determined to win the gold medal that she had a rival on her own team beaten up. Now, upon watching that brief summary stretched out into a two-hour movie, I'm still little clearer about the details of the event, but then I think that's the point. Many stories that are based on real life (or 'inspired by true events' as seems to be the popular phrase these days) are debateable as to how true they really are. However, right from the beginning, this film states in some opening text that it's based on multiple versions of many unbelievable events. I liked that. Not only does it suggest that what you hear is subjective, but it also sets the tone of the movie.Once the 'characters' have been introduced, the story progresses and, quite often, we see different versions of the same event - as seen by the different person who witnessed it/is telling that portion of the story. I know I mentioned that Margot Robbie gives off a real 'Harley Quinn' vibe, but it works. I hope she's not actually going to just get typecast as the - borderline nutty - woman of the big screen, as I'm sure she can play numerous roles. However, in this case, I dose of 'Daddy's Little Monster' is just the ticket and she steals every scene she's in. And she has to work for that accolade, as the supporting cast all do their best to upstage her. There wasn't a single bad performance in this movie and it was a real treat to watch.I'm not sure how much actual skating Margot Robbie did and how much is some form of CGI trickery. I did my best to stare intently to see if I could pick out anything that would give the effects away and either my eyesight isn't that good, or the CGI was just better, as it looks like she's on the ice the whole time.I don't know how true to what really happened this film is, but I do know it's great entertainment and has a great cast on display. Special mention to Allison Janney, who plays possibly the worst on-screen mother since poor Carrie White's single parent! Only after I'd seen this film did I understand that one marketing quote was something along the lines of 'The Goodfellas of ice skating.' I'm not sure I saw the similarities, but I would say it's an epic tale that's definitely worth watching. It's like Harley Quinn gave up crime, became a figure skater and then took up crime again (maybe!).",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A solid film, but not thrilling","Have to say, I am a little disappointed.The cast is good, with solid acting (that's why Margot Robbie is on the race for an Academy Award) and very impressive visual changes. Every actor did something for their characters and the universe of the '90s decade was really visible in every frame of the movie. But the visual is only a small part of quality.It's an easy movie to watch, that was my first feeling. I could watch this and re-watch it easily, I didn't ask myself how much more it had until it end, and that is something hard for me, as I'm a very anxious person. But, the movie escalates for a long time, the peak is ""the incident"". And from there, everything is disappointing. I was waiting the whole time to sit apprehensively, but nothing happened, the plot slowly went to the conclusion living me with the question ""that's it?"".Even thought I know that this is a true-story and I hate when movies try to change the past, I still felt like something was missing. The acting was there, the story was appealing and the direction was very nice. But, thinking about the movie, the best part I can think of is how they filmed the ice skating. When you see a movie as big as this, you expect to remember something more important than the way the camera behaved in some scenes.Now, about the facts: is she guilty of something or isn't she? The film is very clear about their opinion: it was not her fault. There are scenes where some hypocrisy is shown in an almost comic way, but looking back at the way she was raised, and how valuable that Olympic moment was for her, how could we expect that kind of honesty? In the end, she is just not a very smart girl, but a very persistent one. The movie perfectly show how absurd is the media coverage nowadays (even if tells something from 2 decades ago), how people idolize, both hating her or loving her, when actually, nobody knew her. It also shows how unfair the justice can be sometimes, as she suffered more than other individuals just because she would benefit more than them.In conclusion, if you lived the polemic story of Tonya, you should watch this movie, it will be fun and it will make you think. However, don't expect something memorable, it's a solid movie, like many others, that is only as successful because of the weight of the plot.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great, but most of all, very important movie","I, Tonya follows the controversial career of ice skater Tonya Harding who is best known for an incident involving a rival, and was ridiculed for it.
Quick directing review first: well shot, great choice of storytelling through 'interviews' that are based almost all on the truth, well paced and great choice of music.
Now that that's out of the way...
I went into the film thinking I would get to respect seeing Tonya's side of the story but I went out with something completely different and surprising: I ended up on her side. It is not just a great film, but a must see for its importance in showing us how the ice skating world works, how brutal sports can be, and how rigged such a world can be rigged against those with true talent. It's a film about how we sometimes become haters for the wrong reasons, while we should be far more compassionate.
Sure, there is much to say about Tonya her behavior. But the picture painted of all of those around her is much, much more damning. The film is basically a warning. In the light of recent other sport scandals, this film is an important biopic that should warn us all for people who want to lift on someone else's success. The only real other victim apart from Tonya was of course Nancy Kerrigan, who too became victimized by the fanaticism of those that have no place around top talent.
Of course, you should judge yourself. But to me, I'm on Tonya's side now. Kudoos to Tonya herself for telling her story. And kudoos to Margot Robbie for picking it up so brilliantly.
Go watch this, it'll change everything.

Tonya Harding's sweet revenge,"I am glad this film got made. I always smelled a rat in the media coverage of the Kerrigan/ Harding spat in 1994. Kerrigan was not so sweet and Harding not so nasty. Margot Robbie does a fair job as Harding and the staging of the big incident is well carried out. The film is ultimately not as powerful as it could be, as Robbie is too good looking, too magnificent looking. Harding was small, tough and put upon - we do not get that sense from seeing Robbie on screen. Also the mockumentary style falls flat in parts as the jokes are not funny enough; the cutesy girl/ dainty mum being foul mouthed is overused and never really as funny as the film thinks it is. The dialogue often meanders and is only pulled together by the use of the 70s early 80s rock tracks. Still very glad this film got made. Go girl, Tonya.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"""Everyone has their own truth."" My truth; this film is a stylish triple axel that keeps you on thin ice.","Margot Robbie and Allison Janney are a devilish duo that make this stylistic mock-doc biopic in a word-of-mouth presentation infused with '80's style and sound shimmer.
The film is an unflinching look into the life of Tonya Harding before, during, and after her infamous 'incident' involving Nancy Kerrigan before the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in 1994. But while a lot of films that are 'based on true events' often present themselves in a very wary and questionable way, this film makes no attempt to head or misguide your judgment on the real, or even ambiguous, events portrayed. While the film opens with the statement, ""Based on irony free, wildly contradictory, totally true interviews with Tonya Harding and Jeff Gillooly."" Seeing as how Harding and Gillooly presented vastly different stories, it feels as though her innocence is not forced upon the viewer; however, her possible motives are displayed on the screen.
Robbie fills Harding's skates with an encumbering exuberance that draws you in to her character. With Robbie producing the film as well it is very clear she was invested to this role and it shines through in her performance, making her Oscar nomination very obvious.
Harding's early life in rural Oregon, as portrayed by the film, was riddled with the disapproval of her over-bearing mother LaVona Golden (played by Janney). Janney's portrait of Golden is painted in greatness as Janney embodies the character in what seems like a natural fit. Providing the film with its most powerful scenes, along with comically dark and prudent dialogue. One of the titular scenes with Janney is when she first gets her daughter enrolled in figure skating. The scene has an incredulous feeling of the '80's, with Golden smoking on the ice while Cliff Richard's ""Devil Woman"" polishes the scene off with a comfy finesse. This eventually leads to a line that distinguishes Harding's character; Golden is arguing with Harding's coach, Diane Rawlinson (played by Julianne Nicholson), about her not fitting in with the ""rich, prissy"" types that are typically expected of figure skaters. Golden states her daughter can do triple axels and adds, ""She doesn't fit in. She stands out.""
Another scene between Harding and Golden later in the film emerges as the centerpiece of both Robbie and Janney's performances in the film. The interaction between mother and daughter in a café is hauntingly real and drenched in emotion. With Golden, rather explicitly, explaining to Harding that she gave her a gift delivering the line, ""I made you a champion, knowing you'd hate me. That's the sacrifice a mother makes!"" To which Harding's response is, ""You cursed me.""
Janney sends chills with her execution of a shameless and distant parent, making it evident why she won an Oscar for her role, and the relation feels real between the two actors on screen.
A lot of scenes felt like they were shot with a lot of thought behind them, such as the scene with her mother on the ice and one later where they explain her history of domestic abuse with intriguing 4th wall breaks. While other scenes fall flat, specifically when she fires her coach in the locker room it felt as though a lot of emotion was lost in the presentation of the scene. But for the scenes it worked, it worked well. Along with the fast-paced and smooth editing, it creates a very interesting and fluent tale. This seems fitting when you realize Director Craig Gillespie and Editor Tatiana S. Riegel had previously worked on the 2011 remake of the 1985 cult film Fright Night, both films have a similar feel.
Overall, 'I, Tonya' is an enjoyable ride, littered with sweet tunes, and dark humour. Harding's character may not be portrayed as likeable but you begin to feel a sense of empathy for her by the end. It is interesting to witness a glaring example of how the sports world always has its scandals, which often become bigger than the sport itself, and how the least expected sport can be ground zero for one of the biggest in history.-Nick Mac",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Molecule Review: I, Tonya (7 Stars)","I, Tonya is a film about nearly everything. It has a woman skater (Margot Robbie) being ruthlessly trained on her mother's (Allison Janney) insistence since she was 4; it has domestic abuse; and it has a stupid crime. Yet what has stayed with me after I completed watching the movie was an exchange of dialogues between Robbie's character, Tonya Harding, and another who judged her skating performance few minutes ago and gave a bad rating. She asks why was she being rated low, to which the judge replies that performance is not only about skating, you have to project yourself as a good American from a wholesome family. ""Why can't it be only about skating?"", Harding asks and the judge drives away without an answer. I love that scene, and a plenty more in director Craig Gillespie's I, Tonya because it chafes the reality and serves it with dark comedy. I don't know if I laughed out loud in any of the scenes, but everyone in the cast look like they travelled back 20 years to play life, and I did chuckle a lot. Most notable Janney, Robbie, and Sebastian Stan in that order. I, Tonya is less about the sport and more about what external stimuli can do to someone who plays it. A good watch because it's a very well-made and objective film and not your usual biopic. TN.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
MeToo: Too Little Too Late (No Spoilers),"The infamous story about the Tonya Harding story encouraged by the sect of adoring Oprah fans backing the ""MeToo""/""TimesUp"" initiatives that are more propaganda than action.The film provides the back story of abuse and suffering that the famous olympic skater apparently had to endure, with strong shaming to those who tried to give her honest feedback about the industry (and the expectations) as well as those who took part in the public hatred she faced following the incident with fellow-skater Nancy Kerrigan.The film comes too late in the sense that mainstream movie goers don't necessarily recall (or care) about this story any more. In the eyes of the media, justice was served and the injured skater was able to recover to some degree. It dishes the guilt out to everyone, globally, with the implication that Tonya is the product of her environment, pushed down by too many. While this may be true, and while I personal feel sympathy for her childhood back story (no spoilers), as an adult her choices were hers to make (no spoilers).It's interesting to see who the movie industry now chooses to celebrate.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

fun movie about abuse and idiots,"While I, Tonya offers a sympathetic portrayal of the disgraced Olympian, one should note that it is *her* sympathetic portrayal. The movie is based on interviews with Tonya and her ex and plays with the unreliable narrator; at one point Tonya shoots at her hubby, then turns to the camera and says she never did such a thing.In spite of those moments, overall the movie does take Tonya's side, chiding her for never taking responsibility yet ultimately portraying her as caught in a cycle of abuse. While this abuse is often gasp-inducing, for the most part the movie has a breezy, humorous tone, taking great delight in its idiot-rogues.Victim Nancy Kerrigan gets short shrift here. I read an article suggesting she should be rehabilitated as well from her undeserved ""ice princess"" reputation, but that's unlikely to happen. Whatever her level of complicity, Tonya is a fascinating character, and this movie offers an intriguing look at figure skating's bad girl.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Ice Caper Problems,"Having lived through the drama itself, it was interesting to learn more about this bizarre episode in sports. But this dramatization of actual interviews with Tonya and the others has problems. The tone of the film shifts between pathos, violence, mockumentary, and broad black comedy - overly broad at times. And Tonya is mostly a sympathetic character in this version of events, unlike the real events, necessitated for sure by Harding's participation in the project. Finally, Margot Robbie looks 35 when she's playing a teen. It doesn't remotely work, and her film husband looks 40ish. In real life Tonya looked young and petite when she was young, and the proof is in the real footage of her at the end. It would have been better to find a younger actress for the role, and Robbie should not have allowed her ego spoil the film. This isn't the first film where older actors play high school students, but it really does create a disconnect with the audience. Lastly, one wonders if this dramatization even needed - perhaps letting Tonya tell her own story would have been more poignant than this Hollywood ego trip.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

"The acting, story and direction make this an interesting watch","Margot Robbie has impressed me so much in films like The Wolf of Wall Street and Suicide Squad and yet again she proves why she's one of the best actresses working today in I, Tonya.I, Tonya is about the figure skater Tonya Harding and focuses on her personal life as well as the huge controversy surrounding her which put her career in jeopardy.This film honestly surprised and I didn't expect to be into it as much as I did. I loved the way the story was told. It felt like a documentary in many ways and had a Scorsese feeling to it with the fourth wall breaking. A lot of biopics tend to tell its story in a normal way and so that made I, Tonya feel different. What is most interesting about this film was its story. The film had great pacing which made the film consistently engaging and the screenplay by Steven Rogers was really good. The figure skating scenes were shot brilliantly. The way the camera movements seemed so elegant and fluid. The only drawback to those scenes were some noticeable CGI effects that should have been polished more but apart from that, it was shot beautifully.A strong aspect of this film is the acting and the performances by everyone were spectacular. Margot Robbie does a fantastic job as Tonya Harding and this is definitely one of her best performances. Allison Janney won an Oscar for her role as LaVona and I can see why. The abusive and unforgiving nature of LaVona is portrayed so brilliantly by Allison Janney and despite her limited screen presence, Janney steals the show in every scene she's in. Two underrated performances in this film which I feel don't get enough credit are given by Sebastian Stan and Paul Walter Hauser. Stan shows the desperation and frustration of Jeff effortlessly and Hauser also does an terrific job as Shawn. I wish these two performances got recognised more.Apart from the CGI during the skating scenes, there is a point in this film where Tonya is meant to be 15 years old and seeing a fully grown Margot Robbie trying to be 15 seemed way too unbelievable to me.I, Tonya isn't perfect by any means but it's certainly a very interesting film that holds your attention for its entire duration.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

So much better than I expected,"I recall the Tonya Harding - Nancy Kerrigan figure skating 'incident' from its brief period of saturation coverage in the news and sports pages, and I approached this film with a bit of trepidation. Maybe it would be a sequence of overacted clichés, or unending fairly dreary skating. But I need not have worried. It is wonderfully written and cast, and you just couldn't invent people and stories like those portrayed. I don't know how faithful to the facts it is, but I very soon stopped wondering as I was carried along by the story, the characters and the overall tightness of the whole production.I thought Margot Robbie, was great in the Tonya role, and Allison Janney as her driven mother LaVone must have made nearly all of us appreciate our own mothers so much more. With ex-husbands like Sebastian Stan's Jeff, and body guards like Paul Walter Hauser's Shawn, plus her mother, it's amazing Tonya got as far as she did. The film's material states that Margot Robbie did all her own skating sequences, with some four months' intensive training. I'm sure this helped her embody Tonya's unwavering desire to make her mark on the sport, particularly (as she said) I don't have much else.The film is a wonderful blend of documentary, biting satire and social commentary, all held together by the competitive figure skating world. You don't need to know or care about figure skating. The total package just fairly whizzes along.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful,Margot Robbie did a beautiful job portraying Tonya Harding. I grew up during the time of this scandal and met Tonya a couple times in Portland. The attitude and the way she carried herself was spot on.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing movie. The life of a woman destroyed by an insane believing to be 007.,An amazing movie which makes justice about a woman whose both life and career have been destroyed by an alienated individual persuaded to live in a fantasy world where he acts as a secret agent just because he needs to lie about his childish life. Excellent directing and cast as well.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A no holds barred, tongue-in-cheek look into the life of the titular skater and the infamous legacy she has left behind","I, Tonya is a biographical film about controversial figure skater Tonya Harding. Starring Margot Robbie in the lead role, it is a no holds barred, tongue-in-cheek look into the life of the titular skater and the infamous legacy she has left behind.Since the age of 4, Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie) had been forced into the sport of figure skating by her abusive and domineering mother, LaVona (Allison Janney). As she grows older, Tonya becomes one of America's greatest figure skaters and attracts a whole legion of fans along the way due to her bold and brash personality. While training one day, Tonya meets Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan), and the two start dating and eventually marry, against LaVona's wishes. However, their marriage is rife with physical and verbal abuse against each other, and over time this takes its toll on Tonya's abilities as a skater.The film portrays its subject in a surprisingly sympathetic light. We, the audience, are shown that a great deal of Tonya Harding's actions and personality traits are not entirely her fault, but that of the people she was unfortunate to have been surrounded by. Margot Robbie gives a career-redefining performance as the title character, hopefully putting an end to any doubt that she cannot play serious roles like this due to being considered too ""beautiful"" or ""glamorous"". However, Allison Janney stands out as Tonya's tyrannical mother, who is clearing exploiting her daughter's fame and fortune for her own personal gain, much like many of today's ""pageant moms"" .I rate it 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Some great performances, but a distortion of truth","I suppose everyone is the protagonist in their life story, but this was too pro-Tonya for my taste. At the heart of it for me is whether Harding knew about the plan to maim one of her rivals, Nancy Kerrigan, prior to the national competition leading up to the 1994 Olympics. The film presents the story that she was unaware, and that even her husband Jeff Gillooly hadn't planned more than intimidating letters, laying the blame mostly at the door of his moronic friend (and her bodyguard), Shawn Eckardt. It conveniently avoids the grand jury investigation which found evidence that Harding was not only aware but participated and used money from U. S. Figure Skating to pay for it. So for me the film is problematic at its core.I'm certainly sympathetic to Harding's difficult personal life, growing up poor in a broken family with an abusive, unloving mother, and then the victim of domestic violence at the hands of her husband. I didn't always like how these facts were presented, however, as it seemed like director Craig Gillespie was trying too hard to create a feel-good story out of these dark elements. The frequent cueing up of rock music from the period during or shortly after these scenes felt odd tonally to me.The film then extends these real aspects of victimization to almost everything else in her life. Yes, she was trying to make it in a sport known for polish and grace when she was all about power and athleticism, but in my opinion the degree to which this presented bias in her scores is overstated. Quite frankly, she was never the best skater in the world, contrary to what she's allowed to say here, and if ""the incident"" had never happened, she would be largely forgotten today. The imagined conversation with the judge in the parking lot where he admits to bias was absolutely ridiculous.We also see Harding playing the victim of a poor performance because the blade on her skates was not put on properly at a world championship, as well as the better known broken laces issue under heavy pressure at the Olympics. After the incident when she was under intense scrutiny and the butt of many jokes, the film has her saying that the public, all of us, were her attackers, just as she'd been attacked in her abusive relationships, which I snorted over. Give me a break.Harding is also allowed to essentially hit Kerrigan again with the snide comment about her appearance during the medal ceremony, which, whatever you think about Kerrigan, was pretty low of the film. It takes this view that, as Harding expresses it, ""There's no such thing as truth,"" which to me was a convenient cop out, not some stroke of genius ala Rashomon. Even with this premise, one perspective notably missing is that of the real victim of the incident, Nancy Kerrigan.The film would have scored more points with me had it shown just how much work Harding had to put in ascend as a figure skater, and given us more of the grim reality of her story. Allison Janney (her mother) and Paul Walter Hauser (Shawn Eckardt) are fantastic here, and the film is effective in making us believe that Margot Robbie could actually perform these jumps. Those elements held great promise, but the way this was put together and the lies it perpetrates made it an irritating experience.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Honest and Brutal,"The word honest is used here as a reflection on the honesty of the characters in who they are. We will of course never really know whether she was indeed involved to the extent as stated.If anything the film really gave the characters involved their chance to lay it all to rest and set the record straight as it were.But more than that - it is an in depth character study of those key players in the infamous scandal and what happened for them to reach that breaking point so to speak.The actors and actresses do not hold back with their characteristic and comedic portrayals and at times can be rather brutal - Allison Janney anyone?! It really is a triumph in terms of acting, script and the production of a true story - the story itself in its retelling could have gone either way but the screenplay was impressive and pushed our actors talents to their limits - especially the excellent Margot Robbie, who is almost unrecognizable in her portrayal.Cinematography was stylish and made use of a toned down filter in colour schemes which reflected the late 80's/early 90's well and really set the scene.The humour doesn't miss a beat and is cleverly dry, inserting some serious moments in between.We feel genuinely sorry for Margot Robbie's, Harding as a woman who was consistently up against something and someone throughout her life - at points tough to watch but never drowning in it's own self-indulgence, it hits all the right beats and draws emotion for a character who was chastised mercilessly without clear cut evidence to implicate her in the crimes she was judged for. Not to say that what she did was right, she was involved in some wrongs, how much we will never know, but one thing we do know is she was one hell of a skater who fought for approval with every stride and triple axel.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
It's about time to hear the other side of the story.,"An attack on Nancy Kerrigan in 1994 was the event of the year. Because it was tragic and dramatic, because it was easy to who is good and who is bad, that attack is trash-talked about more than it should be. 'I, Tonya' narrates Tonya Harding's life story in a genuine and sincere way. No embellishments or no exaggeration to make the movie more dramatic. No pointing fingers. The opposite of 1994.Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan, Allison Janney really bring real-life people into the screen. Their acting is no embellishment as well, pure genius. Especially, Margot Robbie portrays Tonya's pain, fear, anxiety inside even though she is smiling. This really pinpoints Tonya's vulnerability. She seemed strong, loud, and confident back then, but she was actually fragile and shaky. She seemed evil and jealous, but she was just foolish. The audience gets Tonya because of Robbie's acting.No one has tried to look deep into 1994 attack because it was already clear who is victim and who is a culprit. However, I want to applaud the director's bold choice to investigate and question what is established as a 'fact'. To make valid points against common belief, the research and the evidence are the keys, and I can see the director really take the stakeholders' account seriously. AND the skating scenes. It has the best, the most artistic, the most realistic skating sequences of all. Skating movies so far have been such a mess, but an actor herself and choreography team really put effort to make it real, and it works.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Terrific film!,"I, Tonya is a masterclass in film-making, directed by Australian Craig Gillespie who has obviously been heavily influenced by Martin Scorsese and superbly utilises long steadicam shots, freeze-frames, zoom close-ups, voiceover and frequent breaking of the fourth wall in a Henry Hill-type manner, not to mention perfectly selected music from the period to tell the fascinating true story of Tonya Harding who trained from the age of four in figure-skating in the '70s and rose to fame in the late '80s, early '90s but whose life and career came undone towards the mid '90s. You probably know the story already but I'm trying not to give anything away for those that don't because I hate spoilers. While the movie is laugh out loud funny at times, it is also extremely hard to watch at other times too as it deals with domestic abuse. It is certainly powerful viewing but comes highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Simply the best movie in years.,"An amazing sugar-rush of a movie. I felt like I had been picked up and whirled around, then placed back on the ground outside the cinema, laughing. I can pay no higher compliment than that I, Tonya reminded me in a BIG way of a Coen Brothers movie. The dark humour, the cringing embarrassment, the empathy, the tension. It's not a biopic, and those above complaining about inaccuracies or lack of realism should look elsewhere. Without being a facsimile of Tonya's life, it still manages to tell her story - that's what movies should do.
I have never willingly watched ice-skating in my life, but the scenes on the ice here are tremendous. The music punches you in the stomach, and the action is exhilarating. The CGI isn't great but hey, it's the movies, you suspend your disbelief.
Robbie delivers a stunning performance, her screen husband is hapless, pathetic and hilarious, but special mention must go to the rotund henchman (the real character died at 40 in 2007, apparently). His is a comic performance par excellence. Alison Janney deserves all her accolades as the psychotic mother, but to be fair, it's a bit of a pantomime villain role, so maybe a little easier to get her teeth into. Robbie simply steals the show.
It saddens me that worthy but dull, box-ticking entries like Get Out and Moonlight garner all the accolades they do whilst a rollicking entertainment like I, Tonya is, to some extent, disregarded. See it, without delay!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
I wanted to love it because it seems like everyone does...,"I went into watching this film with exceptionally high expectations given the hype (ie. Oscar nominations and wins).Is it entertaining? Yes. Is it worth all the hype? Sadly no.Like many reviewers here I found this movie tonally confusing. At one point it's a serious view of domestic violence, the next it's like an episode of the Three Stooges. Also I was waiting for some kind of emotional payoff that never came.Sure Allison Janney was fantastic in the 10-20 mins of screen time total she got. But I can't help but be disappointed at how under utilised she was.Margot Robbie was fine playing a redneck figure skater, she just wasn't Tonya Harding.(By the way whoever did the CGI on Robbie's face during the ice skating scenes needs to be fired. So obvious it distracts the viewer).",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

"She, Tonya","This was a pleasant surprise. Margot Robbie once again proves she has exceptional talent as an actor and, in this one, they don't even have to rely on her beauty to accent her skills, it's just raw talent.Robbie isn't the only one giving an excellent performance though. Sebastian Stan is also going against type, losing his normally cool, tough guy act and slipping into the skin of a low brow and abusive spouse. Allison Janney is also remarkable as the tough loving mother that most of us have probably encountered at some point. Then there's PWH who I thought was just doing his normal slow hillbilly bit again until I saw the archive footage at the end and realized he was spot on in his performance.The story was compelling. I was a little young and disinterested in figure skating to really remember any of the details and can't begin to say how accurate it is, but as a character study it's fascinating. It also manages to film the actual skating in a way that's kinetic and heart pounding.That leads into a downside though. I understand that Robbie did her fair bit of the skating but she's not a figure skater and at times a stunt double was needed. The movie opts to scan Robbie'a head and plaster it over the double and it just looks off putting each and every time.Bad CG aside, this was a very entertaining and stylized movie that I really enjoyed and would absolutely recommend it for the performances alone. That and any movie that can make figure skating interesting to me is doing something very right.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Talking about white thrash...,"Let me first tell you that I think figure ice skating is one of the most boring things to watch. So I was, let just say, not thrilled to watch this movie. But everybody heard about the Nancy Kerrigan incident, and Tonya Harding would become world famous after that incident, even more than Nancy Kerrigan, so I was interested by the story leading to the incident. And I didn't regret watching this movie because I thought it was really well made, with great actors, and a quite unbelievable story. I just think they should have said a bit more about the press that condamned Harding from the beginning and that she clearly didn't deserve that. I was also biased by watching the news about the incident in those days, and this movie made me realize that Tonya didn't had an easy life and should not be blamed for every sin under the sun. Very good acting from Margot Robbie playing Tonya. The best actress in this movie to me is Allison Janney playing Lavona, the mother of Tonya. That character deserved to have her kneecaps broken instead of Kerrigan. A truely awful mother, one that not deserve to have kids. The movie is about white thrash at it's best. But also about how corrupt and narrow minded the ice skating world is, aspecially the judges. Shame on them. One that clearly deserves jail time, regardless the Kerrigan incident is Tonya's husband Jeff, played by Sebastian Stan. An awful human being, a controling egocentric women beater. But the absolute winner of the Darwin award is the character Shawn, played by Paul Walter Hauser. If that story truely happened like they showed in this movie, then that must be one of the dumbest people I ever saw. An absolute garbage of a human being, a waste of space. I, Tonya is a movie that will be appreciated by a lot of movie lovers. Well made, with a great cast, and with an incredible story, a story that had to be told.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Love It!,"I, Tonya was an amazing movie based on true events and the story of Tonya Harding. Margot Robbie had her best performance in this movie. She was perfect. Alison Janney will most likely win Best Actress in a Supporting Role at the Oscars. She was so funny and fantastic. I thought Sebastian Stan did good as well. I thought the film editing was well done and deserves the Oscar nomination. This movie was really good and I would highly suggest it. You'll have a good laugh.
My Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Too early to say for sure, but might one day be a 'classic'","I first watched I, Tonya about a year after it came out, and immediately regretted having seen it at home and not on the big screen. It got lost amongst so many great releases around the end of 2017 and start of 2018, as it had been a surprisingly good year for movies, particularly around the awards season, with heavy hitters like Call Me By Your Name, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri, The Shape of Water, and Ladybird all getting my attention over I, Tonya. It's regrettable but it happens, and at least I was able to watch and thoroughly enjoy it later on.On my first viewing I had a very positive reaction, but my second, just a couple of nights ago now, was even stronger. I really, REALLY liked the movie initially, but now I think I love it. It's a maximal, bold, very ambitious movie, and as a result isn't going to get called 'perfect' by many people. But my favourite kinds of movies are often heavily stylised, fast-paced, genre hopping, and ambitious, and all these words apply and then some to I, Tonya, a film that I hope will continue to get better with age and potentially become labelled as a classic one day.First off: it's good to comprehensively list and appreciate just how many things I, Tonya does throughout its two-hour runtime. It's a dark comedy, it's something of a tragedy, it's a sports movie, it's a harrowing look at two very abusive relationships- mother-daughter and a toxic marriage- it feels like a crime movie at points, and it's also a Rashomon-style look at the unreliability of memory and the conflicting ways people recall the same events. It does all this while also being extremely well acted, fast paced, stylised, and emotional. It might drag a tiny bit in its third act, which is perhaps the only real criticism I can give, but then the last scene or two provides a real emotional gut punch that makes the whole thing worthwhile, and puts everything into perspective. I remember the first time I watched it, I didn't think the movie pulled off having the different perspectives on the history it covered while also more or less taking Tonya Harding's side towards the end, but it worked better and more seamlessly the second time for whatever reason. It earned the right to sometimes humorously point out how different everyone's memories were, while also playing up Harding's perspective near the end for some truly devastating emotional moments.I don't think Margot Robbie's ever been better, and if not for Frances McDormand's career-best performance in Three Billboards, she would have been a shoo-in for best actress (though that being said, Saoirse Ronan was brilliant that year as the titular Ladybird too). Allison Janney was also great, and deserving of her best supporting actress Oscar for her performance as Tonya's emotionally abusive, sociopathic mother. I enjoyed seeing Paul Walter Hauser too, after recently seeing and enjoying him in Richard Jewell, and I hope to see him in a whole lot more going forward.The film moves at a tremendous pace, and while I felt it came close to almost sagging in its final act, it might only feel that way because of how breathless and exciting it is for its first two acts. I loved how biting, cynical, and fun it was, and then when it starts to expose how demonised Harding was, it suddenly gets quite heavy. There will be some who don't believe Tonya Harding's side of the story, and some who do, and then others who are in-between. I'm of the belief that even if she was more involved in the film's events than she let on, that her fate was still quite severe, and in a way the demonisation and ridicule of her through and by the media reminds me of the emotional and eye-opening Amy Winehouse documentary, Amy, from a few years ago. Both remind viewers that even if these people are flawed and at times outlandish or off-putting, they're still people. They're still going through real problems and real heartbreak, and while you can think that making fun of them is harmless, if everyone acts that way, we're only isolating them and potentially even ruining their lives. As Tonya Harding is still with us, I can say that I, Tonya isn't as devastating as Amy, and being born 1995 myself, I can feel guilt-free when it comes to the societal ridicule Harding went through (I'm sure I made Winehouse jokes as a teenager though, and so that documentary really did make me feel a tremendous amount of guilt).Anyway, I'm rambling. This movie is great, it's only got a couple of minor problems here and there, and those flaws can be overlooked quite easily because of how good the good stuff is. If this one flew under your radar like it did mine back in 2017, make sure you give it a watch. It's got some great performances, style for days, solid comedy, and genuine pathos. I look forward to the next time I revisit it, and can say that in time, it may well end up one as of my personal favourite movies from the 2010s.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Sorry I waited so long to see this gem of a movie.,"I, Tonya is a surprising movie for a number of reasons. Firstly the main performances are excellent. Margo Robbie's portrayal of Harding and the people who surrounded her in life are excellent. Alison Jenny is particularly good in the role of Harding's chain smoking and abusive mother. Secondly the film deftly mixes dark humor and tragedy to produce a thoroughly engrossing film. There has been criticism that the story underplays the role of domestic violence in Harding's life, but the fact is even a life with violence is still a life lived, and the story deserves to be told.When watching the film one would be forgiven for thinking the plot is entirely fictional and created just for laughs, but the end credits wisely show the source of the material upon some scenes are based, and this only adds to the sense of disbelief about how bizarrely the Harding/Kerrigan story played out. More importantly it also provides a look into why it did so. License is taken with some facts, but the truth is just as strange.I approached this film thinking I knew the Harding/Kerrigan story, but found it was far more interesting than I knew. What is revealed is the story that lay beneath events which were sensationalized by the media, and even if they are distorted by the film, what emerges is an engrossing story told with humor and pathos.

"I, Tonya: A Flawed Yet Watchable Portrait of a Controversial Life","I don't necessarily align with the mainstream praise for I, Tonya. In my opinion, it's an average film-not bad, but certainly not extraordinary. The movie is a mix of strengths and weaknesses, ultimately resulting in a watchable and even enjoyable experience. The direction is solid, and the screenplay is even stronger, but the film struggles to fully engage the audience with its uneven pacing and tonal shifts. That said, it's worth noting that Craig Gillespie truly excels as a director in capturing the essence of 1980s and 1990s America. His attention to detail and directorial signature are evident, much like what we've seen in his work on the series Physical. The screenplay by Steven Rogers effectively develops the characters and their relationships, tackling themes such as domestic violence, social pressures, and media scrutiny.When it comes to the performances, Sebastian Stan is, frankly, a weak actor who fails to bring depth to any role. His performance detracts from the quality of the screenplay. Margot Robbie, while delivering a good performance, feels miscast in this role. Someone like Lily James might have been a better fit. On the other hand, Allison Janney and Paul Walter Hauser were absolutely brilliant in their roles. Allison Janney, in particular, deserved her Oscar win. Even Bobby Cannavale, in his brief appearance, delivered a commendable performance.The music, however, felt entirely out of place and was poorly utilized throughout the film. At times, the film oscillates between dark comedy and serious drama, which can be confusing for some viewers. That said, the use of narrative techniques like mock interviews and breaking the fourth wall adds depth and intrigue to the story. As for how faithful the film is to the real-life events, it doesn't really matter to me-I'm not here to judge anyone, only to share my thoughts on the film I watched.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Comparing the movie with the real footage side by side, everything matches up perfectly - the camera work, ice skating performances, acting and settings.

I wanted her to be beautiful and she was. This time mostly on the inside. As far as I'm concerned she can do no wrong and rightly deserves her place in Hollywood's A list. I didn't know the story but do know a little bit about skating, my wife having been a competitive skater, and the skating was truly impressive, expertly captured, and never boring. What I wasn't expecting was the realism and the violence throughout. I cringed all the way through. However I got to the end of I Tonya feeling truly inspired. It is a cautionary tale of true courage in adversity and a young soul, broken but ultimately undefeated. And expertly portrayed.. and I like that.

"My God! They are really learning how to do a biography film, aren't they?","Till this past year I had a problem with most ""biography"" that I watched, the only one that I really loved was The Imitation Game, although, this past year made me change my mind. ""I, Tonya"" is another great biography movie that came out this year.The acting is gorgeous, Margot Robbie and Allison Janney are the highlights of it, they kill in their roles, but I also like a lot of Paul Walter Hauser's performance. Sebastian Stan is good too.In fact, this part (the acting) was what I came to the movie expecting, just amazing acting and a ""ok"" movie, but my God, the movie is thrilling and entertaining for the entire run time. The soundtrack is fantastic, every song fits almost perfectly in each scene. The editing is awesome, they mix some ""interview"" scene through the main history, with narration, and fourth wall breaks, and it works! Otherwise, the movie would be just an assembly of events in Tonya's life leading to this one moment, but the montage change this scenario completely.You understand Tonya's point of view, you get why she is like that, you might not like her overall, but you definitely gets the reason why she act like that.And this is probably my favorite thing about the movie, how they were able to pick the history and make something fresh with it, not just the ordinary dramatic arch that we saw over and over again. The history is sad in many ways, but the approach here is not only sadness, is also with a comic way.The movie has tension when it needs to have, it can make you cry when he needs to, and also could get some jokes in a lot of other moments. I love the direction here too, the actor's performance, the cinematography, the use of the slow-mo, the track, in a way, it almost always has the director's hand.The only issue that I might have with the movie are some of the skating scenes, I don't know how the could improve that, but in some shoot you just can't avoid notice that is just Margot's head in some else's body.In short, ""I, Tonya"" is a terrific film, that approach this really challenging genre in a fresh and clever way.

A Ice Cold Dark Comedy,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A clever bio-pic that purposely mixes fact and fiction.SYNOPSIS: The supposed story of ice skater, Tonya Harding.JIM'S REVIEW: I, Tonya is not your typical biography film. Craig Gillespie solidly directs his movie about the infamous ice skater, Tonya Harding, with a bold conceit, purposely mixing fact and fiction and admitting this premise from the outset. He skates through the hard news facts and avoids conventional storytelling techniques in a refreshing way. The director tends to simplify the story as he adds one part high melodrama and two parts irony to his dark comedy. He does overload the film with 90's pop standards that overstate his message, but he assembles a winning cast of players who act their roles with expert glee and a strong satiric edge.I, Tonya stays on target with its low-trash trashing of America, and having Tonya portrayed as the eternally abused heroine. Perhaps, not the most accurate depiction of this celebrity. The clever screenplay by Steven Rogers uses mock interviews with the actors in character and the supposed ""true"" events that led up to the attack on fellow skater, Nancy Kerrigan. The script reinforces this notion with a ""she said-he said"" formula which works.The film sets up the story of Ms. Harding's early skating career, her heartless mother, her violent relationship with her husband, her Olympic dreams, and the ""incident"" leading to her downfall. It tells its tale effectively but spends too much time blaming those around Tonya as her victimizers and making her more saintly sympathetic than need be. Where the film mostly succeeds is in its sardonic black humor and outlandish characterizations.Margot Robbie, a bit too beautiful for the part, is quite sensational as Tonya. The actress interprets her role very well as abused victim and hard-as-nails survivor. She rarely is shown to be apologetic or kind, usually appears to be temperamental and impetuous, yet Ms. Robbie makes Tonya empathetic and vulnerable. She is excellent throughout the film, her highpoint being her dressing room scene prior to Tonya's disgraceful showing at the Olympics and the film's brutal closing moments. Those alone deserve award attention.Ms. Robbie gets strong support from a fine ensemble that are physically aligned to the real life counterparts and bring a fierce determination to their characters. Sebastian Stan is Jeff Gillooly, her abusive spouse, and he makes this despicable person a dangerous force and troubled soul. His scenes of sudden violence and unpredictable behavior are powerful. Paul Walter Hauser plays Shawn Eckhardt, his half-witted accomplice with delusions of grandeur, and the actor is quite wonderful...funny and yet pitifully tragic. Some of the other roles could use more clarification and depth, but they are graced with talented performers like Julianne Nicholson and Bobby Cannavale who add much to their sketchy parts.But the real scene-stealer is Allison Janney as her cold-hearted mother, . She creates a bitter hateful woman, unloved and unloving, and Ms. Janney, almost unrecognizable, never allows her cruel character to be not the least bit sympathetic or caring with the moviegoing audience. What could easily have been an overdone evil caricature becomes an wildly eccentric character that is, understandably, the main cause-and-effect of Tonya's dysfunction. Her scenes with Ms. Robbie have a bittersweet sadness and a quick comic give-and-take shock value that empowers the film.I, Tonya is a well-made and searing indictment of the rise and fall of one woman and her quest for fame, fortune, and the American Dream. Be careful what you wish for.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sublime performances,"""I, Tonya"" narrates the life events of Tonya Harding, an American ice-skater who achieved stardom and success through years of pain and then suffered a terrible downfall, when she was accused of taking part in the aggression against her sport rival.The story is extremely moving, terribly painful, especially considering it is a true story and the violence suffered by the protagonist really happened. I really liked Margot Robbie, her performance is simply wonderful and it highlights her chamaleontic ability to transform into anything. My absolute favourite is Allison Jenney, her performance, her voice, her movements, her charisma, she is beyond. It is a must watch!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Saw it twice,It was so fun that I went to see it twice. Great point-of-view idea to show the story from Tonya and Jeff's side. I'm sure there were many truths AND alternate truths but the movie does a great job of letting us decide.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Liberalist victim garbage,"If this movie was an analogy of the current political climate in the states and how the media and big tech want to manipulate the narrative, Biden and the dems would be Tonya and Nancy Kerrigan would be trump. I cannot believe this production about the Tonya/ Kerrigan incident wants to portray Tonya as the victim and everyone(the public) who sought out to punish her with guilt should hang their head with shame. What we learnt from this movie is that Kerrigan was just an unfortunate victim because of tonyas miserable life. Typical victim mentality courtesy of liberalist thinking. This whole mockumentary or what ever it was created its own narrative and manipulation of facts just to fit in with the progressive left mentality. It guilts fools to excuse the trauma and suffering the protagonist creates on others because they had a bad day . like wtf!",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great acting! unexpectedly good movie!,"Not that I knew too much about her, but I can say that the acting was great enough to be the standout thing about the movie. I can not judge the movie based on a true story that didn't know too well about. But I thoroughly enjoyed it. Which is the main thing in my opinion.8.3/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Uncomfortable but real,"I can still recall this story when it unfolded in real life, so I was delighted to see how they would capture that piece of time in a movie. I'll admit, I had a hard time looking past Margot Robble playing Tonya Harding. It's not that Tonya Harding wasn't attractive, it's that I lived in the era where we were trained to see her as ""ugly"" because of her actions. So watching one of the hottest stars in Hollywood play a less attractive villain was a major accomplishment. Margot Robbie pulled it off with a great performance.The movie from start to finish kept me interested and it ran in some ways like a 1st person documentary. The movie covered a lot of the backstory on Tonya and did in fact show the human side to her greed and aggressiveness.This was an awesome movie and I would encourage most to watch it. I'd advised googling Tonya Harding first a getting a little of the backstory, it adds to the spice.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stellar,"While you come to watch I, Tonya for the knee bashing the movie isn't really about the so called ""incident."" The film is about class struggle and discrimination and how the cycle of abuse can plauge someone's life in unimaginable ways.The film is throughly entertaining and darkly funny. The screenplay is outstanding and matched with great direction. Margot Robbie is brilliant. She really makes Tonya Harding a fully fleshed out person who wasn't just a late-night punch-line.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Good Watch,"I was just 7 when the whole situation happened. I didn't really understand at the time but I knew someone had hurt Nancy. Never did I believe all the rumours that Tonya had anything to do with it. I believe she got the short end of the stick. 20 some years later I still believe she got shafted. I really enjoyed watching this, it really made me understand as an adult what happened. I'm sorry this happened to you Tonya. It's horrible. I wish that this documentary showed a little more real clips throughout. Only reason why I gave it 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wanted to see this for a long time,"The film gets a solid eight and while Allison Janney has been so lauded for her performance and that is very much deserved, watching Margot Robbie portray Tonya Harding is absolutely divine. If I were rating the film simply on that basis I would give it 9.5 stars. This movie really brings the characters to life in a way few movies do. When you arrive at the end and see clips of the real life subjects of the film , the resemblance is positively stunning. As they say, a real must see.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bad,"Having lived through that time period when it happened in my early 20s, this movie is a mockumentary of what it could have been: it could have been a real thought out movie that gets beneath the surface of what really happened. Margot Robbie was horrible in this and the other characters were caricatures with little depth. I was so interested in this movie because I thought it would shed some light, but it really was a dumbed down version of what could have been. Another movie, a real movie with depth and sensitivity needs to be made of their story. I do think that Tonya Harding was completely involved, but Nancy Kerrigan, having seen her in interviews, was a real piece of work too. I do not think that Tonya Harding should have been banned from skating for life. She should have been punished and then after a period of time, be allowed to skate again. She basically got a life sentence and that was wrong.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
update on the reality,"Going to see a movie about Tonya Harding was not something I ever planned on doing, but I will watch anything Craig Gillespie directs, as his movies have a way of making impossible situations believable as plausible tales (see 2007's Lars and the Real Girl or the underrated The Finest Hour). Harding becomes a victim of her own gullibility, thinking it only takes talent and hard work to succeed in the world and that not playing politics will not matter. When other people around her act out on her behalf, well....we all know what happened in the 90's figure skating competitions! We lived it as a country, and finally this tale of a true underdog can be told. Margot Robbie is a force to be reckoned with for sure, if she wasn't before.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
It wasn't her fault,"Uncovering the most controversial scandals in sports history has become cannon fodder for some writers this season. Late last year, Netflix's eye-opening documentary, ""Icarus,"" faced up to the dishonest doping method created for hundreds of cyclists and athletes consciously by way of a narrative enough expressive and refined to take home one coveted Academy Award. In other circumstances, the seventh art chose to portray one of the most talked and paralyzing ""incidents"" in the history of female figure skating, Tonya Maxene Harding's.It's not necessary to say that, in the first period, who seizes the story is Allison Janney, an Oscar-winning actress who plays the figure-skating prodigy's chain-smoking, domineering soulless mother. Paradoxically, 'Golden' is the last name of the unforgiving woman who puts her little daughter under extreme daily routines, progressively getting her to an irreversible point, nonetheless, although it's difficult to accept, it's she who forcibly molds- maybe in excess -her daughter's competitive spirit through abuse, insult, and contempt; unforgettable traumatic memories that didn't mean a barrier to Tonya's golden dreams. At an acting level, Janney is superb as LaVona, a character who demanded a complicated search for humanity amongst so much revulsion and coldness. Surprisingly, she gets it by using her overwhelming talent that knows the exact point between containment and emotional overflow. From the other angle, the character counterweight rests on the tiny shoulders of Mckenna Grace, who plays Tonya in the 8-12 age range; a sweet cute girl who performs admirable dramatic scenes, especially one involving her father. One more promising actress to keep an eye on.In the second stage, two big screen giants take the lead, the actors who must handle the rest of the story. On the one hand, there is an unexpectedly fiery Sebastian Stan, whose performance reveals an overwhelming dramatic range, necessary and extremely functional to the story because of his character, Stan's character background is well-assembled, at least, in terms of his towards the rebel protagonist, since he sticks with the story as exactly a supporting narrative agent, as everything must hinge on her. Jeff is a great gamble in the mind of any actor because, as well as requiring a serious dedication and a keen eye to take the right positions in the right circumstances, it comes with a deep analysis on unwavering machismo in that time, however, also involves peculiarity portraying certain relationships in which women don't decide to cut a toxic relationship off.. And the big star of the show comes into play: Margot Robbie.. The actress plays the title figure skater, Tonya, who must stand earnest personal falls throughout her life to understand that most of those unfortunate events coming her way almost daily have been consequences of the past, that ""it's never my fault"" card, repeated constantly by her, proves the irreverently empowered spirit of the woman, one which won't embrace man's injustice. The character is very caustic but deeply disturbing from the perspective in which the story exhibits it, the audience connects immediately with its rocky ascent; a connection achieved because of the imposing script that lays on the table hundreds of opportunities that Robbie takes advantage in the best way possible, situations pretending to put her at risk, but actually provoking the opposite effect: to show how strong and powerful is her after getting punched in the face, being attacked by the back or getting a knife in her arm. The character-acting relation works one hundred per cent with Margot, she takes over the whole story and doesn't care, the viewer wants her to meet her goals yet consider that certain of her actions are not the right ones, we rationalize the mistakes because the film transforms the spectator into an honest merciful human being about all the bad stuff happening to her, especially at that stage when Tonya faces a sour adulthood bordering the depressive feelings and thoughs.The third stage can be named as the grand finale, the one that thousands of people in the 94's knew, yes, that ""incident"". Being a biopic, the film must synthesize with a keen sense the key facts on the star, this time, of course, such events were responsible for the future of the skater, who being involved in the attack of her main skating rival, saw her dreams go up in flames: to win an Olympic medal, wowing the whole world with a phenomenal triple axel. According to the film, everything that entails the final act serves to showcase the numerous gender gaps, from sentencing to an irritating talk with a sheriff who doesn't arrest a ""gentleman"" who has just shot his wife, deliberately overlooking countless crimes prior to this one. In this field, the film works as a social commentary about the ever-present machismo, violence and deceit, on how stereotypes can still influence the scope of your dreams. Again, Stan and Robbie are in play, who must finish the film with their most powerful tools, and they do, because our Bucky Barnes and Harley Quinn radiate strength, energy and veracity, even when their characters are opposites. A clear genre switch is perceived in this part, as it replaces the kind of black humor comedy with drama, and then jump to a singular thriller against the clock about the search for the culprit, a risky bet that could hurt the excellent dramatic construction that was being set up to that point. Besides, the whodunit sub-plot doesn't upstage the storyline, instead, it's articulated when it should and when it doesn't, allows the main story to follow its course to re-incorporate in the end, because we're there to see Tonya's full heap of trouble and that aspect has an important role. The fantastic ending doesn't admit improvement as it agrees emphatically with the casual kinetic personality that pervades all the footage, giving a coherent message about what happened that day, a message about the broken dreams of a woman who never broke down, who never accept a weak determinant, a woman who always won. It should be noted, in general terms, the excellent interpretive feast of the cast as a whole because they practically recreate with their performances the videotape recordings projected in the final credits, you can evidence the neat effort in their portrayals, amazing and terribly close to real life.Artistically and technically, Gillespie's film excels, first of all, by the precise handling of incomparable framing and angles, putting in the second place its cinematography and the staging of other moments. Film inventiveness concerning the photographic stuff underlines what the script doesn't achieve by means of a simple but vivacious visual power, never falling into plasticity and always treating the vision of the director with respect. An unexpected and rebellious fourth wall breaking is highlighted, an unaccustomed technique in a drama and even more in a film of this nature, smashing the traditional rules imposed for biographical adaptations, it endows the film with an interesting satirical air that together with mockumentary style with which present the dramatized interviews, present an enviable balance between black humor and sentimental drama. Peter Nashel's soundtrack displays great hits of yesteryear that match with the tone and timing of the sequences, however, the compositions explicitly created for the film don't get the same impact or importance of the classic songs, it's a real flaw that a vital aspect like this does not get what it should.""I, Tonya"" by Australian Craig Gillespie manufactures an aggressive portrayal about broken dreams, ambitions and success, vices, repercussions and defeats, working as, in addition to a voyeuristic and enlightening vehicle for the events that stirred the sporting world, an opportunity for gifted actors to push to the limit their interpretative skills. Stan, Robbie, and Janney keep firm the story from beginning to end with their impressive talent, fortifying Gillespie's intriguing vision and strange career, a filmmaker who with more indie stories could make a space among the giants. Incendiary, intense and praiseworthy acted, this film definitely puts a spotlight on actress-turned-producer Margot Robbie while showing a sweeping and realistic cinematic look at an event of unimaginable media outreach.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

We'll never know what really happened...,"I wasn't sure how I'd feel abt this movie because I thought the Tonya Harding story had been worn out with ""The Price of Gold"" (30 for 30) documentary and the many other news magazine programs about ""the incident"".However...I loved this movie!! I've heard some people say that Margot Robbie was miscast because she is too pretty for the role but I really disagree. Margot Robbie is gorgeous but that shoudn't mean she's miscast...I think that she did a great job. I don't think it really matters whether or not she's pretty; Tonya Harding wasn't ugly, just a misfit. Margot Robbie really captures how Tonya must have felt about herself with all the abuse she encountered.Allison Janney is really great in this. I thought it was really well cast.

What a great surprise this film was!,"I'm not fond of sports-related movies based on true events. I'm not into sports of any kind, so I'm usually bored if I have to sit through one of these films. But, I do like fictional ones like Major League, Stick It, Whip It... if it's stupid funny, I can enjoy it. But wow. Just, wow! I, Tonya was NOT what I thought it would be! Such a shockingly funny dark comedy that had me laughing from beginning to end! I'm not going to praise anything in particular. The acting was great from everyone. The film's direction, editing, music and overall tone was just so well done. The characters, even the evil ones, are so enjoyable. This movie was just one big package of devious fun! There's a lot of great movies that you can watch a few times, then you'll break it out only if someone you know hasn't seen it yet. But this movie? This is one I will happily watch over and over whenever I need a pick me up. It's an instant classic. Easily the most badass dark comedy I have EVER seen!Just go see this!

One of the greatest Docu-Drama I have ever seen!,"Margot Robbie return in theater since Suicide Squad (2016), she produces and acts as the leading in the new docu-drama about Tonya Harding! I,Tonya is that kind of movie you laugh at you have fun at yet you still feel bad and question yourselves..... The publics knows what they are going to watch, yet you still question yourself on Tonya Harding story. It an excellent biography and needs to be seen by everyone love it or not it has to be listened to!Acting: 10/10: Amazing cast!!!! Margot Robbie is stunning as Tonya Harding she gives those intense scenes where she needs to handle 2 feelings and the way Robbie does it feels so true it gives goosebumbs, she deserves and Oscar nominations maybe even an Oscar that take on Harding was really really well done! Then we have Allison Janney starring as LaVona Golden the mother of Tonya, I personnaly think that there is no way someone will be able to win that Oscar other than Janney herself, she was amazing one of the greatest supporting performances of the past 10 years, there is no way she won't win that Oscar! Then we have great actors who played well too but were simply behind the success of Robbie and Janney, yet Sebastian Stan delivered a great performances and pretty much the same from the rest of the cast !DIrections: 10/10: The directions is done perfectly not a scene is wasted, the interview scenes we have during the whole movie are well placed and great ! Everyone involved in the directions and productions of this movie did a good job. it unpredictable and good, plus it tells a deep sad story about some tragic events and makes us think for the victims, it graphic but not to much just great enough! Margot improvement in the productions of the movie is great it really feels like she came up with everything you see it in the way the story is told and by how she plays Tonya!Humour: 10/10: Not too many jokes, but that's good this movie is mostly a biography about some tragic shitt! Yet when there are jokes they sure are funny and well-placed !CGI or Visuals: 6/10: That's were the movie kind of felts down, I loved the movie and nothing about it except those awfully cringe worthy CGI scenes where Tonya skates, it feels like a videogame yet don't judge it too much, it's not that bad and it doesn't matter at all, still they could have been better but I really don't give much of a fuck.... THe 90's style was well done and great !Costumes and Makeup: 10/10: Some really well made costumes, that looked exaclty like what Tonya Harding was wearing at her competitions back in the days. For the makeup it was done well not much to say it since it was good and not gonna lie it doesn't matter that much, oh and the hairstyle on Robbie looked exaclty the same as Haring well done indeed!Enjoyment: 10/10: Was really hyped wanted to see Robbie again and loved that trailer, yet the movie even delivered more that what I was hoping which made me fall in love with the film after it's first 10min!

A favourite of mine.,"This film really inspired me to look into the Tonya Harding situation. It really shows the crazy situation from all angles, and brings to light the sheer nastiness of both the women's figure skating world and the American media. The best part of the film is the performances. Margot Robbie doesn't just play Tonya Harding, she IS her, for the entirety of the movie. Allison Janney practically steals every scene she is in with an iconic performance as Laverna. Sebastian Stan delivers an impressive and in depth performance as the absolute mess that is Jeff Gilooly. The performances and absolutely perfect recreations of interviews and recorded skating completions of Harding's that really make the film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A self-aware gem,"There were times that I wondered how much of ""I, Tonya"" were true . . . but it never really bothered me because it's just wildly entertaining. A uniformly excellent cast, irresistible soundtrack and winking sense of humor turn what could've been a standard biopic into a raucous tragedy (not even the fourth-wall breaks get old).You wouldn't know that Tonya Harding's been buried in the tabloid past to look at Margot Robbie's savage performance (same can be said for Allison Janney). There's plenty of screentime devoted to ""the incident"", but the filmmakers come from behind with a sympathetic portrayal of Harding herself. A total curveball move.This was a rental I had to see twice before returning. It's sad, tense, even hysterical, and I loved every minute.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Underwhelmed,"I first heard that this film was amazing, I saw that it was highly rated so I wanted to give it a go. For me the film didn't really live up to my expectations.The main thing I think was the 'interview' or 'documentary' style of having the charcters talk to a camera. It acted as a barrier in a sense to stop me from relating and loving these charcters becasue the intense moments got cut up with these interview scenes in the middle. I think I struggled to properly thrive in the moment and really sympathize with Tonya when her memories and her truma from her mum was interupped by speaking and cutting to another room.It wasn't for me personally but if you like that style of film you can give it a go.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
An entertaining (and unreliable) history lesson.,"U.S. Olympic figure skater and self-proclaimed redneck, Tonya Harding is anything but an ordinary figure in sporting history, so it makes sense that this biopic-based on ""wildly contradictory"" interviews, as we're told by the opening title card-is a rambunctious whirlwind of craziness. Framed by re-enacted interviews that quickly establish the inconsistencies between stories and the overall untrustworthiness of everybody involved, the film wears its artistic licence proudly on its sleeve. Some scenes are replayed from varying perspectives, whilst others brazenly break the fourth wall to emphasise the lack of dependability of the source; director Craig Gillespie never letting the (contested) truth get in the way of a good yarn. There's no shortage of filmmaking bells and whistles on display either, Gillespie ambitiously employs crash zooms, unbroken tracking shots and split screens, among other things, to give off that energetic Tarantino-esque vibe. Such brazen storytelling is hard to pull off-especially when trying to sustain it over two hours-so at times it feels like Gillespie is either in over his head or becoming a little too enamoured with his own flashiness, but never enough to derail proceedings. He's also blessed to anchor his movie with a knockout performance from Margot Robbie. De-sexy-fied with prosthetics and 80s hairstyle wigs, Robbie is spellbinding as the crude, tenacious and super-talented Harding, able to simultaneously elicit sympathy and scorn in a single scene. Playing out like a twisted comedy adventure, with a tinge of tragedy and pinch of crime thrown in for good measure, I, Tonya is one hell of a history lesson.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Cautionary Tale (About time),"I want to first applaud the excellent job done by Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan & Allison Janney. Fantastic. Not a lot to complain about as far as the filmmaking goes here. They stuck to the story and told it like it is.Overall the film was great, but this review will touch on a lot more than that. I remember when all this happened and it was a media sh!tshow.What truly disgusts me now more than then, is the fact that idiotic millenials watch this an then say: ""I didn't know it was based on a true story"".""Based on a true story""???? This *IS* her story. Idiots, I swear.One of the biggest stories of the 90's; Globally; in Sports history, and they have no idea. The same way thay people today are clueless about things but will blindly follow whatever BS the media feeds them.Whether its propaganda about Trump, Covid, Ukraine, everybody makes the mistake of believing whatever nonsense is in the media.Imagine being this young girl, coming from nothing and propelling herself to the top ranks in her sport, making history! Then being stricken from the books, only to have moronic millenials come out and say ""I didn't know it was a true story"".That makes you look as ignorant as you are. And now this woman, along with the rest of the intelligent world, has to suffer the indignity of future generations being just as ignorant; to things that matter.A cautionary tale indeed.Knowledge is power, without it you have narrative, uneducated opinion and absolute ignorance.I love that this story was finally told. I always felt horrible for Harding. And she's right, Nancy Kerrigan was an arrogant cuuz not say that here.So to recap:
Nancy Didn't do it, Bill did do it. Michael didn't do it, O. J. did do it. There's your U. S. 90's media in a nutshell. We're in this thing called the internet. Try learning something.This is where your ""cancel culture"" would run riot. Thank God there was no social media back then. All these hollywood and social media phonies, cry out for equality but only when it suits them.Let this be a lesson to you all about the damage you do when you have NONE of the facts. This womans life was destrotyed, and if there was social media, millenials of today would have been all over it.The meaning behind this film.Take note: Your ignorance is damning!Entertainment Value 9/10
Overall Rating 9/10A good, or not so good trip down memory lane. Anyone remember those Olympics? Josée Chouinard was forced to go on early and didn't place. Finished behind Tonya Harding.She was looking good for the silver that Kerrigan won and looked like she could care less about. Didn't stop Nancy from taking all that endorsement money though.Some of us still fight that battle, regardless of what the situation is.I, Tonya!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Went down pirate egomania street, instead of ""I must please mother""","The first few scenes of the film are Tonya's mother being excessively strict on her as a child. It goes on far too long without any interruption, and she stands and stares, without defending herself, covering her ears, storming off, or anything...After this is Tonyas teenage years... her mother is still strict.. but Tonya is now fighting her mother for fun like a pirate. She also fights her boyfriend for fun like a pirate... later in the movie she still does the same....It makes absolutely no sense, because if she's that conceited she would have no reason to try to amaze everyone with the triple axel...Her real personality (not shown in the movie) is basically not being loved by her mother and so must try to overplease everyone around her, and treat older strangers as potential role models because she doesn't have one. When she's around her mother, skating for the competition she has no heart or soul in it except for an unholy will to be the best (to please her unpleasable mother). She decides to do a triple axel. Her mother is still dissapointed with her, or fakes being happy with her. - She would not have any inflated, pirate style egomania at all.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not your ordinary biopic,"Well I am not really into figure ice skating or anything that happens on the ice at all but I am always into good story and this is truly an interesting character to put on the silver screen. 
The film was good because it wasnt your typical straight forward biopic drama, no it was a fresh, foul mouthed comedy with some little thriller elements and of course some tragic turns as well. It was film to really give Margot Robbie the chance to put out all her acting weapons and boy did she deliver! This is so far the role of her life and she deserves every kudos she receives for it. I am sure this will not only end up with an Oscar nomination but also with one of the top candidates for the Best Actress Oscar. Excellent and brave performance. Funny, tragic, sad and always with a bad mouth. Allison Janney was just as good. Sure it already was a showy part to begin with but Janney even put something on top. You never knew if you should just straight up hate her or if there is something good in her. Very cynical, very sarcastic performance. Unlike everything Janney ever did on that level and one of the best performances of this year. She really owned every scene she was in (although some scenes were stolen by her bird). Sebastian Stan was okay but couldn't stand himself too well against those two powerhousse women. The soundtrack was excellent, the direction fine and I really liked the script.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"I, Tonya","On the surface, this film presents itself as a rockstar portrait of the life of Tonya Harding. However, at its core, the film is a deep introspection of the tragedy of this woman's fight to be recognized for the talent she bestowed. The direction of this movie is brilliant, giving exciting and brilliant camera movements to immerse the viewer into the ice skating sequences, and yet at the same time is able to give the audience a behind-the-scenes look at the unbelievable drama that made the characters who they are. The film is also stacked with brilliant performances from its cast, mainly through Margot Robbie and Allison Janney, who truly show their full range as actresses, radiating effort from beginning to end. The film is also smartly written, presenting a surprising comedy through all the darkness that surrounds it. However, one detriment that works against the film is the lack of development of the relationship between the two ladies that were involved in the incident that largely defined the majority of their lives. The concept is introduced, yet never fully expanded upon, leaving the incident feeling empty for the friend who was ultimately hurt. This film, however, is a must-watch with powerful performances and a deep, intricate story that is entertaining and heartbreaking throughout.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Margot Robbie playing Emma Stone playing Tonya Harding.,"An absolute trailer park, trailer trash, trash fire movie of unredeemable people in ridiculous situations. And it couldn't be any more perfect unless John Waters himself schlocked its brains out.Margot Robbie deserves three Oscars for losing herself so deep in a wonderfully despicable role. As usual, Allison Janney is at her amazing best, proving herself the Meryl Streep of brassy low-rent broads. Sebastian Stan is uncharacteristically unattractive and downright sleazeball,This movie is an emotional romp. You'll laugh like your neighbor's meth lab is leaking; you'll experience terror like a new foster kid. You'll cry like it's the shotgun mass wedding of all of your first cousins.

"I, Tonya","I, Tonya is the movie about the career of the former skater Tonya Harding. It really covers her life in detail with the R rating. It covers her origins in skating, her family life, and her legal issues. It does a good job at showing how she impacted women's sports. Overall good performances from Margot Robbie and Sebastian Stan. Good film about women's history. Since it is based on a true story, the female lead doesn't feel forced by studio, as the true story is about her and can't be necessarily make it have the male lead (so if anything it had a male lead, that would be forced), so that's my spiel to you ""anti-woke"" people.

targets only specific audience,"I am disappointed more than satisfied because obviously because this targets very narrow audience, namely older or middle aged people who live to hear hear for her, and those interested in ice skating. I don't know who this is, and I don't care. Did not get me interested. Also the way it is presented is unrealistic and boring because actors are talking about themselves on the camera while acting in the meantime, so this looks more like vlog or documentary. Also too negative, typical, that I think there is nothing extraordinary compared to my or any person's typical life issues including relationship issues, job issues, finances issues, career issues, growing up issues. And as most or all oscar movies this is time waster, lasts 2 hours, which is not worth it.

"Waterskate, or, The Battle of Wounded Knee","OK, let me set out at the beginning my views on the Harding/Kerrigan affair, also known as ""Waterskate"" or ""The Battle of Wounded Knee"". I have long believed that Tonya Harding was innocent of involvement in the attack on Nancy Kerrigan. I have believed this, in fact, ever since Tonya finished eighth in the 1994 Winter Olympics. It is just conceivable that a figure skater might orchestrate an attack on a rival in order to win the gold medal rather than silver. It beggars belief to suggest that she might do so in order to finish seventh rather than eighth. Tonya would have realised what the real culprits, her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly and her supposed ""bodyguard"" Shawn Eckhardt, did not, namely that Nancy was far from being the only skater standing between her and the gold. What Gillooly knew about skating could have been written on the back of an envelope. (What Eckhardt knew could have been written on the back of the stamp).A TV movie ""Tonya and Nancy"" was made about these events a few months after they happened, but I was surprised that more than twenty years on there is still enough interest in them to justify another film on the subject. Given that Tonya has passed into folk-memory as one of the Bad Girls of sporting history, I was even more surprised that it was made from a viewpoint which contradicts that folk-memory by presenting her as more sinned against than sinning. (""Tonya and Nancy"", by contrast, tried to sit on the fence as far as the question of Tonya's guilt or innocence was concerned, largely for legal reasons).In some circles, in fact, Tonya was regarded as the Bad Girl of Skating even before the Kerrigan incident. She consistently refused to conform to the stereotype of female figure skaters as fairy princesses, and her skating style was characterised more by athleticism than by the graceful elegance of some of her competitors. She was frequently criticised for her temperamental personality, for her flamboyant costumes, generally designed to emphasise her voluptuous figure, and for her choice of music. (She preferred rock music or film scores to the more favoured classical). And although some Americans like to kid themselves that theirs is a classless society, she was criticised most of all on account of her social background; journalists and commentators hostile to her did not hesitate to denigrate her as ""poor white trailer trash"". (Nancy, in fact, came from a similar blue-collar background, but always found it much easier to play up to the ""fairy princess"" image on the ice).Part of Tonya's tragedy was that she was often let down most by those who should have loved and cared for her, notably her mother LaVona Golden and Gillooly. Tonya had a miserable childhood, especially after her parents divorced and her father, to whom she was close, left the family home. (She was the only child of the fourth of LaVona's five marriages). LaVona was a harsh and abusive parent, frequently beating Tonya and humiliating her in public. It was largely to escape her mother's tyranny that Tonya took refuge in a disastrous marriage to the equally abusive Gillooly. That marriage soon ended in divorce, but Tonya was reluctant to admit that the relationship was over, and it was during an attempt at reconciliation that the Kerrigan attack took place.The film tells this story in a mock-documentary style, including interviews with the characters. At its heart are two particularly fine performances from the two leading female actors, Margot Robbie (who also produced) as Tonya and Allison Janney (who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress) as LaVona. Janney's LaVona is a cold woman, unable to feel much affection for anyone, including her various husbands or her daughter. She attempts to take credit for Tonya's success as a skater, but there is a hint that beneath the surface she resents the fact that her daughter has become one of America's greatest sportswomen while she, LaVona, has failed at everything in her life. There is another good performance from Paul Walter Hauser as Eckhardt, a man so delusional that he makes Walter Mitty look like a sober realist. In Eckhardt's imagination he is a master spy, a master detective and a master criminal, James Bond, Sherlock Holmes and Don Corleone rolled into one; in reality he is a bum and a petty crook.Robbie's casting was criticised on the basis that she does not bear a great resemblance to Tonya, but the make-up department achieve a sufficiently convincing likeness and Robbie brings to her characterisation all the fierce never-say-die spirit that was both Tonya's great strength on the ice and her great weakness off it. (It was her reluctance to admit that she could fail at anything, be it triple axels or romantic relationships, which led to her ill-fated reconciliation with the worthless Gillooly). Robbie was nominated for Best Actress, but lost out to Frances McDormand for ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"". I have no quarrel with that decision as McDormand was indeed excellent. Nevertheless, I felt that it was Robbie's performance here, even more than Janney's which holds the film together and gives it its emotional power. ""I, Tonya"" is not just an entertaining movie about a news item which briefly held the headlines over twenty years ago. It is a deeply affecting story about a sportswoman of great talent whose career was destroyed, partly by a prejudiced and sensationalist media but chiefly by the man she loved. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fantastic Work from Gillespie and His Unreliables,"In cast not known, Margot Robbie is one hell of an actress, and her performance in 2017's I, Tonya is evidence. As Tonya Harding, Robbie embraces with grace, her most unglamorous role and nails it to perfection. She conveys the much needed physicality, enduring hardness and charm, that when the class conscious tears her down, it is a breeze to sympathize with her narrative. The rest of the supporting cast were just as memorable, spearheaded by the foul-mouthed Allison Janey, donning the Terence Fletcher-esque persona of LaVona Golden without fault. Here, Janey conveys the necessary and affecting complexities of her character's twisted sense of upbringing. Of course, these magnetic performances ushers from Steven Rogers' emotionally resonant screenplay, that focuses on Harding's tragedies that includes being victimized by class resentment and dysfunctional, abusive relationships.As for I, Tonya's filmmaking, it deserves praise for veering away from being a familiar sob story, as it entertains flawlessly with its snappy and jovial tone. Craig Gillespie's clever and energetic touch that exploits its unreliable narrators see to this, with its hilarious faux interviews of attention-grabbing characters, and the occasional breaking of the fourth wall. These of course, are weaved together brilliantly by Tatiana Riegel. In amazing fashion, these entertaining tenets were never over bearing to the point of diverting us, from its heavy handed themes of domestic violence and class warfare.I, Tonya is then a result of a successful marriage between praiseworthy cinematic craft, Oscar worthy acting, and a pop-culture narrative drenched with commentaries on a whole lot of societal ugliness.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Everyone has their own truth...,"I, Tonya, is a strong movie that stands out on it's own about the true shocking event involving figure skater, Tonya Harding.

This film shows the events that happen leading up to the incident between Tonya and Nancy Kerrigan where an outcry of injustice can be seen. I, Tonya truly shows a story of how America wants people to love and people to hate, and it just so happens the hate went all to Tonya. Watch the movie and decide for yourself on the event.

Not great at all.,"I just have a few criticisms regarding this film.
I never enjoyed it to be honest. I felt it tried far too hard to put across Tonya as a victim. It also insisted on creating ""key moments"" and scenes using the first minutes of theme tunes which have been over used by all the other average films out there.
As for the real victim, Nancy Kerrigan, she was hardly featured at all and when you consider the event you have to question the mentality of the film makers in ""enabling"" the sense of ""victimhood"" and naivety in the people found guilty.They make a Coen Brothers film but not actually a good one.There was far too much over acting and the usual scenes of violence and stupidity that we have grown to recognize in poor quality films from the US.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great fun, Great acting. But alternative facts.","So you want blue collar? You want drama?

And how 'bout her brother getting into a fistfight with her Dad, and he dies of a heart attack?Nope. Not Tonya. Nancy Kerrigan.Tonya wasn't blackballed because she was poor. She was blackballed because she was trailer trash. And the pecksniffians who run the figure skating racket didn't want any WWE story lines, even though the dramas were certainly ratings boosters.Of course, like any WWE story line, you gotta have a heel, and Tonya and her friends in the Axis of Evil are the perfect heels. And, like WWE, a lot of this is kayfabe.The movie is great fun. The acting is world class, and Allison Janney seems to be a lock for Best Supporting Actress.

It should be just about the skating...,"I do not follow any sports, I know nothing about skating and I live in Europe. Yet, even I caught a distant echo of what seems to have been a major US scandal. As a proof of how damaging gutter press can be, the only memory I had of the facts was that Harding physically assaulted one of her competitors.Turns out the ""real"" story was a lot more complex than the version I barely recollected. According to this movie, Tonya Harding was the product of a violent environment, with a nightmare of a mother who pushed her into competition from age three. Throughout a history of domestic abuse, Tonya managed to become a great skater and then she fell for the wrong guy, Jeff who - by his own admission, had ""no game whatsoever"". The Tonya-Jeff relationship is the cliche' for codependent-destructive. After countless beatings (from both sides), splitting and reconciliations, the couple went back together for Tonya to get through the 1994 Olympic selections, by proving she had a ""wholesome"" family.Unfortunately for her, Jeff had friends as dumb as himself. Jeff tried to ""help"" Tonya getting to the Olympics by ""scaring off"" her main competitor. It is not clear what the truth about the ""scaring"" really is: if it involved the beating or ""only"" treating letters. At this stage I think nobody cares anymore if Tonya knew about Jeff's plans.Still, it's hard to believe that people that dumb can actually exist. What I also found terrifying is the relentless media coverage that turned a minor story into a scandal that crossed the Atlantic.Tony was a trashy girl from the wrong part of town, without any social grace, who was considered too embarrassing to represent internationally the US and she made herself an easy target by refusing to mend her ways, mistaking stubbornness for authenticity. Even if I understand that Tonya's life was doomed form the start, I do not see her as a blameless victim, more as an accomplish.In any case, the movie is absolutely brilliant. I loved the fake documentary technique, the music score is pitch-perfect and the main actors are terrific. Janney's Oscar for her role as Tonya's terrible mother was well deserved.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
One Sided,"I saw the events live when they originally took place, and followed the news for a few years after. Right off, I was disappointed in this movie's one-sided interpretation.

It's what happens when fame & money govern our values.

One of the Best Movies of 2017,"I'm mad at this movie. No sooner have I just finished writing my ""Best Movies of 2017"" list, this film skates up to my doorstep and effortlessly wedges itself on my list of favorites. No sooner do I write off Margot Robbie as just a face for making the forgettable Legend of Tarzan (2016) and (gag) Suicide Squad (2016), she turns in this absolutely masterful performance. No sooner do I write off director Craig Gillespie for being a hack Disney hired-hand forced to make Driving Miss Daisy (1989)-level cheese, he comes up with this uniquely dark and comic masterpiece. It's not my fault I didn't catch I, Tonya before the New Year. I blame the distribution!The story of competitive ice skater and sensational-media pariah Tonya Harding does have a lot of blame to go around. Harding, her abusive ex-husband Jeff Gillooly, her dimwitted bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt, her mother LaVona Golden, the media, the Ice Skating Association and even you, yes you, all have a part to play in what Tonya refers to as ""the incident"". The running stitch the holds this dysfunctional collage together may surprise you but at the same time feels perfectly reasonable, tragic and despite this film being set in the early nineties, altogether timely.Assuming you're under 25 and don't have the 90's Trivial Pursuit Time Capsule Edition, the story of Tonya Harding and her involvement in a vicious attack perpetrated on rival Nancy Kerrigan was very much the news story of the season. At the time, the exceptional ice skater became a punchline for the media and especially for late night comedians such as David Letterman. It certainly didn't help that her humble origins set against Nancy Kerrigan's prim and perfect media persona, aided in making her the biggest sports villain since the Soviet 1980 Hockey Olympic team.What was never shown before, during or after the hoopla was Harding's battle with abuse. The film portrays the 20-year-old Harding (Robbie) coming to skating practice; makeup barely covering up bruises made by her husband Jeff (Stan) the night before. Before even meeting Jeff, the film portrays her home life with LaVona (Janney) as just as tumultuous; LaVona making it a point to destroy her confidence nearly every chance she gets. The film also portrays Harding's wings constantly being clipped by judging committees who see her homemade outfits and attitude on and off the ice as an affront to the sports' image.I keep saying ""the film portrays"" because director Craig Gillespie and screenwriter Steven Rogers make it a point to state that I, Tonya is not an official account, but rather a Rashomon (1950) cobbled from different sources. Peppered in-between the unruly narrative are a host of mock-interviews where all the characters involved are given a chance to ""set the record straight"". This is despite the movie often juxtaposing what they say with beautiful levels of Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999) irony. It's a ridiculous approach to a ridiculous story and it's pulled off with the same bullish grace as Nicolas Karakatsanis's cinematography and Margot Robbie's ice skating. Thus what we see in I, Tonya is a total marriage of pacing and tone, humor and depth, glee and sadness that gainfully tells a story you only think you knew.There are some problems, largely stemming from the film's third act inclusion of what's essentially extra credit. It intones that due to our own addiction with sensationalist media, we as an audience are complicit in Harding's hardships. While I agree with the sentiment and the film does weave this new tangent into the fabric of the narrative, it does seem to come a little late to the party. Additionally while Robbie completely owns the role as Tonya, the twenty-seven-year-old actress playing her at fifteen looks a little...off.Regardless, I, Tonya is a wonder of a movie. It's a slick, funny, wild and sad little showcase about wholly unlikeable characters who manage to simultaneously be sympathetic without necessarily being deserving of your sympathy. With documentarians are mining 90's tabloid journalism to create layered, hard-hitting features like Casting JonBenet (2017) and O.J.: Made in America; it's nice to see a movie go a completely different way without sacrificing perspective. Here's to hoping the soon-to-be-made Lorena Bobbit story also rises to the occasion.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Story Populated Solely By Boobs,"As you're watching this the truth is that you honestly don't know whether you should be laughing or crying. It's the life story of Tonya Harding - the infamous American figure skater who ended up being banned from skating and with a criminal record after the attack on her fellow skater and American teammate Nancy Kerrigan in the lead up to the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. Written by Steven Rogers and directed by Craig Gillespie, this is a combination of biography and dark (very dark) comedy with some very sad dramatic content mixed in. I have to admit that as I waded my way through it, it brought up conflicting emotions within me. There are times when Tonya becomes very much an object of sympathy. Her upbringing is portrayed in nightmar-ish quality. I would rarely if ever use this term, but her family of origin (and especially her mother) are shown as the showcase of redneck white trash. Her mother is domineering, angry and shows no love for her daughter - except, mind you, that she does seem to spend most of the money she earns as a waitress on figure skating lessons for Tonya. But then, at the rink, she's the quintessential ugly sports parent - attacking her daughter, Tonya's coach, Tonya's competitors; foul mouthed, pushy. It was an incredible performance from Allison Janney, who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Perhaps not surprisingly, Tonya then ends up marrying Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan) - who's portrayed as an abusive guy who's none too bright. Tonya's life is a nightmare. She contributes to it, of course, rather than rising above it - and by not being either able or willing to rise above it she puts herself at odds with the US figure skating establishment, who don't like her because she's almost the complete opposite of the elegant and beautiful Nancy Kerrigan.And there it is - ""the incident"" as the movie refers to it; the attack on Kerrigan as her knee is smashed not long before Lillehammer in an attempt (unsuccessful) to knock her out of the Olympics. ""The incident"" is what every viewer is interested in; it's the only reason you'd even really know who Tonya Harding is. The incident itself only takes up a few seconds of screen time - but there's a lot of focus on the planning and on the aftermath. It becomes like something you'd see in the Three Stooges. Tonya is jealous of Nancy. Jeff decides the make anonymous threats to Nancy to play with her head. But he can't do it himself, so he enlists the help of his buddy Shawn Eckardt (a great performance from Paul Walter Hauser) - who imagines himself as some sort of secret agent/counter terrorism expert, but who's really not much more than a loser who lives with his parents and his fantasies. In this portrayal of events it seems to be Eckardt who pushes things too far. As you watched all this unfolding on the screen, you wonder how seriously you can take any of it. Often the characters come across more as caricatures than anything - it is, in the words of Hard Copy reporter Martin Maddox (Bobby Cannavale) ""a story populated entirely by boobs."" True enough. Entirely. You do feel some sympathy for Tonya, as I said, but in the end none of these people are anywhere near likeable.Tonya was played by Margot Robbie. It was a strong performance, and Robbie was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar. She was, in fact, very good in the role - she played that redneck white trash completely believably. I have to give a lot of credit to director Craig Gillespie and whoever was responsible for choreographing the figure skating scenes. They were incredibly believable and authentic. I'm not sure that the format of the movie was entirely successful. It's told essentially as a series of snippets of interviews of the various characters, followed up by more traditional dramatic presentations of what was being talked about. I think that perhaps a straight movie format without the interviews might have worked better, although the portrayals of the interviews certainly gave us some feel for the various people depicted in the film.I'm not sure that in the end I felt sorry for Tonya herself - nor do I think the movie was really going for sympathy. It does, however, give you an understanding of her background and upbringing and helps you gain some sense into how she ended up where she was, and you have a sort of grudging admiration just for the fact that she got as far as she did, and even for the fact that she was so resistant to conforming to the standards expected of a figure skater. But that admiration is linked with a sense of tragedy at the absolute waste of talent that her life ultimately represented, and at what she was ultimately reduced to as portrayed by the last little bit of the film.

Rating: A-,"If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I, Tonya is one of the best movies based on real-life events that I've seen recently. Being a genre that I usually don't feel amazed by, Craig Gillespie tells a very well-written story by Steven Rogers. Very interesting and captivating screenplay, I was invested throughout most of the runtime and I think the pacing is extremely well-balanced, something that is a common issue in this kind of films. Gillespie also makes a great decision by telling the story through different perspectives since the interviews with the real Tonya and Jeff are highly contradictory (as the movie states right at the beginning of the movie).The cast's performances definitely elevate the film. Margot Robbie (Tonya Harding) might not win the Oscar this year, but her display proves that she has her hands on one in the future. However, Allison Janney (LaVona Golden) portrays Tonya's mother flawlessly (even if the character might have been stretched, as well as some aspects of the real story) and she is my frontrunner to get the Best Supporting Actress award. Great performance from Sebastian Stan (Jeff Gillooly) as well.Great cinematography, excellent editing and beautiful use of the CGI for the skating scenes.

This film will motivate you to find more about your life.this is one of the few movies that might actually be able to inspire someone to lead their life a little differently.One of the most heart warming movies I've ever seen.,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"I, Tonya subverts a tragic story into a black, comical and unexpected piece of pop culture history.","Introducing itself as ""irony free, wildly contradicting, and totally true"", I, Tonya is a fiercely entertaining exposé on one of America's most famous yet equally hated personalities in sports history - Tonya Harding. That name not only generated a media frenzy in US championship figure skating, it was also riddled with infamy owing to events that were both outrageous and scandalous. But at the heart, this is a tragic story of a sports star fallen from grace. 
Contrary to the introduction, the film is indeed a huge irony that asks whether Tonya had any grace at all. And if she did, was it unfairly snatched away by the all-encompassing judge and jury we know as society. But before we get to the film's first most anticipated moment - the incredible triple-Axel jump which no other American figure skater had previously attempted - we are introduced to Tonya at age 4. She is on the ice with her skates. She is a natural. The ice skating teacher can see that. The teacher also sees that Tonya and her mother are from the wrong side of the tracks. This would prove to be Tonya's single biggest challenge but also her drive to fulfil her dream of becoming an Olympian.The second most anticipated moment is what everyone in the film refers to as ""the incident"". The narration, nevertheless, through fake interviews or by breaking the fourth-wall, doesn't detract from the fact that this was the last straw in Tonya's career as a figure skater. While every sports magazine and TV channel were quick to turn Tonya into a villainous monster, I, Tonya is nuanced by the black comical moments leading up to ""the incident"". Instead of answering the question on every viewer's mind (there's a pause where she directly addresses this to the audience), the film is at its gripping best when we learn about Tonya's many personal issues, including domestic and emotional abuse involving her mother and her (now) ex-husband. Between the constant mother-daughter squabbles and love-hate relationship with her husband, Tonya emerges as young woman with true grit rather than the ice skating princess everyone expected her to be. 
 
Sharply written by Steve Rogers (rom-com screenwriter and not Captain America) and directed by Craig Gillespie, this dark satire not only takes a stab at the hideous and vain nature of the sport but also the sacrifice, pain, physical and emotional bruising Tonya endured just to be accepted as any other aspiring figure skater. Lending a wide range of emotions (and even a glint of Harley Quinn), Margot Robbie is at her best as manic Tonya and impressive in every scene. But even as Robbie delivers her best performance to date, Allison Janney as Tonya's iron-fisted mother is an absolute treat with an unending library of expletives. From her introductory scene to the tune of Cliff Richard's 'Devil Woman' to messing with Tonya's head, to shaping her into a champion, Janney's LaVona Fay Golden is just that - show stealing gold in every scene. Together, Robbie and Janney are the muscle and sinew of this film while subverting a tragic story of a sports star fallen from grace into an unexpected yet unforgettable piece of pop culture history.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Boring,"A really good moive that looses its way halfthrough.
It gets to cliche, 70s gangster comedy. And its really really boring 
to watch these stupid lackeys and the iq is in the kindergarden field.
In the end it just gets that trailer trashy vibe mixed with
boring gangster movies that tries to be witty.
The actress was great and the rest sucked, real or not.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best movie the year it came out,"So much better than I was expecting. This is a movie that is truly DIRECTED, and it's not ashamed to show that off. Surprised it didn't show up at the top of more year end lists. It was acclaimed, but not fully appreciated for just how good it is.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
an ICON.,"I've seen this film a million times already and i will continue to do so because this is a MASTERPIECE.it is literally SO GOOD. you will never find anything wrong about this movie from the story telling to the dialogue to the plot and cinematography, EVERYTHING is just so beautiful to look at and listen to and feel. it's SO PERFECT! i love everything about this film.margot robbie was SENSATIONAL and this will always be my favourite performance of hers. best actress nomination ROBBED. and sebastian stan's performance? a perfect complement to margot's and allison's. the just work so WELL together and the direction of the whole thing was just INSANE.here we also get to see mckenna grace play young tonya (well, she is young character in everything so) and even in her few minutes of screentime, she gave a great and ICONIC performance as always.the film starts off like a normal family with its ups and downs like any other wholesome american household but as harding's career is developed, this film that revolves around the family just gets better and BETTER.and that triple axel scene? ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. everything about it is so amazing. from the editing to the production, BEAUTIFUL.the ending broke me. it's not the best but it's still PRETTY DAMN GOOD. it will leave you with THAT feeling after watching a really good film & love how it always keeps coming back. 10/10. always.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
I Didn't know....?,"I Didn't know that this Girl from Australian was so good. Man, i didn't know that a female so Beautiful could Act so Well. Well, now i know. What a story too. Margot picked a good one to produce and Star in. What a Tragedy; the skating story of Tanya Harding. This movie reminded me 'again' of 'its not what you know, it 'who' you know.' Tanya Fell victim to bad associations with her loser husband. Pick your friends carefully. Make friends with people who have 'half-a-brain' and are psychologically 'Sane.' Run from dysfunctional Family Members as fast as you Can. And most certainly, run from so called 'friends' who are not going anywhere but down the drain. This was a great movie full of wisdom. Margot did a 'great job.' A must see for those who want to learn a life lesson from someone who suffered from poor associations.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Even the worst deserve better,"Let's dive right into it: the acting was not good. The script did this movie no favors but there's really no excuse. If you're a good actor you shouldn't have to convince me you're a bad person by cursing every other word and if you're a good person by not cursing at all. Life is more complicated than that and, frankly, the people in this movie deserved better. In this day and age if you need to curse that much in a movie you're script either isn't very good and/or your characters are one dimensional. The language and behavior of all the characters make it really hard to care about these very real people. I would never watch this again and if I was any of the people portrayed in this movie I'd distance myself from it.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

It wasn't as bad as my rating,The acting in the film is quite good. I would give that part an 8. The down side is the movies massive attempt at painting Tonya Harding in a good light. I still feel she was a great part of her own demise.,5.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Astonishing Story Expertly Told,"I had no knowledge at all of Tonya Harding. No idea about the incident, her career, what happened to her etc, and boy is it a gripping story. I was hooked. What a tragic and bizarre story and series of events. If, like me, you have no knowledge of Tonya I'd encourage you to just dive right in without any prior research to keep you on your toes.The way that the story was told was very clever. It presented the events, interspersed with fictionalised interviews and fourth wall breaks. What the film really does well is to cast ambiguity over everything. Tonya is the definition of an unreliable narrator, and throughout the film you will find yourself reaching for that bag of salt on many occasions. You're never 100% sure if what happened is over exaggerated in Tonya's head or whether its a complete fabrication, which makes for a compelling experience. I'd describe the story as rather Shakespearean, in that its ultimately a tragedy but with many elements of farce and black comedy.Margot Robbie was phenomenal as Tonya and may well have won the Oscar had she not been up against an incredibly strong field. There was so much depth to her performance, expertly presenting the varying layers of Tonya's personality and character. Her and Sebastian had such great chemistry (or lack of it I suppose), and the way that the two of them were able to recreate their complex and toxic relationship was incredible. Allison Janney put in a transformative performance as Tonya's hardened mother, and was a scene stealer whenever she was on screen.The soundtrack was crafted with great care and used to great effect throughout the film, which didn't go unnoticed. I just loved the atmosphere that it created.This was just such a great film. Cast, story, direction, script, soundtrack all on point. One of the best biopics I've seen in recent times!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very Strong And Eeerie Serious Drama,"Labeled as a mockumentary, I Tonya is in my opnion a very deep, very serious, very touchy biopic, with very clever plot twists, fourth wall breakage, excellent cast, amazing soundtrack and terrific Margot Robbie as Tonya Harding. She alone makes this anyway awesome movie even more awesome, and she deserves all th accolades and awards she has already won or was nominated for. Margot proves she can execute a very serious, sensible, psychological role and can do with certain gusto, valor, passion and thrust. The plot sheds light on to her quite dramatic and often traumatized life story, her strained family relations, her gaines and losses. 
I need not say more - I do recommend this movie very urgently to be watched as a prime example of excellent biopic.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Surprisingly a ton of fun,"Not sure why, but I went into this expecting a boring movie. What I got was a thoroughly entertaining and hilarious film. Everything falls into place so nicely, and from the script to the editing, it's clear they cared about the story they were telling. Good job, I, Tonya.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"'I, Tonya' more than movie","Great movie, based on real story about Tonya Harding(Margot Robbie), who was figure skater, she completed the triple axel (1991) and became the first American woman to perform it at an international event. She was the best and she knew that, wanted to prove this to others. Margot perfectly acted(Nominated on Oscars and Golden Globes for Best Performance by an Actress) and showed us about Tonya's unfair life.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
not what i was expecting.,"I was hesitant to see this film because i wasn't interested in seeing a film where they make excuse for the horrific act on nancy Kerrigan. thankfully, this wasn't that. it was a dark comedy about dysfunctional relationships and how, sometimes, we can use that to be better people. it sure helped tonya harding to be a better skater. everyone raves about alison janney but i don't see enough credit given to margot robbie for having to do an emotional role, as well as a physical one. it's very refreshing to find out she did most of the skating. I also was surprised they were able to make Margot look as young as she was. she did a great job playing a naive innocent girl/women kinda trapped in her own life. I would recommend this film for good fun, which i know sounds odd, but at one point i laughed so hard i spit out my drink. the movie and plot i give a 7, and i add a point for the cast.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Toyna is always trash,"Tonya is always trash for a reason. But why own anything in this new age? Everyone is a victim afterall. Why own up to violence when it happened to you? Why do you think this movie protrayed her as the victim? I cant even kill weeds this generation without people saying i am a villian. So theres your logic. Only in this generation. Tonya if your reading this i am glad you are banned, imagine other outcomes. Still justifying your truth at your age. I am ashamed hollywood picked this up.you are trash and always will be. It didnt have to do with money it was your arrogance and candor. You recked a beautiful sport.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Abused victim or awful trash? I still don't know,"Excellent acting from all concerned. My quibbles would be the blatant bias on favour of Tonya and the slightly comedy style, does that suit the violence and abuse?Still the idiocy of those involved and the tragic inevitability of events are well portrayed.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"I, Oscar","Wow! this film is a must watch. clever direction enthrals the audience (with ""Tonya/Margot addressing the viewers at certain points throughout). a stand out performance in Robbie's career thus far that propels her from good to phenomenal. i cant find a bad thing to say. 10 stars",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
This is a great movie,"I watched this last night and loved it. The cinematography was very interesting, and overall it was well directed. The acting was fantastic, and the story and characters were very well thought out.I thought the film hit some very important points, how the media frenzy storm blew things way out of proportion (as it always does) and forces ideas into the public conscious to cause division, and ultimately gain more ratings and followers. The movie seemed to be far better researched than any of the stories published during the incident.Every story has it's own side/own truth, and the life of Tonya is taken into context. It still leaves the viewer with speculation, but it does tell a side that we've never seen/heard before, which is important.Now I'm interested to hear the Nancy Kerrigan story...",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Too much swearing, use of F word all through","Sad story of a talented woman coming from an abusive background, was interesting to follow, but too much swearing and use of F word all through so because of that I did not derive much entertainment from this movie. This would have been a much better movie if that is skipped, even without that, it is easy to see where this woman came from.Other than that, there is some good acting and great skating learnt by the main actor. The outcome is sad, too sad to think that a talented great skater was lost to the world because of wrong company and it appears that no support given to help her lead a better life.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
What a great movie and history,I will recommend everyone to spend time on this film. The recording and setup is perfect with the actors.,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
a decent one,"Not a big fan of Margot's acting here, it felt forced and unrealistic to me rather than authentic and raw. Maybe her acting is not the problem, it might be the casting choice as well. I saw her in so many different projects that I wasn't convinced enough that she was Tonya. A fresh new face could do better at impersonating Harding, I guess. Other than that, Sebastian Stan did a pretty amazing job for me. 'Til some point I didn't even realize the actor for the role of Jeff was him, I have to admit. No questioning for Allison Janney's work, of course. Overall, it was a pretty fun piece to watch on a saturday night.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wow,"I had low expectations, but man this was good. I have always been neutral to the controversy, but I think I am team Tonya now. Allison Janney deserved that Oscar. It was a little hard to believe Margot Robbie ass Tonya, though.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
